      <title>Thrombogenic Risk Assessment of Transcatheter Prosthetic Heart Valves Using a Fluid-Structure Interaction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prosthetic heart valve interventions such as TAVR have surged over the past decade, but the associated complication of long-term, life-threatening thrombotic events continues to undermine patient outcomes. Thus, improving thrombogenic risk analysis of TAVR devices is crucial. In vitro studies for thrombogenicity are typically difficult to perform. However, revised ISO testing standards include computational testing for thrombogenic risk assessment of cardiovascular implants. We present a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) approach for assessing thrombogenic risk of prosthetic heart valves.
  An FSI framework was implemented via the incompressible computational fluid dynamics multi-physics solver of the Ansys LS-DYNA software. The numerical modeling approach for flow analysis was validated by comparing the derived flow rate of the 29-mm CoreValve device from benchtop testing and orifice areas of commercial TAVR valves in the literature to in silico results. Thrombogenic risk was analyzed by computing stress accumulation (SA) on virtual platelets seeded in the flow fields via Ansys EnSight. The integrated FSI-thrombogenicity methodology was subsequently employed to examine hemodynamics and thrombogenic risk of TAVR devices with two approaches: 1) engineering optimization and 2) clinical assessment.
  Our methodology can be used to improve the thromboresistance of prosthetic valves from the initial design stage to the clinic. It allows for unparalleled optimization of devices, uncovering key TAVR leaflet design parameters that can be used to mitigate thrombogenic risk, in addition to patient-specific modeling to evaluate device performance. This work demonstrates the utility of advanced in silico analysis of TAVR devices that can be utilized for thrombogenic risk assessment of other blood recirculating devices.</description>

      <title>Systematic equation formulation for simulation of power electronic circuits using explicit methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Use of explicit integration methods for power electronic circuits with ideal switch models significantly improves simulation speed. The PLECS package [1] has effectively used this idea; however, the implementation details involved in PLECS are not available in the public domain. Recently, a basic framework, called the ``ELEX" scheme, for implementing explicit methods has been described [2]. A few modifications of the ELEX scheme for efficient handling of inductors and switches have been presented in [3]. In this paper, the approach presented in [3] is further augmented with robust schemes that enable systematic equation formulation for circuits involving switches, inductors, and transformers. Several examples are presented to illustrate the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Aggregation-Disaggregation Pipelines for Smart Charging of Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the global energy landscape shifts towards renewable energy and the electrification of the transport and heating sectors, national energy systems will include more controllable prosumers. Many future scenarios contain millions of such prosumers with individualistic behavior. This poses a problem for energy system modelers. Memory and runtime limitations often make it impossible to model each prosumer individually. In these cases, it is necessary to model the prosumers with representatives or in aggregated form. Existing literature offers various aggregation methods, each with strengths, drawbacks, and an inherent modeling error. It is difficult to evaluate which of these methods perform best. Each paper presenting a new aggregation method usually includes a performance evaluation. However, what is missing is a direct comparison on the same benchmark, preferably by a neutral third party that is not associated with any of the compared methods. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a benchmark to evaluate the end-to-end performance of multiple aggregation-disaggregation pipelines, specifically focusing on electric vehicles (EVs). Our study assesses the performance of the common representative profile (REP) approach, four different versions of the virtual battery (VB) approach, the Flex Object (FO) method, and the Dependency-based FlexOffer (DFO) method. The results show that each method has a clear use case. Depending on the price signal, additional median charging costs of 2%-50% are incurred using an aggregation method, compared to the optimal charging costs (i.e., the charging costs resulting from optimizing the EVs directly, without aggregation). The representative profile approach results in the lowest additional costs (2%-20%), while the FO and DFO methods allow for error-free disaggregation, which is advantageous in real-world use cases.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Free Jacobian Chaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient computation of Jacobians represents a fundamental challenge in computational science and engineering. Large-scale modular numerical simulation programs can be regarded as sequences of evaluations of in our case differentiable subprograms with corresponding elemental Jacobians. The latter are typically not available. Tangent and adjoint versions of the individual subprograms are assumed to be given as results of algorithmic differentiation instead. The classical (Jacobian) Matrix Chain Product problem is reformulated in terms of matrix-free Jacobian-matrix (tangents) and matrix-Jacobian products (adjoints), subject to limited memory for storing information required by latter. All numerical results can be reproduced using an open-source reference implementation.</description>

      <title>Financial Assets Dependency Prediction Utilizing Spatiotemporal Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial assets exhibit complex dependency structures, which are crucial for investors to create diversified portfolios to mitigate risk in volatile financial markets. To explore the financial asset dependencies dynamics, we propose a novel approach that models the dependencies of assets as an Asset Dependency Matrix (ADM) and treats the ADM sequences as image sequences. This allows us to leverage deep learning-based video prediction methods to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies among assets. However, unlike images where neighboring pixels exhibit explicit spatiotemporal dependencies due to the natural continuity of object movements, assets in ADM do not have a natural order. This poses challenges to organizing the relational assets to reveal better the spatiotemporal dependencies among neighboring assets for ADM forecasting. To tackle the challenges, we propose the Asset Dependency Neural Network (ADNN), which employs the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, a highly successful method for video prediction. ADNN can employ static and dynamic transformation functions to optimize the representations of the ADM. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms the baselines in the ADM prediction and downstream application tasks. This research contributes to understanding and predicting asset dependencies, offering valuable insights for financial market participants.</description>

      <title>Bridging Design Gaps: A Parametric Data Completion Approach With Graph Guided Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a generative imputation model leveraging graph attention networks and tabular diffusion models for completing missing parametric data in engineering designs. This model functions as an AI design co-pilot, providing multiple design options for incomplete designs, which we demonstrate using the bicycle design CAD dataset. Through comparative evaluations, we demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing classical methods, such as MissForest, hotDeck, PPCA, and tabular generative method TabCSDI in both the accuracy and diversity of imputation options. Generative modeling also enables a broader exploration of design possibilities, thereby enhancing design decision-making by allowing engineers to explore a variety of design completions. The graph model combines GNNs with the structural information contained in assembly graphs, enabling the model to understand and predict the complex interdependencies between different design parameters. The graph model helps accurately capture and impute complex parametric interdependencies from an assembly graph, which is key for design problems. By learning from an existing dataset of designs, the imputation capability allows the model to act as an intelligent assistant that autocompletes CAD designs based on user-defined partial parametric design, effectively bridging the gap between ideation and realization. The proposed work provides a pathway to not only facilitate informed design decisions but also promote creative exploration in design.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Learn Macroeconomic Narratives from Social Media?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study empirically tests the $\textit{Narrative Economics}$ hypothesis, which posits that narratives (ideas that are spread virally and affect public beliefs) can influence economic fluctuations. We introduce two curated datasets containing posts from X (formerly Twitter) which capture economy-related narratives (Data will be shared upon paper acceptance). Employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, we extract and summarize narratives from the tweets. We test their predictive power for $\textit{macroeconomic}$ forecasting by incorporating the tweets' or the extracted narratives' representations in downstream financial prediction tasks. Our work highlights the challenges in improving macroeconomic models with narrative data, paving the way for the research community to realistically address this important challenge. From a scientific perspective, our investigation offers valuable insights and NLP tools for narrative extraction and summarization using Large Language Models (LLMs), contributing to future research on the role of narratives in economics.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Primitive Conservative Solver for the Euler Equations with Arbitrary Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a procedure to solve the Euler equations by explicitly updating, in a conservative manner, a generic thermodynamic variable such as temperature, pressure or entropy instead of the total energy. The presented procedure is valid for any equation of state and spatial discretization. When using complex equations of state such as Span-Wagner, choosing the temperature as the generic thermodynamic variable yields great reductions in the computational costs associated to thermodynamic evaluations. Results computed with a state of the art thermodynamic model are presented, and computational times are analyzed. Particular attention is dedicated to the conservation of total energy, the propagation speed of shock waves and jump conditions. The procedure is thoroughly tested using the Span-Wagner equation of state through the CoolProp thermodynamic library and the Van der Waals equation of state, both in the ideal and non-ideal compressible fluid-dynamics regimes, by comparing it to the standard total energy update and analytical solutions where available.</description>
