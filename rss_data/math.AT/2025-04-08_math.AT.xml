      <title>Polynomial functors from free groups to a stable infinity-category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the category of polynomial functors from finitely generated free groups to a stable infinity-category D. We show that this category is equivalent to the category of excisive functors from pointed animas to D, and also to truncated right comodules over the commutative operad with values in D. The latter formulation generalizes a result of Geoffrey Powell in characteristic zero.
  We use the equivalence of categories to calculate Ext between polynomial functors from free groups to abelian groups, extending previous results of Christine Vespa and others. Using the work of Aurelien Djament, we give applications to stable cohomology of automorphism groups of free groups with coefficients in a polynomial functor.</description>

      <title>Calculating Higher Digraph Homotopy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the first tractable and systematic examples of nontrivial higher digraph homotopy groups. To do this we define relative digraph homotopy groups and show these satisfy a long exact sequence analogous to the relative homotopy groups of spaces. We then define digraph suspension and Hurewicz homomorphisms and show they commute with each other. The existence of nontrivial digraph homotopy groups then reduces to the existence of corresponding groups in the degree 1 path homology of digraphs.</description>

      <title>Permutohedral complex and complements of diagonal subspace arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the complement of a diagonal subspace arrangement is homotopy equivalent to a cellular subcomplex $\mathrm{Perm}(K)$ in the permutohedron. The product in the cohomology ring of a diagonal arrangement complement is described via the cellular approximation of the diagonal map in the permutohedron constructed by Saneblidze and Umble. We consider the projection from the permutohedron to the cube and prove that the Saneblidze--Umble diagonal maps to the diagonal constructed by Cai for the description of the product in the cohomology of a real moment-angle complex.</description>

      <title>On the cosine similarity and orthogonality between persistence diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological data analysis is an approach to study shape of a data set by means of topology. Its main object of study is the persistence diagram, which represents the topological features of the data set at different spatial resolutions. Multiple data sets can be compared by the similarity of their diagrams to understand their behaviors in relative to each other. The bottleneck and Wasserstein distances are often used as a tool to indicate the similarity. In this paper, we introduce cosine similarity as a new indicator for the similarity between persistence diagrams and investigate its properties. Furthermore, it leads to the new notion of orthogonality between persistence diagrams. It turns out that the orthogonality refers to perfect dissimilarity between persistence diagrams under the cosine similarity. Through data demonstration, the cosine similarity is shown to be more accurate than the standard distances to measure the similarity between persistence diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we will compute some Gromoll filtration groups $\Gamma^{n+1}_{i+1}$ for certain $i$ when $8\leq n \leq 17$ and $n=4k+2\geq 18$. We will also use these results to obtain some information of $\pi_1\mathrm{Diff}_{\partial} (D^n)$ when $6\leq n \leq 15$ and $\pi_2 \mathrm{Diff}_{\partial} (D^{4k+3})$ when $4k+3\geq 15$.</description>

      <title>MaxTDA: Robust Statistical Inference for Maximal Persistence in Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology is an area within topological data analysis (TDA) that can uncover different dimensional holes (connected components, loops, voids, etc.) in data. The holes are characterized, in part, by how long they persist across different scales. Noisy data can result in many additional holes that are not true topological signal. Various robust TDA techniques have been proposed to reduce the number of noisy holes, however, these robust methods have a tendency to also reduce the topological signal. This work introduces Maximal TDA (MaxTDA), a statistical framework addressing a limitation in TDA wherein robust inference techniques systematically underestimate the persistence of significant homological features. MaxTDA combines kernel density estimation with level-set thresholding via rejection sampling to generate consistent estimators for the maximal persistence features that minimizes bias while maintaining robustness to noise and outliers. We establish the consistency of the sampling procedure and the stability of the maximal persistence estimator. The framework also enables statistical inference on topological features through rejection bands, constructed from quantiles that bound the estimator's deviation probability. MaxTDA is particularly valuable in applications where precise quantification of statistically significant topological features is essential for revealing underlying structural properties in complex datasets. Numerical simulations across varied datasets, including an example from exoplanet astronomy, highlight the effectiveness of MaxTDA in recovering true topological signals.</description>

      <title>Persistent Sullivan Minimal Models of Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend classical tools from rational homotopy theory to topological data analysis by introducing persistent Sullivan minimal models of persistent topological spaces. Our main result establishes that the interleaving distance between such models in the homotopy category of CDGAs is stable with respect to the homotopy interleaving distance of the underlying spaces. For Vietoris-Rips filtrations of metric spaces, this yields new persistent invariants that are more discriminative than persistent homology. We further show that these models provide sharper lower bounds for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance than those obtained from persistent homology or persistent rational homotopy groups.</description>

      <title>KSp-characteristic classes determine Spin$^h$ cobordism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classic result of Anderson, Brown, and Peterson states that the cobordism spectrum MSpin (respectively, MSpin$^c$) splits as a sum of Eilenberg--Mac Lane spectra and connective covers of real K-theory (respectively, complex K-theory) at 2. We develop a theory of symplectic K-theory classes and use these to build an explicit splitting for MSpin$^h$ in terms of Eilenberg--Mac Lane spectra and spectra related to symplectic K-theory. This allows us to determine the Spin$^h$ cobordism groups systematically. We also prove that two Spin$^h$-manifolds are cobordant if and only if their underlying unoriented manifolds are cobordant and their KSp-characteristic numbers agree.</description>

      <title>An analogue of the Milnor conjecture for the de Rham-Witt complex in characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the modulo $2$ de Rham-Witt complex of a field of characteristic $2$, in terms of the powers of the augmentation ideal of the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-geometric fixed points of real topological restriction homology TRR. This is analogous to the conjecture of Milnor, proved by Kato for fields of characteristic $2$, which describes the modulo $2$ Milnor K-theory in terms of the powers of the augmentation ideal of the Witt group of symmetric forms. Our proof provides a somewhat explicit description of these objects, as well as a calculation of the homotopy groups of the geometric fixed points of TRR and of real topological cyclic homology, for all fields.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Homotopy Theory via Simplicial Coalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a commutative ring $R$, a $\pi_1$-$R$-equivalence is a continuous map of spaces inducing an isomorphism on fundamental groups and an $R$-homology equivalence between universal covers. When $R$ is an algebraically closed field, Raptis and Rivera described a full and faithful model for the homotopy theory of spaces up to $\pi_1$-$R$-equivalence by means of simplicial coalgebras considered up to a notion of weak equivalence created by a localized version of the Cobar functor. In this article, we prove a $G$-equivariant analog of this statement using a generalization of a celebrated theorem of Elmendorf. We also prove a more general result about modeling $G$-simplicial sets considered under a linearized version of quasi-categorical equivalence in terms of simplicial coalgebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.12338v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kontsevich conjectured that $\text{BDiff}(M, \text{rel }\partial)$ has the homotopy type of a finite CW complex for all compact $3$-manifolds with non-empty boundary. Hatcher-McCullough proved this conjecture when $M$ is irreducible. We prove a homological version of Kontsevich's conjecture. More precisely, we show that $\text{BDiff}(M, \text{rel }\partial)$ has finitely many nonzero homology groups, each finitely generated, when $M$ is a connected sum of irreducible $3$-manifolds that each have a nontrivial and non-spherical boundary.</description>

      <title>Perfect Matching Complexes of Polygonal Line Tilings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perfect matching complex of a simple graph $G$ is a simplicial complex having facets (maximal faces) as the perfect matchings of $G$. This article discusses the perfect matching complex of polygonal line tilings and the $\left(2 \times n\right)$-grid graph in particular. We use tools from discrete Morse theory to show that the perfect matching complex of any polygonal line tiling is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. While proving our results, we also characterize all the matchings of $\left(2 \times n\right)$-grid graph that cannot be extended to form a perfect matching.</description>
