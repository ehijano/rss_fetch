      <title>Engineering interaction potentials for stabilizing quantum quasicrystal phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the necessary features of the pair interaction for the stabilization of self-assembled quantum quasicrystals in two-dimensional bosonic systems. Unlike the classical scenario, our results show that two-dimensional octagonal, decagonal, and dodecagonal aperiodic phases require a distinct number of properly tuned characteristic length scales for their stabilization. By using a mean field spectral variational approach and Gross-Pitaevskii numerical calculations, we determine that the dodecagonal quasicrystal structure requires at least two characteristic length scales for its stabilization, while the decagonal and octagonal patterns need at least three and four length scales, respectively. The family of pair interaction potentials considered, albeit simple, is well justified in terms of a novel experimental platform based on laser-painted interactions in a cavity QED setup. Finally, we perform a structural characterization of the quasicrystal patterns obtained and show that these phases coexist with a finite superfluid fraction, forming what can be called a super quasicrystal phase.</description>

      <title>Structural, electronic, vibrational, optical, piezoelectric, thermal and thermoelectric properties of double perovskite BCZT from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double perovskite material such as BCZT (Ba$_{0.875}$Ca$_{0.125}$(Zr$_{0.125}$Ti$_{0.875}$)O$_{3}$) is well known for its high value of piezoceramic properties and Curie temperature which has potential applications in sensors, actuators, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. Based on its composition and physical parameters such as pressure and temperature, experimentally, BCZT shows different crystal structures (rhombohedral, tetragonal and orthorhombic) with multiferroic properties. Here, we have designed these materials by comparing experimental stoichiometry and evaluated their stability by calculating the tolerance factor, formation energy, and cohesive energy. The structural, electronic and vibrational properties of BCZT are explored using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the framework of density functional theory. We have also shown variation of piezoelectric and optical properties through multiple phases using time dependent density functional theory. The electronic band gap, optical response in the visible light range, as well as piezoelectric, electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric properties, demonstrate excellent characteristics, making this material a promising lead-free ferroelectric candidate for various energy harvesting applications. Boltzmann transport theory is used for the calculation of Seebeck coefficient, electron thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity to estimate the power factor and figure of merit which represents the efficiency of the material. The high values at the Fermi level suggest that these materials are well-suited for future device applications.</description>

      <title>Perfectly harmonic spin cycloid and multi-$Q$ textures in the Weyl semimetal GdAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question concerns how topological electronic states are influenced by many-body correlations, and magnetic Weyl semimetals represent an important material platform to address this problem. However, the magnetic structures realized in these materials are limited, and in particular, no clear example of an undistorted helimagnetic state has been definitively identified. Here, we report clear evidence of a harmonic helimagnetic cycloid with an incommensurate magnetic propagation vector in the Weyl semimetal GdAlSi via resonant elastic X-ray scattering, including rigorous polarization analysis. This cycloidal structure is consistent with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction prescribed by the polar crystal structure of GdAlSi. Upon applying a magnetic field, the cycloid undergoes a transition to a novel multi-$Q$ state. This field-induced, noncoplanar texture is consistent with our numerical spin model, which incorporates the DM interaction and, crucially, anisotropic exchange. The perfectly harmonic Weyl helimagnet GdAlSi serves as a prototypical platform to study electronic correlation effects in periodically modulated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Self-aligned pillar arrays embedding site-controlled single quantum dots for enhanced non-classical light emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a foundational approach for fabricating arrays of self-aligned micro- and nanopillar structures incorporating individual site-controlled quantum dots (QDs) for enhanced light extraction. This method leverages the non-planar surface morphology of pyramidal QD samples to define dielectric masks self - aligned to the QD positions. The mask size, and consequently the lateral dimensions of the pillars, is precisely controlled through a chemical mechanical polishing step, obviating the need for any additional lithography step for creating the pillar. This fabrication technique offers several key advantages, including precise control over the pillar sites, and fully deterministic embedding of QD structures. The functionality of the structures was validated by integrating single In0.25Ga0.75As QDs - upon two-photon excitation of the biexciton state, the emission of single and polarization-entangled photon pairs was observed. Additionally, an extra fabrication step to deposit dome-like structures atop the pillars was demonstrated, effectively enhancing light extraction efficiency up to 12%.</description>

      <title>Interplay between evanescent scattering modes and finite dispersion in superconducting junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting junctions are essential building blocks for quantum hardware, and their fundamental behaviour remains a highly active research field. The behaviour of generic junctions is conveniently described by Beenakker's determinant formula, linking the subgap energy spectrum to the scattering matrix characterising the junction. In particular, the gap closing between bound and continuum states in short junctions follows from unitarity of the scattering matrix, and thus, from probability conservation. In this work, we critically reassess two assumptions: that scattering in short junctions is approximately energy-independent and dominated by planar channels. We argue that strongly energy-dependant scattering follows from finite dispersion of the conductor electrons even when they spend little time within the scattering region, and show that evanescent modes play a central role when cross-channel scattering is important. By generalising Beenakker's equation and performing a mapping to an effective Hamiltonian, we show that the gap closing is linked to a chiral symmetry. While finite energy dependence in the scattering breaks the chiral symmetry, we show two distinct mechanisms preserving the gap closing, each connected to new types of constraints on energy-dependant scattering matrices beyond unitarity. If the dispersive mode is planar, the gap closing is still preserved through a time-dependant probability conservation analysis of the scattering process. If the dispersive channel is evanescent, we derive a constraint which, notably, cannot follow from probability conservation. We thus demonstrate that Andreev physics reveal a much wider variety of properties of normal-metal scattering than commonly expected. We expect that our findings will have an impact on the dissipative behaviour of driven junctions, and offer a new perspective on fundamental properties of scattering matrices.</description>

      <title>Geometric contribution to adiabatic amplification in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concepts from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics have proven useful in understanding and manipulating a variety of classical systems, such as those encountered in optics, classical mechanics, and metamaterial design. Recently, the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry phase for adiabatic processes was experimentally measured. In non-Hermitian systems, the Berry phase can have an imaginary part, which contributes to the amplification or decay of the total wave intensity. When the imaginary part of the Berry curvature is zero, this geometric amplification factor is determined solely by the initial and final points of the adiabatic path in parameter space, and it does not depend on how these points are connected by the path. We list classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians where this path independence is guaranteed by suitable symmetries, and we find that, for some of these classes, the amplification factor can be written only in terms of the Petermann factors of the initial and final points. Our result can, in turn, be used to experimentally obtain the Petermann factor by observing how the norm of the wave function changes under adiabatic processes. We validate our theory using a couple of concrete examples of physical relevance.</description>
