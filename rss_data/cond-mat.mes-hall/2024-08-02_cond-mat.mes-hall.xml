      <title>Information Scrambling at Quantum Hall Interfaces and Their Analog to Black Hole Event Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole information paradox has been hotly debated for the last few decades without a full resolution. This makes it desirable to find analogues of this paradox in simple and experimentally accessible systems, whose resolutions may shed light on this longstanding and fundamental problem. Here, we review and resolve the apparent "information paradox" in two different interfaces separating Abelian and non-Abelian quantum Hall states. In both cases, the information carried by the pseudospin degree of freedom of the Abelian anyons get scrambled when they cross the interface and enter the non-Abelian quantum Hall liquid. Nevertheless, it is found that the scrambling mechanism depends on the nature of the interface. The corresponding analogues of different concepts in black hole physics such as event horizon, black hole interior, Hawking radiation, and Page curve will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Assisted Auger Decay of Excitons in Doped Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition between the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes determines the optical quantum yield and plays a crucial role in the potential optoelectronic applications of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC). Here, we show that, in the presence of free carriers, an additional nonradiative decay channel opens for excitons in TMDC monolayers. Although the usual Auger decay channel is suppressed at low doping levels by the simultaneous momentum and energy conservation laws, exciton-phonon coupling relaxes this suppression. By solving a Bethe-Salpeter Equation, we calculate the phonon-assisted Auger decay rates in four typical TMDCs as a function of doping, temperature, and dielectric environment. We find that even for a relatively low doping of 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, the nonradiative lifetime ranges from 16 ps to 165 ps in different TMDCs, offering competition to the radiative decay channel.</description>

      <title>Observation of current whirlpools in graphene at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-electron interactions in high-mobility conductors can give rise to transport signatures resembling those described by classical hydrodynamics. Using a nanoscale scanning magnetometer, we imaged a distinctive hydrodynamic transport pattern - stationary current vortices - in a monolayer graphene device at room temperature. By measuring devices with increasing characteristic size, we observed the disappearance of the current vortex and thus verify a prediction of the hydrodynamic model. We further observed that vortex flow is present for both hole- and electron-dominated transport regimes, while disappearing in the ambipolar regime. We attribute this effect to a reduction of the vorticity diffusion length near charge neutrality. Our work showcases the power of local imaging techniques for unveiling exotic mesoscopic transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Singlet-Triplet Kondo Effect in Blatter Radical Molecular Junctions: Zero-bias Anomalies and Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Blatter radical has been suggested as a building block in future molecular spintronic devices due to its radical character and expected long-spin lifetime. However, whether and how the radical character manifests itself in the charge transport and magnetotransport properties seems to depend on the environment or has not yet been studied. Here, we investigate single-molecule junctions of the Blatter radical molecule in a mechanically controlled break junction device at low temperature. Differential conductance spectroscopy on individual junctions shows two types of zero-bias anomalies attributed to Kondo resonances revealing the ability to retain the open-shell nature of the radical molecule in a two-terminal device. Additionally, a high negative magnetoresistance is also observed in junctions without showing a zero-bias peak. We posit that the high negative magnetoresistance is due to the effect of a singlet-triplet Kondo effect under magnetic field originating from a double-quantum-dot system consisting of a Blatter radical molecule with a strong correlation to a second side-coupled molecule. Our findings not only provide the possibility of using the Blatter radical in a two-terminal system under cryogenic conditions but also reveal the magnetotransport properties emerging from different configurations of the molecule inside a junction.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Brownian Ratchets for Directed Transport of Analytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled long-range transport of micro- and nano-scale objects is a key requirement in lab-on-a-chip and microfluidic applications, enabling the efficient capture, concentration, manipulation, and detection of analytes. Traditional methods such as microfluidic pumps and optical trapping face challenges including high power consumption and limited range of action. This study introduces a plasmonic Brownian ratchet designed for the directed transport of dielectric nanometer-sized particles at low optical powers. Through numerical simulations, the ratchet geometry was optimized to enhance electric fields, optical forces, and trapping potentials. Experimentally, the plasmonic ratchet demonstrated the ability to rectify random thermal motion of 40 nm polysterene spheres over extended distances in a specific direction, achieving velocities up to 2.4 $\mu$m/s at excitation powers as low as 0.785 kW/cm^2. This plasmonic ratchet offers a robust and efficient solution for the targeted delivery and concentration of nanoscale analytes on chips, with significant implications for advancing applications in the life sciences.</description>

      <title>Quantized electrical, thermal, and spin transports of non-Hermitian clean and dirty two-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From lattice-regularized models, devoid of any non-Hermitian (NH) skin effects, here we compute the electrical ($\sigma_{xy}$), thermal ($\kappa_{xy}$), and spin ($\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$) Hall, and the electrical ($G_{xx}$) and thermal ($G^{th}_{xx}$) longitudinal conductivities for appropriate NH planar topological insulators and superconductors related to all five non-trivial Altland-Zirbauer symmetry classes in the Hermitian limits. These models feature real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, only where the associated topological invariants remain quantized. In this regime, the NH quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators show quantized $\sigma_{xy}$ and $G_{xx}$, respectively, the NH $p+ip$ ($p \pm ip$) pairing shows half-quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ ($G^{th}_{xx}$), while the NH $d+id$ pairing shows quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ and $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ in the clean and weak disorder (due to random pointlike charge impurities) regimes. We compute these quantities in experimentally realizable suitable six-terminal setups using the Kwant software package. But, in the strong disorder regime, all these topological responses vanish and with the increasing non-Hermiticity in the system this generic phenomenon occurs at weaker disorder.</description>

      <title>Weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Supertopology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal symmetries can enforce all bands of a material to be topological, a property that is commonly referred to as "supertopology". Here, we determine the symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies of non-magnetic centrosymmetric materials with weak and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). For weak (i.e., negligible) SOC, crystal symmetries can enforce Dirac nodal lines protected by a $\pi$-Berry phase, while for strong SOC, crystal symmetries can give rise to nontrival weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologies in 2D subplanes of the 3D Brillouin zone. We catalogue all centrosymmetric space groups whose symmetries enforce these $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies. Suitable material realizations are identified and experimental signatures of the supertopologies, such as quantum spin Hall states, are being discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report systematic first-principles investigation of light-induced mechanical deformations in monodomain (PbTiO$_{3}$)$_{n}$/(SrTiO$_{3}$)$_{n}$ superlattices ($n=1-5$). We reveal that photostriction in these heterostructures quantitatively and qualitatively depends on the chemical period $n$. Specifically, we show that by changing the chemical period, we can induce $\textit {positive}$ or $\textit {negative}$ photostriction. We also present a simple analytical model to account for the calculated deformations. Our findings indicate that superlattices architectures may be key to design novel optomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond switching of strong light-matter interactions in microcavities with two-dimensional semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast all-optical logic devices based on nonlinear light-matter interactions hold the promise to overcome the speed limitations of conventional electronic devices. Strong coupling of excitons and photons inside an optical resonator enhances such interactions and generates new polariton states which give access to unique nonlinear phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, used for all-optical ultrafast polariton transistors. However, the pulse energies required to pump such devices range from tens to hundreds of pJ, making them not competitive with electronic transistors. Here we introduce a new paradigm for all-optical switching based on the ultrafast transition from the strong to the weak coupling regime in microcavities embedding atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides. Employing single and double stacks of hBN-encapsulated MoS$_2$ homobilayers with high optical nonlinearities and fast exciton relaxation times, we observe a collapse of the 55-meV polariton gap and its revival in less than one picosecond, lowering the threshold for optical switching below 4 pJ per pulse, while retaining ultrahigh switching frequencies. As an additional degree of freedom, the switching can be triggered pumping either the intra- or the interlayer excitons of the bilayers at different wavelengths, speeding up the polariton dynamics, owing to unique interspecies excitonic interactions. Our approach will enable the development of compact ultrafast all-optical logical circuits and neural networks, showcasing a new platform for polaritonic information processing based on manipulating the light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong Terahertz Coupling in a van der Waals Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of strongly coupled photon-matter systems aims to create novel hybrid phases that enhance or modify material properties. A key challenge has been developing versatile platforms for exploring cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) of quantum materials. Here, we demonstrate and probe ultrastrong light-matter coupling in atomically-thin van der Waals materials. We developed a broadband time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated, two-dimensional quantum materials with sub-wavelength photon confinement at terahertz frequencies. Using bilayer graphene as a model system, we perform spectroscopic studies across a wide range of frequencies and gate voltages. For the first time, we measure the field-tunable band gap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while simultaneously observing clear signatures of ultrastrong coupling, with interaction strengths exceeding $\Omega/\omega\approx 40\%$. Our work bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental implementation of cavity QED in van der Waals materials, paving the way for further studies of exotic phases and novel light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a metallic room-temperature d-wave altermagnet KV2Se2O</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, altermagnetism is a recently discovered unconventional magnetic phase characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split band structures in materials with zero net magnetization. This distinct magnetic phase not only enriches the understanding of fundamental physical concepts but also has profound impacts on condense-matter physics research and practical device applications. Spin-polarized band structures have been recently observed in semiconductors MnTe and MnTe2 with vanishing net magnetization, confirming the existence of this unconventional magnetic order. Metallic altermagnets have unique advantages for exploring novel physical phenomena related to low-energy quasiparticle excitations and for applications in spintronics as electrical conductivity in metals allows the direct manipulation of spin current through electric field. Here, through comprehensive characterization and analysis of the magnetic and electronic structures of KV2Se2O, we have unambiguously demonstrated a metallic room-temperature altermaget with d-wave spin-momentum locking. The highly anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and the spin-density-wave order emerging in the altermagnetic phase make it an extraordinary platform for designing high-performance spintronic devices and studying many-body effects coupled with the unconventional magnetism.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic Microstructure Created from Invariant Line Constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroic materials enable a multitude of emerging applications, and optimum functional properties are achieved when ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties are coupled to a first-order ferroelastic transition. In bulk materials, this first-order transition involves an invariant habit plane, connecting coexisting phases: austenite and martensite. Theory predicts that this plane should converge to a line in thin films, but experimental evidence is missing. Here, we analyze the martensitic and magnetic microstructure of a freestanding epitaxial magnetic shape memory film. We show that the martensite microstructure is determined by an invariant line constraint using lattice parameters of both phases as the only input. This line constraint explains most of the observable features, which differ fundamentally from bulk and constrained films. Furthermore, this finite-size effect creates a remarkable checkerboard magnetic domain pattern through multiferroic coupling. Our findings highlight the decisive role of finite-size effects in multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Sliding Flexoelectricity in Two-Dimensional van der Waals Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional sliding ferroelectrics, with their unique stacking degrees of freedom, offer a different approach to manipulate polarization by interlayer sliding. Bending sliding ferroelectrics inevitably leads to interlayer sliding motion, thus altering stacking orders and polarization properties. Here, by using machine-learning force field, we investigate the effects of bending deformation on geometries, stackings, energies, and polarizations in sliding ferroelectric bilayer h-BN and 3R-MoS2. We predict that bent ferroelectric bilayer forms irreversible kinks instead of arc when the bending angle exceeds a critical value. We demonstrate that the kinks originate from the competition between bending energy and interlayer van der Waals energy. The kink contains a ferroelectric domain wall that reverses the polarization, effectively inducing a flexoelectric effect. We term this phenomenon "sliding flexoelectricity" to distinguish it from conventional strain-gradient-induced flexoelectricity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-state transitions of a single Cu-phthalocyanine molecule adsorbed on an insulating layer of NaCl on Cu(111) are probed by means of alternate charging scanning tunneling microscopy. Real-space imaging of the electronic transitions reveals the Jahn--Teller distortion occurring upon formation of the first and second anionic charge states. The experimental findings are rationalized by a theoretical many-body model which highlights the crucial role played by the substrate. The latter enhances and stabilizes the intrinsic Jahn--Teller distortion of the negatively charged molecule hosting a degenerate pair of single-particle frontier orbitals. Consequently, two excess electrons are found to occupy, in the ground state, the same localized orbital, despite a larger Coulomb repulsion than the one for the competing delocalized electronic configuration. Control over the charging sequence by varying the applied bias voltage is also predicted.</description>

      <title>Droplet-confined electroplating for nanoscale additive manufacturing: current control of the initial stages of the growth of copper nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplet-confined electrodeposition enables a precise deposition of three dimensional, nanoscopic and high purity metal structures. It aspires to fabricate intricate microelectronic devices, metamaterials, plasmonic structures and functionalized surfaces. Yet, a major handicap of droplet-confined electrodeposition is the current lack of control over the process, which is owed to its dynamic nature and the nanoscopic size of the involved droplets. The deposition current offers itself as an obvious and real-time window into the deposition. Therefore, the current during droplet-confined deposition is analysed. Nucleation and growth dynamics are evaluated systematically. Our results indicate different deposition regimes and link current to both volume and morphology of deposited copper. This allows for optimized electroplating strategies and to calibrate the slicing algorithms necessary for a controlled deposition of 3D structures. The potential of selecting appropriate solvents further readies this novel technique for the reliable deposition of functional structures with submicron resolution.</description>

      <title>Fractional AC Josephson effect in a topological insulator proximitized by a self-formed superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A lateral Josephson junction in which the surface of a 3D topological insulator serves as the weak link should support topologically protected excitations related to Majorana fermions. The resulting $4\pi$-periodic current-phase relationship could be detected under high-frequency excitation by the suppression of odd Shapiro steps. Here, we demonstrate such devices through the self-formation of a Pd-Te superconducting layer from a telluride topological insulator, and observe suppressed first and third Shapiro steps. Other devices, including those where the Pd-Te layer is bolstered by an additional Al layer, show no suppression of Shapiro steps, a difference supported by simulations. Though we rule out the known trivial causes of suppressed Shapiro steps in our devices, we nevertheless argue that corroborating measurements and disorder-aware theoretical descriptions of these systems are needed before confidently claiming the observation of Majorana states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on experimental observation of next-nearest-neighbour coupling between ballistically expanding spinor exciton-polariton condensates in a planar semiconductor microcavity. All-optical control over the coupling strength between neighbouring condensates is demonstrated through distance-periodic pseudospin screening of their ballistic particle outflow due to the inherent splitting of the planar cavity transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes. By screening the nearest-neighbour coupling we overcome the conventional spatial coupling hierarchy between condensates. This offers a promising route towards creating unconventional non-planar many-body Hamiltonians using networks of ballistically expanding spinor exciton-polariton condensates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The insensitivity of photons towards external magnetic fields forms one of the hardest barriers against efficient magneto-optical control, aiming at modulating the polarization state of light. However, there is even scarcer evidence of magneto-optical effects that can spatially modulate light. Here, we demonstrate the latter by exploiting strongly coupled states of semimagnetic matter and light in planar semiconductor microcavities. We nonresonantly excite two spatially adjacent exciton-polariton condensates which, through inherent ballistic near field coupling mechanism, spontaneously synchronise into a dissipative quantum fluidic supermode of definite parity. Applying a magnetic field along the optical axis, we continuously adjust the light-matter composition of the condensate exciton-polaritons, inducing a supermode switch into a higher order mode of opposite parity. Our findings set the ground towards magnetic spatial modulation of nonlinear light.</description>

      <title>Interplay of valley, layer and band topology towards interacting quantum phases in moir\'e bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BBG), the Landau levels give rise to an intimate connection between valley and layer degrees of freedom. Adding a moir\'e superlattice potential enriches the BBG physics with the formation of topological minibands - potentially leading to tunable exotic quantum transport. Here, we present magnetotransport measurements of a high-quality bilayer graphene-hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructure. The zero-degree alignment generates a strong moir\'e superlattice potential for the electrons in BBG and the resulting Landau fan diagram of longitudinal and Hall resistance displays a Hofstadter butterfly pattern with a high level of detail. We demonstrate that the intricate relationship between valley and layer degrees of freedom controls the topology of moir\'e-induced bands, significantly influencing the energetics of interacting quantum phases in the BBG superlattice. We further observe signatures of field-induced correlated insulators, helical edge states and clear quantizations of interaction-driven topological quantum phases, such as symmetry broken Chern insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum have recently been utilized in photonic crystal gratings to achieve strong coupling and ultralow power-driven condensation of bosonic exciton-polariton quasiparticles with atypical Dirac-like features in their dispersion relation. Here, we develop the single- and many-body theory of these new effective relativistic exciton-polaritons modes and describe their mean field condensation dynamics facilitated by the interplay between protection from the radiative continuum and negative-mass pump induced optical trapping. Our theory accounts for many tunable grating parameters giving full control over the diffractive coupling properties between guided polaritons and the radiative continuum previously unexplored in the context of driven condensation. In particular, we discover stable cyclical condensate solutions mimicking a driven-dissipative analog of the zitterbewegung effect characterized by coherent superposition of both ballistic (rapid phase front) and trapped (slow phase front) polariton waves. Finally, important distinctions are drawn between the concepts of near field and far field in the photonic grating, clarifying recent experimental observations on the emission characteristics of these long lived nonlinear Dirac polaritons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the experimentally relevant situation, where a non-equilibrium state is created at the edge of a quantum Hall system by injecting charge current into a chiral edge state with the help of a quantum point contact, quantum dots, or mesoscopic Ohmic contact. We show that the commonly accepted picture of the full equilibration of a non-equilibrium state at finite distances longer than a characteristic length scale contradicts to the charge conservation requirement. We use a phenomenological transmission line model to account for the local equilibration process and the charge and energy conserving dynamics of the collective mode. By solving this model in the limit of long distances $L$ from the injection point, we demonstrate that the correction of the electron distribution function to its eventual equilibrium form scales down slowly as $1/\sqrt{L}$.</description>

      <title>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy for Molecules: Manipulating Electron Transport through the Conduction Gap by varying Buffer Layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In scanning tunneling microscopy of molecules, an insulating buffer layer is often introduced to reduce interactions between adsorbed molecules and the substrate. Focusing on tunneling through the molecule's electronic transport gap, we demonstrate that the buffer itself strongly influences the wave function of the tunneling electron at the molecule. This is exemplified for an adsorbed platinum phthalocyanine molecule by varying the composition and thickness of the buffer. We find that, in particular, the buffer's lattice parameter is crucial. By expanding the wave function of the tunneling electron in molecular orbitals (MOs), we illustrate how one can strongly vary the relative weights of different MOs, such as the highest occupied MO versus some low-lying MOs with few nodal surfaces. The set of MOs with significant weight are important for processes used to manipulate the state of the molecule by a tunneling electron, such as molecular luminescence. The choice of buffer therefore provides an important tool for manipulating these processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1806.03061v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: InBi(001) is formed epitaxially on InAs(111)-A by depositing Bi on to an In-rich surface. Angle-resolved photoemission measurements reveal topological electronic surface states, close to the M bar high symmetry point. This demonstrates a heteroepitaxial system entirely in the III-V family with topological electronic properties. InBi shows coexistence of Bi and In surface terminations, in contradiction with other III-V materials. For the Bi termination, the study gives a consistent physical picture of the topological surface electronic structure of InBi(001) terminated by a Bi bilayer rather than a surface formed by splitting to a Bi monolayer termination. Theoretical calculations based on relativistic density functional theory and the one-step model of photoemission clarify the relationship between the InBi(001) surface termination and the topological surface states, supporting a predominant role of the Bi bilayer termination. Furthermore, a tight-binding model based on this Bi bilayer termination with only Bi-Bi hopping terms, and no Bi-In interaction, gives a deeper insight into the spin texture.</description>

Abstract: Topological bound states in the continuum are confined wave-mechanical objects that offer advantageous ways to enhance light-matter interactions in compact photonic devices. In particular, their large quality factor in the strong-coupling regime has recently enabled the demonstration of Bose-Einstein condensation of bound-state-in-the-continuum polaritons. Here, we show that condensation into a negative-mass bound state in the continuum exhibits interaction-induced state confinement, opening opportunities for optically reprogrammable molecular arrays of quantum fluids of light. We exploit this optical trapping mechanism to demonstrate that such molecular complexes show hybridization with macroscopic modes with unusual topological charge multiplicity. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our technique by constructing extended mono- and diatomic chains of bound-state-in-the-continuum polariton fluids that display non-Hermitian band formation and the opening of a minigap. Our findings offer insights into large-scale, reprogrammable, driven, dissipative many-body systems in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Surface transfer doping of hydrogen-terminated diamond probed by shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surface conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond is a topic of great interest from both scientific and technological perspectives. This is primarily due to the fact that the conductivity is exceptionally high without the need for substitutional doping, thus enabling a wide range of electronic applications. Although the conductivity is commonly explained by surface transfer doping due to air-borne surface acceptors, there remains uncertainty regarding the main determining factors that govern the degree of band bending and hole density, which are crucial for the design of electronic devices. Here, we elucidate the dominant factor influencing band bending by creating shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers beneath the hydrogen-terminated diamond surface through nitrogen ion implantation at varying fluences. We measured the photoluminescence and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of the NV centers, as well as the surface conductivity, as a function of the nitrogen implantation fluence. The disappearance of the conductivity with increasing nitrogen implantation fluence coincides with the appearance of photoluminescence and ODMR signals from negatively charged NV centers. This finding indicates that band bending is not exclusively determined by the work-function difference between diamond and the surface acceptor material, but by the finite density of surface acceptors. This work emphasizes the importance of distinguishing work-function-difference-limited band bending and surface-acceptor-density-limited band bending when modeling the surface transfer doping, and provides useful insights for the development of devices based on hydrogen-terminated diamond.</description>

Abstract: We present a cavity-electromechanical system comprising a superconducting quantum interference device which is embedded in a microwave resonator and coupled via a pick-up loop to a 6 $\mu$g magnetically-levitated superconducting sphere. The motion of the sphere in the magnetic trap induces a frequency shift in the SQUID-cavity system. We use microwave spectroscopy to characterize the system, and we demonstrate that the electromechanical interaction is tunable. The measured displacement sensitivity of $10^{-7} \, \mathrm{m} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, defines a path towards ground-state cooling of levitated particles with Planck-scale masses at millikelvin environment temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of dynamical screening of interactions on the transition temperatures ($T_c$) of exciton condensation in a symmetric bilayer of quadratically dispersing electrons and holes by solving the linearized Eliashberg equations for the anomalous interlayer Green's functions. We find that $T_c$ is finite for the range of density and layer separations studied, decaying exponentially with interlayer separation. $T_c$ is suppressed well below that predicted by a Hartree Fock mean field theory with unscreened Coulomb interaction, but is above the estimates from the statically screened Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, using a diagrammatic framework, we show that the system is always an exciton condensate at zero temperature but $T_c$ is exponentially small for large interlayer separation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the frictional force arising from quantum fluctuations when two dissipative metallic plates are set in a shear motion. While early studies showed that the electromagnetic fields in the quantum friction setup reach nonequilibrium steady states, yielding a time-independent force, other works have demonstrated the failure to attain steady states, leading to instability and time-varying friction under sufficiently low-loss conditions. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory without perturbative approximations and unveil the transition from stable to unstable regimes of the quantum friction setup. Due to the relative motion of the plates, their electromagnetic response may be active in some conditions, resulting in optical gain. We prove that the standard fluctuation-dissipation leads to inconsistent results when applied to our system, and, in particular, it predicts a vanishing frictional force. Using a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation tailored for gain media, we calculate the frictional force in terms of the system Green's function, thereby recovering early works on quantum friction. Remarkably, we also find that the frictional force diverges to infinity as the relative velocity of the plates approaches a threshold. This threshold is determined by the damping strength and the distance between the metal surfaces. Beyond this critical velocity, the system exhibits instability, akin to the behaviour of a laser cavity, where no steady state exists. In such a scenario, the frictional force escalates exponentially. Our findings pave the way for experimental exploration of the frictional force in proximity to this critical regime.</description>

Abstract: Optical bistability and oscillating phases exist in a Sagnac interferometer and a single ring resonator made of $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear medium where the refractive indices are modulated by the light intensity due to the Kerr nonlinearity. An array of coupled nonlinear ring resonators behave similarly but with more complexity due to the presence of the additional couplings. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the bifurcation of edge modes which leads to optical bistability in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with the Kerr nonlinearity. Additionally, we demonstrate periodic and chaotic switching behaviors in an oscillating phase resulting from the coupling between the edge mode and bulk modes with different chiralities, i.e., clockwise and counter-clockwise circulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentiable models of physical systems provide a powerful platform for gradient-based algorithms, with particular impact on parameter estimation and optimal control. Quantum systems present a particular challenge for such characterisation and control, owing to their inherently stochastic nature and sensitivity to environmental parameters. To address this challenge, we present a versatile differentiable quantum master equation solver, and incorporate this solver into a framework for device characterisation. Our approach utilises gradient-based optimisation and Bayesian inference to provide estimates and uncertainties in quantum device parameters. To showcase our approach, we consider steady state charge transport through electrostatically defined quantum dots. Using simulated data, we demonstrate efficient estimation of parameters for a single quantum dot, and model selection as well as the capability of our solver to compute time evolution for a double quantum dot system. Our differentiable solver stands to widen the impact of physics-aware machine learning algorithms on quantum devices for characterisation and control.</description>

Abstract: In the Letter, Xu et al. reported that edge modes disappear in the expanded structure of Wu-Hu model characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index, while appear in the trivial shrunken structure, when the edge cuts through the hexagonal unit cell. They then concluded that these edge modes are defect modes lacking topological protection. Unfortunately, their approach is not justified, rendering the conclusion unsolid.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a compelling platform for analog quantum simulation due to the precision control, fast operation, and site-resolved readout inherent to the hardware. Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits natively emulate the dynamics of interacting particles according to the Bose-Hubbard model. However, many interesting condensed-matter phenomena emerge only in the presence of electromagnetic fields. Here, we emulate the dynamics of charged particles in an electromagnetic field using a superconducting quantum simulator. We realize a broadly adjustable synthetic magnetic vector potential by applying continuous modulation tones to all qubits. We verify that the synthetic vector potential obeys requisite properties of electromagnetism: a spatially-varying vector potential breaks time-reversal symmetry and generates a gauge-invariant synthetic magnetic field, and a temporally-varying vector potential produces a synthetic electric field. We demonstrate that the Hall effect--the transverse deflection of a charged particle propagating in an electromagnetic field--exists in the presence of the synthetic electromagnetic field.</description>
