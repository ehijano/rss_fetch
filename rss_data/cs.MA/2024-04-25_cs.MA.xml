      <title>IryoNLP at MEDIQA-CORR 2024: Tackling the Medical Error Detection &amp; Correction Task On the Shoulders of Medical Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In natural language processing applied to the clinical domain, utilizing large language models has emerged as a promising avenue for error detection and correction on clinical notes, a knowledge-intensive task for which annotated data is scarce. This paper presents MedReAct'N'MedReFlex, which leverages a suite of four LLM-based medical agents. The MedReAct agent initiates the process by observing, analyzing, and taking action, generating trajectories to guide the search to target a potential error in the clinical notes. Subsequently, the MedEval agent employs five evaluators to assess the targeted error and the proposed correction. In cases where MedReAct's actions prove insufficient, the MedReFlex agent intervenes, engaging in reflective analysis and proposing alternative strategies. Finally, the MedFinalParser agent formats the final output, preserving the original style while ensuring the integrity of the error correction process. One core component of our method is our RAG pipeline based on our ClinicalCorp corpora. Among other well-known sources containing clinical guidelines and information, we preprocess and release the open-source MedWiki dataset for clinical RAG application. Our results demonstrate the central role of our RAG approach with ClinicalCorp leveraged through the MedReAct'N'MedReFlex framework. It achieved the ninth rank on the MEDIQA-CORR 2024 final leaderboard.</description>

      <title>BattleAgent: Multi-modal Dynamic Emulation on Historical Battles to Complement Historical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents BattleAgent, an emulation system that combines the Large Vision-Language Model and Multi-agent System. This novel system aims to simulate complex dynamic interactions among multiple agents, as well as between agents and their environments, over a period of time. It emulates both the decision-making processes of leaders and the viewpoints of ordinary participants, such as soldiers. The emulation showcases the current capabilities of agents, featuring fine-grained multi-modal interactions between agents and landscapes. It develops customizable agent structures to meet specific situational requirements, for example, a variety of battle-related activities like scouting and trench digging. These components collaborate to recreate historical events in a lively and comprehensive manner while offering insights into the thoughts and feelings of individuals from diverse viewpoints. The technological foundations of BattleAgent establish detailed and immersive settings for historical battles, enabling individual agents to partake in, observe, and dynamically respond to evolving battle scenarios. This methodology holds the potential to substantially deepen our understanding of historical events, particularly through individual accounts. Such initiatives can also aid historical research, as conventional historical narratives often lack documentation and prioritize the perspectives of decision-makers, thereby overlooking the experiences of ordinary individuals. BattelAgent illustrates AI's potential to revitalize the human aspect in crucial social events, thereby fostering a more nuanced collective understanding and driving the progressive development of human society.</description>

      <title>GRSN: Gated Recurrent Spiking Neurons for POMDPs and MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are widely applied in various fields due to their energy-efficient and fast-inference capabilities. Applying SNNs to reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly reduce the computational resource requirements for agents and improve the algorithm's performance under resource-constrained conditions. However, in current spiking reinforcement learning (SRL) algorithms, the simulation results of multiple time steps can only correspond to a single-step decision in RL. This is quite different from the real temporal dynamics in the brain and also fails to fully exploit the capacity of SNNs to process temporal data. In order to address this temporal mismatch issue and further take advantage of the inherent temporal dynamics of spiking neurons, we propose a novel temporal alignment paradigm (TAP) that leverages the single-step update of spiking neurons to accumulate historical state information in RL and introduces gated units to enhance the memory capacity of spiking neurons. Experimental results show that our method can solve partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and multi-agent cooperation problems with similar performance as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but with about 50% power consumption.</description>

      <title>EdgeVision: Towards Collaborative Video Analytics on Distributed Edges for Performance Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based video analytics significantly improves recognition accuracy in computer vision applications. Deploying DNN models at edge nodes, closer to end users, reduces inference delay and minimizes bandwidth costs. However, these resource-constrained edge nodes may experience substantial delays under heavy workloads, leading to imbalanced workload distribution. While previous efforts focused on optimizing hierarchical device-edge-cloud architectures or centralized clusters for video analytics, we propose addressing these challenges through collaborative distributed and autonomous edge nodes. Despite the intricate control involved, we introduce EdgeVision, a Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)- based framework for collaborative video analytics on distributed edges. EdgeVision enables edge nodes to autonomously learn policies for video preprocessing, model selection, and request dispatching. Our approach utilizes an actor-critic-based MARL algorithm enhanced with an attention mechanism to learn optimal policies. To validate EdgeVision, we construct a multi-edge testbed and conduct experiments with real-world datasets. Results demonstrate a performance enhancement of 33.6% to 86.4% compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Selectively Sharing Experiences Improves Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-agent RL approach, Selective Multi-Agent Prioritized Experience Relay, in which agents share with other agents a limited number of transitions they observe during training. The intuition behind this is that even a small number of relevant experiences from other agents could help each agent learn. Unlike many other multi-agent RL algorithms, this approach allows for largely decentralized training, requiring only a limited communication channel between agents. We show that our approach outperforms baseline no-sharing decentralized training and state-of-the art multi-agent RL algorithms. Further, sharing only a small number of highly relevant experiences outperforms sharing all experiences between agents, and the performance uplift from selective experience sharing is robust across a range of hyperparameters and DQN variants. A reference implementation of our algorithm is available at https://github.com/mgerstgrasser/super.</description>

      <title>Distributed online constrained convex optimization with event-triggered communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the distributed online convex optimization problem with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents, where each agent collaborates with its neighboring agents to minimize the cumulative network-wide loss over time. To reduce communication overhead between the agents, we propose a distributed event-triggered online primal-dual algorithm over a time-varying directed graph. With several classes of appropriately chose decreasing parameter sequences and non-increasing event-triggered threshold sequences, we establish dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation bounds. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Model for Multi-Agent Autonomy That Uses Opinion Dynamics and Multi-Objective Behavior Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports a new hierarchical architecture for modeling autonomous multi-robot systems (MRSs): a non-linear dynamical opinion process is used to model high-level group choice, and multi-objective behavior optimization is used to model individual decisions. Using previously reported theoretical results, we show it is possible to design the behavior of the MRS by the selection of a relatively small set of parameters. The resulting behavior - both collective actions and individual actions - can be understood intuitively. The approach is entirely decentralized and the communication cost scales by the number of group options, not agents. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach using a hypothetical `explore-exploit-migrate' scenario in a two hour field demonstration with eight unmanned surface vessels (USVs). The results from our preliminary field experiment show the collective behavior is robust even with time-varying network topology and agent dropouts.</description>

      <title>NoiseNCA: Noisy Seed Improves Spatio-Temporal Continuity of Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.</description>
