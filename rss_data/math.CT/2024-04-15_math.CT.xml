      <title>Costability of Comodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a ring $R$, we have a classical result stating that the ordinary category of modules is the abelianization of the category of $R$-algebras. Analogously, using the framework of infinity categories and higher algebra, Francis showed that the infinity category of $R$-modules is the {\em stabilization} of the infinity category of $R$-algebras. In this work we show a dual result for coalgebras over a cooperad $Q$: namely that given a coalgebra $C$, comodules over $C$ are the costabilization of coalgebras over $C$, which is the universal stable category with a finite colimit preserving functor to coalgebras over $C$.</description>

      <title>Towards a General Theory of Dependent Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce dependent adders. A dependent adder $A$ has for every $x \in A$ a way of adding together $x$ many elements of $A$. We provide examples from many disparate branches of mathematics. Examples include the field with one element $\mathbb{F}_1$, the real numbers with integrals as sums, the category of categories with oplax colimits as sums. We also consider modules over dependent adders and provide examples.</description>

      <title>The local-to-global principle via topological properties of the Balmer-Favi support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the theory of stratification of tensor triangulated categories via Balmer-Favi support inaugurated by Barthel, Heard and Sanders, we prove the local versions of the well-known statements that the Balmer spectrum being noetherian or profinite scattered implies the local-to-global principle.
  That is, given an object $t$ of a tensor triangulated category $\mathcal{T}$ we show that if the Balmer-Favi support $\text{Supp}(t)$ is a noetherian space, then the local-to-global principle holds for $t$. In the case where the Balmer spectrum $\text{Spc}(\mathcal{T}^c)$ is profinite, if the support $\text{Supp}(t)$ is scattered then the local-to-global principle holds for the object $t$.
  We conclude with an application of the last result to the examination of the support of injective superdecomposable modules in the derived category of an absolutely flat ring which is not semi-artinian.</description>

      <title>A Topologically Enriched Probability Monad on the Cartesian Closed Category of CGWH Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probability monads on categories of topological spaces are classical objects of study in the categorical approach to probability theory. We construct a probability monad on the category of compactly generated weakly Hausdorff (CGWH) spaces, a (if not the) standard choice of convenient category of topological spaces. Because a novel version of the Riesz representation theorem plays a fundamental role in our construction, we name it the Riesz probability monad. We show that the Riesz probability monad is a simultaneous extension of the classical Radon and Giry monads that is topologically enriched. Topological enrichment corresponds to a strengthened continuous mapping theorem (in the sense of probability theory). In addition, restricting the Riesz probability monad to the cartesian closed subcategory of weakly Hausdorff quotients of countably based (QCB) spaces results in a probability monad which is strongly affine, ensuring that the notions of independence and determinism interact as we would expect.</description>

      <title>ViCAR: Visualizing Categories with Automated Rewriting in Coq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ViCAR, a library for working with monoidal categories in the Coq proof assistant. ViCAR provides definitions for categorical structures that users can instantiate with their own verification projects. Upon verifying relevant coherence conditions, ViCAR gives a set of lemmas and tactics for manipulating categorical structures. We also provide a visualizer that can display any composition and tensor product of morphisms as a string diagram, showing its categorical structure. This enables graphical reasoning and automated rewriting for Coq projects with monoidal structures.</description>

      <title>Composing Codensity Bisimulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proving compositionality of behavioral equivalence on state-based systems with respect to algebraic operations is a classical and widely studied problem. We study a categorical formulation of this problem, where operations on state-based systems modeled as coalgebras can be elegantly captured through distributive laws between functors. To prove compositionality, it then suffices to show that this distributive law lifts from sets to relations, giving an explanation of how behavioral equivalence on smaller systems can be combined to obtain behavioral equivalence on the composed system.
  In this paper, we refine this approach by focusing on so-called codensity lifting of functors, which gives a very generic presentation of various notions of (bi)similarity as well as quantitative notions such as behavioral metrics on probabilistic systems. The key idea is to use codensity liftings both at the level of algebras and coalgebras, using a new generalization of the codensity lifting. The problem of lifting distributive laws then reduces to the abstract problem of constructing distributive laws between codensity liftings, for which we propose a simplified sufficient condition. Our sufficient condition instantiates to concrete proof methods for compositionality of algebraic operations on various types of state-based systems. We instantiate our results to prove compositionality of qualitative and quantitative properties of deterministic automata. We also explore the limits of our approach by including an example of probabilistic systems, where it is unclear whether the sufficient condition holds, and instead we use our setting to give a direct proof of compositionality. ...</description>

      <title>Quantifier alternation depth in universal Boolean doctrines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a quantifier-stratified universal Boolean doctrine. This notion requires additional structure on a universal Boolean doctrine, accounting for the quantifier alternation depth of formulas. After proving that every Boolean doctrine over a small base category admits a quantifier completion, we show how to freely add the first layer of quantifier alternation depth to these doctrines. To achieve this, we characterize, within the doctrinal setting, the classes of quantifier-free formulas whose universal closure is valid in some common model.</description>

      <title>Classification of Boolean Algebras through von Neumann regular $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}-$Rings</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of a "von Neumann regular $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-ring", which is a model for a specific equational theory. We delve into the characteristics of these rings and demonstrate that each Boolean space can be effectively represented as the image of a von Neumann regular $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-ring through a specific functor. Additionally, we establish that every homomorphism between Boolean algebras can be expressed through a $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-ring homomorphism between von Neumann regular $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$-rings.</description>

Abstract:   In cryptography, encryption is the process of obscuring information to make it unreadable without special knowledge. This is usually done for secrecy, and typically for confidential communications. Encryption can also be used for authentication, digital signatures, digital cash e.t.c. In this paper we are going to examine and analyse all these topics in detail.</description>

      <title>The Reduced Tensor Product of Braided Tensor Categories Containing a Symmetric Fusion Category</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.13562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We detail a construction of a symmetric monoidal structure, called the reduced tensor product on the 2-category of braided tensor categories $\mathbf{BTC}(\mathcal{A})$ containing a fixed symmetric fusion subcategory $\mathcal{A}$. The construction only depends on the braiding and monoidal structure of the categories involved. The main tool in the construction is an enriching procedure that is shown to give an equivalence between $\mathbf{BTC}(\mathcal{A})$ and a 2-category of so-called Drinfeld centre crossed braided tensor categories. As an application of the reduced tensor product, we show that it gives a pairing between minimal modular extensions of braided tensor categories containing $\mathcal{A}$ as their transparent subcategory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-valued coalgebraic logics with semi-primal algebras of truth-degrees. We provide a systematic way to lift endofunctors defined on the variety of Boolean algebras to endofunctors on the variety generated by a semi-primal algebra. We show that this can be extended to a technique to lift classical coalgebraic logics to many-valued ones, and that (one-step) completeness and expressivity are preserved under this lifting. For specific classes of endofunctors, we also describe how to obtain an axiomatization of the lifted many-valued logic directly from an axiomatization of the original classical one. In particular, we apply all of these techniques to classical modal logic.</description>

      <title>A General Probabilistic Framework in IMALL: A Concrete Categorical Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the linear lambda-calculus extended with the sup type constructor, which provides an additive conjunction along with a non-deterministic destructor. The sup type constructor has been introduced in the context of quantum computing. In this paper, we study this type constructor within a simple linear logic categorical model, employing the category of semimodules over a commutative semiring. We demonstrate that the non-deterministic destructor, either weighted or not, finds a suitable model in a weighted codiagonal map. Our approach offers a valid and insightful alternative to interpreting non-determinism and probability calculi, in instances where the conventional Moggi's Powerset Monad interpretation does not align with the category's structure, as is the case with the category of semimodules. The validity of this alternative relies on the presence of biproducts within the category.</description>

      <title>Interval Decomposition of Persistence Modules over a Principal Ideal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of persistent homology has contributed new insights and perspectives into a variety of interesting problems in science and engineering. Work in this domain relies on the result that any finitely-indexed persistence module of finite-dimensional vector spaces admits an interval decomposition -- that is, a decomposition as a direct sum of simpler components called interval modules. This result fails if we replace vector spaces with modules over more general coefficient rings.
  We introduce an algorithm to determine whether a persistence module of pointwise free and finitely-generated modules over a principal ideal domain (PID) splits as a direct sum of interval submodules. If one exists, our algorithm outputs an interval decomposition. Our algorithm is finite (respectively, polynomial) time if the problem of computing Smith normal form over the chosen PID is finite (respectively, polynomial) time. This is the first algorithm with these properties of which we are aware.
  We also show that a persistence module of pointwise free and finitely-generated modules over a PID splits as a direct sum of interval submodules if and only if the cokernel of every structure map is free. This result underpins the formulation our algorithm. It also complements prior findings by Obayashi and Yoshiwaki regarding persistent homology, including a criterion for field independence and an algorithm to decompose persistence homology modules of simplex-wise filtrations.</description>

      <title>Resolutions as directed colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general principle suggests that "anything flat is a directed colimit of countably presentable flats". In this paper, we consider resolutions and coresolutions of modules over a countably coherent ring $R$ (e.g., any coherent ring or any countably Noetherian ring). We show that any $R$-module of flat dimension $n$ is a directed colimit of countably presentable $R$-modules of flat dimension at most $n$, and any flatly coresolved $R$-module is a directed colimit of countably presentable flatly coresolved $R$-modules. If $R$ is a countably coherent ring with a dualizing complex, then any F-totally acyclic complex of flat $R$-modules is a directed colimit of F-totally acyclic complexes of countably presentable flat $R$-modules. The proofs are applications of an even more general category-theoretic principle going back to an unpublished 1977 preprint of Ulmer. Our proof of the assertion that every Gorenstein-flat module over a countably coherent ring is a directed colimit of countably presentable Gorenstein-flat modules uses a different technique, based on results of Saroch and Stovicek. We also discuss totally acyclic complexes of injectives and Gorenstein-injective modules, obtaining various cardinality estimates for the accessibility rank under various assumptions.</description>

Abstract:   There have been many theories about the paradoxes of numbers, but this is far and away more paradoxical than most. In this paper we will present the Zoli Numbers which have some innovative characteristics. The basic concept of these numbers is that they don't follow strictly any Mathematical rule. They are called Zoli from the names of Zotos and Litke. We are going to see some examples with the Zoli Programming Language and reveal the connection with other mathematical topics.</description>
