      <title>Resurrecting the coherent state variational algorithm for large $N$ gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The feasibility of studying, numerically, properties of infinite volume QCD-like theories in the large $N$ limit using coherent state variational methods is reassessed. An entirely new implementation of this approach is described, applicable to SU($N$) lattice gauge theories, with or without fundamental representation fermions, on cubic lattices of up to four dimensions. In addition to various test cases, initial results are presented for Hamiltonian Yang-Mills theory on an infinite two-dimensional spatial lattice.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of the 't Hooft partition function and (de)confining phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 't Hooft partition function $Z_{\mathrm{tH}}[E_i;B_{ij}]$ is a discrete Fourier transform of Yang--Mills partition functions in background $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 2-form gauge fields and encodes information on confinement, Higgs, Coulomb and oblique-confining phases. We report a direct Monte Carlo strategy to measure $Z_{\mathrm{tH}}$ without reweighting, by extending hybrid Monte Carlo to include dynamical updates of the background flux variables. As a first application we measure all flux sectors of four-dimensional $SU(2)$ lattice Yang--Mills on $T^4$ and observe the characteristic ``light/heavy'' behavior expected in the confining phase, together with the shift implied by the Witten effect at $\theta=2\pi$. We also present a preliminary finite-temperature study and discuss outstanding issues on thermalization and separability between different flux sectors.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Consistency as a Reliability Test for Complex Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex Langevin method (CLM) is a promising tool to address the sign problem in quantum field theories with complex actions. However, it can converge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable, highlighting the need for robust diagnostics. Existing checks, such as monitoring drift distributions, are useful but indirect. We propose a complementary test based on the configurational temperature, constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based criteria, this estimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and provides a physically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. Using one-dimensional PT-symmetric models, we show that it reproduces the input temperature with high precision and sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and incomplete thermalization. While demonstrated in simple systems, the method extends naturally to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories. Since temperature is tied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring can also provide an independent check on coupling-dependent observables. Our results indicate that configurational temperature can enhance CLM reliability across a broad range of applications, including lattice QCD at finite density.</description>

      <title>Tensor renormalization group study of cold and dense QCD in the strong coupling limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase structure of the (3+1)-dimensional cold and dense QCD with the Kogut--Susskind quark in the strong coupling limit using the tensor renormalization group method. The chiral and nuclear transitions are investigated by calculating the chiral condensate and the quark number density as a function of the chemical potential. For a fixed temporal extent $N_\tau=8$, we determine the critical quark masses $m_c^{\chi}$ and $m_c^{n}$ for the chiral condensate and the quark number density, respectively, at which the first-order phase transition terminates with the vanishing discontinuity in thermodynamic quantities. We find that both quantities at the same quark mass exhibit a discontinuity at the same chemical potential, and the resulting critical quark masses are consistent with each other. We also compare our results for the critical quark masses with those obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation in the dual formulation and from the mean-field analysis. We further confirm the first-order phase transition at finite quark mass on a $1024^4$ lattice, which is essentially in the thermodynamic limit at zero temperature, as expected from the mean-field analysis.</description>

      <title>A scalable flow-based approach to mitigate topological freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As lattice gauge theories with non-trivial topological features are driven towards the continuum limit, standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations suffer for topological freezing, i.e., a dramatic growth of autocorrelations in topological observables. A widely used strategy is the adoption of Open Boundary Conditions (OBC), which restores ergodic sampling of topology but at the price of breaking translation invariance and introducing unphysical boundary artifacts. In this contribution we summarize a scalable, exact flow-based strategy to remove them by transporting configurations from a prior with a OBC defect to a fully periodic ensemble, and apply it to 4d SU(3) Yang--Mills theory. The method is based on a Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) that alternates non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates with localized, gauge-equivariant defect coupling layers implemented via masked parametric stout smearing. Training is performed by minimizing the average dissipated work, equivalent to a Kullback--Leibler divergence between forward and reverse non-equilibrium path measures, to achieve more reversible trajectories and improved efficiency. We discuss the scaling with the number of degrees of freedom affected by the defect and show that defect SNFs achieve better performances than purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods at comparable cost. Finally, we validate the approach by reproducing reference results for the topological susceptibility.</description>

      <title>High-precision ground state parameters of the two-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several ground state properties of the square-lattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet are computed (the energy, order parameter, spin stiffness, spinwave velocity, long-wavelength susceptibility, and staggered susceptibility) using extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the stochastic series expansion method. Moderately sized lattices are studied at temperatures $T$ sufficiently low to realize the $T \to 0$ limit. Results for periodic $L\times L$ lattices with $L \in [6,96]$ are tabulated versus $L$ and extrapolations to infinite system size are carried out. The extrapolated ground state energy density is $e_0=-0.669441857(7)$, which represents an improvement in precision of three orders of magnitude over the previously best result. The leading and subleading finite-size corrections to $e_0$ are in full quantitative agreement with predictions from chiral perturbation theory, thus further supporting the soundness of both the extrapolations and the theory. The extrapolated sublattice magnetization is $m_s=0.307447(2)$, which agrees well with previous estimates but with a much smaller statistical error. The coefficient of the linear in $L^{-1}$ correction to $m^2_s$ agrees with the value from chiral perturbation theory and the presence of a factor $\ln^\gamma(L)$ in the second-order correction is also confirmed, with the previously not known value of the exponent being $\gamma = 0.82(4)$. The finite-size corrections to the staggered susceptibility point to logarithmic corrections also in this quantity. To facilitate benchmarking of methods for which periodic boundary conditions are challenging, results for systems with open and cylindrical boundaries are also listed and their spatially inhomogeneous order parameters are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Localization-delocalization transition at weak coupling in two-color matrix QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the matrix model of two-color one-flavor adjoint QCD (matrix-QCD$_{2,1}^{\text{adj}}$) in the weak coupling regime (small $g$) and in the chiral limit. The Yang-Mills potential has two distinct gauge invariant minima: one at $A_i=0$ and the other at $A_i = \frac{\sigma_i}{2g}$. We show that when the chiral chemical potential $c \leq \frac{3}{2}$, there is a quantum phase transition at $g_0^\ast \simeq 0.143$: for $g&lt;g_0^\ast$, the ground state wavefunction is localized near $A_i=0$, while for $g&gt;g_0^\ast$, the ground state is delocalized over the gauge configuration space. The transition between these two phases is singular, with the ground state at $g_0^\ast$ being distinctly different from that of $g_0^\ast \pm|\epsilon|$. At $g_0^\ast$, we show that the square of the chromoelectric field vanishes, strongly suggesting that the system is in a ``dual superconductor" phase. Numerical evidence shows that the localization-delocalization phenomenon holds for the 1st and 2nd excited states as well, leading us to conjecture that there are an infinite number of isolated singular points $g_0^\ast&gt; g_1^\ast&gt;g_2^\ast&gt; \cdots$ accumulating to $g=0$. For $c=1$, the model formally possesses $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. We show that in the localized phase (i.e. for $g&lt;g_0^\ast$) the supermultiplet structure is disrupted and SUSY is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Holographic Aspects of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is one of the most standard theoretical frameworks for addressing strongly correlated electron systems. Meanwhile, the concept of holography, developed in the field of quantum gravity, provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum many-body systems and space-time geometry. In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely related to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT, particularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a holographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the outer edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its fixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's function in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's function and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge of the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's function. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard model, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition in the deep interior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that, depending on the geometry and quark ordering, the ground state of the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system may be a hadronic molecule, a tetraquark state, or a superposition of the two. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension.</description>

      <title>Two-Point Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy: a Computable Magic Proxy of Interacting Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying non-stabilizerness (``magic'') in interacting fermionic systems remains a formidable challenge, particularly for extracting high order correlations from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In this Letter, we establish the two-point stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) and its mutual counterpart as robust, computationally accessible probes for detecting magic in diverse fermionic phases. By deriving local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions: in the one-dimensional spinless $t$-$V$ model, they sharply identify the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, while in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice via determinant quantum Monte Carlo, they faithfully capture the critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu-Ising universality class. Furthermore, extending our analysis to the fractional quantum Hall regime, we unveil a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, revealing signatures of short-range exclusion correlations. Our results validate the two-point SRE as a versatile and sensitive diagnostic, forging a novel link between quantum resource theory, critical phenomena, and topological order in strongly correlated matter.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of the $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory in a momentum-space Daubechies wavelet basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to investigate nonperturbative dynamics within the Hamiltonian framework. In particular, we employ Daubechies wavelets in momentum space, whose basis functions are labeled by resolution and translation indices, providing a natural nonperturbative truncation of both infrared and ultraviolet truncation of quantum field theories. As an application, we compute the energy spectra of a free scalar field theory and the interacting $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory. This approach successfully reproduces the well-known strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2 &gt; 0$ regime. We find that the extracted critical coupling systematically converges toward its established value as the momentum resolution is increased, demonstrating the effectiveness of the wavelet-based Hamiltonian formulation for nonperturbative field-theoretic calculations.</description>
