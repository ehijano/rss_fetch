      <title>SCUBADive I: JWST+ALMA Analysis of 289 sub-millimeter galaxies in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has enabled detecting and spatially resolving the heavily dust-attenuated stellar populations of sub-millimeter galaxies, revealing detail that was previously inaccessible. In this work we construct a sample of 289 sub-millimeter galaxies with detailed joint ALMA and JWST constraints in the COSMOS field. Sources are originally selected using the SCUBA-2 instrument and have archival ALMA observations from various programs. Their JWST NIRCam imaging is from COSMOS-Web and PRIMER. We extract multi-wavelength photometry in a manner that leverages the unprecedented near-infrared spatial resolution of JWST, and fit the data with spectral energy distribution models to derive photometric redshifts, stellar masses, star-formation rates and optical attenuation. The sample has an average z=2.6, A_V=2.5, SFR=270 and log(M*)=11.1. There are 81 (30%) galaxies that have no previous optical/near-infrared detections, including 75% of the z&gt;4 sub-sample (n=28). The faintest observed near-infrared sources have the highest redshifts and largest A_V=4. In a preliminary morphology analysis we find that ~10% of our sample exhibit spiral arms and 5% host stellar bars, with one candidate bar found at z&gt;3. Finally, we find that the clustering of JWST galaxies within 10 arcseconds of a sub-mm galaxy is a factor of 2 greater than what is expected based on either random clustering or the distribution of sources around any red galaxy irrespective of a sub-mm detection.</description>

      <title>MSA-3D: dissecting galaxies at z~1 with high spatial and spectral resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) is a powerful tool for understanding the formation of galaxies across cosmic history. We present the observing strategy and first results of MSA-3D, a novel JWST program using multi-object spectroscopy in a slit-stepping strategy to produce IFS data cubes. The program observed 43 normal star-forming galaxies at redshifts $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.5$, corresponding to the epoch when spiral thin-disk galaxies of the modern Hubble sequence are thought to emerge, obtaining kpc-scale maps of rest-frame optical nebular emission lines with spectral resolution $R\simeq2700$. Here we describe the multiplexed slit-stepping method which is $&gt;15$ times more efficient than the NIRSpec IFS mode for our program. As an example of the data quality, we present a case study of an individual galaxy at $z=1.104$ (stellar mass $M_{*} = 10^{10.3}~M_{\odot}$, star formation rate~$=3~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) with prominent face-on spiral structure. We show that the galaxy exhibits a rotationally supported disk with moderate velocity dispersion ($\sigma = 36^{+5}_{-4}$~\kms), a negative radial metallicity gradient ($-0.020\pm0.002$~dex\,kpc$^{-1}$), a dust attenuation gradient, and an exponential star formation rate density profile which closely matches the stellar continuum. These properties are characteristic of local spirals, indicating that mature galaxies are in place at $z\sim1$. We also describe the customized data reduction and original cube-building software pipelines which we have developed to exploit the powerful slit-stepping technique. Our results demonstrate the ability of JWST slit-stepping to study galaxy populations at intermediate to high redshifts, with data quality similar to current surveys of the $z\sim0.1$ universe.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Star Formation Quenching of Galaxies in Group Environments using the NewHorizon simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study star formation (SF) quenching of satellite galaxies with $M_{*} &gt; 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ within two low-mass groups ($M_{\rm vir}=10^{12.9}$ and $10^{12.7} \,M_{\odot}$) using the NewHorizon simulation. We confirm that satellite galaxies ($M_{*}\lesssim10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$) are more prone to quenching than their field counterparts. This quenched fraction decreases with increasing stellar mass, consistent with recent studies. Similar to the findings in cluster environments, we note a correlation between the orbital motions of galaxies within these groups and the phenomenon of SF quenching. Specifically, SF is suppressed at the group center, and for galaxies with $M_{*} &gt; 10^{9.1}\,M_{\odot}$, there is often a notable rejuvenation phase following a temporary quenching period. The SF quenching at the group center is primarily driven by changes in star formation efficiency and the amount of gas available, both of which are influenced by hydrodynamic interactions between the interstellar medium and surrounding hot gas within the group. Conversely, satellite galaxies with $M_{*} &lt; 10^{8.2}\,M_{\odot}$ experience significant gas removal within the group, leading to SF quenching. Our analysis highlights the complexity of SF quenching in satellite galaxies in group environments, which involves an intricate competition between the efficiency of star formation (which depends on the dynamical state of the gas) on the one hand, and the availability of cold dense gas on the other hand. This challenges the typical understanding of environmental effects based on gas stripping through ram pressure, suggesting a need for a new description of galaxy evolution under mild environmental effects.</description>

      <title>An X-ray-Detected Quiescent Galaxy at $z=2.09$: Implications for the Connection between AGNs and Galaxy Quenching at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a characterization of an X-ray-detected quiescent galaxy at $z=2.09$, named COS-XQG1, using JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. This galaxy is detected in Chandra imaging, suggesting the presence of an AGN with a high black hole accretion rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm BH}=0.22\pm0.03\, {\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. Using multi-wavelength photometry from X-ray to sub-millimeter, including the latest JWST imaging, we confirm that COS-XQG1 is massive ($M_\star = (1.6\pm0.2)\times10^{11}\, M_\odot$) and quiescent (${\rm sSFR}=(0.9\pm 1.8)\times10^{-11}\, {\rm yr^{-1}}$) as reported previously, even considering the contribution from AGN emission. Noticeably, COS-XQG1 displays a broad line H$\alpha$ emission component with a full width at half maximum of $4491^{+118}_{-110}\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$ in its NIRSpec spectrum. The line width and luminosity of the broad H$\alpha$ emission give a black hole mass of $\log{(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)} = 8.45\pm0.02\, (\pm 0.5)$. With a stellar velocity dispersion measurement ($\sigma_\star=235\pm35\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$), we find that this galaxy is consistent with the local relations in the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ and $M_{\rm BH}- M_\star$ planes, which might suggest that massive quiescent galaxies at $z\geq2$ have already been mature in terms of both stellar and black hole masses and will not evolve significantly. In addition, image 2D-decomposition analysis finds that this galaxy comprises disk and point source components. The latter is likely the composition of an AGN and a stellar bulge. Based on a comparison with numerical simulations, we expect that COS-XQG1 will evolve into a typical bulge-dominated quiescent galaxy with lower AGN activity by redshift 0. This study shows the usefulness of X-ray-detected quiescent galaxies in investigating the co-evolution between SMBHs and galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a hyperluminous quasar at z = 1.62 with Eddington ratio &gt; 3 in the eFEDS field confirmed by KOOLS-IFU on Seimei Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a hyperluminous type 1 quasar (eFEDS J082826.9-013911; eFEDSJ0828-0139) at $z_{\rm spec}$ = 1.622 with a super-Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$). We perform the optical spectroscopic observations with KOOLS-IFU on the Seimei Telescope. The black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) based on the single-epoch method with MgII $\lambda$2798 is estimated to be $M_{\rm BH} = (6.2 \pm 1.2) \times 10^8$ $M_{\odot}$. To measure the precise infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$), we obtain submillimeter data taken by SCUBA-2 on JCMT and conduct the spectral energy distribution analysis with X-ray to submillimeter data. We find that $L_{\rm IR}$ of eFEDSJ0828-0139 is $L_{\rm IR} = (6.8 \pm 1.8) \times 10^{13}$ $L_{\odot}$, confirming the existence of a hypeluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG). $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ is estimated to be $\lambda_{\rm Edd} = 3.6 \pm 0.7$, making it one of the quasars with the highest BH mass accretion rate at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Formation of the interstellar sugar precursor, (Z)-1,2-ethenediol, through radical reactions on dust grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the continued detection of complex organic molecules of prebiotic interest has refueled the interest on a panspermic origin of life. The prebiotic molecule glyceraldehyde is proposed to be formed from (Z)-1,2-ethenediol, a molecule recently detected towards the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud at the galactic center. In this work, we computationally simulate the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol from vinyl alcohol on the surface of amorphous solid water in a two-step synthesis involving a OH addition and a H abstraction reaction. In total, we considered all reaction possibilities of the 1,1 and 1,2-OH addition to vinyl alcohol followed by H-abstraction or H-addition reactions on the resulting radicals. The combination of these reactions is capable of explaining the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol provided a suprathermal diffusion of OH. We also conclude that our proposed formation pathway is not selective and also yields other abstraction and addition products. Key in our findings is the connection between the adsorption modes of the reactants and intermediates and the stereoselectivity of the reactions.</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical Estimates of the Cosmic Planet Formation Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise and exploit a data-driven, semi-empirical framework of galaxy formation and evolution, coupling it to recipes for planet formation from stellar and planetary science, to compute the cosmic planet formation rate, and the properties of the planets' preferred host stellar and galactic environments. We also discuss how the rates and formation sites of planets are affected when considering their habitability, and when including possible threatening sources related to star formation and nuclear activity. Overall, we conservatively estimate a cumulative number of some $10^{20}$ Earth-like planets and around $10^{18}$ habitable Earths in our past lightcone. Finally, we find that a few $10^{17}$ are older than our own Earth, an occurrence which places a loose lower limit a few $10^{-18}$ to the odds for a habitable world to ever hosting a civilization in the observable Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note chronicles the early steps and incidences from over four decades ago, that gave a kickstart to research on the now prominent subclass of radio galaxies, called 'Gigahertz-Peaked-Spectrum' (GPS) sources. In this first-hand account, the origin of the acronym 'GPS' in this context is retraced, along with the first crucial steps and the major milestones set in course of evolution of this now vibrant branch of extragalactic radio astronomy. A brief update on the recent developments in this field is also presented.</description>

      <title>Instability and Evolution of Shocked Clouds Formed by Orthogonal Collisions between Magnetized Filamentary Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filamentary molecular clouds are recognized as primary sites for the formation of stars. Specifically, regions characterized by the overlapping point of multiple filaments, known as hub regions, often associated with active star formation. However, the formation mechanism of this hub structure is not well understood. Therefore, to understand the formation mechanism and star formation in hub structures, as a first step, we investigate the orthogonal collisions between two filaments using three-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations. As a model of initial filaments, we use an infinitely long filament in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium under a global magnetic field running perpendicular to the filament axis. Two identical equilibrium filaments, sharing the same magnetic flux, are arranged with their long axes perpendicular to each other and given an initial velocity perpendicular to their long axes to replicate an orthogonal collision. We find three types of evolution after the shocked cloud is formed: collapse, stable, and expansion modes. The energy balance just after the filaments completely collide explains the future evolution of the shocked cloud. If the magnitude of gravitational energy is larger than the sum of the kinetic, thermal, and magnetic energies, the shocked cloud evolves in collapse mode. If the magnitude of gravitational energy is less than the sum of these energies, the cloud evolves in stable mode when the kinetic energy is relatively small and in expansion mode when the kinetic energy is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>What if the universe expands linearly? A local general relativity to solve the "zero active mass" problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cosmology presents important challenges such as the \textit{Hubble tension}, \textit{El Gordo's collision} or the \textit{impossible galaxies} ($z &gt; 10$). Slight modifications to the standard model propose new parameters (e.g. the early and dynamical dark energy). On the other hand, alternatives such as the coasting universes (e.g. the \textit{hyperconical model} and the spatially flat $R_h = ct$ universe) are statistically compatible with most of observational tests, but still present theoretical problems in matching the observed matter contents since they predict a ``zero active gravitational mass.'' To solve these open issues, we suggest that general relativity might be not valid at cosmic scales, but it would be valid at local scales. This proposal is addressed from two main features of the embedding hyperconical model: 1) the background metric would be independent of the matter content, and 2) the observed cosmic acceleration would be fictitious and because of a distorted stereographic projection of coordinates that produce an apparent radial inhomogeneity from homogeneous manifolds. Finally, to support the discussion, standard observational tests were updated here, showing that the hyperconical model is adequately fitted to Type Ia Supernovae, quasars, galaxy clusters, BAO, and cosmic chronometer data sets.</description>

      <title>On the correlation between Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity and galaxy density in late reionization models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity and local galaxy density (the opacity-density relation) is a key observational test of late reionization models. Using narrow-band surveys of z=5.7 Ly$\alpha$ emitters centered on quasar sight lines, Christenson et al. (2023) showed that two of the most transmissive forest segments at this redshift intersect galaxy underdensities. This is in tension with models of a strongly fluctuating ionizing background, including some late reionization models, which predict that the vast majority of these segments should intersect overdensities where the ionizing intensity is strongest. We use radiative transfer simulations to explore in detail the opacity-density relation in late reionization models. Fields like the one toward quasar PSO J359-06 -- the more underdense of the two transmissive sight lines in Christenson et al. (2023) -- typically contain recently reionized gas in cosmic voids where the hot temperatures and low densities enhance Ly$\alpha$ transmission. The opacity-density relation's transmissive end is sensitive to the amount of neutral gas in voids, and its morphology, set by the reionization source clustering. These effects are, however, degenerate. We demonstrate that models with very different source clustering can yield similar opacity-density relations when their reionization histories are calibrated to match Ly$\alpha$ forest mean flux measurements at z&lt;6. In models with fixed source clustering, a lower neutral fraction increases the likelihood of intersecting hot, recently reionized gas in voids, increasing the likelihood of observing PSO J359-06. For instance, the probability of observing this field is 15% in a model with neutral fraction $x_{\rm HI}=5\%$ at z=5.7, three times more likely than in a model with $x_{\rm HI}=15\%$. The opacity-density relation may thus provide a complementary probe of reionization's end.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Spatially Resolved Star Formation at $4.8&lt;z&lt;6.5$ with JWST FRESCO NIRCam Slitless Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results on the spatial distribution of star formation in 454 star-forming galaxies at $4.8&lt;z&lt;6.5$ using H-Alpha emission-line maps and F444W imaging tracing the stellar continuum from JWST FRESCO NIRCam Slitless Spectroscopy. Star-forming galaxies with stellar masses $6.8\leq$log($M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$)$&lt;11.1$ have positive H-Alpha equivalent width profiles, providing direct evidence for the inside-out growth of galaxies just after the epoch of reionisation. GALFIT is used to calculate half-light radii, $R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and central surface densities within 1 kiloparsec, $\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc}}$. At a fixed stellar mass of log$(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})=9.5$, $\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, H}\alpha}$ is $1.04\pm0.05$ times higher than $\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, C}}$, $R_{\mathrm{eff, H}\alpha}$ is $1.18\pm0.03$ times larger than $R_{\mathrm{eff, C}}$ and both $R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ measurements are less than 1 kiloparsec. These measurements suggest the rapid build-up of compact bulges just after the epoch of reionisation. By comparing to work done at lower redshifts with HST WFC3 Slitless Spectroscopy as part of the 3D-HST ($z=1$) and CLEAR ($z=0.5$) surveys, we find that $R_{\mathrm{eff}}(z)$ evolves at the same pace for H$\alpha$ and the continuum, but $\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc}}(z)$ evolves faster for H$\alpha$. As a function of the Hubble parameter, $\frac{R_{\mathrm{eff, H}\alpha}}{R_{\mathrm{eff, C}}}=1.1h(z)$ and $\frac{\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc,H}\alpha}}{\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc,C}}}=h(z)^{1.3}$. These functions suggest that the inside-out growth of the disk dominates the inside-out growth of the bulge towards lower redshifts. This is supported by the redshift evolution in EW(H$\alpha$) profiles, where there is rapid increase in EW(H$\alpha$) with radius within the half-light radius at $z=5.3$ but only significantly increasing EW(H$\alpha$) with radius in the outer disk at $z=0.5$.</description>

      <title>The ratio of [Eu/$\alpha$] differentiates accreted/in-situ Milky Way stars across metallicities, as indicated by both field stars and globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine stellar orbits with the abundances of the heavy, $r$-process element europium and the light, $\alpha$-element, silicon to separate in-situ and accreted populations in the Milky Way across all metallicities. At high orbital energy, the accretion-dominated halo shows elevated values of [Eu/Si], while at lower energies, where many of the stars were born in-situ, the levels of [Eu/Si] are lower. These systematically different levels of [Eu/Si] in the MW and the accreted halo imply that the scatter in [Eu/$\alpha$] within a single galaxy is smaller than previously thought. At the lowest metallicities, we find that both accreted and in-situ populations trend down in [Eu/Si], consistent with enrichment via neutron star mergers. Through compiling a large dataset of abundances for 46 globular clusters (GCs), we show that differences in [Eu/Si] extend to populations of in-situ/accreted GCs. We interpret this consistency as evidence that in $r$-process elements, GCs trace the star formation history of their hosts, motivating their use as sub-Gyr timers of galactic evolution. Furthermore, fitting the trends in [Eu/Si] using a simple galactic chemical evolution model, we find that differences in [Eu/Si] between accreted and in-situ MW field stars cannot be explained through star formation efficiency alone. Finally, we show that the use of [Eu/Si] as a chemical tag between GCs and their host galaxies extends beyond the Local Group, to the halo of M31 - potentially offering the opportunity to do Galactic Archaeology in an external galaxy.</description>

      <title>Star Stream Velocity Distributions in CDM and WDM Galactic Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark matter subhalos orbiting in a galactic halo perturb the orbits of stars in thin stellar streams. Over time the random velocities in the streams develop non-Gaussian wings. The rate of velocity increase is approximately a random walk at a rate proportional to the number of subhalos, primarily those in the mass range $\approx 10^{6-7} M_\odot$. The distribution of random velocities in long, thin, streams is measured in simulated Milky Way-like halos that develop in representative WDM and CDM cosmologies. The radial velocity distributions are well modeled as the sum of a Gaussian and an exponential. The resulting MCMC fits find Gaussian cores of 1-2 km/sec and exponential wings that increase from 3 km/sec for 5.5 keV WDM, 4 km/sec for 7 keV WDM, to 6 km/sec for a CDM halo. The observational prospects to use stream measurements to constrain the nature of galactic dark matter are discussed.</description>

      <title>Objects May Be Closer Than They Appear: Significant Host Galaxy Dispersion Measures of Fast Radio Bursts in Zoom-in Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the contribution of host galaxies to the overall Dispersion Measures (DMs) for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) using the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological zoom-in simulation suite. We calculate DMs from every star particle in the simulated L* galaxies by ray-tracing through their multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM), summing the line-of-sight free thermal electron column for all gas elements within $\pm$20 kpc of the galactic mid-plane. At $z=0$, we find average (median) host-galaxy DMs of 74 (43) and 210 (94) pc cm$^{-3}$ for older ($\gtrsim$10 Myr) and younger ($\lesssim$10 Myr) stellar populations, respectively. Inclination raises the median DM measured for older populations ($\gtrsim$10 Myr) in the simulations by a factor of $\sim$2, but generally does not affect the younger stars deeply embedded in H{\small II} regions except in extreme edge-on cases (inclination $\gtrsim 85^\circ$). In kinematically disturbed snapshots ($z = 1$ in FIRE), the average (median) host-galaxy DMs are higher: 80 (107) and 266 (795) pc cm$^{-3}$ for older ($\gtrsim$10 Myr) and younger ($\lesssim$10 Myr) stellar populations, respectively. FIRE galaxies tend to have higher DM values than cosmological simulations such as IllustrisTNG\rev{, with larger tails in their distributions to high DMs}. As a result, FRB host galaxies may be closer (lower redshift) than previously inferred. Furthermore, constraining host-galaxy DM distributions may help significantly constrain FRB progenitor models.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of High Velocity Clouds in the Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of our Galaxy's high-velocity clouds (HVCs) remains a mystery after many decades of effort. In this paper, we use the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to identify cool, dense clouds that match observations of Galactic HI HVCs. We track these clouds back in time to determine their origin. For a TNG50 Milky Way-like galaxy, we find that only 17% of HVCs can be tracked directly to the disk, and 21% to material stripped out of satellites. The majority of HVCs (62%) arise from warm and hot circumgalactic gas that cools through thermal instability. They then obtain their anomalous velocities through interactions with the turbulent circumgalactic medium. At TNG50 resolution, we do not see evidence for HVCs forming out of very low metallicity intergalactic material. Instead, low metallicity HVCs are most likely associated with satellites. These results suggest that Galactic HVCs are highly heterogeneous in their origin, and can provide insight into the physical processes that shape the circumgalactic medium such as disk outflows, satellite accretion, and thermal instabilities.</description>

      <title>AGN-driven outflows in clumpy media: multiphase structure and scaling relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small-scale winds driven from accretion discs surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGN) are expected to launch kpc-scale outflows into their host galaxies. However, the ways in which the structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) affects the multiphase content and impact of the outflow remains uncertain. We present a series of numerical experiments featuring a realistic small-scale AGN wind with velocity $5\times 10^3-10^4\ \rm{km/s}$ interacting with an isolated galaxy disc with a manually-controlled clumpy ISM, followed at sub-pc resolution. Our simulations are performed with AREPO and probe a wide range of AGN luminosities ($L=10^{43-47}\ \rm{erg/s}$) and ISM substructures. In homogeneous discs, the AGN wind sweeps up an outflowing, cooling shell, where the emerging cold phase dominates the mass and kinetic energy budgets, reaching a momentum flux $\dot{p} \approx 7\ L/c$. However, when the ISM is clumpy, outflow properties are profoundly different. They contain small, long-lived ($&gt; 5\ \rm{Myr}$), cold ($T&lt;10^{4.5}\ \rm{K}$) cloudlets entrained in the faster, hot outflow phase, which are only present in the outflow if radiative cooling is included in the simulation. While the cold phase dominates the mass of the outflow, most of the kinetic luminosity is now carried by a tenuous, hot phase with $T &gt; 10^7 \ \rm K$. While the hot phases reaches momentum fluxes $\dot{p} \approx (1 - 5)\ L/c$, energy-driven bubbles couple to the cold phase inefficiently, producing modest momentum fluxes $\dot{p} &lt; L/c$ in the fast-outflowing cold gas. These low momentum fluxes could lead to the outflows being misclassified as momentum-driven using common observational diagnostics. We also show predictions for scaling relations between outflow properties and AGN luminosity and discuss the challenges in constraining outflow driving mechanisms and kinetic coupling efficiencies using observed quantities.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Accretion Flows -- ALMAGAL: Flows along filamentary structures in high-mass star-forming clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use data from the ALMA Evolutionary Study of High Mass Protocluster Formation in the Galaxy (ALMAGAL) survey to study 100 ALMAGAL regions at $\sim$ 1 arsecond resolution located between $\sim$ 2 and 6 kpc distance. Using ALMAGAL $\sim$ 1.3mm line and continuum data we estimate flow rates onto individual cores. We focus specifically on flow rates along filamentary structures associated with these cores. Our primary analysis is centered around position velocity cuts in H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$ - 2$_{0,2}$) which allow us to measure the velocity fields, surrounding these cores. Combining this work with column density estimates we derive the flow rates along the extended filamentary structures associated with cores in these regions. We select a sample of 100 ALMAGAL regions covering four evolutionary stages from quiescent to protostellar, Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), and HII regions (25 each). Using dendrogram and line analysis, we identify a final sample of 182 cores in 87 regions. In this paper, we present 728 flow rates for our sample (4 per core), analysed in the context of evolutionary stage, distance from the core, and core mass. On average, for the whole sample, we derive flow rates on the order of $\sim$10$^{-4}$ M$_{sun}$yr$^{-1}$ with estimated uncertainties of $\pm$50%. We see increasing differences in the values among evolutionary stages, most notably between the less evolved (quiescent/protostellar) and more evolved (YSO/HII region) sources. We also see an increasing trend as we move further away from the centre of these cores. We also find a clear relationship between the flow rates and core masses $\sim$M$^{2/3}$ which is in line with the result expected from the tidal-lobe accretion mechanism. Overall, we see increasing trends in the relationships between the flow rate and the three investigated parameters; evolutionary stage, distance from the core, and core mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of a minimally coupled tachyonic scalar field at inflection points in an accelerating universe. We consider the different expansion factors and obtain potentials of tachyonic scalar field. Inflection points of homogeneous tachyonic scalar field is calculated for these potentials. We employ the tools of dynamical system analysis for the considered potentials and obtain the stable points.</description>

      <title>Jets from the Upper Scorpius Variable Young Star System 2MASS J16075796-2040087 Via KECK/HIRES Spectro-astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 2MASS J16075796-2040087 is a ~ 5 Myr young star in Upper Sco with evidence for accretion bursts on a timescale of about 15 days and, uncommonly for its age, outflows traced by multi-component forbidden emission lines (FELs). The accretion bursts may be triggered by a companion at ~ 4.6 au. We analyze HIRES spectra optimised for spectro-astrometry to better understand the origin of the several FEL velocity components and determine whether a MHD disk wind is present. The FEL high velocity component (HVC) traces an asymmetric, bipolar jet ~ 700 au long. The jet's position angle (PA) ~ 277 degrees is not perpendicular to the disk. The lower-velocity emission, classified previously as a disk wind low-velocity component (LVC), is found to have more in common with the HVC and overall it is not possible to identify a MHD disk wind component. The spectro-astrometric signal of the low velocity emission resembles those of jets and its density and ionisation fraction fall into the range of HVCs. We suggest a scenario where the accretion bursts due to the close companion power the jets past the age where such activity ends around most stars. The low-velocity emission here could come from a slow jet launched near the close companion and this emission would be blended with emission from the MHD wind.</description>
