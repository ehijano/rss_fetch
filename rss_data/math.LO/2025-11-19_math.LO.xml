      <title>Theory of Interpretations I. Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first paper in a series in which we lay down the foundations of the theory of interpretations. We systematically study different types of interpretations and their properties. Some of these interpretations are known, while others are new. Each of them serves different purposes. In the last section, we describe applications of interpretations to Diophantine problems, first-order classification, isotypeness, definability of structures by types, elimination of imaginaries, richness, logical categories, and bi-interpretations with Z or N. Additionally, throughout the text, we pose some open questions that naturally arise in this context and provide the most typical examples, usually from algebra. The current literature is plagued by discrepancies and inconsistencies in definitions, concepts, and fundamental applications of interpretations. To address this, we thoroughly examine various principal notions, definitions, and arguments, bringing order to the existing theory. Simultaneously, we develop several key concepts, such as regular interpretations, regular bi-interpretations, and invertible interpretations, and outline their main applications.</description>

      <title>The Solver's Paradox in Formal Problem Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how global decision problems over arithmetically represented domains acquire reflective structure through class-quantification. Arithmetization forces diagonal fixed points whose verification requires reflection beyond finitary means, producing Feferman-style obstructions independent of computational technique. We use this mechanism to analyze uniform complexity statements, including $\mathsf{P}$ vs. $\mathsf{NP}$, showing that their difficulty stems from structural impredicativity rather than methodological limitations. The focus is not on deriving separations but on clarifying the logical status of such arithmetized assertions.</description>

      <title>A general approach to asymptotic elimination of aggregation functions and generalized quantifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a logic with truth values in the unit interval and which uses aggregation functions instead of quantifiers, and we describe a general approach to asymptotic elimination of aggregation functions and, indirectly, of asymptotic elimination of Mostowski style generalized quantifiers, since such can be expressed by using aggregation functions. The notion of ``local continuity'' of an aggregation function, which we make precise in two (related) ways, plays a central role in this approach.</description>

      <title>On models of affine arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By affine arithmetic is meant the set of affine consequences of Peano arithmetic. This is a continuous theory which is studied in the framework of affine logic, a sublogic of continuous logic. Affine arithmetic is undecidable. Also, its models are generally lattice ordered and carry a nontrivial metric. Classical models are then characterized as those which are linearly ordered. In this paper, the affine variants of several classical results in Peano arithmetic are proved. In particular, an affine form of Gaifman's splitting theorem is proved.</description>

      <title>Exponential sums and motivic oscillation index of arbitrary ideals and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2006, Budur, Musta\c{t}\v{a} and Saito introduced the notion of Bernstein-Sato polynomial of an arbitrary scheme of finite type over fields of characteristic zero. Because of the strong monodromy conjecture, it should have a corresponding picture on the arithmetic side of ideals in polynomial rings. In this paper, we try to address this problem. Motivated by the Hardy-Littlewood circle method, we introduce the notions of abstract exponential sums modulo $p^m$ and motivic oscillation index of an arbitrary ideal in polynomial rings over number fields. In the arithmetic picture, the abstract exponential sums modulo $p^m$ and the motivic oscillation index of an ideal should play the role of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial and its maximal non-trivial root of the corresponding scheme. We will provide some properties of the motivic oscillation index of ideals in this paper. On the other hand, based on Igusa's conjecture for exponential sums, we propose the averaged Igusa conjecture for exponential sums of ideals. In particular, this conjecture and the motivic oscillation index of ideals will have many interesting applications. We will introduce these applications and prove some variant version of this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two subclasses of the class of automatic structures: automatic structures of polynomial growth and Presburger structures. We present algebraic characterisations of the groups and the equivalence structures in these two classes.</description>
