      <title>Perturbations and Phase Transitions in Swarm Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural systems often exhibit chaotic behavior in their space-time evolution. Systems transiting between chaos and order manifest a potential to compute, as shown with cellular automata and artificial neural networks. We demonstrate that swarm optimization algorithms also exhibit transitions from chaos, analogous to a motion of gas molecules, when particles explore solution space disorderly, to order, when particles follow a leader, similar to molecules propagating along diffusion gradients in liquid solutions of reagents. We analyze these `phase-like' transitions in swarm optimization algorithms using recurrence quantification analysis and Lempel-Ziv complexity estimation. We demonstrate that converging iterations of the optimization algorithms are statistically different from non-converging ones in a view of applied chaos, complexity and predictability estimating indicators.
  An identification of a key factor responsible for the intensity of their phase transition is the main contribution of this paper. We examined an optimization as a process with three variable factors -- an algorithm, number generator and optimization function. More than 9.000 executions of the optimization algorithm revealed that the nature of an applied algorithm itself is the main source of the phase transitions. Some of the algorithms exhibit larger transition-shifting behavior while others perform rather transition-steady computing. These findings might be important for future extensions of these algorithms.</description>

      <title>Applying Space-Group Symmetry to Speed up Hybrid-Functional-Based Calculations with Numerical Atomic Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the efficient implementation of hybrid density functionals (HDFs) for large-scale periodic systems within the framework of numerical atomic orbital bases using the localized resolution of identity (RI) technique, we have developed an algorithm that exploits the space group symmetry in key operation steps of HDF calculations, leading to further improvements in two ways. First, the reduction of $\mathbf{k}$-points in the Brillouin zone can reduce the number of Kohn-Sham equations to be solved. This necessitates the correct implementation of the rotation relation between the density matrices of equivalent $\mathbf{k}$-points within the representation of atomic orbitals. Second, the reduction of the real-space sector can accelerate the construction of the exact-exchange part of the Hamiltonian in real space. We have implemented this algorithm in the ABACUS software interfaced with LibRI, and tested its performance for several types of crystal systems with different symmetries. The expected speed-up is achieved in both aspects: the time of solving the Kohn-Sham equations decreases in proportion with the reduction of $\mathbf{k}$-points, while the construction of the Hamiltonian in real space is sped up by several times, with the degree of acceleration depending on the size and symmetry of the system.</description>

      <title>Negative and positive anisotropic thermal expansion in 2D fullerene networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular double bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.</description>

      <title>A geometric Particle-In-Cell discretization of the drift-kinetic and fully kinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the geometric Particle in Cell framework on dual grids to a gauge-free drift-kinetic Vlasov--Maxwell model and its coupling with the fully kinetic model. We derive a discrete action principle on dual grids for our drift-kinetic model, such that the dynamical system involves only the electric and magnetic fields and not the potentials as most drift-kinetic and gyrokinetic models do. This yields a macroscopic Maxwell equation including polarization and magnetization terms that can be coupled straightforwardly with a fully kinetic model.</description>

      <title>Numerical Framework for Multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings Models Incorporating the Modified Langevin Noise Formalism: Non-Markovian Analysis of Atom-Field Interactions in Dissipative Electromagnetic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel numerical framework that integrates the modified Langevin noise formalism into the multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings models, enabling a first-principles, non-Markovian analysis of atom-field interactions in dissipative electromagnetic (EM) environments that account for both radiative losses and absorptive dissipation in lossy dielectric media (or satisfying general inhomogeneous causal media exhibiting both dispersion and absorption effects). In the modified Langevin noise formalism, the boundary- and medium-assisted (BA and MA) fields, which constitute a continuum set of EM modes in dissipative EM environments, are numerically obtained using the finite-element method (FEM). Specifically, BA field modes are extracted by solving plane-wave scattering problems, while MA field modes are determined through point-source radiation problems. These numerically obtained BA and MA field modes are then incorporated into the multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings models such that the coupling strength between atoms and BA-MA field modes can be calculated for the study of atom-field interactions in dissipative EM environments. The proposed methodology captures non-Markovian atomic dynamics that cannot be described by traditional quantum master equations under the Markovian approximation. To validate the accuracy of the proposed numerical framework, we present four numerical examples: (i) a two-level system (TLS) in a perfect electric conductor (PEC) half-space; (ii) dissipative cavity electrodynamics with two limiting cases approaching spontaneous emission in free space and ideal Rabi oscillations; (iii) super-radiance in TLS arrays; and (iv) entanglement sudden death of two TLSs inside dissipative cavities. The proposed methodology can serve as a ground-truth numerical simulator for studying atom-field interactions in general dissipative EM environments.</description>

      <title>CrystalFormer-RL: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Materials Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning has instrumental enhanced the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we explore the applications of reinforcement fine-tuning to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer (arXiv:2403.15734) using discriminative machine learning models such as interatomic potentials and property prediction models. By optimizing reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material property figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning enables not only the property-guided novel material design ability of generative pre-trained model but also unlocks property-driven material retrieval from the unsupervised pre-training dataset. Leveraging rewards from discriminative models to fine-tune materials generative models opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity: stability and attractors in slip rate driven processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructral changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. Interestingly, we demonstrate that even size-independent models can exhibit size-dependent effects through variations in initial dislocation density. Notably, the initial dislocation density significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of micro-pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Numerical limits in the integration of Vlasov-Poisson equation for Cold Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Poisson systems of equations (VP) describes the evolution of a distribution of collisionless particles under the effect of a collective-field potential. VP is at the basis of the study of the gravitational instability of cosmological density perturbations in Dark-Matter (DM), but its range of application extends to other fields, such as plasma physics.
  In the case of Cold Dark Matter, a single velocity is associated with each fluid-element (or particle) , the initial condition presents a stiff discontinuity. This creates problems such as diffusion or negative distribution function when a grid based method is used to solve VP. In this work we want to highlight this problem, focusing on the technical aspects of this phenomenon. By comparing different finite volume methods and a spectral method we observe that, while all integration schemes preserve the invariants of the system (e.g, energy), the physical observable of interest, i.e., the density, is not correctly reproduced. We thus compare the density obtained with the different Eulerian integration schemes with the result obtained from a reference N-body method. We point out that the most suitable method to solve the VP system for a self-gravitating system is a spectral method.</description>

      <title>Low-energy interband Kondo bound states in orbital-selective Mott phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-energy excitations in correlated electron systems may show intricate behaviors and provide essential insights into the dynamics of quantum states and phase transitions. Here, we study a typical half-filled two-orbital Hubbard model featuring the so-called holon-doublon (HD) low-energy excitations in the orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP), where the principal form of the low-energy excitations has been considered to be a HD bound state. We employ standard single-site dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), using NORG as an improved impurity solver to calculate the spectral functions at zero temperature. We show that the HD bound state gives an incomplete or even wrong picture for the low-energy excitations. Instead, the excitations are composed of a Kondo-like state in the wide band and a doublon in the narrow band, termed as inter-band Kondo-like (IBK) bound states. Remarkably, we find that, as the bandwidths of the two bands approach each other, anomalous IBK bound-state excitations appear in the metallic {\em wide} band. Our study provides a new picture for the low-energy excitations in the OSMP.</description>

      <title>Structural and Magnetic Properties of Co-rich bct CoMn Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02812v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is crucial in drug discovery, particularly during hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases, however, limitations in ligand force fields continue to impact prediction accuracy. In this work, we validate relative binding free energy (RBFE) accuracy using neural network potentials (NNPs) for the ligands. We utilize a novel NNP model, AceFF 1.0, based on the TensorNet architecture for small molecules that broadens the applicability to diverse drug-like compounds, including all important chemical elements and supporting charged molecules. Using established benchmarks, we show overall improved accuracy and correlation in binding affinity predictions compared with GAFF2 for molecular mechanics and ANI2-x for NNPs. Slightly less accuracy but comparable correlations with OPLS4. We also show that we can run the NNP simulations at 2 fs timestep, at least two times larger than previous NNP models, providing significant speed gains. The results show promise for further evolutions of free energy calculations using NNPs while demonstrating its practical use already with the current generation. The code and NNP model are publicly available for research use.</description>

      <title>Combining physics-based and data-driven models: advancing the frontiers of research with Scientific Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) is a recently emerged research field which combines physics-based and data-driven models for the numerical approximation of differential problems. Physics-based models rely on the physical understanding of the problem, subsequent mathematical formulation, and numerical approximation. Data-driven models instead aim to extract relations between input and output data without arguing any causality principle underlining the available data distribution. In recent years, data-driven models have been rapidly developed and popularized. Such a diffusion has been triggered by a huge availability of data, increasingly cheap computing power, and the development of powerful ML algorithms. SciML leverages the physical awareness of physics-based models and the efficiency of data-driven algorithms. With SciML, we can inject physics and mathematical knowledge into ML algorithms. Yet, we can rely on data-driven algorithms' capability to discover complex and nonlinear patterns from data and improve the descriptive capacity of physics-based models. After recalling the mathematical foundations of digital modelling and ML algorithms and presenting the most popular ML architectures, we discuss the great potential of a broad variety of SciML strategies in solving complex problems governed by PDEs. Finally, we illustrate the successful application of SciML to the simulation of the human cardiac function, a field of significant socioeconomic importance that poses numerous challenges on both the mathematical and computational fronts. Despite the robustness and accuracy of physics-based models, certain aspects, such as unveiling constitutive laws for cardiac cells and myocardial material properties, as well as devising efficient reduced order models to dominate the extraordinary computational complexity, have been successfully tackled by leveraging data-driven models.</description>
