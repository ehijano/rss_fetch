      <title>Bread Upon the Waters: Corporate Science and the Benefits from Follow-On Public Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do firms produce scientific research and make it available to the public, including their rivals? Prior literature has emphasized the tension between imitation risks from disclosure and scientists' preferences for publication. This study examines an additional managerial consideration: the value of follow-on research conducted by external scientists building upon firms' publications. Using data on U.S. public firms' scientific publications from 1990 to 2012, and a novel instrumental variable based on quasi-random journal issue assignment, I find that accumulation of follow-on research is associated with increased subsequent scientific investments, improved patenting outcomes, and greater employee retention by the originating firms. Benefits are more pronounced for firms with complementary assets and those operating in emerging research fields. Beyond serving as direct input into innovation, follow-on research provides external validation of internal research programs, helping managers allocate resources under conditions of scientific uncertainty. These findings demonstrate that firms benefit when their scientific disclosures inspire follow-on research by the broader scientific community.</description>

      <title>Does Military Expenditure Impede Sustainable Development? Empirical Evidence from NATO Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development in NATO countries. The analysis utilizes annual data for the period between 1995 and 2019. In this study, the Durbin-Hausman panel cointegration test is used to analyze the cointegration relationship between the variables and the Panel AMG estimator is used to estimate the long-run coefficients. The results of the AMG estimator show that military expenditures and industrial production index have a negative effect on sustainable development in NATO countries, while foreign direct investments have a positive effect. The impact of primary energy consumption is negative and less significant than the other negative impacts. The study also analyzes how the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development varies across countries. This analysis reveals the significant differences in the direction, significance, and coefficient size of the relationship among different countries. These findings suggest that the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development varies across countries. Therefore, countries should develop policies to ensure sustainable development by considering their specific dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Provincial Export Performance in Turkiye: A Spectral Clustering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes and clusters Turkiye's 81 provinces based on their export performance. The study uses import, export and net export data for 2023. In addition, exchange rate-adjusted versions of the data were also included to eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Spectral clustering method is used to group the export performance of cities. The optimum number of clusters was determined by the Eigen-Gap method. The Silhouette coefficient method was used to evaluate the clustering performance. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that the data set was optimally separated into 3 clusters. Spectral-clustering analysis based on export performance showed that 42% of the provinces are in the "Low", 33% in the "Medium" and 25% in the "High" export performance category. In terms of import performance, 44%, 33%, 33%, and 22% of the provinces are in the "Medium", "High", and "Low" categories, respectively. In terms of net exports, 38, 35% and 27% of the provinces are in the "Low", "Medium" and "High" net export performance categories, respectively. Izmir has the highest net export performance, while Istanbul has the lowest.</description>

      <title>Can Renewable Energy Sources Alleviate the Pressure of Military Expenditures on the Environment? Empirical Evidence from Turkiye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes the potential of renewable energy sources to reduce the environmental impact of military expenditures in Turkiye. ARDL method is preferred in the analysis using annual data for the period 1990-2021. In addition, an interaction term is added to the model to determine the effectiveness of renewable energy sources. The results show that military expenditures have a positive impact on CO2 emissions in the short and long run with coefficients of 0.260 and 0.196, respectively. Moreover, renewable energy use has a statistically significant negative impact on CO2 emissions in the short and long run with coefficients of -0.119 and -0.120, respectively. GDP has a positive impact on CO2 emissions in the short and long run with coefficients of 0.162 and 0.193, respectively. Although population growth does not have a statistically significant impact in the short run, it is found to increase CO2 emissions in the long run with a coefficient of 0.095. Moreover, the interaction term shows that renewable energy use reduces the environmental impact of military expenditures in Turkiye in the short and long run with coefficients of -0.130 and -0.140, respectively. The results indicate that renewable energy use can play an important role in mitigating the environmental impacts of military expenditures.</description>

      <title>Impact of power outages on the adoption of residential solar photovoltaic in a changing climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are a cornerstone of residential decarbonization and energy resilience. However, most existing systems are PV-only and cannot provide backup power during grid failures. Here, we present a high-resolution analysis of 377,726 households in Indianapolis, US, quantifying how power outages influence the installation of PV-only systems between 2014 and 2023. Using a two-part econometric panel model, we estimate the causal effect of power outage exposure and project future risks under a middle of the road climate scenario (RCP 4.5). We find that each additional hour of annual outage duration per household lowers the new-installation rate by 0.012 percentage points per year, equivalent to a 31% decline relative to the historical mean (2014-2023). With outage duration and frequency projected to double by 2040, these results reveal a potential vicious cycle between grid unreliability and slower decarbonization, calling for policies that integrate grid resilience and clean-energy goals.</description>

      <title>From FLOPs to Footprints: The Resource Cost of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As computational demands continue to rise, assessing the environmental footprint of AI requires moving beyond energy and water consumption to include the material demands of specialized hardware. This study quantifies the material footprint of AI training by linking computational workloads to physical hardware needs. The elemental composition of the Nvidia A100 SXM 40 GB graphics processing unit (GPU) was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, which identified 32 elements. The results show that AI hardware consists of about 90% heavy metals and only trace amounts of precious metals. The elements copper, iron, tin, silicon, and nickel dominate the GPU composition by mass. In a multi-step methodology, we integrate these measurements with computational throughput per GPU across varying lifespans, accounting for the computational requirements of training specific AI models at different training efficiency regimes. Scenario-based analyses reveal that, depending on Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and hardware lifespan, training GPT-4 requires between 1,174 and 8,800 A100 GPUs, corresponding to the extraction and eventual disposal of up to 7 tons of toxic elements. Combined software and hardware optimization strategies can reduce material demands: increasing MFU from 20% to 60% lowers GPU requirements by 67%, while extending lifespan from 1 to 3 years yields comparable savings; implementing both measures together reduces GPU needs by up to 93%. Our findings highlight that incremental performance gains, such as those observed between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, come at disproportionately high material costs. The study underscores the necessity of incorporating material resource considerations into discussions of AI scalability, emphasizing that future progress in AI must align with principles of resource efficiency and environmental responsibility.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Doughnut of social and planetary boundaries with frugal machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 'Doughnut' of social and planetary boundaries has emerged as a popular framework for assessing environmental and social sustainability. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept analysis that shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut. First, we show how ML methods can be used to find policy parameters that are consistent with 'living within the Doughnut'. Second, we show how a reinforcement learning agent can identify the optimal trajectory towards desired policies in the parameter space. The approaches we test, which include a Random Forest Classifier and $Q$-learning, are frugal ML methods that are able to find policy parameter combinations that achieve both environmental and social sustainability. The next step is the application of these methods to a more complex ecological macroeconomic model.</description>
