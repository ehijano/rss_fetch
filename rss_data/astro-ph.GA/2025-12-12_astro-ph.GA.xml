      <title>Rhea-RT: Dynamical impact of Central Molecular Zone conditions on ISM properties and stellar feedback coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is an extreme star formation environment, characterized by higher density, higher turbulence, stronger orbital shear, and stronger magnetic field strength than the Solar neighborhood. Whether classical theories of star formation hold within this extreme environment is still debated. In order to assess the impact of these different conditions on the interstellar medium (ISM) and on star formation, we present radiation MHD arepo simulations of a Milky Way-type galaxy. We set up a high-resolution ($M_{\rm cell}=20$ M$_\odot$) region in a ring around the Solar radius, as well as in the barred region of the Galaxy to have a coherent comparison between the CMZ and the Solar neighborhood. Although the high densities and strong levels of turbulence influence star formation and feedback, we find that a key difference in the regulation of star formation between the two environments comes from the short orbital times and the strong shear present in the CMZ. In particular, we highlight the role of the quick dynamical decoupling of stars and gas that leads to periodic re-embedding events in the early lifetimes of radiating O stars. Young stellar associations get efficiently sheared apart such that the ISM is deprived of the compounding effect of radiation and supernovae in disrupting molecular clouds. This changes dramatically the evolution of giant molecular clouds and how feedback can regulate star formation in the CMZ. Stellar feedback is no longer directly coupled to the molecular cloud from which they formed and no strong and disruptive superbubbles can develop. Instead, the feedback rather acts as a background source of turbulence.</description>

      <title>KURVS: chemical properties from multiple strong line calibrations for star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-phase oxygen abundance (metallicity) properties can be constrained through emission line analyses, and are of great importance to investigate galaxy evolution histories. We present an analysis of the integrated and spatially-resolved rest-frame optical emission line properties of the ionised gas in 43 star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.5$ in the KMOS Ultra-deep Rotational Velocity Survey (KURVS). Using the [NII]$\lambda6584$/H$\alpha$ (N$_2$), ([OII]$\lambda\lambda3727,9+$[OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$)/H$\beta$ (R23), and for the first time [NII]$\lambda6584$/[OII]$\lambda\lambda3727,9$ (N$_2$O$_2$) indicators at this redshift, we measure the gas-phase metallicities and their radial gradients. On $\sim4$-kpc scales metallicity gradients measured from N$_2$O$_2$ and those measured from N$_2$ are in good agreement when considering the spatial distributions of dust in each galaxy, as parameterised by dust attenuation radial gradients. We report a nearly flat metallicity gradient distribution typically at $z\sim1.5$, with the 50th, 16th and 84th percentiles at $0.01$, $-0.03$, and $0.05$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, respectively. The findings agree well with previous observational studies and simulations at this epoch. We ascribe the observed negative metallicity gradients to a natural result from self-regulating systems, and the positive ones to potential galactic fountains and higher merger rates.</description>

      <title>Orbital migration and heating history of the Galactic disc: a transition between the bimodal discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar orbits in the Galactic disc evolve from their birth to the current shape through both radial migration and dynamical heating. The history of their secular evolution is imprinted in the current kinematics and age-metallicity distribution. We construct a chrono-chemo-dynamical model of the disc, incorporating inside-out growth, metallicity evolution, radial migration, and heating to fit the observed age-metallicity-kinematics distribution of LAMOST subgiant stars in both the low and high-$\alpha$ disc. By modelling all distribution parameters with spline fitting, we present the first non-parametric stellar migration and heating history of the Galaxy. We determine the heating-to-migration ratio, the ratio of the root-mean-square changes in radial/vertical and azimuthal actions, to be $\approx0.075$ for radial to azimuthal actions and $\approx0.015$ for vertical to azimuthal actions, implying a highly anisotropic diffusion in the action space. Furthermore, we identify a transition in radial migration efficiency coinciding with the transition moment of the bimodal disc, for which the radial migration was more efficient for the high-$\alpha$ disc than for the low-$\alpha$ disc. This transition may be attributed to two correlated scenarios: 1) a bar formation epoch accompanied by violent outward migration, and 2) a drop in the gas mass fraction in the disc when the low-$\alpha$ disc began to form. These findings offer further constraints on the formation mechanisms of bimodal discs, favouring the downsizing scenario. We also briefly discuss the connection between our results and recent high-redshift observations. In addition to the secular evolution history, our model maps the Milky Way ISM metallicity gradient at different lookback times, which we find has only varied a little (in the range of $-0.07~\rm to~-0.10~dex/kpc$) since disc formation.</description>

      <title>ClearPotential: Revealing Local Dark Matter in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ClearPotential, a data-driven, three-dimensional measurement of the gravitational potential of the local Milky Way using unsupervised machine learning, without the symmetry assumptions, specific functional forms, and binning required in previous work. The potential is modeled as a neural network, optimized to solve the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation for the observed phase space density of Gaia DR3 Red Clump stars within 4 kpc of the Sun. This density is obtained from data using normalizing flows, and our unsupervised solution to the Boltzmann equation automatically corrects for selection effects from crowding and the dust-driven extinction of starlight. Our fully-differentiable model of the gravitational potential allows us to map the acceleration and mass density of the Galaxy in the volume around the Sun, including in the dust-obscured disk towards the Galactic Center. We determine the dark matter density at the Solar radius to be $(0.84 \pm 0.08)\times 10^{-2}\,{M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$, and analyze the structure of the dark matter halo. We find strong evidence for a tilted oblate halo, weak preference for a cored inner profile, and the strongest constraints to date on a possible dark matter disk. We place a bound on the timescale of disequilibrium in the local Milky Way, and find mild evidence for disequilibrium using independent acceleration measurements from timings of binary pulsar systems. This work provides the clearest map of the local Galactic potential to date and marks an important step in the era of data-driven astrometry.</description>

      <title>The mysterious Globular Cluster population of MATLAS-2019</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MATLAS-2019 (also known as NGC5846-UDG1) has attracted significant attention due to the ongoing debate surrounding its Globular Cluster (GC) population, with several studies addressing the issue yet reaching little consensus. In this paper we take advantage of HST's multi-wavelength coverage (F475W, F606W and F814W observations) with the addition of deep u-band imaging from Gran Telescopio de Canarias, to perform the most detailed study and estimation to date of the GC population of the ultra-diffuse galaxy MATLAS-2019. The improved constraints provided by the combination of high spatial resolution and better coverage of the GC spectral energy distribution has allowed us to obtain a clean sample of GCs in this galaxy. We report a number of 33+-3 GCs in MATLAS-2019, supporting the previous lower estimates for this galaxy. The GC population of this galaxy is highly concentrated with ~80% of the GCs inside the effective radius (Re) of the galaxy and the GC half-number radius Re,GC is 0.7Re. Using the GC-Halo mass relation, we estimate a halo mass for MATLAS-2019 of (1.14+-0.1)x10**11 solar masses. The GC luminosity function and the distribution of effective radii of the GCs favour a distance to the galaxy of 20.0+-0.9 Mpc. In agreement with previous findings, we find that the distribution of GCs is highly asymmetric even though the distribution of stars in the galaxy is symmetric. This suggests that assumptions about the symmetry of the GC distribution may be incorrect when used to calculate the number of GCs with such low statistics.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: Powerful and frequent outflows in moderate-luminosity AGN at $z\sim3-6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The period between z ~ 3-6, a key transformational phase in galaxy evolution preceding `cosmic noon' (z ~ 1-3), is very poorly explored in terms of feedback from AGN acting through gas outflows. In this work, we study the properties of outflows in AGN (mostly X-ray-selected) from the GOODS-S field, exploiting JWST NIRSpec IFU observations as part of the GA-NIFS GTO survey. Together with its twin sub-sample from COSMOS reported in a previous GA-NIFS work, this constitutes the largest spatially resolved sample of AGN outflows at these redshifts to date, comprising 16 targets with outflows (out of a total of 19 AGN), and probes the unexplored regime of AGN at z ~ 3-6 with bolometric luminosities ~$10^{45-46}$ erg/s. We mapped the rest-optical ionised gas emission lines at sub-kpc scales and spectrally isolated the broad wings tracing fast outflows from the gas at rest in the host galaxies. The incidence of ionised outflows in the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS sample is high (&gt;75\%), among the highest at any redshift. We inferred outflow velocities between ~600-2000 km/s, maximum radii of &lt;1-4 kpc, and ionised gas mass outflow rates of ~0.1-100 $M_\odot$/yr, which in some cases can exceed the host galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We find that the outflow properties inferred for the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS AGN sample and their relations with $L_{\rm bol}$ and SFR generally align with those observed for other spatially resolved literature samples of AGN outflows across different redshifts and AGN luminosities. Nonetheless, after accounting for any luminosity bias, our analysis suggests a cosmic evolution of the outflow properties, with higher median mass outflow rates (and possibly also mass loading factors) at higher redshifts, especially at z&gt;3, indicating that AGN outflows were stronger in the early Universe than at later times, and thus potentially more capable of affecting their host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Transient protostellar cores in high mass star forming regions revealed by time-resolved synthetic imaging of dust emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between dense gas cores and their infant protostars is key to understanding how stars form in molecular clouds. In this paper we investigate the properties, persistence, and protostellar content of cores that would be identified by a dendrogram analysis of 1.3 mm ALMA images. We use a time series of synthetic images produced by post-processing a simulation of star formation in a massive globally collapsing clump, with polaris to calculate dust radiative transfer and CASA to generate synthetic ALMA data. Identifying sinks in the simulation with protostars, we find that most dendrogram-identified cores do not contain any protostars, with many cores being transient features associated with clumpy flow along feeder filaments. Cores with protostars generally host &lt;4, and protostellar mass is not strongly correlated with the mass of the parent cores due to their transience and shifting boundaries. Calculating observationally-relevant intensity-weighted average temperatures for all cores, we find that even at early times the core temperature distribution spans tens of Kelvin, and its width increases with time. The 1.3 mm peak and integrated intensity of the brightest mm core do not increase monotonically as the most massive associated protostar grows, indicating it cannot be assumed that brighter mm sources host more massive protostars. Leveraging the time domain, we test observational properties that have been proposed as potential evolutionary indicators and find that only the total 1.3 mm flux density of the region, the total 1.3 mm flux density in cores, and the number of cores show strong, statistically significant correlation with time.</description>

      <title>High-energy astrochemistry in the molecular interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: Constraining Chemical Enrichment Pathways at Cosmic Noon with Argon Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present argon abundances from a sample of 46 star-forming galaxies at $z=2-3.5$ from the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-Optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) program. Although argon is an $\alpha-$element produced by Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe), the latest supernova yield models suggest additional argon production and enrichment by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), unlike other $\alpha-$elements such as oxygen. To study the relationship between argon and oxygen abundances, we construct two median-stacked composite spectra for separate $z=2.0-2.6$ and $z=2.8-3.5$ redshift bins, presenting more representative measurements than previous samples that require individual detection of faint lines. Abundance ratios were determined using an empirical calibration based on the strength of the [ArIII]$\lambda7137$ emission line relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5008$ emission line. With this calibration, we estimate argon abundances (Ar/O) of $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 2.26$ bin and $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.11}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 3.15$ bin, suggesting minimal SNe Ia and dominant CCSNe enrichment in this sample. Comparison of our abundance measurements of $z\sim 2-3$ AURORA galaxies with chemical evolution modeling of Milky Way stars shows consistency with the Milky Way Bulge component, suggesting a rapid star-formation timescale. However, even larger samples of actively star-forming galaxies with available argon abundances, as well as comparisons between argon abundance and other critical galaxy properties (e.g., sSFR) and models (e.g., one tuned specifically to this redshift range) are needed to draw stronger conclusions on the role of argon in galactic chemical enrichment at Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>Deuterium fractionation and CO depletion in Barnard 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuterium fractionation provides a key diagnostic of the physical and chemical evolution of prestellar and protostellar cores, where it is strongly linked to CO depletion in cold, dense gas. We present the first spatially resolved maps of deuterium fraction and CO depletion in the Barnard 5 (B5) region of the Perseus molecular cloud, covering both a starless core and the protostellar core hosting the Class 0/I source IRAS 03445+3242. Using IRAM 30~m observations of N$_2$H$^+$(1--0), N$_2$D$^+$(1--0), H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), and DCO$^+$(2--1), complemented by C$^{18}$O(2--1) data, we derive column density, deuterium fraction, and CO depletion maps. We find that the deuterium fraction in both mentioned nitrogen- and carbon-bearing species increases from the protostellar to the starless core, reaching $R_D^{\rm N_2H^+}=0.43\pm0.10$ and $R_D^{\rm HCO^+}=0.09\pm0.02$ in the starless core, compared with $0.15\pm0.03$ and $0.05\pm0.01$, respectively, in the protostellar core. The CO depletion factor also rises from $4.1\pm0.1$ to $5.0\pm0.1$ across the same transition. While the embedded YSO reduces deuteration in the dense inner gas, the less dense envelope traced by HCO$^+$ is only slightly affected at our resolution. Our analysis confirms that CO freeze-out and the presence of a protostar jointly regulate deuterium chemistry in star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Weak O VI Absorption in Underdense Regions of the Low-Redshift Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for weak O VI absorption in the low-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) using 82 high signal-to-noise quasar spectra obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. From this dataset, we compile a clean sample of 396 intervening Lyman-alpha (Lya) absorption lines with H I column densities log (N_HI) &lt; 14.5, all of which lack individual O VI absorption with log (N_OVI ) &gt; 13. We perform a spectral stacking analysis at the expected location of the O VI doublet, revealing O VI absorption with a statistical significance greater than 5$\sigma$, and measure an equivalent width of 1.7 $\pm$ 0.3 mA, corresponding to log (N_OVI ) = 12.14 $\pm$ 0.08. The stacked O VI absorption signal associated with strong Lya absorbers (13.5 &lt;= log N_HI &lt; 14.5) is significantly stronger than that associated with weaker Lya absorbers (12.5 &lt;= log N_HI &lt; 13.5). For the subset of 81 broad Lya absorbers (BLAs; b(HI) &gt; 45 km/s), we obtain a marginal $\sim$3 $\sigma$ O VI detection. Other than Si III, detected at 5$\sigma$, no associated metal lines are found. Cross-correlation of the Lya absorbers with galaxies indicates that 93% of these absorbers are not associated with bright galaxies within 1 Mpc, implying that the detected O VI originates in the diffuse IGM rather than the circumgalactic medium. The stacked O VI signal suggests characteristic metallicities of $\sim 0.01\,Z_{\odot}$ under photoionisation and $\sim 0.001\,Z_{\odot}$ under collisional ionisation conditions, though these estimates are model-dependent and assume that O VI and H I trace the same phase. This study provides the first observational evidence for metal absorption in low-column-density Lya systems that individually exhibit no detectable metals, placing important constraints on the metal enrichment of the underdense IGM.</description>

      <title>Strong Bars, Strong Inflow: The Effect of Bar Strength on Gas Inflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar bars are elongated structures in disk galaxies that can torque and funnel gas inward, influencing galaxy evolution. While strong bars are known to induce rapid inflow, the impact of weaker bars remains less certain. We collected spectroscopic data using the Isaac Newton Telescope to analyze 18 nearby galaxies (strongly barred, weakly barred, and unbarred) drawn from Galaxy Zoo DESI. We obtained spatial profiles of equivalent width (EW) and ionized gas velocity dispersion by fitting Gaussian profiles to the H{\alpha} emission line. Strongly barred galaxies exhibit a distinctive three-peaked EW[H{\alpha}] structure, consistent with inward funneling of gas. Weakly barred systems lack this pattern, which suggests limited inflow. Velocity dispersion distributions further distinguish the bar types, with strongly barred galaxies showing significantly higher values than weakly barred and unbarred systems. These results suggest that strong bars drive gas inflow, while weak bars exert a limited dynamical influence.</description>

      <title>The Narrow Emission Lines of Seyfert 1 Galaxies: Comparisons with a Large SDSS Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed a large sample of SDSS spectra of Seyfert galaxies, subdividing Seyfert 1s based on their narrow-to-broad Halpha components. Comparing their narrow-lines (NL) to Seyfert2s in line-ratio diagrams, most of the NL of strong Sy 1.0 and Sy 1.2s (with dominant broad lines) are the same as those of pure Sy2s. In contrast, only 25-30 percent of the Sy1.8 and Sy1.9 nuclei (with weak broad lines) are located in the pure Sy2 region, with the rest falling in the composite-star-forming region. We explain these Seyfert-plus-star-formation spectra with a simple model. It shows that 85 percent of NL in Sy1.9 are from HII-regions, while 88 percent of the NL in Sy 1.0 arise from the same NLR as in pure Sy2. About 6 percent of the strong and weak Sy1's have NL dominated by LINER emission, while 15 percent of intermediate Seyferts (Sy 1.5 and Sy 1.6) do. To confirm this Seyfert 1 AGN plus star formation combination, we used stellar absorption-lines to compare their stellar populations. Their Hdelta strengths show that LINERs, pure Sy2s, and also the broad-line dominated Sy1s have old stellar populations. The weak Sy 1s show stronger Hdelta absorption, indicating larger proportions of young stars. About one third of the u band light in Sy1.0 and 1.2 is blended Balmer lines and continuum from the BLR. The NL gas reddening increases as the BLR strength decreases, from Sy1.0 (0.13 mag), to Sy1.9 (0.40 mag), to Sy2s and LINERs both with 0.50 mag. Our data do not support the simplest version of Seyfert 1 and 2 unification, where both AGN classes have identical NL.</description>

      <title>$^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 Observations of Tycho's supernova remnant: constraints on the environmental gas properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR; SN 1572) is expanding into a cavity wall of molecular clouds (MCs), which decelerate the SNR and influence its multi-wavelength morphology. To constrain the physical properties of environmental MCs and search for heated gas, we perform a JCMT $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 observation and compare with previous $^{12}$CO $J$=2--1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1--0 and $^{13}$CO $J$=1--0 data. We present the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 map toward Tycho and show that the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 spatial distribution and line profiles are similar to those of the lower-$J$ CO lines. By comparing the multiple transitions of CO and the RADEX (Radiative transfer code in non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) models, we constrain the physical properties of molecular gas surrounding Tycho: the northern cloud has a molecular column density of $N({\rm H}_{2})=0.5$ -- $4.5\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, while other regions have $N({\rm H}_{2})=0.2$ -- $3.9\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$; the kinetic temperatures $T_{\rm k}$ of these clouds are in the range of 9 -- 22 K and the volume densities $n({\rm H}_{2})$ are 20 -- $700$ cm$^{-3}$. We also discuss the difficulty in finding hot molecular gas shocked by such a young SNR. We estimate that the shocked molecular layer can be as thin as 0.003 pc, corresponding to $0.2''$ at the distance of 2.5 kpc, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the angular resolution of current CO observations. Therefore, our molecular observations are largely insensitive to the thin shocked gas layer; instead, they detect the environmental gas.</description>

      <title>Tracking Protostellar Variability in Massive Protoclusters with ALMA: I. Insights from QUARKS and MaMMOtH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter/submillimeter variability is often attributed to dynamical disk-mediated accretion, yet detection is limited to low-mass protostars in nearby clouds. Recent observations have also revealed significant (sub)millimeter variability in high-mass protostars, but the confirmed cases are scarce and lack systematic monitoring. In this work, we analyzed multi-epoch Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 (1.3 mm) continuum observations of 22 massive protoclusters, with epoch separations ranging from a few hours to more than two years, while achieving a consistent angular resolution of approximately 0.3 arcsec. These data allow us to track variability of protostars across a broader mass range and in an environment markedly different from nearby clouds. Using a custom processing pipeline for data reduction, image alignment, and relative flux calibration, we achieve high-precision flux measurements and, for the first time, investigate millimeter variability in massive protoclusters based on interferometric data in a statistical manner. Applying the astrodendro algorithm, we identified 383 condensations and tracked their variations in peak intensities. Standard deviation analysis and difference maps reveal five variable sources, corresponding to a lower limit of 1.3% on the variable fraction. Among these, I13111-6228 stands out as it hosts a hypercompact H II region that exhibits a 68% increase in continuum peak intensity over one year, with an uncertainty of 2%. This supports the burst-mode accretion picture in massive star formation as a viable route for the formation of massive stars.</description>

      <title>The LEGA-C galaxy survey: multiple quenching channels for quiescent galaxies at $z\sim1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the sizes and star-formation histories (SFHs) of 2908 galaxies with $M_\star \geq 10^9$ M$_\odot$ at $0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.0$, drawn from the LEGA-C survey. The goal is to investigate the connection between galaxy sizes with SFH, stellar age, and metallicity. SFHs were derived with Prospector by fitting the high signal-to-noise, high spectral resolution spectroscopy drawn from the LEGA-C DR3 together with the broadband photometry from the UltraVISTA catalog. Galaxy sizes were measured by fitting a 2D S{\'e}rsic profile to the HST ACS~F814W images. We find diverse SFHs and quenching timescales ($\tau_\rm{q}$). The main quiescent population quenched over $\tau_\rm{q}=1.23\pm0.04$ Gyr, whereas compact post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) quenched much faster, $\tau_\rm{q}=0.13\pm0.03$ Gyr. At fixed stellar mass, smaller quiescent galaxies quenched more rapidly than larger ones; at fixed size, the dependence on stellar mass is weak. Larger quiescent galaxies are marginally younger, quenched more slowly, and have near-solar metallicities, while compact quiescent galaxies are older, metal-rich, and quenched faster. PSBs formed half their mass later ($z_\rm{form}\sim1.9$) and quenched on the shortest timescales. The general trends with galaxy size, $Z_\star$, and $z_\rm{form}$ for the quiescent populations remain consistent regardless of the method used to derive the stellar properties. We conclude that compact quiescent galaxies are consistent with both early, moderately fast quenching and with more rapid, late quenching. While this may suggest the existence of multiple quenching channels, our data are also compatible with a continuous distribution of quenching timescales. These findings suggest that different physical mechanisms may drive quenching across galaxy populations, potentially leading to similar morphological outcomes despite differing evolutionary histories.</description>

      <title>Isotopomer-Specific Carbon Isotope Ratio of Complex Organic Molecules in Star-Forming Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\sim$ 10 $\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($&gt;$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.</description>

      <title>MAUVE-MUSE: A Star Formation-driven Outflow Caught in the Act of Quenching the Stripped Virgo Galaxy NGC 4064</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid quenching of satellite galaxies in dense environments is often attributed to environmental processes such as ram pressure stripping. However, stripping alone cannot fully account for the removal of dense, star-forming gas in many satellites, particularly in their inner regions. Recent models and indirect observations have suggested that star formation-driven outflows may play a critical role in expelling this remaining gas, yet direct evidence for such feedback-driven quenching remains limited. Here we report the discovery of an ionized gas outflow in NGC 4064, a Virgo cluster satellite that has already lost most of its cold gas through environmental stripping. MUSE observations from the Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE) survey reveal a bi-polar outflow driven by residual, centrally concentrated star formation in NGC 4064 - despite its current star formation rate being ~0.4 dex below the star-forming main sequence due to prior interaction with the cluster environment. The outflow's mass loading factor is ~2, suggesting that stellar feedback could remove the remaining gas on timescales shorter than those required for depletion by star formation alone. These results demonstrate that even modest but centrally concentrated star formation can drive efficient feedback in stripped satellites, accelerating quenching in the final stages of their evolution.</description>

      <title>Stellar masses and mass ratios for Gaia open cluster members</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Unresolved binaries in star clusters can bias stellar and cluster mass estimates, making their proper treatment essential for studying cluster dynamics and evolution. Aims: We aim to develop a fast and robust framework for jointly deriving stellar masses and multiplicity statistics of member stars, together with optimal cluster parameters. Methods: We use Gaia DR3 parallaxes together with multi-band photometry of open cluster (OC) members to infer stellar masses and binary mass-ratios through simulation-based inference (SBI), while iteratively fitting the cluster parameters. The validation of our SBI framework on simulated clusters demonstrates that the inclusion of infrared photometry significantly improves the detection of low mass-ratio binaries. The minimum mass-ratio threshold for reliably identifying unresolved binaries depends on cluster properties and the available photometry, but typically lies below $q=0.5$. Results: Applying our method to 42 well-populated OCs, we derive a catalogue of stellar masses and mass-ratios for 27201 stars, achieving typical uncertainties of 0.08 in $q$ and $0.01\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in the primary stellar mass. We analyse the archetype OCs M67 and NGC 2360 in detail, including mass segregation and mass-ratio distribution among other characteristics, while deriving multiplicity fractions for the rest of the sample. We find evidence that the high mass-ratio ($q\geq 0.6$) binary fraction shows a strong correlation with the age and a weak anti-correlation with the cluster metallicity. Furthermore, the variation of the binary fraction with stellar mass in OCs shows strong accordance with the observed dependence for field stars heavier than $\gtrsim0.6\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Conclusions: Our work paves a path for future population-level investigations of multiplicity statistics and precision stellar masses in extended samples of OCs.</description>

      <title>OutLines: Modeling Spectral Lines from Winds, Bubbles, and Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common methods for studying the kinematics and geometry of outflowing gas rely on modeling emission and absorption lines in integrated spectra using methods that are not physically motivated, including empirical quantiles or fitting multiple Gaussian or Voigt profiles. Such methods are not always consistent with the interpretation of these features and, as a result, miss key underlying physics and can even lead to inaccurate interpretations of observations. To address this problem, we present the publicly available python code OutLines, which provides astrophysical models of spectral emission and absorption line profiles produced by outflows in a variety of environments. The OutLines code accounts for differences in parameterization of the velocity field and density profile while allowing for different outflow geometries, making OutLines versatile and useful for a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. We demonstrate the wide applicability of OutLines by using the code to model line profiles in an H II region knot, super star clusters, a starburst galaxy, and an AGN. In each of these contexts, we illustrate how OutLines can illuminate key underlying physics in ways that improve our scientific understanding and address important open questions in astronomy, including the key mechanisms in the baryon cycle, the evolution of H II regions and galaxies, and even Lyman continuum escape. OutLines will be a critical resource as massively multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like WEAVE-LOFAR and 4MOST/WAVES come online, providing the means to probe feedback kinematics with deeper, higher resolution spectroscopy for unprecedented large samples of galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are typically discovered in previously quiescent galaxies. However, earlier studies have revealed a handful of TDEs occurring in pre-existing active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We discuss AT2019aalc, a promising TDE candidate in an AGN, and compare it to similar sources. We also explore Bowen fluorescence flares, a newly identified class of flaring supermassive black holes, as potential members of the TDE in AGN transient class. We aim to connect the observed properties of these flares with the expectations of TDE-in-AGN simulations.</description>

      <title>Chemical enrichment in LINERs from MaNGA. II. Characterizing the shape of their radial metallicity gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical abundance radial gradients provide key information on how the processes that affect chemical enrichment of the gas-phase interstellar medium (ISM) act at different galaxy scales. Whereas in the last decades there has been an increase in the number of galaxies studied with integral field spectroscopy, there is still not a clear picture on a subsequent characterization of the chemical abundance radial gradients in galaxies hosting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This lack of analysis is even more accentuated in the case of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). For the first time, we analyze the chemical abundance radial gradients in a sample of LINER-like galaxies, whose nuclear emission has been previously (Paper I) discussed. We use a sample of 97 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA), whose nuclear regions show LINER-like emission. We use the open-source code HII-CHI-Mistry to estimate the chemical abundance ratios 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) in the HII regions across the disks in our sample, as well as in the nuclear parts where the LINER-like activity dominates. To fit the radial profiles we use a piecewise methodology which uses a non-fixed number of breaks to find the best fit for the data. We obtain that majority of our sample of galaxies exhibits departures from the single linear gradient both in 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) (as expected from the inside-out scenario). We investigate whether these departures are driven by galaxy properties (stellar mass, neutral gas mass, stellar velocity dispersion), finding not correlation at all. We also report that in most cases there is no correlation between the shape of the 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) radial profiles. We propose a model in which AGN (feed)back, acting at different scales depending on the galaxy and its evolutionary stage, might be responsible for these departures.</description>

      <title>Pressure and Star Formation in LITTLE THINGS Dwarf Irregular Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface densities of star formation, Sigma_SFR, in 24 dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS survey are combined with gas surface densities and midplane pressures to examine the correlations found previously for spiral galaxies. The pressure is the weight of the disk inside the gas layer, including gas, stars, and dark matter, which usually dominates disk gravity in dIrrs. We compare the results to the outer part of M33, which has similar local properties but a slightly higher metallicity, enabling the detection of CO. All the data are convolved to the HI beam, but to study the effects of resolution, the galaxies are examined first with average radial profiles, and then with maps having 1.5" pixels and 244 pc pixels. The correlations are found to be independent of resolution from 24 pc to 424 pc. The average ratio of molecular to atomic surface density is estimated to be 0.23+-0.1, from the H_2 surface density in M33 compared to the HI surface density at the same Sigma_SFR in the dIrrs. With this ratio, the average star formation rate per molecule is about the same for all the dIrrs, and a factor of 2 less than the rate in M33. The pressure in dIrrs is so low that CO is essentially a dense gas tracer, with the same surface density threshold at the low metallicities of dIrrs as HCN has in spiral galaxies. As a result, CO regions in dIrrs should be strongly self-gravitating.</description>

      <title>A remarkable Gaia-assisted discovery of a temporally varying, triple-lensed quasar at z=2.67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed quasars are viable cosmic tools for constraining a diversity of fundamental astrophysical phenomena; They enable identification of faint, low-mass supermassive black holes, provide unique constraints on the intervening intergalactic or interstellar medium in their sightlines, and can be used to determine key cosmological quantities such as the Hubble constant, $H_0$. However, they are rare phenomena, and it has proven difficult to define efficient, unbiased selection methods.} In this study, we report the spectroscopic identification of a remarkable triple-lensed quasar system at $z=2.67$, identified based on its astrometric measurements from the {\em Gaia} mission, as well as a larger spectroscopic follow-up survey of {\em Gaia}-detected candidate lensed quasars. We characterize in detail the three mirror images of the quasar and their spatial and temporal spectroscopic coverage, with focus on the emission-line properties which shows variation across sigthlines and temporal evolution over the $\sim 11$months spectroscopic campaign. We construct a lens model of the foreground source from a combination of the multiple spectra and deep optical imaging, providing a robust halo mass of $M_{\rm h} = (2.78 \pm 0.05)\times 10^{10}M_\odot$. Based on the lens model, the time delay between each sightline is translated into an intrinsic quasar time, allowing us to construct a quasar timeseries over $\sim18$months with monthly cadence. Over months timescales the broad emission lines vary in both velocity offset and equivalent width (EW) as well as an overall increase in ionization. This exemplary triple-lensed quasars demonstrates the viability of identifying such rare lens configurations based purely on the astrometric measurements from the {\em Gaia} mission, which we here provide optimized selection criteria for, for future studies.</description>

      <title>Resolving the ionizing photon budget crisis with JWST/NIRCam HII clumping constraints at z=6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the ionizing properties of 1721 galaxies at $5.6&lt;z&lt;6.5$ using deep JWST/NIRCam photometric imaging from the NEP, JADES, and PRIMER surveys spanning an unmasked area $\sim550$arcmin$^2$ across UV magnitudes $-22\lesssim M_{\rm UV}\lesssim-17.5$. Our $90\%$ stellar mass complete sample suggests little relation of UV slope with magnitude, $\beta_{\rm UV}=(-0.040\pm0.022)M_{\rm UV}-2.88^{+0.43}_{-0.44}$, implying $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}\simeq5\%$ based on calibrations from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS). We measure a constant ionizing photon production efficiency with UV magnitude, $\log_{10}(\xi_{\rm ion, 0}/\rm Hz\,erg^{-1}) = -0.006^{+0.019}_{-0.017}~M_{\rm UV} + 25.05^{+0.39}_{-0.34}$, consistent with HST canonical values. The total production rate of photons escaping into the IGM is computed as $\log_{10}(\dot{n}_{\rm ion}/\rm s^{-1}Mpc^{-3})=50.31^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ for $M_{\rm UV}&lt;-17$ galaxies from our star forming and smouldering UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), which differ in the faint-end slope ($\alpha_{\rm SFG}=-2.2\pm0.2$; $\alpha_{\rm sm}=-1.7\pm0.2$). Extrapolating to the latest UVLF turnover limits from the massive lensing galaxy cluster Abell S1063 ($M_{\rm UV, lim}=-13.5$) implies that a recombination-weighted HII clumping factor $C_{\rm HII, rec}=6.2^{+4.1}_{-2.1}$ is required to produce fully stably reionized at $z\simeq6$. A clumping factor of this magnitude resolves the ionizing photon budget crisis. Our methodology paves the way for indirect clumping measurements from galaxies which will provide insight into earlier stages of the EoR when the Ly$\alpha$-forest becomes saturated and more direct quasar measurements become impossible.</description>

      <title>Weighing the Milky Way's Satellite Galaxies Using Pulsar Accelerations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way (MW) are useful for testing models of the formation of our Galaxy, and by extension various theories of cosmology. Recent efforts to measure the masses of the MW's satellite dwarf galaxies have relied on the motions and positions of stars in the MW's disk and halo, which are perturbed by the passage of satellite galaxies. As there are many known processes in our Galaxy that lead to observed disequilibrium in stars, these kinematic methods have been limited by the inherent difficulty in identifying only the perturbations due to particular satellite galaxies. We present a novel method for determining the masses of two MW satellite galaxies -- the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Sgr dSph) -- using only direct, instantaneous acceleration data derived from extremely precise timing of millisecond pulsars near the Sun. As the LMC and Sgr dSph orbit the MW, they cause wave-like distortions in the structure of the disk plus a large-scale offset in the centers of mass of the dark matter halo and the baryonic disk. These two effects lead to asymmetric accelerations above and below the disk midplane near the Sun, which is observed in the pulsar acceleration data. Notably, the amplitude of this asymmetry is shown to depend on the masses of the orbiting satellites. We analyze a grid of simulations with varying masses of each satellite. We find the total (dark + baryon) mass enclosed within the tidal radius at the present day for the LMC to be 4.1 $\pm$ 1.0 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ within a radius of 16.6 kpc, and for Sgr to be 3.5 $\pm$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^8$ M$_\odot$ within a radius of 5 kpc. These results are generally consistent and competitive with previous determinations of the masses of these objects, but entirely independent of any stellar kinematic data for the first time.</description>

      <title>Signatures of star formation inside galactic outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations have suggested that galactic outflows contain substantial amounts of dense and clumpy molecular gas, creating favourable conditions for igniting star formation. Indeed, theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations have suggested that stars could form within galactic outflows, representing a new mode of star-formation that differs significantly from the typical star formation in star forming discs. In this paper, we examine 12 local galaxies with powerful Active Galactic Nuclei and high star-formation rate using spectroscopic data from the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. We investigate the excitation mechanism and physical properties of these outflows via spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams (along with tests to rule out contribution by shocks and external photoionisation). Out of the seven galaxies with clearly detected outflows, we find robust evidence for star formation within the outflow of one galaxy (IRAS 20551-4250), with two additional galaxies showing tentative signs (IRAS 13120-5453 and F13229-2934). Therefore, our findings support previous results that star formation inside outflows can be a relatively common phenomenon among these active galaxies and may have played an important role in the formation and evolution of the spheroidal component of galaxies.</description>

      <title>CWTHF: Subhalo Identification with Continuous Wavelet Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With advances in cosmology and computer science, cosmological simulations now resolve structures in increasingly fine detail. As key tracers of hierarchical structure formation, subhalos are among the most important objects within these simulations. In our previous work, we established that the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) can effectively extract clustering information and serve as a robust halo finder. Here, we extend the CWT framework to subhalo identification by adapting the CWTHF (Continuous Wavelet Transform Halo Finder) code. This extension extends the unbinding procedure, which enables the reliable identification of gravitationally bound substructures. The algorithm identifies density peaks within known halos or subhalos and segments the surrounding volume accordingly. Once a new subhalo is registered, its position is recorded to prevent duplicate detection. We validate our approach using the TNG50-2 and TNG100-1 simulations, as well as a single Friends-of-Friends (FOF) halo, by comparing the resulting CWT catalog against the reference SUBFIND catalog. Because the method inherits the original computational framework, our subhalo finder maintains a favorable linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$.</description>

      <title>UV Luminosity Functions from HST and JWST: A Possible Resolution to the High-Redshift Galaxy Abundance Puzzle and Implications for Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of high redshift galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope suggest the presence of a bright population of galaxies that is more abundant than predicted by most galaxy formation models. These observations have led to a rethinking of these models, and numerous astrophysical and cosmological solutions have been proposed, including cosmic strings, topological defects that may be remnants of a specific phase transition in the very early moments of the Universe. In this paper, we integrate cosmic strings, a source of nonlinear and non-Gaussian perturbations, into the semi analytical code Zeus21, allowing us to efficiently predict the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF). We conduct a precise study of parameter degeneracies between star-formation astrophysics and cosmic-string phenomenology. Our results suggest that cosmic strings can boost the early-galaxy abundance enough to explain the measured UVLFs from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes from redshift z = 4 to z = 17 without modifying the star-formation physics. In addition, we set a new upper bound on the string tension of $G\mu \lessapprox 10^{-8}$ ($95\%$ credibility), improving upon previous limits from the cosmic microwave background. Although with current data there is some level of model and prior dependence to this limit, it suggests that UVLFs are a promising avenue for future observational constraints on cosmic-string physics.</description>

      <title>The Space-Based Time-Domain Revolution in Astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based time-domain telescopes such as CoRoT, Kepler/K2 and TESS have profoundly impacted astrophysics over the past two decades. Continuous light curves with high cadence and high photometric precision are now available for millions of sources within our galaxy and beyond. In addition to revolutionizing exoplanet science, the data have enabled breakthroughs ranging from the solar system to stellar interiors, the transient universe, and active galaxies. The key summary points of this review are: (1) Stellar astrophysics has been transformed by the ability to probe the internal structures of stars, test the physics of stellar convection, connect stellar rotation and magnetic activity, and reveal complex variability in young stars. (2) Ages of stellar populations probe the formation history of our Milky Way, and binary star variability enables the detection of "dark" galactic populations such as solar-mass black holes and neutron stars. (3) Early-time observations of explosive transients provide new insights into the progenitors of supernovae, while the quasi-periodic variability of galaxies probes the physics of accretion processes onto supermassive black holes and the tidal disruption of stars. (4) Observations of solar system objects reveal asteroid compositions through their rotation periods and amplitudes, constrain the cloud structure of ice giants, and allow the discovery of new objects in the outer solar system. (5) Open data policies and software have contributed to remarkable scientific productivity and enabled discoveries by citizen scientists, including new exoplanets and exotic variability in mature Sun-like stars.</description>

      <title>Detailed Chemical Abundance Analysis of the Brightest Stars in the Turranburra and Willka Yaku Stellar Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of the three brightest known stars from each of the Turranburra and Willka Yaku stellar streams using high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra. Abundances for 27 elements, ranging from carbon to dysprosium, were derived. Our results support the original classification that Turranburra, with a low average metallicity of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]=-2.45} \pm 0.07$, likely originates from a dwarf-galaxy progenitor. Willka Yaku has a low average metallicity of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]=-2.35 \pm 0.03}$ with a small scatter in the abundances, consistent with a globular cluster progenitor as suggested by previous studies. Both streams exhibit mild enhancements in neutron-capture elements, with averages of $\mathrm{[Eu II/Fe]}=$ $0.47 \pm{0.09}$ for Turranburra and $0.44 \pm{0.05}$ for Willka Yaku, consistent with enrichment from an $r$-process event. A similar enrichment is observed in other stellar streams, and we further discuss this signature as it relates to the potential enrichment histories of these two streams.</description>

      <title>Stellar properties and chemical features of the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars observed by GALAH DR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS) comprises approximately 330 000 stars within 100 pc of the Sun, as observed by Gaia data release 3 (Gaia DR3). Meanwhile, the GALAH DR4 survey has spectroscopically characterised nearly one million stars, delivering detailed chemical abundances (up to 30 elements). We present a joint analysis of the $\sim$ 6 000 stars common to both catalogues, offering initial insights into the stellar and chemical properties of the solar neighborhood. Our preliminary results indicate that the majority of these stars are FGK main-sequence objects, with some A-type interlopers (with effective temperatures ranging between 3 000 and 8 000 K), with median ages of $\sim$ 1.6 Gyr (ranging from 0.10 to 14.79 Gyr), and metal-poorer when compared to the Sun: [Fe/H] $\approx$ -0.19 dex. Additionally, most of the stars are disc members, with some local halo (high-velocity) stars identified. Building on this foundation, future work will deeper exploit the full spectroscopic information and orbital parameters from value-added catalogues to refine Galactic component classifications (thin-thick disc versus halo membership), perform detailed chemical profiling, and deliver a comprehensive chemo-dynamical characterisation of the solar neighborhood. This will provide new insights into the formation and evolution of nearby stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Spectrally Resolved Gas Kinematics in Cygnus A: XRISM Detects AGN Jet-induced Velocity Dispersion in Multi-temperature Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report spectral analysis on a 170 ks XRISM \textit{Resolve} exposure of the core of Cygnus A. Analyzing the full field of view spectrum in the $1.7-12.0$ keV band, we find evidence for two-temperature cluster gas. The hotter ($kT = 5.53 \pm 0.13$ keV) gas has a velocity dispersion of $261 \pm 13$ km s$^{-1}$ and a bulk velocity of $120 \pm 20$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the central galaxy. The cooler gas ($kT = 2.0^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ keV) has an even broader velocity dispersion of $440 \pm 130$ km s$^{-1}$, with a systematic uncertainty of $120$ km s$^{-1}$. The relative line-of-sight velocity between the hotter and cooler gas can be as high as $450 \pm 140$ km s$^{-1}$. We interpret the high velocity dispersions as a combination of turbulence and bulk motion due to the cocoon shock. The upper limit on the non-thermal pressure fraction for the hotter gas is $7.7 \pm 0.7\%$. We associate the cooler gas with the central region ($&lt;35$ kpc) and the hotter phase with the gas surrounding it ($35-100$ kpc). The total energy due to the kinetic motion is $5.1 \times 10^{60}$ erg, consistent with the energy associated with the central radio source. The kinetic energy injection rate is $6.9 \times 10^{44}-7.4 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ under varying assumptions of injection timescales. The range of injection power is higher than the cooling luminosity, and thus the heating and cooling rates in Cygnus A are unbalanced.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Phase-Space and Field-Level Cosmology: The Strength of Semi-Analytic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-analytic models are a widely used approach to simulate galaxy properties within a cosmological framework, relying on simplified yet physically motivated prescriptions. They have also proven to be an efficient alternative for generating accurate galaxy catalogs, offering a faster and less computationally expensive option compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that using only galaxy $3$D positions and radial velocities, we can train a graph neural network coupled to a moment neural network to obtain a robust machine learning based model capable of estimating the matter density parameters, $\Omega_{\rm m}$, with a precision of approximately 10%. The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations. This suggests that the physical relationships encoded in the phase-space of semi-analytic models are largely independent of their specific physical prescriptions, reinforcing their potential as tools for the generation of realistic mock catalogs for cosmological parameter inference.</description>

Abstract: Precise stellar parameters for M-type stars, the Galaxy's most common stellar type, are crucial for numerous studies. In this work, we refined the LAMOST DR10 M-type star catalog through a two-stage process. First, we purified the catalog using techniques including deep learning and color-magnitude diagrams to remove 22,496 non-M spectra, correct 2,078 dwarf/giant classifications, and update 12,900 radial velocities. This resulted in a cleaner catalog containing 870,518 M-type spectra (820,493 dwarfs, 50,025 giants). Second, applying a label transfer strategy using values from APOGEE DR16 for parameter prediction with a ten-fold cross-validated CNN ensemble architecture, we predicted $T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, [M/H], and [$\alpha$/M] separately for M dwarfs and giants. The average internal errors for M dwarfs/giants are respectively: $T_\text{eff}$ 30/17 K, log $g$ 0.07/0.07 dex, [M/H] 0.07/0.05 dex, and [$\alpha$/M] 0.02/0.02 dex. Comparison with APOGEE demonstrates external precisions of 34/14 K, 0.12/0.07 dex, 0.09/0.04 dex, and 0.03/0.02 dex for M dwarfs/giants, which represents precision improvements of over 20\% for M dwarfs and over 50\% for M giants compared to previous literature results.

      <title>FAUST XXX: Dust enhancement in the young binary L1551 IRS 5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young binary stars with discs provide unique laboratories to study the earliest stages of planet formation in star-forming environments. The detection of substructure in discs around Class I protostars challenges current models of disc evolution, suggesting that planets may form earlier than previously expected ($&lt;1$ Myr). In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present observations of the circumbinary disc (CBD) around the young binary system L1551 IRS 5. The CBD exhibits two prominent over-densities in the continuum emission at the edge of the cavity, with the Northern over-density being about 20% brighter than the Southern one. By analysing the disc morphology and kinematics of L1551 IRS 5, we delineate dynamical constraints on the binary's orbital parameters. Additionally, we present 3D hydrodynamical models of the CBD to predict both the dust and the gas surface densities. Then, we compare the resulting synthetic observations with ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.3 mm and the C$^{18}$O line emission. Our analysis suggests that the density enhancements observed with ALMA in L1551 IRS 5 can be caused by interactions between the binary stars and the CBD, leading to dust concentration within the disc. We conclude that the observed over-density corresponds to a location where could potentially grow under favourable conditions.</description>

      <title>Evidence of galaxy cluster rotation in the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first robust evidence for the rotational kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (rkSZ) effect, produced by the Thomson scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons off rotating intracluster gas. By combining CMB intensity and polarization measurements from the $\it{Planck}$ satellite with spectroscopic member-galaxy redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in a sample of 25 X-ray cross-matched, low-redshift ($0.02&lt; z&lt; 0.09)$, massive ($10^{13.9}\lesssim M_{\rm 500c}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{14.6}$) galaxy clusters, we detect a dipolar rkSZ signature aligned with the estimated rotation direction of each cluster, ruling out a chance fluctuation at 99.98% confidence (3.6$\sigma$). The significance of this measurement is enhanced by several new methodological improvements for isolating the rkSZ signal from primary CMB fluctuations and noise. The amplitude and shape of the signal are qualitatively consistent with predictions from state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations. These results establish a new tool with which to probe the dynamical state of galaxy clusters using CMB data.</description>

      <title>Duration and properties of the embedded phase of star formation in 37 nearby galaxies from PHANGS-JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light reprocessed by dust grains emitting in the infrared allows the study of the physics at play in dusty, embedded regions, where ultraviolet and optical wavelengths are attenuated. Infrared telescopes such as JWST have made it possible to study the earliest feedback phases, when stars are shielded by cocoons of gas and dust. This phase is crucial for unravelling the effects of feedback from young stars, leading to their emergence and the dispersal of their host molecular clouds. Here we show that the transition from the embedded to the exposed phase of star formation is short (&lt; 4 Myr) and sometimes almost absent (&lt; 1 Myr), across a sample of 37 nearby star-forming galaxies, covering a wide range of morphologies from massive barred spirals to irregular dwarfs. The short duration of the dust-clearing timescales suggests a predominant role of pre-supernova feedback mechanisms in revealing newborn stars, confirming previous results on smaller samples and allowing, for the first time, a statistical analysis of their dependencies. We find that the timescales associated with mid-infrared emission at 21 {\mu}m, tracing a dust-embedded feedback phase, are controlled by a complex interplay between giant molecular cloud properties (masses and velocity dispersions) and galaxy morphology. We report relatively longer durations of the embedded phase of star formation in barred spiral galaxies, while this phase is significantly reduced in low-mass irregular dwarf galaxies. We discuss tentative trends with gas-phase metallicity, which may favor faster cloud dispersal at low metallicities.</description>

      <title>Earliest Galaxy Evolution in the CANUCS+Technicolor fields: Galaxy Properties at $z\sim10-16$ seen with the Full NIRCam Medium and Broad Band Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sample of $z_{\rm phot}\sim10-16$ galaxies by exploiting one of the richest JWST NIRCam imaging data, taken in the CANUCS survey in Cycle 1 and the Technicolor (TEC) survey in Cycle 2. The combination of the CANUCS+TEC provides multi-epoch, deep NIRCam images in all medium bands (MBs) and broad bands (BBs) onboard NIRCam (22 filters in total), over $\sim23\ {\rm arcmin}^2$ in three independent lines of sight. We select high-$z$ galaxy candidates based on photometric redshifts, and obtain eight candidates at $z\sim10-16$, including a very robust candidate at $z\sim15.4$. The ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) from our sample is consistent with previous JWST studies showing a scatter of $\sim0.6$ dex across the literature, marking the significance of the field-to-field variance in interpreting galaxy abundance measurements at $z&gt;10$. We find that the UV LF moderately evolves at $z&gt;10$, and the LF normalization and the luminosity density decline by a factor of $\sim7$ from $z\sim11$ to $z\sim15$, indicating less steep evolution than $z&lt;11$. We highlight the importance of MB filters, not only to minimize the contamination by low-$z$ interlopers but also to maximize the completeness. In particular, faint and less blue galaxies could be missed when the sample is built solely on BB data. The contamination and incompleteness of BB-only selected samples can bias our views of earliest galaxy evolution at $z&gt;10$, including the UV LF by $\sim0.6$ dex, the size-magnitude relation by $\sim0.6$ dex, and the UV slope-magnitude relation by $\Delta\beta_{\rm UV}\sim-0.3$.</description>

      <title>The z = 9.625 Cosmic Gems Galaxy was a "Compact Blue Monster" Propelled by Massive Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of five massive stellar clusters at z=9.625 in the Cosmic Gems has raised the question about the formation mechanism of star clusters in the first half Gyr after the Big-Bang. We infer the total stellar mass in clusters by normalizing and integrating the stellar cluster mass function (SCMF, dn(M)/dM ~ (n$_0$) $M^\beta$), assuming three different slopes $\beta$ = -1.5, -2.0 and -2.5 and different lower-mass limits between $10^2$ and $10^5$ Msun. The total integrated cluster stellar mass is compared to the stellar mass inferred from the counter-image of the Cosmic Gems, which provides the best, modestly magnified ($\mu$ = 1.84$\pm$0.05) representation of the entire galaxy. The delensed stellar mass of the Cosmic Gems galaxy is estimated as 3.5$_{-1.8}^{+3.3}$ x$10^7$ Msun, with an effective radius of Reff = 103$_{-15}^{+13}$ parsec and a stellar surface mass density of $\Sigma$mass = 520$_{-225}^{+340}$ Msun pc$^{-2}$. Accounting for normalization uncertainties - including different lensing magnification scenarios for the arc - a modified SCMF, combined with a significantly high star cluster formation efficiency (approaching 100%), appears to be a necessary condition to explain the relatively short formation timescale of both the star clusters and the counter-image, without exceeding the galaxy's stellar mass. By extrapolating the physical properties at the peak of the burst we find that in its recent past (&lt;~ 30 Myr) the Cosmic Gems galaxy has likely experienced a specific star formation rate (sSFR) exceeding 25 Gyr$^{-1}$ and luminosity approaching the ``blue monster'' regime (M$_{UV}$ &lt; -20). Our study provides insights into the extreme clustered nature of star formation in early galaxies and shed light into the formation of bound star clusters that might survive to z = 0 as globular clusters, older than 13 Gyr.</description>

      <title>The FAST-SETI Milky Way Globular Cluster Survey I: A Pilot Multibeam On-the-Fly Search of Five Globular Clusters at L-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a narrowband technosignature search toward five Milky Way globular clusters (NGC 6171, NGC 6218, NGC 6254, NGC 6838, and IC 1276) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) 19-beam L-band receiver (1.05-1.45 GHz). We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| &lt;= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N &gt;= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Medium in Extremely High Star-Formation Regions: A Prospect of Observations on the Millimetron Space Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High star-formation rate and active galactic nucleus' emission can significantly transform the interstellar medium. In ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, in which the star-formation rate reaches thousands of solar masses per year, the gas and dust are considerably affected by the ionizing radiation, cosmic rays and shock waves, that can be about a factor of 100--1000 larger than typical values in quiet star-forming galaxies. In these conditions, the emissivity of the gas and dust changes: in dense gas, high ionic and molecular transitions become excited, while dust grains are heated to high temperatures. In this paper, we analyze the possibilities for studying the interstellar medium in extreme conditions of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies at redshifts of $\sim 0-3$, utilizing the atomic and molecular lines, and dust continuum in far infrared range of $100-500\mu$m. We discuss the prospect of observations using the instruments of the Millimetron Space Observatory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first data release (DR1) of the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey, a mapping in the J=(1-0) transition lines of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O toward the northern Galactic plane during 2011-2022. The MWISP survey was conducted using the PMO 13.7 m telescope at a spatial resolution of approximately 50" and a velocity resolution of 0.16 km/s at 115 GHz. DR1 fully covered 2310 square degrees within the Galactic longitude (l) and latitude (b) range of 9.75 deg =&lt; l =&lt; 229.75 deg and |b| =&lt; 5.25 deg. The surveyed area was divided into cell units of 30'x30' for practical purposes and On-The-Fly (OTF) mapping was performed toward each target cell unit. The data were regridded into a regular 3D datacube in l-b-V_LSR with a pixel size of 30" in l-b axes and 0.16 km/s in theV_LSR axis. The median rms noise is 0.47 K, 0.25 K, and 0.25 K for 12CO, 13CO, and C18O, respectively. The equivalent 3 sigma sensitivity in 12CO luminosity is approximately 0.23 K km/s, making MWISP the most sensitive survey of its kind. In this paper, we describe the survey data, including the calibration, data cleaning, data mosaic processes, and the data products. The final mosaicked data cubes contain about 3.33x10^7 spectra (pixels) for each CO isotopologue line. Color composite images, made from the intensities of the isotopologue lines, and some concise descriptions are provided. We constructed a molecular cloud catalog based on the mosaicked 12CO data cube using the clustering algorithm DBSCAN, detecting 103,517 molecular clouds, 10,790 of which exhibit 13CO emission and 304 of which show C18O emission. Based on the histogram of voxel brightness temperature, we estimated a total 12CO flux of 7.69+/-0.38x10^7 K km/s arcmin^2, 82% of which is captured by the DBSCAN algorithm. The data, together with the cloud sample, provide unique information on molecular gas in the northern Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Clumpy, dense gas in the outflow of NGC 1266</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outflows are one of the most spectacular mechanisms through which active galactic nuclei (AGN) impact their host galaxy, though the role of AGN-driven outflows in global star formation regulation across the galaxy population is unclear. NGC 1266 is an excellent case study for investigating the outflows and star formation quenching because it is a nearby (D\sim30 Mpc) AGN host galaxy with an outflow driving shocks through the interstellar medium (ISM) and has recently quenched its star formation outside the nucleus. While previous works have studied the molecular outflow from its CO emission, to fully characterize the impact the outflow has on the ISM observations probing the dense, cold gas are necessary. Our ALMA cycle 0 observations do not detect a molecular outflow in 13CO(2-1) and yield a lower limit 12CO/13CO \geq 250, suggesting a highly optically thin CO outflow with low 13CO abundance. In contrast, we detect substantial HCN(1-0) emission in the outflow, with an HCN(1-0)/12CO(1-0) ratio of 0.09, consistent with global measurements of many star-forming galaxies and Luminous InfraRed Galaxies (LIRGs). We conclude that the CO emission traces a diffuse component of the molecular gas with a low optical depth, whereas the HCN(1-0) traces dense clumps of gas entrained in the outflow. We measure an upper limit molecular outflow rate of &lt; 85 Msun/yr. Assuming the ongoing nuclear star formation and outflow continue at the same rates, NGC 1266 will deplete its gas reservoirs in 450 Myr or longer, indicating that relatively low-level AGN feedback is capable of gradually expelling the molecular gas reservoir after a rapid quenching event.</description>

Abstract: We report on an international scientific conference, where we brought together African and European academic astronomers. This aimed to bridge the gap between those in position of privilege, with ease of access to international events (i.e., the typical experience of academics in Western institutions), with those historically excluded (affecting the majority of African scientists/institutions). We describe how we designed the conference around cutting-edge research problems, but with a parallel focus on building networking and professional relationships. Significant effort went into: (1) ensuring a diversity of participants; (2) practically and financially supporting those who may never have attended an international conference and; (3) creating an inclusive and supportive environment through a careful programme of activities, both before and during the event. Maintaining scientific integrity was a core commitment throughout. We summarise successes, challenges and lessons learnt from organising this conference. We also present feedback obtained from participants immediately after the conference, and a discussion of some longer-term impacts, which we identified around 1 year later. We found an overall achievement of our objectives, and multiple longer-term benefits. With this report we provide some key recommendations for groups, from any research field, who may wish to lead similar initiatives.</description>

      <title>Caustic fringes for wave dark matter</title>

Abstract: Wave dark matter is composed of particles sufficiently light that their de Broglie wavelength exceeds the average inter-particle separation. A typical wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference. In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Thermodynamics: Established Results, Unresolved Paradoxes, and Speculative Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Between 1972 and 1975, Jacob Bekenstein proposed that black holes possess entropy proportional to their horizon area, and Stephen Hawking derived this relationship from semiclassical quantum field theory in curved spacetime, predicting thermal radiation from black holes. These developments established black hole thermodynamics as a formal framework connecting general relativity, quantum mechanics, and statistical physics. However, this synthesis rests on approximations whose validity remains unproven in regimes where quantum gravitational effects become important. This article provides a detailed overview of the historical development from 1972 to 1975 and surveys modern proposals, such as the holographic principle and gravitational path integrals. We highlight persistent theoretical challenges, including the information paradox, the trans-Planckian problem, backreaction effects, and the absence of experimental verification. The work concludes by identifying which aspects of black hole thermodynamics are well-established and which remain speculative or fundamentally incomplete.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity distribution of extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present realistic eccentricity distributions for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) forming via the two-body relaxation channel in nuclear star clusters, tracking their evolution up to the final plunge onto the central Schwarzschild massive black hole (MBH). We find that EMRIs can retain significant eccentricities at plunge, with a distribution peaking at $e_\mathrm{pl} \approx0.2$, and a considerable fraction reaching much higher values. In particular, up to $20\%$ of the forming EMRIs feature $e_\mathrm{pl} &gt; 0.5$ for central MBH masses $M_\bullet$ in the range $10^5 \mathrm{M_\odot} \leq M_\bullet \leq 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$, partially due to EMRIs forming at large semi-major axes and "cliffhanger EMRI", usually neglected in literature. This highlights the importance of accounting for eccentricity in waveform modeling and detection strategies for future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Furthermore, we find that the numerical fluxes in energy and angular momentum currently implemented in the FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) package may not adequately sample the full parameter space relevant to low-mass MBHs ($M_\bullet &lt; 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$), potentially limiting its predictive power in that regime. Specifically, for $M_\bullet=10^5 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ we find that about $75\%$ ($50 \%$) of EMRIs at 2 years (6 months) from plunge fall outside the currently available flux parameter space. Our findings motivate the development of extended flux grids and improved interpolation schemes to enable accurate modeling of EMRIs across a broader range of system parameters.</description>

      <title>Self-lensing of moving gravitational-wave sources can break the microlensing crossing timescale degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a moving gravitational-wave (GW) source travels behind a massive astrophysical object, its signal is gravitationally lensed, showing a waveform distortion similar to a Paczy\'{n}ski curve. We present a first study of the lensing signature of a massive black hole (MBH) on a frequency-dependent GW signal from a moving binary merger. For both light and GW sources in a Keplerian circular orbit around a MBH lens, the self-lensing geometry breaks the microlensing degeneracy in the Einstein radius crossing timescale $t_{\rm E}$. The duration of the curve ($2 t_{\rm E}$) becomes independent on the MBH mass $M_{\rm MBH}$, and provides a direct measure of the distance $d_{\rm LS}$ to the MBH. However, $M_{\rm MBH}$ remains unknown. We show that, in GW signals, the redshifted mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ can additionally be obtained from the interference pattern, by measuring the modulation period $T$, the GW frequency $f$, and $t_{\rm E}$: $M_{{\rm MBH},z}\simeq 2.5\times 10^6\,M_\odot\,(t_{\rm E}/[100\,{\rm s}])\,(f\,T)^{-1}$. If this lensing signature is not considered, it may be confused with other waveform distortions, especially in the modeling of overlapping signals in next generation ground-based GW detectors. The observation of one of these curves and its associated parameters may help (1) constrain the orbital distance $d_{\rm LS}$ of sources, especially around low-mass MBHs at the center of star clusters and galaxies, (2) additionally estimate the mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ of these MBHs, and (3) infer the orbital inclination of the binary. Simultaneously obtaining $d_{\rm LS}$ and $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ through self-lensing can help constrain the astrophysical environments where GW signals come from.</description>
