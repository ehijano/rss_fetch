      <title>A Stokes-Brinkman-type formulation for the eigenvalue problem in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and analyze, for two and three dimensions, a finite element method to approximate the natural frequencies of a flow system governed by the Stokes-Brinkman equations. Here, the fluid presents the capability of being within a porous media. Taking advantage of the Stokes regularity results for the solution, and considering inf-sup stable families of finite elements, we prove convergence together with a priori and a posteriori error estimates for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with the aid of the compact operators theory. We report a series of numerical tests in order to confirm the developed theory.</description>

      <title>Computational algorithm for downward continuation of gravity anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The downward continuation of potential fields from the Earth's surface into the subsurface is a critical task in gravity exploration, as it helps to identify the sources of gravity anomalies. This problem is often addressed by solving a first-kind integral equation using regularization techniques to stabilize an inherently unstable process. A similar approach is used in our work, where the continued field is represented as the potential of a simple layer or its vertical derivative. The constancy of the density sign of this equivalent simple layer preserves the sign of anomalies, provided that the layer's surface encloses all anomalous sources. This constraint is a key feature of our algorithm for the downward continuation of potential fields. To enforce, for instance, non-negativity in the simple layer density, we employ the NNLS (Non-Negative Least Squares) method. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated on model examples.</description>

      <title>Minimum-norm interpolation for unknown surface reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study algorithms to estimate geometric properties of raw point cloud data through implicit surface representations. Given that any level-set function with a constant level set corresponding to the surface can be used for such estimations, numerical methods need not specify a unique target function for the domain-type interpolation problems. In this paper, we focus on kernel-based interpolation by radial basis functions (RBF) and reformulate the uniquely solvable interpolation problem into a constrained optimization model. This model minimizes some user-defined norm while enforcing all interpolation conditions. To enable nontrivial feasible solutions, we propose to enhance the trial space with 1D kernel basis functions inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed mixed dimensional trial space significantly improves surface reconstruction from raw point clouds. This is particularly evident in the precise estimation of surface normals, outperforming traditional RBF trial spaces including the one for Hermite interpolation. This framework not only enhances processing of raw point cloud data but also shows potential for further contributions to computational geometry. We demonstrate this with a point cloud processing example.</description>

      <title>Long-time relative error analysis for linear ODEs with perturbed initial value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of initial value perturbations along the solution of a linear ODE \( y'(t) = Ay(t) \). This propagation is analized using the relative error rather than the absolute error. Our focus is on the long-term behavior of this relative error, which differs significantly from that of the absolute error. Understanding this long-term behavior provides insights into the growth of the relative error over all times, not just at large times. Therefore, it represents a crucial and fundamental aspect of the conditioning of linear ODEs, with applications in, for example, non-normal dynamics. The author hopes that this paper will stimulate attention to the role of relative error in dynamic contexts.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic condition numbers for linear ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the (relative) conditioning of the linear problem $y_0\mapsto \mathrm{e}^{tA}y_0$, i.e. the conditioning of the action of the matrix exponential $\mathrm{e}^{tA}$ on a vector with respect to perturbations of this vector. The present paper is a qualitative study of the long-time behavior of this conditioning. In other words, we are interested to study the propagation to the solution $y(t)$ of perturbations of the initial value for a linear ODE $y^\prime(t)=Ay(t)$, by measuring these perturbations with relative errors instead of absolute errors. We introduce three condition numbers: the first considers a specific initial value and a specific direction of perturbation; the second considers a specific initial value and the worst case by varying the direction of perturbation; and the third considers the worst case by varying both the initial value and the direction of perturbation. The long-time behaviors of these three condition numbers are studied.</description>

      <title>Entropy-conservative numerical fluxes for compressible Euler equations with thermally perfect gas models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel spatial discretization procedure for the compressible Euler equations that guarantees entropy conservation at a discrete level for thermally perfect gases. The procedure is based on a locally conservative formulation, and extends the entropy-conserving schemes to the more realistic case of thermally perfect gases, while still guaranteeing preservation of both linear invariants and kinetic energy. The proposed methodology, which can also be extended to multicomponent gases and to an Asymptotically Entropy-Conservative formulation, shows advantages in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared to existing similar approaches.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Random Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points. Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore, combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.</description>

      <title>A filtered multilevel Monte Carlo method for estimating the expectation of cell-centered discretized random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06069v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods for estimating the expectation of discretized random fields. Specifically, we consider a setting in which the input and output vectors of numerical simulators have inconsistent dimensions across the multilevel hierarchy. This motivates the introduction of grid transfer operators borrowed from multigrid methods. By adapting mathematical tools from multigrid methods, we perform a theoretical spectral analysis of the MLMC estimator of the expectation of discretized random fields, in the specific case of linear, symmetric and circulant simulators. We then propose filtered MLMC (F-MLMC) estimators based on a filtering mechanism similar to the smoothing process of multigrid methods, and we show that the filtering operators improve the estimation of both the small- and large-scale components of the variance, resulting in a reduction of the total variance of the estimator. Next, the conclusions of the spectral analysis are experimentally verified with a one-dimensional illustration. Finally, the proposed F-MLMC estimator is applied to the problem of estimating the discretized variance field of a diffusion-based covariance operator, which amounts to estimating the expectation of a discretized random field. The numerical experiments support the conclusions of the theoretical analysis even with non-linear simulators, and demonstrate the improvements brought by the F-MLMC estimator compared to both a crude MC and an unfiltered MLMC estimator.</description>

      <title>Decoupling multistep schemes for elliptic-parabolic problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the construction and convergence of decoupling multistep schemes of higher order using the backward differentiation formulae for an elliptic-parabolic problem, which includes multiple-network poroelasticity as a special case. These schemes were first introduced in [Altmann, Maier, Unger, BIT Numer. Math., 64:20, 2024], where a convergence proof for the second-order case is presented. Here, we present a slightly modified version of these schemes using a different construction of related time delay systems. We present a novel convergence proof relying on concepts from G-stability applicable for any order and providing a sharper characterization of the required weak coupling condition. The key tool for the convergence analysis is the construction of a weighted norm enabling a telescoping argument for the sum of the errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a linear algebraic framework for performing density estimation. It consists of three simple steps: convolving the empirical distribution with certain smoothing kernels to remove the exponentially large variance; compressing the empirical distribution after convolution as a tensor train, with efficient tensor decomposition algorithms; and finally, applying a deconvolution step to recover the estimated density from such tensor-train representation. Numerical results demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Blind free deconvolution over one-parameter sparse families via eigenmatrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note considers the blind free deconvolution problems of sparse spectral measures from one-parameter families. These problems pose significant challenges since they involve nonlinear sparse recovery. The main technical tool is the eigenmatrix method for solving unstructured sparse recovery problems. The key idea is to turn the nonlinear inverse problem into a linear inverse problem by leveraging the R-transform for free addition and the S-transform for free product. The resulting linear problem is solved with the eigenmatrix method tailored to the domain of the parametric family. Numerical results are provided for both the additive and multiplicative free deconvolutions.</description>

      <title>Quantile-RK and Double Quantile-RK Error Horizon Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In solving linear systems of equations of the form $Ax=b$, corruptions present in $b$ affect stochastic iterative algorithms' ability to reach the true solution $x^\ast$ to the uncorrupted linear system. The randomized Kaczmarz method converges in expectation to $x^\ast$ up to an error horizon dependent on the conditioning of $A$ and the supremum norm of the corruption in $b$. To avoid this error horizon in the sparse corruption setting, previous works have proposed quantile-based adaptations that make iterative methods robust. Our work first establishes a new convergence rate for the quantile-based random Kaczmarz (qRK) and double quantile-based random Kaczmarz (dqRK) methods, which, under certain conditions, improves upon known bounds. We further consider the more practical setting in which the vector $b$ includes both non-sparse ``noise" and sparse ``corruption". Error horizon bounds for qRK and dqRK are derived and shown to produce a smaller error horizon compared to their non-quantile-based counterparts, further demonstrating the advantages of quantile-based methods.</description>

      <title>Global Energy Minimization for Simplex Mesh Optimization: A Radius Ratio Approach to Sliver Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quality of simplex mesh is crucial for the stability and accuracy of numerical simulations in finite element analysis and computational geometry. However, the presence of sliver elements in 3D simplex mesh can severely impact the results. This paper presents a novel method based on a radius ratio energy function to optimize the quality of simplex mesh elements. This method can effectively eliminate sliver elements, thereby enhancing mesh quality.The gradient of the proposed energy function can be decomposed into a matrix-vector product. With minor processing, the matrix becomes symmetric positive definite, and this symmetric positive definite matrix can serve as a preconditioner to significantly accelerate the optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in eliminating sliver elements and improving mesh quality.</description>

      <title>FEniCSx-pctools: Tools for PETSc block linear algebra preconditioning in FEniCSx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations with the finite element method leads to large linear systems of equations that must be solved. When these systems have a natural block structure due to multiple field variables, using iterative solvers with carefully designed preconditioning strategies that exploit the underlying physical structure becomes necessary for an efficient and scalable solution process. FEniCSx Preconditioning Tools (FEniCSx-pctools) is a software package that eases the specification of PETSc (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) block preconditioning strategies on linear systems assembled using the DOLFINx finite element solver of the FEniCS Project. The package automatically attaches all necessary metadata so that preconditioning strategies can be applied via PETSc's standard options-based configuration system. The documented examples include a simple mixed Poisson system and more complex pressure convection-diffusion approach to preconditioning the Navier-Stokes equations. We show weak parallel scaling on a fully coupled temperature-Navier-Stokes system up to 8192 MPI (Message Passing Interface) processes, demonstrating the applicability of the approach to large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>State Estimation Using Sparse DEIM and Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) was recently proposed for state estimation in dynamical systems when only a sparse subset of the state variables can be observed. The S-DEIM estimate involves a kernel vector whose optimal value is inferred through a data assimilation algorithm. This data assimilation step suffers from two drawbacks: (i) It requires the knowledge of the governing equations of the dynamical system, and (ii) It is not generally guaranteed to converge to the optimal kernel vector. To address these issues, here we introduce an equation-free S-DEIM framework that estimates the optimal kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We show that the recurrent architecture is necessary since the kernel vector cannot be estimated from instantaneous observations. But RNNs, which incorporate the past history of the observations in the learning process, lead to nearly optimal estimations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on three numerical examples with increasing degree of spatiotemporal complexity: a conceptual model of atmospheric flow known as the Lorenz-96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Rayleigh-Benard convection. In each case, the resulting S-DEIM estimates are satisfactory even when a relatively simple RNN architecture, namely the reservoir computing network, is used.</description>
