      <title>Fractional Thouless pumping of solitons: a unique manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This raises a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we demonstrate the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of this correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model with next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we discover that the NNN parameters can induce fractional topological phases despite quantized topological invariants from conventional approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, linking nonlinear spectral features directly to bulk-boundary correspondence. This work reveals novel phenomena emerging from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for designing topological insulators and controlling quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.</description>

      <title>Partial suppression of magnetism in the square lattice SU(3) Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SU(N) Hubbard model is a natural extension of the SU(2) model. However, even the N=3 case remains poorly understood. We report a substantially new ground-state phase diagram of the square lattice SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model. Using a backflow ansatz, we identify strong signatures of a Mott transition and a subsequent magnetic transition, and the suppression of a previously predicted magnetic phase. We study the hole-doped model, identifying a transition from magnetic to paramagnetic behavior in the strong-coupling regime. Our findings offer a qualitatively new ground state picture. More broadly, our work suggests a path to study general SU(N) Hubbard models with arbitrary filling and geometry.</description>

      <title>Exponential onset of scalable entanglement via twist-and-turn dynamics in XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient preparation of scalable multipartite entanglement is a central goal in the development of next-generation quantum devices. In this work, we show that the so-called ``twist-and-turn" (TaT) dynamics for interacting spin ensembles, generated by Hamiltonians with U(1)-symmetric interactions and with a transverse field, can offer an important resource to reach this goal. For models with sufficiently high connectivity, TaT dynamics exhibits two key features: 1) it features both scalable squeezing at short times, as well as quantum Fisher information with Heisenberg scaling at later times; and 2) scalable multipartite entanglement (up to Heisenberg scaling) is reached in a time growing only logarithmically with system size, associated with an exponential buildup of quantum correlations. These results can be shown exactly in the XY model with a Rabi field and infinite range interactions, and numerically in the case of spatially decaying XY interactions, such as dipolar interactions in two dimensions, provided that unstable spin-wave modes do not develop for large system sizes and/or strong fields. For dipolar interactions, the entanglement dynamics at intermediate times is completely at odds with thermalization; and it appears to saturate the maximum speed of entanglement buildup allowed by Lieb-Robinson bounds generalized to power-law interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and Interaction-Controlled Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been extensively studied at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian phenomena can emerge. In this work, we propose an experimentally accessible mechanism to induce and control NHSEs in interacting and reciprocal dissipative systems. We consider both 1D and 2D Bose-Hubbard lattices subject to staggered two-particle loss combined with synthetic magnetic flux and long-range hopping. When the two-particle loss is small, the bound eigenstates (e.g., doublons and triplons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay between the magnetic flux and staggered two-particle loss. In contrast, for strong two-particle loss, the skin-mode localization direction of the bound particles is unexpectedly reversed. This reversal stems from the combined effect of the staggered two-particle loss, synthetic magnetic flux, and long-range hopping, through which virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes induce effectively strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Wehrl Entropy and Entanglement Complexity of Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wehrl entropy of a quantum state is the Shannon entropy of its coherent-state distribution function, and remains non-zero even for pure states. We investigate the relationship between this entropy and the many-particle quantum entanglement, for $N$ spin-1/2 particles. Explicitly, we numerically calculate the Wehrl entropy of various $N$-particle ($2\leq N\leq 20$) entangled pure states, with respect to the SU(2)$^{\otimes N}$ coherent states. Our results show that for the large-$N$ ($N\gtrsim 10$) systems the Wehrl entropy of the highly chaotic entangled states (e.g., $2^{-N/2}\sum_{s_1,s_2,...,s_N=\uparrow,\downarrow}|s_1,s_2,...,s_N\rangle e^{-i\phi_{s_1,s_2,...,s_N}}$, with $\phi_{s_1,s_2,...,s_N}$ being random angles) are substantially larger than that of the very regular entangled states (e.g., the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state). Therefore, the Wehrl entropy can reflect the complexity of the quantum entanglement of many-body pure states, as proposed by A. Sugita (Jour. Phys. A 36, 9081 (2003)). In particular, the Wehrl entropy per particle (WEPP) can be used as a quantitative description of this entanglement complexity. Unlike other quantities used to evaluate this complexity (e.g., the degree of entanglement between a subsystem and the other particles), the WEPP does not necessitate the division of the total system into two subsystems. We further demonstrate that many-body pure entangled states can be classified into three types, based on the behavior of the WEPP in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$: states approaching that of a maximally mixed state, those approaching completely separable pure states, and a third category lying between these two extremes. Each type exhibits fundamentally different entanglement complexity.</description>

      <title>Exceptional stationary state in a dephasing many-body open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</description>

      <title>Structure factors and quantum geometry in multiband BCS superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider multiband BCS superconductors that exhibit time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing, and analyze their dynamic density and spin structure factors using linear-response theory within the mean-field BCS-BEC crossover framework at zero temperature. Our results for the multi-orbital Hubbard model satisfy the associated f-sum rules in several limits. In particular, in the strong-coupling limit, they coincide with those of a weakly-interacting Bose gas of Cooper pairs, where the low-energy collective Goldstone modes serve as Bogoliubov phonons. We further reveal that the quantum-geometric origin of the low-energy structure factors, along with related observables such as the superfluid-weight tensor and the effective-mass tensor of Cooper pairs, can be traced all the way back to the effective-mass theorem for Bloch bands in this limit. As an illustration, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that the Goldstone modes are the only relevant collective degrees of freedom in the flat-band regime.</description>
