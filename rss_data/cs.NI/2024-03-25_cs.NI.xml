      <title>A Novel Non-Terrestrial Networks Architecture: All Optical LEO Constellations with High-Altitude Ground Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations is dynamically transforming the space sector. While free-space optical (FSO) links efficiently facilitate intersatellite data forwarding, they suffer from atmospheric/weather conditions in the space-to-ground link. This study delves into utilizing high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) as elevated relay stations strategically positioned above terrestrial ground stations. We introduce the concept of high-altitude ground stations (HAGS), an innovative approach to enabling the development of all optical LEO satellite constellations. The first contribution is an analysis of the HAGS-based network architecture where the LEO spacecraft only hosts FSO transceivers. Secondly, we execute an extensive simulation campaign to determine the gain of HAGS, including a new equivalency model with the traditional ground station approach. Finally, we examine the research challenges of implementing HAGS-based, all optical LEO mega-constellations.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Digital Veil: Exploring the Ecosystem of DNS HTTPS Resource Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DNS HTTPS resource record is a new DNS record type designed for the delivery of configuration information and parameters required to initiate connections to HTTPS network services. It provides the ability to perform zone apex redirection to a third-party provider, which the existing CNAME record cannot do. In addition, it is a key enabler for TLS Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) by providing the cryptographic keying material needed to encrypt the initial exchange. To understand the adoption and security of this new DNS HTTPS record, we perform a longitudinal study on the server-side deployment of DNS HTTPS for Tranco top 1 million domains over 8 months, as well as the client-side support for DNS HTTPS from major browsers. To the best of knowledge, our work is the first longitudinal study on DNS HTTPS server deployment, and the first known study on client-side support for DNS HTTPS. Despite the rapidly growing trend of DNS HTTPS adoption, our study highlights concerns in the deployment by both servers and clients, such as the complexity in properly maintaining HTTPS records and the concerning hardfail mechanisms in browser when using HTTPS records.</description>

      <title>LOAM: Low-latency Communication, Caching, and Computation Placement in Data-Intensive Computing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying data- and computation-intensive applications such as large-scale AI into heterogeneous dispersed computing networks can significantly enhance application performance by mitigating bottlenecks caused by limited network resources, including bandwidth, storage, and computing power. However, current resource allocation methods in dispersed computing do not provide a comprehensive solution that considers arbitrary topology, elastic resource amount, reuse of computation results, and nonlinear congestion-dependent optimization objectives. In this paper, we propose LOAM, a low-latency joint communication, caching, and computation placement framework with a rigorous analytical foundation that incorporates the above aspects. We tackle the NP-hard aggregated cost minimization problem with two methods: an offline method with a 1/2 approximation and an online adaptive method with a bounded gap from the optimum. Through extensive simulation, the proposed framework outperforms multiple baselines in both synthesis and real-world network scenarios.</description>

      <title>Delay-Optimal Forwarding and Computation Offloading for Service Chain Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging edge computing paradigms enable heterogeneous devices to collaborate on complex computation applications. However, for congestible links and computing units, delay-optimal forwarding and offloading for service chain tasks (e.g., DNN with vertical split) in edge computing networks remains an open problem. In this paper, we formulate the service chain forwarding and offloading problem with arbitrary topology and heterogeneous transmission/computation capability, and aim to minimize the aggregated network cost. We consider congestion-aware nonlinear cost functions that cover various performance metrics and constraints, such as average queueing delay with limited processor capacity. We solve the non-convex optimization problem globally by analyzing the KKT condition and proposing a sufficient condition for optimality. We then propose a distributed algorithm that converges to the global optimum. The algorithm adapts to changes in input rates and network topology, and can be implemented as an online algorithm. Numerical evaluation shows that our method significantly outperforms baselines in multiple network instances, especially in congested scenarios.</description>

      <title>Prioritized Multi-Tenant Traffic Engineering for Dynamic QoS Provisioning in Autonomous SDN-OpenFlow Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter indicates the critical need for prioritized multi-tenant quality-of-service (QoS) management by emerging mobile edge systems, particularly for high-throughput beyond fifth-generation networks. Existing traffic engineering tools utilize complex functions baked into closed, proprietary infrastructures, largely limiting design flexibility, scalability, and adaptiveness. Hence, this study introduces a software-defined networking (SDN)-based dynamic QoS provisioning scheme that prioritizes multi-tenant network traffic while focusing on the base station-edge cloud scenario. The designed scheme first separates control and data planes and enables traffic management automation using SDN programmability. It then implements dynamic QoS management via the SDN-OpenFlow protocol, which ensures ample bandwidth for multiple priority flows and efficiently manages the remaining bandwidth for non-priority traffic. Empirical experiments are conducted with a Mininet network emulator and an OpenDayLight controller. Performance evaluation validates the proposed scheme's effectiveness in meeting multi-tenant QoS criteria, offering a robust solution for traffic prioritization in SDN-based edge networks.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Assisted Intelligent Network Management for Vehicular Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging data-driven methods based on artificial intelligence (AI) have paved the way for intelligent, flexible, and adaptive network management in vehicular applications. To enhance network management towards network automation, this article presents a digital twin (DT) assisted two-tier learning framework, which facilitates the automated life-cycle management of machine learning based intelligent network management functions (INMFs). Specifically, at a high tier, meta learning is employed to capture different levels of general features for the INMFs under nonstationary network conditions. At a low tier, individual learning models are customized for local networks based on fast model adaptation. Hierarchical DTs are deployed at the edge and cloud servers to assist the two-tier learning process, through closed-loop interactions with the physical network domain. Finally, a case study demonstrates the fast and accurate model adaptation ability of meta learning in comparison with benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Interference Management for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging applications such as autonomous driving and Internet of things (IoT) services put forward the demand for simutaneous sensing and communication functions in the same system. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has the potential to meet the demands of ubiquitous communication and high-precision sensing due to the advantages of spectrum and hardware resource sharing, as well as the mutual enhancement of sensing and communication. However, ISAC system faces severe interference requiring effective interference suppression, avoidance, and exploitation techniques. This article provides a comprehensive survey on the interference management techniques in ISAC systems, involving network architecture, system design, signal processing, and resource allocation. We first review the channel modeling and performance metrics of the ISAC system. Then, the methods for managing self-interference (SI), mutual interference (MI), and clutter in a single base station (BS) system are summarized, including interference suppression, interference avoidance and interference exploitation methods. Furthermore, cooperative interference management methods are studied to address the cross-link interference (CLI) in a coordinated multipoint ISAC (CoMP-ISAC) system. Finally, future trends are revealed. This article may provide a reference for the study of interference management in ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Greedy and CBF for ETSI non-area GeoNetworking: The impact of DCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of the two ETSI non-area forwarding algorithms in the GeoNetworking specification: Greedy Forwarding and Non-Area Contention-Based Forwarding (CBF). Non-area forwarding occurs when a packet is sent to a geographical Destination Area from a node located outside of this area, e.g., when a vehicle wants to alert of hazardous events to other vehicles located in a distant geographical area. The evaluation has been carried out both in urban and highway scenarios and takes into account the complete ETSI Architecture, including the interaction with the Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) mechanism. We have also compared ETSI-defined mechanisms with optimizations found in the literature. Our main findings are that Greedy Forwarding, when combined with DCC, is extremely ineffective even with optimizations, and Non-Area CBFs (both ETSI CBF and an optimized version called S-FoT+) outperform Greedy Forwarding both in highway and urban scenarios.</description>

      <title>Study of Workload Interference with Intelligent Routing on Dragonfly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dragonfly interconnect is a crucial network technology for supercomputers. To support exascale systems, network resources are shared such that links and routers are not dedicated to any node pair. While link utilization is increased, workload performance is often offset by network contention. Recently, intelligent routing built on reinforcement learning demonstrates higher network throughput with lower packet latency. However, its effectiveness in reducing workload interference is unknown. In this work, we present extensive network simulations to study multi-workload contention under different routing mechanisms, intelligent routing and adaptive routing, on a large-scale Dragonfly system. We develop an enhanced network simulation toolkit, along with a suite of workloads with distinctive communication patterns. We also present two metrics to characterize application communication intensity. Our analysis focuses on examining how different workloads interfere with each other under different routing mechanisms by inspecting both application-level and network-level metrics. Several key insights are made from the analysis.</description>

      <title>Q-adaptive: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based Routing on Dragonfly Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: on adaptive routing to balance network traffic for optimum performance. Ideally, adaptive routing attempts to forward packets between minimal and non-minimal paths with the least congestion. In practice, current adaptive routing algorithms estimate routing path congestion based on local information such as output queue occupancy. Using local information to estimate global path congestion is inevitably inaccurate because a router has no precise knowledge of link states a few hops away. This inaccuracy could lead to interconnect congestion. In this study, we present Q-adaptive routing, a multi-agent reinforcement learning routing scheme for Dragonfly systems. Q-adaptive routing enables routers to learn to route autonomously by leveraging advanced reinforcement learning technology. The proposed Q-adaptive routing is highly scalable thanks to its fully distributed nature without using any shared information between routers. Furthermore, a new two-level Q-table is designed for Q-adaptive to make it computational lightly and saves 50% of router memory usage compared with the previous Q-routing. We implement the proposed Q-adaptive routing in SST/Merlin simulator. Our evaluation results show that Q-adaptive routing achieves up to 10.5% system throughput improvement and 5.2x average packet latency reduction compared with adaptive routing algorithms. Remarkably, Q-adaptive can even outperform the optimal VALn non-minimal routing under the ADV+1 adversarial traffic pattern with up to 3% system throughput improvement and 75% average packet latency reduction.</description>

      <title>Accuracy-Aware Cooperative Sensing and Computing for Connected Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To maintain high perception performance among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), in this paper, we propose an accuracy-aware and resource-efficient raw-level cooperative sensing and computing scheme among CAVs and road-side infrastructure. The scheme enables fined-grained partial raw sensing data selection, transmission, fusion, and processing in per-object granularity, by exploiting the parallelism among object classification subtasks associated with each object. A supervised learning model is trained to capture the relationship between the object classification accuracy and the data quality of selected object sensing data, facilitating accuracy-aware sensing data selection. We formulate an optimization problem for joint sensing data selection, subtask placement and resource allocation among multiple object classification subtasks, to minimize the total resource cost while satisfying the delay and accuracy requirements. A genetic algorithm based iterative solution is proposed for the optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy awareness and resource efficiency achieved by the proposed cooperative sensing and computing scheme, in comparison with benchmark solutions.</description>

      <title>XAV: A High-Performance Regular Expression Matching Engine for Packet Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular expression matching is the core function of various network security applications such as network intrusion detection systems. With the network bandwidth increases, it is a great challenge to implement regular expression matching for line rate packet processing. To this end, a novel scheme named XAV targeting high-performance regular expression matching is proposed in this paper. XAV first employs anchor DFA to tackle the state explosion problem of DFA. Then based on anchor DFA, two techniques including pre-filtering and regex decomposition are utilized to improve the average time complexity. Through implementing XAV with an FPGA-CPU architecture, comprehensive experiments show that a high matching throughput of up to 75 Gbps can be achieved for the large and complex Snort rule-set. Compared to state-of-the-art software schemes, XAV achieves two orders of magnitude of performance improvement. While compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based schemes, XAV achieves more than 2.5x performance improvement with the same hardware resource consumption.</description>

      <title>Exploring Communication Technologies, Standards, and Challenges in Electrified Vehicle Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As public awareness of environmental protection continues to grow, the trend of integrating more electric vehicles (EVs) into the transportation sector is rising. Unlike conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, EVs can minimize carbon emissions and potentially achieve autonomous driving. However, several obstacles hinder the widespread adoption of EVs, such as their constrained driving range and the extended time required for charging. One alternative solution to address these challenges is implementing dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), charging EVs in motion on the road. Moreover, charging stations with static wireless power transfer (SWPT) infrastructure can replace existing gas stations, enabling users to charge EVs in parking lots or at home. This paper surveys the communication infrastructure for static and dynamic wireless charging in electric vehicles. It encompasses all communication aspects involved in the wireless charging process. The architecture and communication requirements for static and dynamic wireless charging are presented separately. Additionally, a comprehensive comparison of existing communication standards is provided. The communication with the grid is also explored in detail. The survey gives attention to security and privacy issues arising during communications. In summary, the paper addresses the challenges and outlines upcoming trends in communication for EV wireless charging.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Relative Representations for Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In future 6G wireless networks, semantic and effectiveness aspects of communications will play a fundamental role, incorporating meaning and relevance into transmissions. However, obstacles arise when devices employ diverse languages, logic, or internal representations, leading to semantic mismatches that might jeopardize understanding. In latent space communication, this challenge manifests as misalignment within high-dimensional representations where deep neural networks encode data. This paper presents a novel framework for goal-oriented semantic communication, leveraging relative representations to mitigate semantic mismatches via latent space alignment. We propose a dynamic optimization strategy that adapts relative representations, communication parameters, and computation resources for energy-efficient, low-latency, goal-oriented semantic communications. Numerical results demonstrate our methodology's effectiveness in mitigating mismatches among devices, while optimizing energy consumption, delay, and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Zero-Knowledge Proof of Distinct Identity: a Standard-compatible Sybil-resistant Pseudonym Extension for C-ITS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudonyms are widely used in Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) to protect the location privacy of vehicles. However, the unlinkability nature of pseudonyms also enables Sybil attacks, where a malicious vehicle can pretend to be multiple vehicles at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol called zero-knowledge Proof of Distinct Identity (zk-PoDI,) which allows a vehicle to prove that it is not the owner of another pseudonym in the local area, without revealing its actual identity. Zk-PoDI is based on the Diophantine equation and zk-SNARK, and does not rely on any specific pseudonym design or infrastructure assistance. We show that zk-PoDI satisfies all the requirements for a practical Sybil-resistance pseudonym system, and it has low latency, adjustable difficulty, moderate computation overhead, and negligible communication cost. We also discuss the future work of implementing and evaluating zk-PoDI in a realistic city-scale simulation environment.</description>

      <title>FOOL: Addressing the Downlink Bottleneck in Satellite Computing with Neural Feature Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanosatellite constellations equipped with sensors capturing large geographic regions provide unprecedented opportunities for Earth observation. As constellation sizes increase, network contention poses a downlink bottleneck. Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) leverages limited onboard compute resources to reduce transfer costs by processing the raw captures at the source. However, current solutions have limited practicability due to reliance on crude filtering methods or over-prioritizing particular downstream tasks.
  This work presents FOOL, an OEC-native and task-agnostic feature compression method that preserves prediction performance. FOOL partitions high-resolution satellite imagery to maximize throughput. Further, it embeds context and leverages inter-tile dependencies to lower transfer costs with negligible overhead. While FOOL is a feature compressor, it can recover images with competitive scores on perceptual quality measures at lower bitrates. We extensively evaluate transfer cost reduction by including the peculiarity of intermittently available network connections in low earth orbit. Lastly, we test the feasibility of our system for standardized nanosatellite form factors. We demonstrate that FOOL permits downlinking over 100x the data volume without relying on prior information on the downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Remote Estimation of Multiple Markov Sources Under Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies semantic-aware communication for remote estimation of multiple Markov sources over a lossy and rate-constrained channel. Unlike most existing studies that treat all source states equally, we exploit the semantics of information and consider that the remote actuator has different tolerances for the estimation errors of different states. We aim to find an optimal scheduling policy that minimizes the long-term state-dependent costs of estimation errors under a transmission frequency constraint. We theoretically show the structure of the optimal policy by leveraging the average-cost Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) theory and the Lagrangian dynamic programming. By exploiting the optimal structural results, we develop a novel policy search algorithm, termed intersection search plus relative value iteration (Insec-RVI), that can find the optimal policy using only a few iterations. To avoid the ``curse of dimensionality'' of MDPs, we propose an online low-complexity drift-plus-penalty (DPP) scheduling algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization theorem. We also design an efficient average-cost Q-learning algorithm to estimate the optimal policy without knowing a priori the channel and source statistics. Numerical results show that continuous transmission is inefficient, and remarkably, our semantic-aware policies can attain the optimum by strategically utilizing fewer transmissions by exploiting the timing of the important information.</description>

      <title>Network-Assisted Delivery of Adaptive Video Streaming Services through CDN, SDN, and MEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimedia applications, mainly video streaming services, are currently the dominant source of network load worldwide. In recent Video-on-Demand (VoD) and live video streaming services, traditional streaming delivery techniques have been replaced by adaptive solutions based on the HTTP protocol. Current trends toward high-resolution (e.g., 8K) and/or low-latency VoD and live video streaming pose new challenges to end-to-end (E2E) bandwidth demand and have stringent delay requirements. To do this, video providers typically rely on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to ensure that they provide scalable video streaming services. To support future streaming scenarios involving millions of users, it is necessary to increase the CDNs' efficiency. It is widely agreed that these requirements may be satisfied by adopting emerging networking techniques to present Network-Assisted Video Streaming (NAVS) methods. Motivated by this, this thesis goes one step beyond traditional pure client-based HAS algorithms by incorporating (an) in-network component(s) with a broader view of the network to present completely transparent NAVS solutions for HAS clients.</description>

      <title>A Traffic Management Framework for On-Demand Urban Air Mobility Systems</title>

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) offers a solution to current traffic congestion by providing on-demand air mobility in urban areas. Effective traffic management is crucial for efficient operation of UAM systems, especially for high-demand scenarios. In this paper, we present a centralized traffic management framework for on-demand UAM systems. Specifically, we provide a scheduling policy, called VertiSync, which schedules the aircraft for either servicing trip requests or rebalancing in the system subject to aircraft safety margins and energy requirements. We characterize the system-level throughput of VertiSync, which determines the demand threshold at which passenger waiting times transition from being stabilized to being increasing over time. We show that the proposed policy is able to maximize throughput for sufficiently large fleet sizes. We demonstrate the performance of VertiSync through a case study for the city of Los Angeles, and show that it significantly reduces passenger waiting times compared to a first-come first-serve scheduling policy.</description>

      <title>CacheGen: KV Cache Compression and Streaming for Fast Language Model Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07240v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on complex tasks, their inputs are supplemented with longer contexts that incorporate domain knowledge or user-specific information. Yet using long contexts poses a challenge for responsive LLM systems, as nothing can be generated until the whole context is processed by the LLM. While the context-processing delay can be reduced by reusing the KV cache of a context across different inputs, fetching the KV cache, which contains large tensors, over the network can cause extra network delays.
  CacheGen is a fast context-loading module for LLM systems. First, CacheGen uses a custom tensor encoder, which embraces KV cache's distributional properties, to encode a KV cache into more compact bitstream representations with negligible encoding/decoding overhead. This reduces the bandwidth demand to fetch the KV cache. Second, to maintain low context-loading delay and high generation quality, CacheGen adapts the streaming strategies to cope with changes in available bandwidth. When available bandwidth drops, CacheGen may raise the compression level for a part of the context or choose to recompute its KV cache on the fly. We test CacheGen on four popular LLMs of various sizes and four datasets (662 contexts in total). Compared to the recent systems that reuse the KV cache, CacheGen reduces the KV cache size by 3.7-4.3x and the total delay in fetching and processing contexts by 2.7-3.2x while having negligible impact on the LLM response quality in accuracy or perplexity.</description>

      <title>The Implications of Decentralization in Blockchained Federated Learning: Evaluating the Impact of Model Staleness and Inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain promises to enhance distributed machine learning (ML) approaches such as federated learning (FL) by providing further decentralization, security, immutability, and trust, which are key properties for enabling collaborative intelligence in next-generation applications. Nonetheless, the intrinsic decentralized operation of peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain nodes leads to an uncharted setting for FL, whereby the concepts of FL round and global model become meaningless, as devices' synchronization is lost without the figure of a central orchestrating server. In this paper, we study the practical implications of outsourcing the orchestration of FL to a democratic setting such as in a blockchain. In particular, we focus on the effects that model staleness and inconsistencies, endorsed by blockchains' modus operandi, have on the training procedure held by FL devices asynchronously. Using simulation, we evaluate the blockchained FL operation by applying two different ML models (ranging from low to high complexity) on the well-known MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, and focus on the accuracy and timeliness of the solutions. Our results show the high impact of model inconsistencies on the accuracy of the models (up to a ~35% decrease in prediction accuracy), which underscores the importance of properly designing blockchain systems based on the characteristics of the underlying FL application.</description>

      <title>From Files to Streams: Revisiting Web History and Exploring Potentials for Future Prospects</title>

Abstract: Over the last 30 years, the World Wide Web has changed significantly. In this paper, we argue that common practices to prepare web pages for delivery conflict with many efforts to present content with minimal latency, one fundamental goal that pushed changes in the WWW. To bolster our arguments, we revisit reasons that led to changes of HTTP and compare them systematically with techniques to prepare web pages. We found that the structure of many web pages leverages features of HTTP/1.1 but hinders the use of recent HTTP features to present content quickly. To improve the situation in the future, we propose fine-grained content segmentation. This would allow to exploit streaming capabilities of recent HTTP versions and to render content as quickly as possible without changing underlying protocols or web browsers.</description>

      <title>Plotinus: A Satellite Internet Digital Twin System</title>

Abstract: The development of an integrated space-air-ground network (SAGIN) requires sophisticated satellite Internet emulation tools that can handle complex, dynamic topologies and offer in-depth analysis. Existing emulation platforms struggle with challenges like the need for detailed implementation across all network layers, real-time response, and scalability. This paper proposes a digital twin system based on microservices for satellite Internet emulation, namely Plotinus, which aims to solve these problems. Plotinus features a modular design, allowing for easy replacement of the physical layer to emulate different aerial vehicles and analyze channel interference. It also enables replacing path computation methods to simplify testing and deploying algorithms. In particular, Plotinus allows for real-time emulation with live network traffic, enhancing practical network models. The evaluation result shows Plotinus's effective emulation of dynamic satellite networks with real-world devices. Its adaptability for various communication models and algorithm testing highlights Plotinus's role as a vital tool for developing and analyzing SAGIN systems, offering a cross-layer, real-time and scalable digital twin system.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Federated Learning in Wireless Networks: Pruning Tackles Bandwidth Scarcity and System Heterogeneity</title>

Abstract: While a practical wireless network has many tiers where end users do not directly communicate with the central server, the users' devices have limited computation and battery powers, and the serving base station (BS) has a fixed bandwidth. Owing to these practical constraints and system models, this paper leverages model pruning and proposes a pruning-enabled hierarchical federated learning (PHFL) in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). We first derive an upper bound of the convergence rate that clearly demonstrates the impact of the model pruning and wireless communications between the clients and the associated BS. Then we jointly optimize the model pruning ratio, central processing unit (CPU) frequency and transmission power of the clients in order to minimize the controllable terms of the convergence bound under strict delay and energy constraints. However, since the original problem is not convex, we perform successive convex approximation (SCA) and jointly optimize the parameters for the relaxed convex problem. Through extensive simulation, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed PHFL algorithm in terms of test accuracy, wall clock time, energy consumption and bandwidth requirement.</description>

      <title>Offloading and Quality Control for AI Generated Content Services in 6G Mobile Edge Computing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-Generated Content (AIGC), as a novel manner of providing Metaverse services in the forthcoming Internet paradigm, can resolve the obstacles of immersion requirements. Concurrently, edge computing, as an evolutionary paradigm of computing in communication systems, effectively augments real-time interactive services. In pursuit of enhancing the accessibility of AIGC services, the deployment of AIGC models (e.g., diffusion models) to edge servers and local devices has become a prevailing trend. Nevertheless, this approach faces constraints imposed by battery life and computational resources when tasks are offloaded to local devices, limiting the capacity to deliver high-quality content to users while adhering to stringent latency requirements. So there will be a tradeoff between the utility of AIGC models and offloading decisions in the edge computing paradigm. This paper proposes a joint optimization algorithm for offloading decisions, computation time, and diffusion steps of the diffusion models in the reverse diffusion stage. Moreover, we take the average error into consideration as the metric for evaluating the quality of the generated results. Experimental results conclusively demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior joint optimization performance compared to the baselines.</description>
