      <title>Josephson effect in strongly disordered metallic wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study localization effects in Josephson junctions with two superconductors connected by a strongly disordered metallic wire of length $L$. The conventional description of the Josephson effect in such systems, based on the quasiclassical Usadel equation, neglects electron interference and is only applicable when $L$ is shorter than the localization length $\xi$ in the wire. We develop a more general theory for the Josephson effect using the non-linear sigma model that fully accounts for electron interference, and hence localization. We show that for $L \gg \xi$, three qualitatively different regimes of the Josephson current arise depending on the ratio of the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$ and the mean level spacing in the localization volume $\Delta_\xi$. We derive the average supercurrent as a function of the phase difference for all three regimes. Quite unexpectedly, we observe that the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the average critical current and the normal-state conductance still holds in the strongly localized state when $\Delta_\xi \gg \Delta$ and $\xi \ll L \ll (\xi/\pi^2) \ln^2(\Delta_\xi/\Delta)$.</description>

      <title>Robust trapping of 2D excitons in an engineered 1D potential from proximal ferroelectric domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the confinement of neutral excitons in a one-dimensional (1D) potential, engineered by proximizing hBN-encapsulated monolayer MoSe$_2$ to ferroelectric domain walls (DW) in periodically poled LiNbO$_3$. Our device exploits the nanometer scale in-plane electric field gradient at the DW to induce the dipolar exciton confinement via the Stark effect. Spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy reveals the emergence of narrow emission lines redshifted from the MoSe$_2$ neutral exciton by up to $\sim100\,$meV, depending on the sample structure. The spatial distribution, excitation energy response and polarization properties of the emission is consistent with signatures of 1D-confined excitons. The large electric field gradients accessible via proximal ferroelectric systems open up new avenues for the creation of robust quantum-confined excitons in atomically thin materials and their heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Angular Interplay of Nematicity, Superconductivity, and Strange Metallicity in a Moir\'e Flat Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems frequently exhibits broken rotational symmetry, raising fundamental questions about the underlying order parameter symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that electronic nematicity--driven by Coulomb-mediated rotational symmetry breaking--serves as a crucial link to understanding the nature of superconductivity. Utilizing a novel framework of angle-resolved measurement, we reveal an interring angular interplay among nematicity, superconductivity, and strange metallicity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. By establishing a direct correlation between the preferred superconducting transport direction and the principal axis of the metallic phase, our findings place strong constrains on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. This work introduces a new paradigm for probing the microscopic mechanisms governing superconductivity in strongly interacting two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Low-lying Electronic Structure of Rare-Earth Based Topological Nodal Line Semimetal Candidate DySbTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanide (Ln) based LnSbTe materials have garnered significant attention due to rich interplay of long range magnetic ordering and topological properties, driven by unique crystalline symmetry, 4f electron interactions, and pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. DySbTe, as a heavier lanthanide-based member of the LnSbTe family, stands out with its SOC and larger on site interactions on its 4f electrons, which arise due to the heavier Dy element. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the low-temperature bulk physical properties and the electronic structure of DySbTe using magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and electrical resistivity measurements, along with high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S), and density functional theory calculations. Our thermodynamic measurements revealed an antiferromagnetic ordering below TN = 7.45 K and a subsequent magnetic phase transition at TN1 = 7.15 K. Our transport studies indicate a semimetallic behavior with unusual feature in the ordered state. Our ARPES measurements revealed a diamond-shaped Fermi pocket centered at the G point, with band features that evolve distinctly across various binding energies. STM/S results indicate a minimum in the density of states at around 100 meV below the Fermi level, and ARPES measurements reveal a significant gap present around the X point, differentiating DySbTe from other LnSbTe compounds. These findings enhance our understanding of the SOC effects on the electronic structure and topological properties in the LnSbTe family, highlighting DySbTe as a promising candidate for exploring the interplay between topology and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Method for bioinspired electron bifurcation by semiconductor electrochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron bifurcating enzymes oxidize a two-electron donor, pushing one electron thermodynamically uphill to reduce a low-potential acceptor by leveraging the downhill flow of the other electron to a high-potential acceptor. Electron bifurcation can achieve near 100\% energy conversion efficiency if operating in a near-reversible regime. Theories of charge transport and heterogeneous electron transfer reveal that bioinspired electron bifurcation is possible in tailored semiconductor electrochemical junctions: three-way n-p-electrolyte junctions. A two-electron species is oxidized at the semiconducting surface, injecting the resulting charges into the semiconductor. If the junction is properly configured, the electrons will spontaneously bifurcate into the n- and p-doped regions. If a bias is applied across these regions, the semiconductor-electrolyte junction will transduce energy by pushing half of the current to higher potential and half to lower potential. Energy wasting short circuit processes are be defeated using the carrier distributions and dynamics that occur naturally in these junctions. Furthermore, bifurcating junctions seem to require only fundamental electrochemical processes that have been observed in other contexts, and does not require fine-tuning of kinetic rate constants (although tuning may improve performance). Theory and simulation of bifurcating junctions reveals critical design principles and suggests that $\sim 100 \mu\text{A}/\text{cm}^2 - 1 \hspace{2 pt} m\text{A/cm}^2$ of bifurcated current is a reasonable goal for bifurcating junctions, but further enhancement seems possible.</description>

      <title>Diode and selective routing functionalities controlled by geometry in current-induced spin-orbit torque driven magnetic domain wall devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on current-induced domain wall (DW) motion in heavy metal/ferromagnet structures is crucial for advancing memory, logic, and computing devices. Here, we demonstrate that adjusting the angle between the DW conduit and the current direction provides an additional degree of control over the current-induced DW motion. A DW conduit with a 45{\deg} section relative to the current direction enables asymmetrical DW behaviour: for one DW polarity, motion proceeds freely, while for the opposite polarity, motion is impeded or even blocked in the 45{\deg} zone, depending on the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction strength. This enables the device to function as a DW diode. Leveraging this velocity asymmetry, we designed a Y-shaped DW conduit with one input and two output branches at +45{\deg} and -45{\deg}, functioning as a DW selector. A DW injected into the junction exits through one branch, while a reverse polarity DW exits through the other, demonstrating selective DW routing.</description>

      <title>Valley Emission and Upconversion in Isotopically Engineered Monolayer WS$_2$ under Resonant Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest to optimize the optoelectronic and valleytronic properties of 2D materials, various strategies such as strain engineering, doping, and heterostructuring have been explored. In this direction, isotope engineering also offers a potential avenue to alter electron-phonon interaction and impact quasiparticle scattering processes. In this study, we investigate the dependence of sulfur isotopes on upconversion and valley scattering phenomena by collecting the resonance photoluminescence (PL) under an applied magnetic field from 0 to 14 T at 4 K for the chemical vapor deposition-grown monolayer (1L) of W$^{N}$S$_2$, W$^{32}$S$_2$, and W$^{34}$S$_2$. The upconversion of the mixed-state sulfur 1L (W$^{N}$S$_2$) exhibits one M-phonon absorption, with an obtained optical gain of nearly 30 meV, while the pure sulfur isotope labelled 1Ls (W$^{32}$S$_2$ and W$^{34}$S$_2$) require two phonons (M and $\Gamma$), yielding a gain of around 80 meV. It is also found that the exciton degree of polarization (DOP) of W$^{N}$S$_2$ changes significantly by $\sim$ -30$\%$ as the field increases from 0 to 14 T, while for W$^{32}$S$_2$ and W$^{34}$S$_2$, the exciton DOP increases by up to $\sim$ 8$\%$. Similarly, distinct changes in the DOP are observed for trions and localized excitons among all the samples, attributed to the different valley scattering phenomena. The 1L W$^{N}$S$_2$ demonstrates a combination of intraband and interband scattering, whereas in the case of W$^{32}$S$_2$ intraband scattering is preferred; W$^{34}$S$_2$ predominantly exhibits interband scattering. Finally, a phenomenological model is proposed to describe the upconversion and valley scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Quantum skyrmions and antiskyrmions in monoaxial chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical monoaxial chiral magnets represent a unique magnetic system that allows for the stabilization of both skyrmions and antiskyrmions of equal energy. Unlike a similar situation in frustrated magnets, the energy landscape here is much simpler, consisting of four states: the saturated ferromagnetic state, spin-spiral, skyrmion, and antiskyrmion. This simplicity makes such systems interesting for potential applications that rely on manipulating these states. We study the quantum analog of the already established classical theory by investigating the low-energy excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg model with monoaxial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we establish that such a model supports the existence of skyrmion and antiskyrmion states of equal energy. This degeneracy allows for the existence of a mesoscopic Schr\"odinger cat state exhibiting properties of both skyrmion and antiskyrmion. To characterize this superposition, we calculate two-point correlation functions that can be measured in neutron scattering experiments. Finally, we introduce a perturbation in the form of a magnetic field gradient to induce a non-trivial time evolution of the superposition state. We study this time evolution using both a numerical variational approach and the collective coordinates method.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Carrier Modulation via Nonlinear Acoustoelectric Transport in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamically manipulating carriers in van der Waals heterostructures could enable solid-state quantum simulators with tunable lattice parameters. A key requirement is forming deep potential wells to reliably trap excitations. Here, we report the observation of nonlinear acoustoelectric transport and dynamic carrier modulation in boron nitride-encapsulated graphene devices coupled to intense surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on LiNbO3 substrates. SAWs generate strong acoustoelectric current densities (JAE), transitioning from linear to nonlinear regimes with increasing SAW intensity. In the nonlinear regime, periodic carrier (electrons, holes, or their mixtures) stripes emerge. Using counter-propagating SAWs, we create standing SAWs (SSAWs) to dynamically manipulate charge distributions without static gates. The saturation of JAE, attenuation transitions, and tunable resistance peaks confirm strong carrier localization. These results establish SAWs as a powerful tool for controlling carrier dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) materials, paving the way for the development of time-dependent quantum systems and acoustic lattices for quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Exciton Binding Energies in 2D Materials: Insights from Braneworld Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we introduce a new interpretation of exciton binding energies in two-dimensional (2D) materials using concepts from brane physics. We adapt the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati-Shifman mechanism to a (2+1)-dimensional brane in a (3+1)-D spacetime, deriving an effective electromagnetic potential on the brane. Using this potential, we develop a hydrogenic model for exciton binding energies in 2D materials, applying it to s-type excitons and comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results on WS$_{2}$ monolayers. This interdisciplinary approach bridges high-energy and condensed matter physics, offering a new didactic representation of excitons in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle gap renormalization driven by internal and external screening in WS$_2$ device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic band gap of a two-dimensional semiconductor within a device architecture is sensitive to variations in screening properties of adjacent materials in the device and to gate-controlled doping. Here, we employ micro-focused angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to separate band gap renormalization effects stemming from environmental screening and electron-doping during \textit{in situ} gating of a single-layer WS$_{2}$ device. The WS$_{2}$ is supported on hBN and contains a section that is exposed to vacuum and another section that is encapsulated by a graphene contact. We directly observe the doping-induced semiconductor-metal transition and band gap renormalization in the two sections of WS$_2$. Surprisingly, a larger band gap renormalization is observed in the vacuum-exposed section than in the graphene-encapsulated - and thus ostensibly better screened - section of the WS$_2$. Using $GW$ calculations, we determine that intrinsic screening due to stronger doping in vacuum exposed WS$_2$ exceeds the external environmental screening in graphene-encapsulated WS$_2$.</description>

      <title>Photonic Negative Differential Thermal Conductance Enabled by NIS Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to their sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, normal metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions are leveraged in various thermal devices. This study illustrates that two NISIN reservoirs can achieve a measurable negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC). This phenomenon is enabled by photon-mediated heat exchange, which is profoundly affected by the temperature-dependent impedance matching between the reservoirs. Under appropriate configurations, the heat current is suppressed for increasingly large temperature gradients, leading to NDTC. We also propose experimental configurations where it is possible to discriminate this effect unambiguously. We employ superconducting aluminum in conjunction with either silver or epitaxial InAs to facilitate the experimental observation of NDTC at low temperatures over significant sub-Kelvin ranges. This advances the development of devices that exploit NDTC to enhance heat and temperature regulation in cryogenic environments, such as thermal switches, transistors, and amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Current and quantum transport factor of fermionic system in fermionic bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the dynamics of current and the quantum transport factor in a fermionic system with a central oscillator interacting with two fermionic reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs. The current is analyzed in relation to system parameters and reservoir temperatures, revealing that the quantum transport factor differs from classical systems, approaching Carnot efficiency at high temperatures but being different at low temperatures. We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator. This work advances the understanding of quantum transport in fermionic systems and provides a foundation for future research in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We show that, upon the chemisorption of organic molecules, Co thin films display a number of unique magnetic properties, including the giant magnetic hardening and the violation of the Rayleigh law in magnetization reversal. These novel properties originate from the modification of the surface magnetic anisotropy induced by the molecule/film interaction: the {\pi}-d molecule/metal hybridization modifies the orbital population of the associated cobalt atoms and induces an additional and randomly oriented local anisotropy. Strong effects arise when the induced surface anisotropy is correlated over scales of a few molecules, and particularly when the correlation length of the random anisotropy field is comparable to the characteristic exchange length. This leads to the collapse of the standard domain structure and to the emergency of a glassy-type ferromagnetic state, defined by blurred pseudo-domains intertwined by diffuse and irregular domain walls. The magnetization reversal in such state was predicted to include topological vortex-like structures, successfully measured in this research by magnetic-force microscopy. Our work shows how the strong electronic interaction of standard components, Co thin films and readily available molecules, can generate structures with remarkable new magnetic properties, and thus opens a new avenue for the design of tailored-on-demand magnetic composites.</description>

      <title>Diverse electronic topography in a distorted kagome metal LaTi3Bi4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent reports on a family of kagome metals of the form LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) has stoked interest due to the combination of highly anisotropic magnetism and a rich electronic structure. The electronic structure near the Fermi level is proposed to exhibit Dirac points and van Hove singularities. In this manuscript, we use angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements in combination with density functional theory calculations to investigate the electronic structure of a newly discovered kagome metal LaTi3Bi4. Our results reveal multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs) with one VHS located in the vicinity of the Fermi level. We clearly observe two flat bands, which originate from the destructive interference of wave functions within the Ti kagome motif. These flat bands and VHSs originate from Ti d orbitals and are very responsive to the polarization of the incident beam. We notice a significant anisotropy in the electronic structure, resulting from the breaking of six fold rotational symmetry in this material. Our findings demonstrate this new family of Ti based kagome material as a promising platform to explore novel emerging phenomena in the wider LnTi3Bi4 (Ln= lanthanide) family of materials.</description>

      <title>Phonons in Electron Crystals with Berry Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in 2D materials featuring nonzero Berry curvature have inspired extensions of the Wigner crystallization paradigm. This paper derives a low-energy effective theory for such quantum crystals, including the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) with nonzero Chern number. First we show that the low frequency dispersion of phonons in AHC, despite the presence of Berry curvature, resembles that of the zero field (rather than finite magnetic field) Wigner crystal due to the commutation of translation generators. We explain how key parameters of the phonon theory such as elastic constants and effective mass can be extracted from microscopic models, and apply them to two families of models: the recently introduced $\lambda$-jellium model and a model of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In the $\lambda$-jellium model, we explore the energy landscape as crystal geometry shifts, revealing that AHC can become "soft" under certain conditions. This causes transitions in lattice geometry, although the quantized Hall response remains unchanged. Surprisingly, the Berry curvature seems to enhance the effective mass, leading to a reduction in phonon speed. For the AHC in RMG, we obtain estimates of phonon speed and shear stiffness. We also identify a previously overlooked "kineo-elastic" term in the phonon effective action that is present in the symmetry setting of RMG, and leads to dramatic differences in phonon speeds in opposite directions. We numerically confirm these predictions of the effective actions by time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations. Our work points to the wealth of new phenomena that can arise when electron crystallization occurs in the presence of band geometry and topology.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous transport and tunneling spectroscopy of moir\'e graphene: Distinct observation of the superconducting gap and signatures of nodal superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of superconductivity in magic-angle graphene remains challenging. A key difficulty lies in discerning the different energy scales in this strongly interacting system, particularly the superconducting gap. Here, we report the first simultaneous tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements of magic-angle graphene, providing a novel approach to probe the superconducting state. This approach allows us to identify two coexisting V-shaped tunneling gaps with different energy scales: a distinct low-energy superconducting gap that vanishes at the superconducting critical temperature and magnetic field, and a higher-energy pseudogap. The superconducting tunneling spectra display a linear gap-filling behavior with temperature and magnetic field and exhibit the Volovik effect, consistent with a nodal order parameter. Our work reveals the unconventional nature of the superconducting gap in magic-angle graphene and establishes an experimental framework for multidimensional investigation of tunable quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Analysis of the Non-Hermitian Electro-Optic Effect in Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we investigate how crystal symmetry tailors the non-Hermitian electro-optic effect arising from the Berry curvature dipole. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical influence of the material's point group symmetry and external electric biases in shaping this effect, leading to current-induced optical gain and non-reciprocal optical responses. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the crystallographic point groups, we identify how different symmetries affect the electro-optic response, enabling the engineering of polarization-dependent optical gain without the need for gyrotropic effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian electro-optic response in a broad class of crystals is characterized by linear dichroic gain. In this type of response, the eigenpolarizations that activate the gain or dissipation are linearly polarized. Depending on the point group symmetry, it is possible to achieve gain (or dissipation) for all eigenpolarizations or to observe polarization-dependent gain and dissipation. Weyl semimetals emerge as promising candidates for realizing significant non-Hermitian electro-optic effects and linear dichroic gain. We further examine practical applications by studying the reflectance of biased materials in setups involving mirrors, demonstrating how optical gain and attenuation can be controlled via symmetry and bias configurations.</description>

      <title>Magneto-rotation coupling for ferromagnetic nanoelement embedded in elastic substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates magneto-rotational coupling as a distinct contribution to magnetoelastic interactions, which can be influenced by magnetic anisotropy. We determine magneto-rotational coupling coefficients that incorporate the shape anisotropy of a magnetic nanoelement (strip) and demonstrate that this type of coupling can be modified through geometric adjustments. Furthermore, we analyze the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field in a ferromagnetic strip embedded in a nonmagnetic substrate. Both Rayleigh and Love waves are considered sources of the magnetoelastic field, and we examine how the strength of the magneto-rotational coupling varies with the direction of the in-plane applied magnetic field. We found that in the absence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field decreases with a reduction in the thickness-to-width ratio of the strip for a Rayleigh wave, whereas for a Love wave, it changes non-monotonically. These findings enhance the understanding of magneto-rotational coupling in magnonic nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Driven-dissipative turbulence in exciton-polariton quantum fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that energy dissipation in slowly-driven, Markovian quantum systems at low temperature is linked to the geometry of the driving protocol through the quantum (or Fubini-Study) metric. Utilizing these findings, we establish lower bounds on dissipation rates in two-tone protocols, such as those employed for topological frequency conversion. Notably, in appropriate limits these bounds are only determined by the topology of the protocol and an effective quality factor of the system-bath coupling. Our results bridge topological and geometric phenomena with energy dissipation in open quantum systems, and further provide design principles for optimal driving protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>A trilinear quantum dot architecture for semiconductor spin qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits hold significant potential for scaling to millions of qubits for practical quantum computing applications, as their structure highly resembles the structure of conventional transistors. Since classical semiconductor manufacturing technology has reached an unprecedented level of maturity, reliably mass-producing CMOS chips with hundreds of billions of components, conventional wisdom dictates that leveraging CMOS technologies for quantum dot qubits can result in upscaled quantum processors with thousands or even millions of interconnected qubits. However, the interconnect requirements for quantum circuits are very different from those for classical circuits, where for each qubit individual control and readout wiring could be needed. Although significant developments have been demonstrated on small scale systems, qubit numbers remain limited, to a large extent due to the lack of scalable qubit interconnect schemes. Here, we present a trilinear quantum dot array that is simple in physical layout while allowing individual wiring to each quantum dot. By means of electron shuttling, the trilinear architecture provides qubit connectivity that is equivalent to or even surpasses that of 2D square lattice. Assuming the current qubit fidelities of small-scale devices can be extrapolated to large-scale arrays, medium-length shuttling arrays on the order of tens of microns would allow million-scale qubit systems, while maintaining manageable overheads. We also present a scalable control scheme, where the qubit chip is 3D-integrated with a low-power switch-based cryoCMOS circuit for parallel qubit operation with limited control inputs. As our trilinear quantum dot array is fully compatible with existing semiconductor technologies, this qubit architecture represents one possible framework for future research and development of large-scale spin qubit systems.</description>

      <title>The nonlinear limit of Babinet's Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Babinet's principle is a powerful tool for predicting the scattering behavior of planar structures where the solution for the complementary structure is already known. This makes it ubiquitous in the design of aperture antennas or metamaterials. Even for plasmonic nanostructures, a qualitative match of the behavior for complementary structures has been reported. Here, we discuss whether Babinet's principle can be extended to nonlinear scattering. We compare the third harmonic emission of plasmonic nanorods and complementary nanoslits by far field imaging and simulation. We find significantly different far field images, in agreement between experiment and simulation. We explain these differences by the higher spatial resolution at the third harmonic wavelength and by additional eddy currents in slits that are not present in rods. Within these limits, Babinet's principle can guide the design of inverted nonlinear plasmonic resonators, which promise to be more stable at high excitation power due to better thermal conductivity.</description>
