      <title>Holographic Time Crystals vs Penrose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the large$-N$ limit, no known no-go theorem rules out thermal time crystals that spontaneously break continuous time-translation, unlike in the large volume limit. If thermal time crystals exist in holographic CFTs, they would correspond to ensemble-dominating black holes with eternally time-varying exterior geometries. We point out that recent work on a conjectured non-linear instability of slowly rotating Kerr-AdS$_4$ produced viable candidates for such states. Then we show that the existence of holographic microcanonical time crystals would imply violations of the AdS Penrose inequality (PI). We proceed to look for violations of the PI in spherical symmetry, working with Einstein-scalar gravity with the most general possible boundary conditions compatible with boundary conformal invariance. We derive a set of ODEs for maximally PI-violating initial data. Solving these numerically, we find strong evidence that in the particular case of spherical symmetry, the PI holds iff the positive mass theorem (PMT) holds. This suggests that holographic CFT$_3$ time crystals can only possibly exist at non-zero angular momentum, at least in the absence of electric charge. We also discover neutral hairy black holes in a consistent truncation of M-theory that has a PMT and boundary conditions respecting conformal invariance, disproving an existing no-hair conjecture. Finally, we show that previous PI-violating solutions by the author all existed in theories where the PMT is violated. Unfortunately, our results imply that there currently are no known examples where the PI functions as a non-trivial Swampland constraint.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Product Orbifold Universality and the Mirage of an Emergent Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermal two-point functions and four-point functions involving two heavy twisted operators and two light probes in symmetric product orbifolds. We identify cases where they are universal at large $N$, that is, they are only sensitive to the orbifold structure. Surprisingly, such observables mimic correlators obtained from the BTZ background, even though symmetric product orbifolds are not dual to semi-classical gravity. We discuss the interpretation of these results in light of the criteria for emergence of spacetime via Von Neumann algebras. Our analysis implies that a condition on the infinite $N$ thermal two-point functions cannot be stringent enough to define an emergent spacetime and the concept of a sharp horizon.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of dimensionally reduced gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensional reduction of gravity theories to $D=2$ along commuting Killing isometries is well-known to be classically integrable. The resulting system typically features a coset $\sigma$-model coupled to a dilaton and a scale factor of the dimensional reduction. In this article, we construct two families of deformations of dimensionally reduced gravity that preserve the Lax integrable structure.
  The first family is an extension of the Auxiliary Field Deformation recently introduced by Ferko and Smith, while the second family consists in the embedding of the Yang-Baxter $\sigma$-model into $D=2$ dimensionally reduced gravity. For both deformations we construct flat Lax representations. The Auxiliary Field Deformation, in particular, preserves the rich algebraic structure underlying the undeformed model and, leaving the canonical structure of the Lax connection's spatial components essentially unchanged, allows us to prove its integrability also in the Hamiltonian sense.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Magnetic Monopole Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the scattering of BPS magnetic monopoles through numerical simulations. We present an ansatz for various multi-monopole configurations suitable for analyzing monopole scattering processes. Our study includes planar scattering scenarios involving two, three, and four monopoles, as well as non-planar processes where three and four monopoles form intermediate tetrahedral and cubic states, respectively. Our observations align with the theoretical predictions of the moduli space approximation. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to relativistic velocities and explore parameters beyond the BPS limit.</description>

      <title>Zero Modes on the Light Front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modes with zero longitudinal light-front momentum (zero modes) do have roles to play in the analysis of light-front field theories. These range from improvements in convergence for numerical calculations to implications for the light-front vacuum and beyond to fundamental issues in the connection with equal-time quantization. In particular, the discrepancy in values of the critical coupling for $\phi^4_{1+1}$ theory, between equal-time and light-front quantizations, would appear to be resolvable with the proper treatment of zero modes and near-zero modes. We provide a survey of these issues and point to open questions.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion in super-renormalizable QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue regarding the high-power behavior of power-expansion/OPE-expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order in the large-$N$ expansion, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high-power terms in the coefficient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coefficient functions and operators only {\it off-diagonally} across different powers. The factorial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former are similar to ``UV renormalon'' of coefficient functions and cancel with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The later are similar to ``IR renormalon'' and cancel with factorial enhancements of renormalized operators at higher powers in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent.</description>

      <title>Specific Heats for Rotating Quantum BTZ Black Holes in Extended Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of extended thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ plays the role of a dynamical pressure $p$, its conjugate variable $V$ arises naturally. This makes it possible to define $C_p$ and $C_V$, the heat capacities at constant pressure and volume, respectively. We extend our previous work on the heat capacities of the static ``quantum" version of the BTZ black hole defined on a braneworld model to the case where the black hole is rotating. The extra degree of freedom that rotation grants the system imparts it with infinite families of both $C_p$ and $C_V$. We find exact formulae for these heat capacities as functions of the three dimensionless parameters of the theory, and explore some special cases in detail. In all cases considered, at least two physically realizable branches were observed, including both positive and negative heat capacities, signaling both stable and unstable black holes, respectively. Though the critical point seen in the static case disappears, other interesting points arise where the heat capacities diverge. Finally, we discuss the conjectured connection in the literature between the super-entropicity of a black hole and its instability, though much like in the static case, the exact relationship, if any, remains unclear.</description>

      <title>A Fuzzy Axiverse from String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, I showcase models for fuzzy axion dark matter within the framework of type IIB string theory, focusing on axions originating from the Ramond-Ramond four-form in compactifications on Calabi-Yau orientifold hypersurfaces. These models are amenable to cosmological tests if a substantial relic abundance of fuzzy dark matter is produced. I present a topologically exhaustive ensemble of more than 350{,}000 Calabi-Yau compactifications with up to seven axions together with a systematic analysis of the misalignment production of fuzzy dark matter. The resulting dark matter composition is generally a mixture of fuzzy axions and heavier axions, including the QCD axion. Dark photons frequently emerge due to the orientifold projection. I will also comment on applications of optimisation strategies based on automatic differentiation for exploring the string axiverse. This talk is partially based on arXiv:2412.12012.</description>

      <title>Courant Algebroid Relations, T-Dualities and Generalised Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of Courant algebroid relation is used to introduce a definition of relation between divergence operators on Courant algebroids. By introducing invariant divergence operators, a notion of generalised T-duality between divergences is presented through an existence and uniqueness result for related divergence operators on T-dual pairs of exact Courant algebroids, which naturally incorporates the dilaton shift. When combined with the notion of generalised isometry, this establishes circumstances under which generalised Ricci tensors are related, proving that T-duality is compatible with generalised string background equations. This enables an analysis of the compatibility between T-duality and generalised Ricci flow, showing that the T-dual of a solution of generalised Ricci flow is also a solution of generalised Ricci flow. Our constructions are illustrated through many explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Extended Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy: Ghost Condensate Dark Energy with Sextic Dispersion Relation in de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our studies of the ghost condensate (GC) with sixth-order dispersion relation. Contrary to the GC with quartic dispersion relation, we find that the correction to the Newtonian potential explicitly depends on the space and time dependence of matter density. At late times when the Newtonian potential becomes time-independent, one obtains similar oscillatory behavior at the distance $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{M^2}$, but this time at the time scale $\frac{M^4}{M_\textrm{Pl}^3}$, where $M^2$ is the ghost field velocity. We also show that the speed of gravitational wave is modified in a frequency dependent manner at momenta close to $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{\sqrt{|\sigma_1|}}$, where $\sigma_1$ is the coefficient of $\gamma^{ij} \nabla_i K_{lr} \nabla_j K^{lr}$ operator in the unitary gauge action.</description>

      <title>Minimal covariant quantum space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss minimal covariant quantum space-time ${\cal M}^{1,3}_0$, which is defined through the minimal doubleton representation of $\mathfrak{so}(4,2)$. An elementary definition in terms of generators and relations is given. This space is shown to admit a semi-classical interpretation as quantized twistor space ${\mathbb C} P^{1,2}$, viewed as a quantized $S^2$-bundle over a 3+1-dimensional $k=-1$ FLRW space-time. In particular we find an over-complete set of (quasi-) coherent states, with a large hierarchy between the uncertainty scale and the geometric curvature scale. This provides an interesting background for the IKKT model, leading to a $\mathfrak{hs}$-extended gravitational gauge theory, which is free of ghosts due to the constraints on phase space arising from the doubleton representation.</description>

      <title>Comment on "The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces" (arXiv:2308.06669v3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03294v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces'' by Carcassi, Calder\'on and Aidala (arXiv:2308.06669v3) is a thoughtful dissection of the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics that seeks to pinpoint difficulties inherent in postulating that the physical states are elements of a Hilbert space. Its pivotal charge against Hilbert spaces is that by a change of variables, which is a change-of-basis unitary transformation, one ``can map states with finite expectation values to those with infinite ones''. In the present comment it is shown that this statement is incorrect and the source of the error is spotted. In consequence, the purported example of a time evolution that makes ``the expectation value oscillate from finite to infinite in finite time" is also faulty, and the assertion that Hilbert spaces ``turn a potential infinity into an actual infinity'' is unsubstantiated. Two other objections to Hilbert spaces on physical grounds, both technically correct, are the isomorphism of separable Hilbert spaces and the unavoidable existence of infinite-expectation-value states. The former is of little relevance but the latter remains an issue without a fully satisfactory solution, although the evidence so far is that it is physically innocuous. All in all, while the authors' thesis that Hilbert spaces must be given up ought to be taken seriously, it seems insufficiently supported to be convincing.</description>

      <title>Generating logical magic states with the aid of non-Abelian topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing with the surface code, non-Clifford gates are crucial for universal computation. However, implementing these gates using methods like magic state distillation and code switching requires significant resources. In this work, we propose a new protocol that combines magic state preparation and code switching to realize logical non-Clifford operations with the potential for fault tolerance. Our approach begins with a special logical state in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ surface code. By applying a sequence of transformations, the system goes through different topological codes, including the non-Abelian $D_4$ quantum double model. This process ultimately produces a magic state in a condensed $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code, which enables the implementation of a logical $T$ gate in the standard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code. In our analysis, we employ a framework where the topological codes are represented by their topological orders and all the transformations are considered as topological manipulations such as gauging symmetries and condensing anyons. This perspective is particularly useful for understanding code switching between topological codes.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Meson Masses in SU(3) and SU(4) Extended Linear-Sigma Model at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study focuses on the mesonic potential contributions to the Lagrangian of the extended linear-sigma model (eLSM) for scalar and pseudoscalar meson fields across various quark flavors. The present study focuses on the low-energy phenomenology associated with quantum chromodynamics (QCD), where mesons and their interactions serve as the pertinent degrees of freedom, rather than the fundamental constituents of quarks and gluons. Given that SU(4) configurations are completely based on SU(3) configurations, the possible relationships between meson states in SU(3) and those in SU(4) are explored at finite temperature. Meson states, which are defined by distinct chiral properties, are grouped according to their orbital angular momentum $J$, parity $P$, and charge conjugation $C$. Consequently, this organization yields scalar mesons with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, pseudoscalar mesons with $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$, vector mesons with $J^{PC}=1^{--}$, and axialvector mesons with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$. We accomplished the derivation of analytical expressions for a total of seventeen noncharmed meson states and twenty-nine charmed meson states so that an analytical comparison of the noncharmed and charmed meson states at different temperatures becomes feasible and the contributions SU(3) and SU(4) configurations can be estimated, analytically.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering Processes with Continuous-Variable Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) using continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC). Focusing on ($1+1$)-dimensional $\varphi^4$ scalar field theory, the approach employs the Hamiltonian formalism to map the theory onto a spatial lattice, with fields represented as quantum harmonic oscillators. Using measurement-based quantum computing, we implement non-Gaussian operations for CQVC platforms. The study introduces methods for preparing initial states with specific momenta and simulating their evolution under the $\varphi^4$ Hamiltonian. Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions. Scattering simulations further illustrate how mass and coupling strength influence field dynamics and energy redistribution. Thus, we demonstrate CVQC's scalability for larger lattice systems and its potential for simulating more complex field theories.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic cosmology in $q$-deformed entropic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the implications of $q$-deformed theory on anisotropic Bianchi type-I cosmological model within the framework of Verlinde's entropic gravity. The $q$-deformed theory, rooted in quantum group structures, provides a natural generalization of classical particle dynamics and offers a useful framework for exploring deviations in standard cosmological models. By incorporating the principles of entropic gravity, which conceptualize gravity as an emergent entropic force, we derive the dynamical equations governing the Bianchi type-I anisotropic model influenced by $q$-deformation. Finally, we analyze the axisymmetric solution of Bianchi type-I model and these findings highlight the potential impact of $q$-deformation on the dynamics of the early universe and its subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>Complex entanglement entropy for complex conformal field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theory underlies critical ground states of quantum many-body systems. While conventional conformal field theory is associated with positive central charges, nonunitary conformal field theory with complex-valued central charges has recently been recognized as physically relevant. Here, we demonstrate that complex-valued entanglement entropy characterizes complex conformal field theory and critical phenomena of open quantum many-body systems. This is based on non-Hermitian reduced density matrices constructed from the combination of right and left ground states. Applying the density matrix renormalization group to non-Hermitian systems, we numerically calculate the complex entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian five-state Potts model, thereby confirming the scaling behavior predicted by complex conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature QCD crossover at non-zero chemical potential: A Dyson-Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study QCD at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential to derive the critical temperature at the chiral phase transition (crossover). We solve a set of Dyson--Schwinger partial differential equations using the exact solution for the Yang--Mills quantum field theory based on elliptical functions. Assuming a Nambu-Jona--Lasino (NJL) model of the quarks, we obtain a very good agreement with recent lattice computations regarding the dependence of the critical temperature on the strong coupling scale. The solution depends on a single scale parameter, as typical for the theory and already known from studies about asymptotic freedom. The analysis is analytically derived directly from QCD.</description>

      <title>Bounce solutions with quantum vacuum effects of massive fields and subsequent Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the previous work about the cosmological solutions with bounce without modifications of gravity or introducing an extra scalar field. The main finding was that the bounce is possible in the initially contracting Universe filled with matter. After a strong contraction, matter gains the equation of state close to the one of radiation, such that the effect on matter on the evolution of the FLRW metric disappears at the classical level. However, this effect comes back owing to the quantum trace anomaly in the matter/radiation sector. In the present contribution, we explore the weak impact of massive fields on the anomaly-driven bounce solution and discuss the role of the vacuum terms. The masses are assumed small and regarded as small perturbations, which enables using trace anomaly even in this case. On the other hand, by adding the $R^2$ term to the action, we arrive at the model with the trans-Planckian bounce and subsequent Starobinsky inflation. In such a framework, using the numerical analysis, we consider three scenarios providing bounce solutions.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Dark Energy and Dark Matter Phenomena Within the Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enigmatic phenomenon of dark energy (DE) is regarded as the elusive entity driving the accelerated expansion of our Universe. A plausible candidate for DE is the non-zero Einstein Cosmological Constant $\Lambda_{E}$ manifested as a constant energy density of the vacuum, yet it seemingly defies gravitational effects. In this work, we interpret the non-zero $\Lambda_{E}$ through the lens of scale-invariant cosmology. We revisit the conformal scale factor $\lambda$ and its defining equations within the Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) paradigm. Furthermore, we address the profound problem of the missing mass across galactic and extragalactic scales by deriving an MOND-like relation, $g \sim \sqrt{a_0\,g_N}$, within the SIV context. Remarkably, the values obtained for $\Lambda_{E}$ and the MOND fundamental acceleration, $a_0$, align with observed magnitudes, specifically, $a_0 \approx 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \, \mathrm{s}^{-2}$ and $\Lambda_{E} \approx 1.8 \times 10^{-52} \, \mathrm{m}^{-2}$. Moreover, we propose a novel early dark energy term, $\tilde{T}_{\mu\nu} \sim \kappa H$, within the SIV paradigm, which holds potential relevance for addressing the Hubble tension.

      <title>A Compact theorem on the compactness of ultra-compact objects with monotonically decreasing matter fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-gravitating horizonless ultra-compact objects that possess light rings have attracted the attention of physicists and mathematicians in recent years. In the present compact paper we raise the following physically interesting question: Is there a lower bound on the global compactness parameters ${\cal C}\equiv\text{max}_r\{2m(r)/r\}$ of spherically symmetric ultra-compact objects? Using the non-linearly coupled Einstein-matter field equations we explicitly prove that spatially regular ultra-compact objects with monotonically decreasing density functions (or monotonically decreasing radial pressure functions) are characterized by the lower bound ${\cal C}\geq1/3$ on their dimensionless compactness parameters.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Vacuum Condensate Stars in the Effective Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low energy effective theory of gravity comprises two elements of quantum theory joined to classical general relativity. The first is the quantum conformal anomaly, which is responsible for macroscopic correlations on light cones and a stress tensor that can strongly modify the classical geometry at black hole horizons. The second is the formulation of vacuum energy as $\Lambda_{\rm eff}\!\propto\! F^2$ in terms of an exact $4$-form abelian gauge field strength $F\!=\!dA$. When $A$ is identified with the Chern-Simons $3$-form of the Euler class, defined in terms of the spin connection, a $J\cdot A$ interaction is generated by the conformal anomaly of massless fermions. Due to the extreme blueshifting of local frequencies in the near-horizon region of a `black hole,' the lightest fermions of the Standard Model can be treated as massless there, contributing to the anomaly and providing a $3$-current source $J$ for the `Maxwell' equation $d\ast F = \ast J$. In this phase boundary region, torsion is activated, and $F$ can change rapidly. The Schwarzschild black hole horizon is thereby replaced by a surface, with a positive surface tension and $\mathbb{R}\otimes \mathbb{S}^2$ worldtube topology, separating regions of differing vacuum energy. The result is a gravitational vacuum condensate star, a cold, compact, horizonless object with a $p_{_V}\!=\! - \rho_{_V}$ zero entropy, non-singular de Sitter interior and thin quantum phase boundary layer at the Schwarzschild radius $2GM/c^2$.</description>

      <title>Primordial Sharp Features through the Nonlinear Regime of Structure Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sudden violations of the slow-roll regime during inflation, a natural prediction of many UV-complete inflationary models, give rise to sharp features in the primordial power spectrum. At large scales, these features provide a unique window into the physics of inflation, with constraints primarily derived from Cosmic Microwave Background observations of linearly evolved primordial fluctuations. However, on smaller scales, it is less clear whether primordial features would survive the late-time nonlinear cosmological evolution, as they are expected to be washed out by mode coupling. In this paper, we run dedicated N-body simulations to tackle this question. We demonstrate that, while oscillatory-like patterns are erased over time by nonlinearities, signatures of primordial sharp features can persist through the nonlinear regime of structure formation. Those take the form of a localised power enhancement or decrease in the matter power spectrum, whose amplitude and position can in principle be used to recover the scale of the primordial feature, and an oscillatory pattern in the halo mass function. While these findings highlight the power for constraining inflationary physics at small scales, they also show the challenges posed by potential degeneracies with other physical processes relevant in the nonlinear regime of structure formation such as non-cold dark matter candidates. Our results open new avenues for probing inflationary physics in large scale structures and galactic physics and emphasise the need for refined theoretical tools to robustly constrain primordial features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop methods for computing the effective action at infinite momentum for $1+1d$ QFTs at finite volume which do not rely on the theory having a Lagrangian description. We do this by taking the infinite momentum limit of equal-time quantization and integrating out all except for the chiral modes of the theory. Our main application of this method is to the Ising Field Theory (IFT), with an energy and magnetic deformation, where we compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian numerically and check it against results from TCSA. Remarkably, in the low-temperature phase, the Lorentz invariant effective Hamiltonian at infinite momentum takes a very compact form and depends on the volume only through the finite volume vacuum expectation value of $\langle\sigma\rangle$, the spin operator.</description>

Abstract: We study finite-coupling effects of QFT on a rigid de Sitter (dS) background taking the $O(N)$ vector model at large $N$ as a solvable example. Extending standard large $N$ techniques to the dS background, we analyze the phase structure and late-time four-point functions. Explicit computations reveal that the spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries is prohibited due to strong IR effects, akin to flat two-dimensional space. Resumming loop diagrams, we compute the late-time four-point functions of vector fields at large $N$, demonstrating that their spectral density is meromorphic in the spectral plane and positive along the principal series. These results offer highly nontrivial checks of unitarity and analyticity for cosmological correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03748v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the path integral formalism, we compute the disk partition functions of two dimensional Liouville and JT quantum gravity theories coupled to a matter CFT of central charge $c$, with cosmological constant $\Lambda$, in the limit $c\rightarrow -\infty$, $|\Lambda|\rightarrow\infty$, for fixed $\Lambda/c$ and fixed and finite disk boundary length $\ell$, to leading and first subleading order in the $1/|c|$ expansion. In the case of Liouville theory, we find perfect agreement with the asymptotic expansion of the known exact FZZT partition function. In the case of JT gravity, we obtain the first explicit results for the partition functions at finite cut-off, in the three versions (negative, zero and positive curvature) of the model. Our findings are in agreement with predictions from the recent proposal for a microscopic definition of JT gravity, including the $c\rightarrow -\infty$ expansion of the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary. In the negative curvature case, we also provide evidence for the emergence of an effective Schwarzian description at length scales much greater than the curvature length scale.</description>

      <title>One-form symmetries and the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $A$-model: Topologically twisted indices and CS theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18141v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter gauge theories with a one-form symmetry in the $A$-model formalism on $\Sigma_g\times S^1$. We explicitly compute expectation values of topological line operators that implement the one-form symmetry. This allows us to compute the topologically twisted index on the closed Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$ for any real compact gauge group $G$ as long as the ground states are all bosonic. All computations are carried out in the effective $A$-model on $\Sigma_g$, whose $S^1$ ground states are the so-called Bethe vacua. We discuss how the 3d one-form symmetry acts on the Bethe vacua, and also how its 't Hooft anomaly constrains the vacuum structure. In the special case of the $\text{SU}(N)_K$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory, we obtain results for the $(\text{SU}(N)/\mathbb Z_r)^{\theta}_K$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theories, for all non-anomalous $\mathbb Z_r \subseteq \mathbb Z_N$ subgroups of the centre of the gauge group, and with a $\mathbb Z_r$ $\theta$-angle turned on. In the special cases with $N$ even, $\frac{N}{r}$ odd and $\frac{K}{r}$ even, we find a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between gravity and the $\mathbb Z_r^{(1)}$ one-form symmetry of the $\text{SU}(N)_K$ theory, and the infrared 3d TQFT after gauging is spin. In all cases, we count the Bethe states and the higher-genus states in terms of refinements of Jordan's totient function. This counting gives us the twisted indices if and only if the infrared 3d TQFT is bosonic. Our results lead to precise conjectures about integrality of indices, which appear to have a strong number-theoretic flavour. Note: this paper directly builds upon unpublished notes by Brian Willett from 2020.</description>

      <title>Stability and topological nature of charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in five dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of Reissner-Nordstrom Gauss-Bonnet (RN-GB) black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space with three horizon geometries (k=+1,0,-1) within the grand canonical ensemble. Using the recently developed topological approach to black hole thermodynamics, inspired by Duan's $\phi$-mapping theory, we analyze the black holes by treating both critical points in the phase diagram and black hole solutions as defects in the thermodynamic parameter space. Our results show that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling significantly alters the topological classification of RN-GB AdS black holes, distinguishing them from their RN AdS counterparts in the grand canonical ensemble, while aligning with their canonical ensemble counterparts. Complementary analyses of local stability using specific heat validate the implication of topological analysis. Furthermore, an evaluation of global stability via Gibbs free energy provides a comprehensive understanding on the system's phase structure. Notably, for k=+1, topological analysis suggests liquid-gas type phase transitions, whereas global analysis favors Hawking-Page transitions. For k=-1, topology indicates a single stable black hole branch, yet the global analysis reveals the presence of Hawking-Page transition.</description>

      <title>Generalized volume-complexity for Lovelock black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time dependence of the generalized complexity of Lovelock black holes using the ``complexity = anything" conjecture, which expands upon the notion of ``complexity = volume" and generates a large class of observables. By applying a specific condition, a more limited class can be chosen, whose time growth is equivalent to a conserved momentum. Specifically, we investigate the numerical full time behavior of complexity time rate, focusing on the second and third orders of Lovelock theory coupled with Maxwell term, incorporating an additional term -- the square of the Weyl tensor of the background spacetime -- into the generalization function. Furthermore, we repeat the analysis for case with three additional scalar terms: the square of Riemann and Ricci tensors, and the Ricci scalar for second-order gravity (Gauss-Bonnet) showing how these terms can affect to multiple asymptotic behavior of time. We study how the phase transition of generalized complexity and its time evolution occur at turning point $(\tau_{turning})$ where the maximal generalized volume supersedes another branch. Additionally, we discuss the late time behavior, focusing on proportionality of the complexity time rate to the difference of temperature times entropy at the two horizons ($TS(r_+)-TS(r_-)$) for charged black holes, which can be corrected by generalization function of each radius in generalized case. In this limit, we also explore near singularity structure by approximating spacetime to Kasner metrics and finding possible values of complexity growth rate with different choices of the generalization function.</description>

      <title>The Moduli Space Curvature and the Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unveil a remarkable interplay between rigid field theories (RFTs), charge-to-mass ratios $\gamma$ and scalar curvature divergences $\mathsf{R}_{\rm div}$ in the vector multiplet moduli space of 4d ${\cal N}=2$ supergravities, obtained upon compactifying type II string theory on Calabi--Yau threefolds. We show that the condition to obtain an RFT that decouples from gravity implies a divergence in the $\gamma$ of (would-be) BPS particles charged under the rigid theory, and vice-versa. For weak coupling limits, where the scalar curvature diverges, we argue that such BPS particles exist and that $\mathsf{R}_{\rm div} \lesssim \gamma^2$, implying that all these divergences are a consequence of RFT limits. More precisely, along geodesics we find that $\mathsf{R}_{\rm div} \sim (\Lambda_{\rm wgc}/\Lambda_g)^2$, where $\Lambda_{\rm wgc} \equiv g_{\rm rigid} M_{\rm Pl}$ is the RFT cut-off estimate of the Weak Gravity Conjecture and $\Lambda_g = g_{\rm rigid}^{-2} \Lambda_{\rm RFT}$ the electrostatic energy integrated up to its actual cut-off $\Lambda_{\rm RFT}$.</description>

      <title>Mode-sum prescription for renormalized expectation values for a charged quantum scalar field on a charged black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new mode-sum prescription for the efficient computation of renormalized expectation values for a massive, charged, quantum scalar field propagating on a curved space-time background. Our method is applicable to any static, spherically-symmetric, four-dimensional space-time with a time-independent, background electrostatic potential and can be used to find the renormalized scalar condensate, current and stress-energy tensor. As an explicit example, we present a calculation of these quantities for a charged scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state on a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole background.</description>

      <title>Superstring amplitudes from BCJ numerators at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a direct map that determines moduli-space integrands for one-loop superstring amplitudes in terms of field-theory loop integrands in the BCJ form. The latter can be computed using efficient unitarity methods, so our map provides an alternative to worldsheet CFT techniques. This construction is a one-loop higher-point analogue of a recent conjecture for the three-loop four-point superstring amplitude. Based on the one-loop chiral-splitting representation, we show how all coefficients of an ansatz for the superstring can be identified with field-theory BCJ numerators, up to at least 7-point amplitudes. Moreover, we obtain partial results for all higher-point amplitudes. The monodromy constraints associated to chiral splitting play a crucial role in determining coefficients of the ansatz that, naively, are not fixed by the field-theory limit. Taking a field-theory perspective, our ansatz for the superstring implies by construction the existence of one-loop BCJ numerators at any multiplicity.</description>

      <title>How Einstein's Equation Emerges From CFT$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\it finiteness} of the mixed state entanglement entropies enables us to show that, the dynamical equation of the entanglement entropy in CFT$_2$ is precisely three dimensional Einstein's equation. A profound relation between the cosmological constant and CFT$_2$ entanglement entropy is given. Thus entanglement entropies induce internal gravitational geometries in CFT$_2$. Deriving the dual metric from an entanglement entropy becomes a trivial procedure. Surprisingly, we find that the renormalization group equation is a geometric identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the study of holographic superfluids from planar topology to spherical topology, inspired by recent studies on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) superfluid on shell-shaped geometry. We mainly focus on superfluid phase transition and Quasi Normal Modes (QNMs). It turns out that the critical temperature for the superfluid phase transition on the sphere is higher than that in the planar case. We investigated four different solutions in the backgrounds of large black hole and small black hole. The calculation of free energy selects the most stable solution. Finally, after calculating the quasi-normal modes and their dynamic behavior, we obtained three different channels similar to the planar superfluid case, along with the "first" hydrodynamic excitation, which may be associated with Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules (BKT) transition.</description>

Abstract: We investigate two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with affine $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ algebra symmetry. Their bosonic modular-invariant partition functions have been fully classified based on the ADE classification. In this work, we extend the classification to include fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with the same affine symmetries, utilizing techniques of fermionization and parafermionization. We find that the fermionic and parafermionic $\widehat{su}(2)$ models are related to non-simply laced Dynkin diagrams.</description>

      <title>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical properties of operator Krylov complexity for chords, establishing an equivalence between the chord number generating function and the crossed four-point correlation function. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model at infinite temperature. Finally, we examine the time evolution of operator Krylov complexity for a matter chord in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the real-time bulk AdS$_3$ two-into-two scattering amplitude of conical defects. This is done through means of a previously developed method of systematic approximation of the monodromy problem for the Virasoro blocks of the four-point HHHH correlator in 2d CFT in the large central charge regime. We find that dialing the external scaling dimension triggers a transition from a scattering phase to an intermediate black hole phase. This transition occurs before the individual heavy operators exceed the BTZ mass gap.</description>

      <title>Two-loop four-point amplitudes on the Coulomb branch of ${\mathcal{N}}=4$ super Yang-Mills</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore scattering amplitudes on the Coulomb branch of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We introduce a particular pattern of scalar vacuum expectation values that allow us to define amplitudes with a different mass pattern compared to what was studied previously. This is motivated by an extension of the Amplituhedron that leads to infrared-finite four-particle amplitudes involving massive particles. We work out the Feynman rules on the Coulomb branch and use them, together with generalized unitarity techniques, to perform consistency checks on the Amplituhedron expectations for the one- and two-loop integrands for the four-particle amplitude. We present details of the computation of the required two-loop four-point integrals via a four-dimensional version of the differential equations method. Finally, we study the Regge limit of the four-point amplitude, including the first power suppressed terms. We find that when organized in terms of a suitable expansion parameter, the subleading power term exponentiates, with the exponent matching the anomalous dimension of a cusped Wilson line with a local operator insertion. The latter is known from integrability, which leads to a prediction at higher loop orders in the Regge limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1810.03246v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates enumerative aspects of permutohedral blades, which provide a generalization of the notion of the tropical hyperplane arrangement. Blade provide the combinatorial underpinning of generalized biadjoint scalar scattering amplitudes in work of Cachazo, Early, Guevara and Mizera (CEGM). We construct a graded basis for a vector space of indicator functions of blades, with the grading determined by the dimension of the support of the function. We prove a Minkowski sum decomposition law into lines and tripods and we explore connections to the cohomology ring of certain moduli spaces and a non-planar analog of the square move for plabic graphs.
  We give a closed formula for the graded dimension of the basis. It is shown in an Appendix by Donghyun Kim that the coefficients appearing in the numerator of the generating function for the graded dimension are symmetric, and that they sum to $\frac{(2j)!}{j!}$. Unimodality is still open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying many-body quantum chaos is one of the big challenges in contemporary theoretical physics. We tackle this problem in the context of a set of perturbed quadratic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) Hamiltonians defined on graphs. This allows us to disentangle the geometrical properties of the underlying single-particle problem and the importance of the interaction terms, showing that the former is the dominant feature ensuring the single-particle to many-body chaotic transition. Our results are verified numerically with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, capable of extracting eigenvalues in a desired energy window of very large Hamiltonians. Our approach essentially provides a new way of viewing many-body chaos from a single-particle perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that every algebraic quantum field theory has an underlying functorial field theory which is defined on a suitable globally hyperbolic Lorentzian bordism pseudo-category. This means that globally hyperbolic Lorentzian bordisms between Cauchy surfaces arise naturally in the context of algebraic quantum field theory. The underlying functorial field theory encodes the time evolution of the original theory, but not its spatially local structure. As an illustrative application of these results, the algebraic and functorial descriptions of a free scalar quantum field are compared in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For neutron stars, there exist universal relations insensitive to the equation of states, the so called I-Love-Q relations, which show the connections among the moment of inertia, tidal Love number and quadrupole moment. In this paper, we show that these relations also apply to dark stars, bosonic or fermionic. The relations can be extended to higher ranges of the variables, clarifying the deviations for dark stars in the literature, as those curves all approximate the ones generated by a polytropic equation of state, when taking the low density (pressure) limit. Besides, we find that for equation of states with scaling symmetries, the I-Love-Q curves do not change when adjusting the scaling parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important question of quantum information is to characterize genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) resources necessary for universal quantum computing. Here, we use the Pauli spectrum to quantify how magic, beyond Clifford, typical many-qubit states are. We first present a phenomenological picture of the Pauli spectrum based on quantum typicality and then confirm it for Haar random states. We then introduce filtered stabilizer entropy, a magic measure that can resolve the difference between typical and atypical states. We proceed with the numerical study of the Pauli spectrum of states created by random circuits as well as for eigenstates of chaotic Hamiltonians. We find that in both cases the Pauli spectrum approaches the one of Haar random states, up to exponentially suppressed tails. Our results underscore differences between typical and atypical states from the point of view of quantum information.</description>

Abstract: In the last three decades, Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory (NSPT) has proven to be an excellent tool for calculating perturbative expansions in theories such as Lattice QCD, for which standard, diagrammatic perturbation theory is known to be cumbersome. Despite the significant success of this stochastic method and the improvements made in recent years, NSPT apparently cannot be successfully implemented in low-dimensional models due to the emergence of huge statistical fluctuations: as the perturbative order gets higher, the signal to noise ratio is simply not good enough. This does not come as a surprise, but on very general grounds, one would expect that the larger the number of degrees of freedom, the less severe the fluctuations will be. By simulating $2D$ $O(N)$ non-linear sigma models for different values of $N$, we show that indeed the fluctuations are tamed in the large $N$ limit, meeting our expectations: for a large number of internal degrees of freedom (i.e. for large enough $N$), NSPT perturbative computation can be pushed to large perturbative orders $n$. By re-expressing our perturbative expansions as power series in the $gN$ ('t Hooft) coupling, we show some evidence that at any given order $n$ there is a tendency to gaussianity for the stochastic process distributions at large $N$. By summing our series, we can verify leading order results for the energy and its (field theoretic) variance in the large $N$ limit. We finally establish general relationships between the various perturbative orders in the expansion of the (field theoretic) variance of a given observable and combinations of variances and covariances of given orders NSPT stochastic processes. Having established all this, we conclude discussing interesting applications of NSPT computations in the context of theories similar to $O(N)$ (i.e. $CP(N-1)$ models).</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dynamics in Interacting Scalar-Torsion f(T,$\phi$) Gravity: Investigating Energy and Momentum Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a homogeneous scalar field non-minimally coupled to torsion gravity, which also interacts with cold dark matter through energy and momentum transfer. The matter and radiation perfect fluids are modeled using the Sorkin-Schutz formalism. We identify scaling regimes of the field during both the radiation and matter eras. Additionally, we discovered a field-dominated scaling attractor; however, it does not exhibit accelerated expansion, making it unsuitable for describing dark energy. Nevertheless, we find two attractor solutions that do exhibit accelerated expansion: one is a quintessence-like fixed point, and the other is a de Sitter fixed point.</description>

      <title>Patterns of the $V_2$-polynomial of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kashaev and the first author defined a sequence $V_n$ of 2-variable knot polynomials with integer coefficients, coming from the $R$-matrix of a rank 2 Nichols algebra, the first polynomial been identified with the Links--Gould polynomial. In this note we present the results of the computation of the $V_n$ polynomials for $n=1,2,3,4$ and discover applications and emerging patterns, including unexpected Conway mutations that seem undetected by the $V_n$-polynomials as well as by Heegaard Floer Homology and Khovanov Homology. This is an updated version with links to data files.</description>

      <title>Geometrical origin for the compaction function for primordial black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometrical origin for the Shibata-Sasaki compaction function, which is known to be a reliable indicator of primordial black hole formation at least during radiation domination. In the long-wavelength limit, we identify it with a compactness function in the static spacetime obtained by removing the cosmological scale factor from the metric and this explains why it cannot be greater than $1/2$. If its maximum is below $1/2$, the perturbation is of type I. If its maximum equals $1/2$, it corresponds to an extremal surface, which is simultaneously a bifurcating trapping horizon and admits a circular photon orbit in the static spacetime. In the long-wavelength regime of the physical expanding Universe, the Shibata-Sasaki compaction reaches its maximum value of $1/2$ at maximal and minimal surfaces on the constant time spacelike hypersurface, which feature a type II perturbation and both correspond to photon spheres expanding along with the cosmological expansion. Thus, the Shibata-Sasaki compaction measures how close to the type II configuration the perturbed region is.</description>

      <title>Wigner distributions in Rindler spacetime and nonvacuum Minkowski states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, Fulling, Davies, and Unruh demonstrated that the vacuum state perceived by an inertial observer in Minkowski space appears as a thermal bath to a uniformly accelerated observer. We explore the transformation of the Wigner distribution of a real scalar field from an inertial to a Rindler frame, utilizing both Minkowski and Unruh modes. We present a general expression for the reduced Wigner distribution for a specific set of massless scalar field configurations, and validate it against known distributions within this set. This includes arbitrary Gaussian states of Unruh-Minkowski modes, the Minkowski vacuum state, the Rindler vacuum, and the thermal bath of Unruh particles. Additionally, we analyze several other distributions, such as a uniform momentum distribution, a slight deviation from the Minkowski vacuum, and a distribution with a Fermionic component in the Rindler frame. The conclusions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Multiseed Krylov complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity is an attractive measure for the rate at which quantum operators spread in the space of all possible operators under dynamical evolution. One expects that its late-time plateau would distinguish between integrable and chaotic dynamics, but its ability to do so depends precariously on the choice of the initial seed. We propose to apply such considerations not to a single operator, but simultaneously to a collection of initial seeds in the manner of the block-Lanczos algorithm. We furthermore suggest that this collection should comprise all simple (few-body) operators in the theory, which echoes the applications of Nielsen complexity to dynamical evolution. The resulting construction, unlike the conventional Krylov complexity, reliably distinguishes integrable and chaotic Hamiltonians without any need for fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Confinement and false vacuum decay on the Potts quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider non-equilibrium dynamics after quantum quenches in the mixed-field three-state Potts quantum chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Compared to the analogous setting for the Ising spin chain, the Potts model has a much richer phenomenology, which originates partly from baryonic excitations in the spectrum and partly from the various possible relative alignments of the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field. We obtain the excitation spectrum by combining semi-classical approximation and exact diagonalisation, and we use the results to explain the various dynamical behaviours we observe. Besides recovering dynamical confinement, as well as Wannier-Stark localisation due to Bloch oscillations similar to the Ising chain, a novel feature is the presence of baryonic excitations in the quench spectroscopy. In addition, when the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field are misaligned, both confinement and Bloch oscillations only result in partial localisation, with some correlations retaining an unsuppressed light-cone behaviour together with a corresponding growth of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>On the Unruh effect for hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18155v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, after the introduction of the notion of spacetime of maximal proper acceleration and its associated fundamental geometric and kinematic properties, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration. Such a generalization implies the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model of point charged particle in a spacetime of maximal proper acceleration. It is shown that according to this mathematical model, the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic relativistic viscous hydrodynamics from the Metropolis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for simulating stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. This is followed by proposing random (spatial) momentum transfers between fluid cells, keeping the total energy fixed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as a statistical weight. The algorithm reproduces relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the ``Density Frame", which is a formulation of viscous hydrodynamics we review and clarify here. This formulation is first order in time and requires no auxiliary dynamical fields such as $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$. The only parameters are the shear and bulk viscosities and the equation of state. By adopting the 3+1 split of general relativity, we extend the Metropolis algorithm to general space-time coordinates, such as Bjorken coordinates, which are commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.</description>
