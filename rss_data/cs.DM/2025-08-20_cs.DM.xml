      <title>A statistical test for network similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we revisit and expand our prior work on graph similarity. In this version of our work, we offer an extensive array of empirical tests. We also examine the sensitivity of our test to network variations. Our test performs exactly as expected, on synthetic and real-world graphs. It offers a very accurate measure of graph (dis)similarity.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Trees in Hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every proper edge-coloring of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ contains a rainbow copy of every tree $T$ on at most $n$ edges. This result is best possible, as $Q_n$ can be properly edge-colored using only $n$ colors while avoiding rainbow cycles.</description>

      <title>Incremental-Decremental Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for incremental-decremental maximization that captures the gradual transformation or renewal of infrastructures. In our model, an initial solution is transformed one element at a time and the utility of an intermediate solution is given by the sum of the utilities of the transformed and untransformed parts. We propose a simple randomized and a deterministic algorithm that both find an order in which to transform the elements while maintaining a large utility during all stages of transformation, relative to an optimum solution for the current stage. More specifically, our algorithms yield competitive solutions for utility functions of bounded curvature and/or generic submodularity ratio, and, in particular, for submodular functions, and gross substitute functions. Our results exhibit that incremental-decremental maximization is substantially more difficult than incremental maximization.</description>

      <title>Isolation of regular graphs, stars and $k$-chromatic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13709v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a set $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, we call a copy of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$ an $\mathcal{F}$-graph. The $\mathcal{F}$-isolation number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,\mathcal{F})$, is the size of a smallest set $D$ of vertices of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood of $D$ intersects the vertex sets of the $\mathcal{F}$-graphs contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G - N[D]$ contains no $\mathcal{F}$-graph). Thus, $\iota(G,\{K_1\})$ is the domination number of $G$. Clearly, $\iota(G, \mathcal{F}) \leq \iota(G, \mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{H})$. For any integer $k \geq 1$, let $\mathcal{F}_{0,k}$ be the set consisting of the $k$-star $K_{1,k}$, let $\mathcal{F}_{1,k}$ be the set of regular graphs whose degree is at least $k-1$, let $\mathcal{F}_{2,k}$ be the set of graphs whose chromatic number is at least $k$, and let $\mathcal{F}_{3,k}$ be the union $\mathcal{F}_{0,k} \cup \mathcal{F}_{1,k} \cup \mathcal{F}_{2,k}$. We prove that if $G$ is a connected $n$-vertex graph, then $\iota(G, \mathcal{F}_{3,k}) \leq \frac{n}{k+1}$ unless $G$ is a $k$-clique or $k = 2$ and $G$ is a $5$-cycle. This generalizes a classical bound of Ore on the domination number, a bound of Caro and Hansberg and of \.{Z}yli\'{n}ski on the vertex-edge domination number, a bound of Fenech, Kaemawichanurat and the author on the $k$-clique isolation number, a bound of the author on the cycle isolation number, and a bound of Caro and Hansberg on the $\mathcal{F}_{0,k}$-isolation number. The proof features a new strategy. For $i = 1, 2, 3$, the bound $\frac{n}{k+1}$ on $\iota(G, \mathcal{F}_{i,k})$ is attainable if $k+1$ divides $n$. Our second main result is that the bound $\frac{n}{k+1}$ on $\iota(G, \mathcal{F}_{0,k})$ is attainable if and only if $n$ is $0$ or $k+1$ or $2(k+1)$. We pose some problems and conjectures, and establish additional intriguing phenomena concerning $k$-star isolation and $k$-cycle isolation.</description>

      <title>Regenerative Ulam-von Neumann Algorithm: An Innovative Markov chain Monte Carlo Method for Matrix Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a regenerative variant of the classical Ulam-von Neumann Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the approximation of the matrix inverse. The algorithm presented in this paper, termed regenerative Ulam-von Neumann algorithm, utilizes the regenerative structure of classical, non-truncated Neumann series defined by a non-singular matrix and produces an estimator of the matrix inverse via ratios of unbiased estimators of the regenerative quantities. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm depends on a single parameter that controls the total number of simulated Markov transitions, thus avoiding the challenge of balancing between the total number of Markov chain replications and their length as in the classical Ulam-von Neumann algorithm. To efficiently utilize Markov chain transition samples in the calculation of the regenerative variables, the proposed algorithm automatically quantifies the contribution of each Markov transition to all regenerative quantities by a carefully designed updating scheme that utilized three separate matrices containing the current weights, total weights, and regenerative cycle count, respectively. A probabilistic analysis of the performance of the algorithm, including the variance of the estimator, is provided. Finally, numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture on isolation of graphs dominated by a vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A copy of a graph $F$ is called an $F$-copy. For any graph $G$, the $F$-isolation number of $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,F)$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$ of $D$ in $G$ intersects the vertex sets of the $F$-copies contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G-N[D]$ contains no $F$-copy). Thus, $\iota(G,K_1)$ is the domination number $\gamma(G)$ of $G$, and $\iota(G,K_2)$ is the vertex-edge domination number of $G$. We prove that if $F$ is a $k$-edge graph, $\gamma(F) = 1$ (that is, $F$ has a vertex that is adjacent to all the other vertices of $F$), and $G$ is a connected $m$-edge graph, then $\iota(G,F) \leq \big\lfloor \frac{m+1}{k+2} \big\rfloor$ unless $G$ is an $F$-copy or $F$ is a $3$-path and $G$ is a $6$-cycle. This was recently posed as a conjecture by Zhang and Wu, who settled the extreme case where $F$ is a star. The result for the other extreme case where $F$ is a clique had been obtained by Fenech, Kaemawichanurat and the present author. The bound is attainable for any $m \geq 0$ unless $1 \leq m = k \leq 2$. New ideas, including deletion methods and divisibility considerations, are introduced in the proof of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Path Eccentricity and Forbidden Induced Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The path eccentricity of a connected graph $G$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ has a path such that every vertex is at distance at most $k$ from the path. A result of Duffus, Jacobson, and Gould from 1981 states that every connected $\{\text{claw}, \text{net}\}$-free graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian path, that is, $G$ has path eccentricity $0$. Several more recent works identified various classes of connected graphs with path eccentricity at most $1$, or, equivalently, graphs having a spanning caterpillar, including connected $P_5$-free graphs, AT-free graphs, and biconvex graphs. Generalizing all these results, we apply the work on structural distance domination of Bacs\'o and Tuza [Discrete Math., 2012] and characterize, for every positive integer $k$, graphs such that every connected induced subgraph has path eccentricity less than $k$. More specifically, we show that every connected $\{S_{k}, T_{k}\}$-free graph has a path eccentricity less than $k$, where $S_k$ and $T_k$ are two specific graphs of path eccentricity $k$ (a subdivided claw and the line graph of such a graph). As a consequence, every connected $H$-free graph has path eccentricity less than $k$ if and only if $H$ is an induced subgraph of $3P_{k}$ or $P_{2k+1} + P_{k-1}$. For such cases, we also provide a robust polynomial-time algorithm that finds a path witnessing the upper bound on the path eccentricity. Our main result also answers an open question of Bastide, Hilaire, and Robinson [Discrete Math., 2025].</description>

      <title>Balanced connected partitions of edge-weighted graphs: Hardness and solving methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The balanced connected $k$-partition problem (\textsc{bcp}) is a classic problem, which consists in partitioning the set of vertices of a vertex-weighted connected graph into a collection of~$k$ classes such that each class induces a connected subgraph of \emph{roughly} the same weight. In this study, we investigate edge-weighted variants of $\textsc{bcp}$, where we are given a connected graph $G$, $k \in \Z_\ge$, and an edge-weight function $w \colon E(G)\to\Q_\ge$, and the goal is to compute a spanning $k$-forest~$\mathcal{T}$ of $G$ (i.e., a forest with exactly $k$ trees) that minimizes the weight of the heaviest tree in~$\mathcal{T}$ in the min-max version, or maximizes the weight of the lightest tree in~$\mathcal{T}$ in the max-min version. We show that both versions of this problem are $\NP$-hard on complete graphs with $k=2$, unweighted split graphs, and unweighted bipartite graphs with $k\geq 2$ fixed. Moreover, we prove that these problems do not admit subexponential-time algorithms, unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails. We focus on the min-max version and devise a tight $k$-approximation algorithm, compact and non-compact integer linear programming formulations, branch and cut, and branch and price algorithms. Finally, we present the outcomes of an experimental study on the performances of different solution methods. The source code of the complete implementation of the proposed algorithms is also available.</description>

      <title>Coloring Graphs With No Totally Odd Clique Immersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that graphs that do not contain a totally odd immersion of $K_t$ are $\mathcal{O}(t)$-colorable. In particular, we show that any graph with no totally odd immersion of $K_t$ is the union of a bipartite graph and a graph which forbids an immersion of $K_{\mathcal{O}(t)}$. Our results are algorithmic, and we give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm (in $t$) to find such a decomposition.</description>
