      <title>Ask for More Than Bayes Optimal: A Theory of Indecisions for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective classification frameworks are useful tools for automated decision making in highly risky scenarios, since they allow for a classifier to only make highly confident decisions, while abstaining from making a decision when it is not confident enough to do so, which is otherwise known as an indecision. For a given level of classification accuracy, we aim to make as many decisions as possible. For many problems, this can be achieved without abstaining from making decisions. But when the problem is hard enough, we show that we can still control the misclassification rate of a classifier up to any user specified level, while only abstaining from the minimum necessary amount of decisions, even if this level of misclassification is smaller than the Bayes optimal error rate. In many problem settings, the user could obtain a dramatic decrease in misclassification while only paying a comparatively small price in terms of indecisions.</description>

      <title>A Central Limit Theorem for the permutation importance measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random Forests have become a widely used tool in machine learning since their introduction in 2001, known for their strong performance in classification and regression tasks. One key feature of Random Forests is the Random Forest Permutation Importance Measure (RFPIM), an internal, non-parametric measure of variable importance. While widely used, theoretical work on RFPIM is sparse, and most research has focused on empirical findings. However, recent progress has been made, such as establishing consistency of the RFPIM, although a mathematical analysis of its asymptotic distribution is still missing. In this paper, we provide a formal proof of a Central Limit Theorem for RFPIM using U-Statistics theory. Our approach deviates from the conventional Random Forest model by assuming a random number of trees and imposing conditions on the regression functions and error terms, which must be bounded and additive, respectively. Our result aims at improving the theoretical understanding of RFPIM rather than conducting comprehensive hypothesis testing. However, our contributions provide a solid foundation and demonstrate the potential for future work to extend to practical applications which we also highlight with a small simulation study.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Surrogates in Conformal Inference of Individual Causal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) is essential for personalized decision making, yet causal inference has traditionally focused on aggregated treatment effects. While integrating conformal prediction with causal inference can provide valid uncertainty quantification for ITEs, the resulting prediction intervals are often excessively wide, limiting their practical utility. To address this limitation, we introduce \underline{S}urrogate-assisted \underline{C}onformal \underline{I}nference for \underline{E}fficient I\underline{N}dividual \underline{C}ausal \underline{E}ffects (SCIENCE), a framework designed to construct more efficient prediction intervals for ITEs. SCIENCE applies to various data configurations, including semi-supervised and surrogate-assisted semi-supervised learning. It accommodates covariate shifts between source data, which contain primary outcomes, and target data, which may include only surrogate outcomes or covariates. Leveraging semi-parametric efficiency theory, SCIENCE produces rate double-robust prediction intervals under mild rate convergence conditions, permitting the use of flexible non-parametric models to estimate nuisance functions. We quantify efficiency gains by comparing semi-parametric efficiency bounds with and without the incorporation of surrogates. Simulation studies demonstrate that our surrogate-assisted intervals offer substantial efficiency improvements over existing methods while maintaining valid group-conditional coverage. Applied to the phase 3 Moderna COVE COVID-19 vaccine trial, SCIENCE illustrates how multiple surrogate markers can be leveraged to generate more efficient prediction intervals.</description>

      <title>Even naive trees are consistent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06850v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decade has shed some light on theoretical properties such as their consistency for regression tasks. In the current paper, we propose a new class of very simple learners based on so-called naive trees. These naive trees partition the feature space completely at random and independent of the data. Although counter-intuitive, we prove these naive trees and ensembles are consistent under fairly general assumptions. However, naive trees appear to be too simple for actual application. We therefore analyze their finite sample properties in a simulation and small benchmark study. We find a slow convergence speed and a rather poor predictive performance. Based on these results, we finally discuss to what extent consistency proofs help to justify the application of complex learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>ROSE Random Forests for Robust Semiparametric Efficient Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely recognised that semiparametric efficient estimation can be hard to achieve in practice: estimators that are in theory efficient may require unattainable levels of accuracy for the estimation of complex nuisance functions. As a consequence, estimators deployed on real datasets are often chosen in a somewhat ad hoc fashion, and may suffer high variance. We study this gap between theory and practice in the context of a broad collection of semiparametric regression models that includes the generalised partially linear model. We advocate using estimators that are robust in the sense that they enjoy $\sqrt{n}$-consistent uniformly over a sufficiently rich class of distributions characterised by certain conditional expectations being estimable by user-chosen machine learning methods. We show that even asking for locally uniform estimation within such a class narrows down possible estimators to those parametrised by certain weight functions. Conversely, we show that such estimators do provide the desired uniform consistency and introduce a novel random forest-based procedure for estimating the optimal weights. We prove that the resulting estimator recovers a notion of $\textbf{ro}$bust $\textbf{s}$emiparametric $\textbf{e}$fficiency (ROSE) and provides a practical alternative to semiparametric efficient estimators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our ROSE random forest estimator in a variety of semiparametric settings on simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Optimality of the Right-Invariant Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss optimal next-sample prediction for families of probability distributions with a locally compact topological group structure. The right-invariant prior was previously shown to yield a posterior predictive distribution minimizing the worst-case Kullback-Leibler risk among all predictive procedures. However, the assumptions for the proof are so strong that they rarely hold in practice and it is unclear when the density functions used in the proof exist. Therefore, we provide a measure-theoretic proof using a more appropriate set of assumptions. As an application, we show a strong optimality result for next-sample prediction for multivariate normal distributions.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we derive the closed form formulae for moments of Student's t-distribution in the one dimensional case as well as in higher dimensions through a unified probability framework. Interestingly, the closed form expressions for the moments of Student's t-distribution can be written in terms of the familiar Gamma function, Kummer's confluent hypergeometric function, and the hypergeometric function.</description>

      <title>An Ising Similarity Regression Model for Modeling Multivariate Binary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dependence structure between response variables is an important component in the analysis of correlated multivariate data. This article focuses on modeling dependence structures in multivariate binary data, motivated by a study aiming to understand how patterns in different U.S. senators' votes are determined by similarities (or lack thereof) in their attributes, e.g., political parties and social network profiles. To address such a research question, we propose a new Ising similarity regression model which regresses pairwise interaction coefficients in the Ising model against a set of similarity measures available/constructed from covariates. Model selection approaches are further developed through regularizing the pseudo-likelihood function with an adaptive lasso penalty to enable the selection of relevant similarity measures. We establish estimation and selection consistency of the proposed estimator under a general setting where the number of similarity measures and responses tend to infinity. Simulation study demonstrates the strong finite sample performance of the proposed estimator, particularly compared with several existing Ising model estimators in estimating the matrix of pairwise interaction coefficients. Applying the Ising similarity regression model to a dataset of roll call voting records of 100 U.S. senators, we are able to quantify how similarities in senators' parties, businessman occupations and social network profiles drive their voting associations.</description>

      <title>Moving Aggregate Modified Autoregressive Copula-Based Time Series Models (MAGMAR-Copulas)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Copula-based time series models implicitly assume a finite Markov order. In reality a time series may not follow the Markov property. We modify the copula-based time series models by introducing a moving aggregate (MAG) part into the model updating equation. The functional form of the MAG-part is given as the inverse of a conditional copula. The resulting MAG-modified Autoregressive Copula-Based Time Series model (MAGMAR-Copula) is discussed in detail and distributional properties are derived in a D-vine framework. The model nests the classical ARMA model and can be interpreted as a non-linear generalization of the ARMA-model. The modeling performance is evaluated by modeling US inflation. Our model is competitive with benchmark models in terms of information criteria.</description>

      <title>Extremal graphical modeling with latent variables via convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extremal graphical models encode the conditional independence structure of multivariate extremes and provide a powerful tool for quantifying the risk of rare events. Prior work on learning these graphs from data has focused on the setting where all relevant variables are observed. For the popular class of H\"usler-Reiss models, we propose the \texttt{eglatent} method, a tractable convex program for learning extremal graphical models in the presence of latent variables. Our approach decomposes the H\"usler-Reiss precision matrix into a sparse component encoding the graphical structure among the observed variables after conditioning on the latent variables, and a low-rank component encoding the effect of a few latent variables on the observed variables. We provide finite-sample guarantees of \texttt{eglatent} and show that it consistently recovers the conditional graph as well as the number of latent variables. We highlight the improved performances of our approach on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Causal Invariance Learning via Efficient Optimization of a Nonconvex Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data from multiple environments offer valuable opportunities to uncover causal relationships among variables. Leveraging the assumption that the causal outcome model remains invariant across heterogeneous environments, state-of-the-art methods attempt to identify causal outcome models by learning invariant prediction models and rely on exhaustive searches over all (exponentially many) covariate subsets. These approaches present two major challenges: 1) determining the conditions under which the invariant prediction model aligns with the causal outcome model, and 2) devising computationally efficient causal discovery algorithms that scale polynomially, instead of exponentially, with the number of covariates. To address both challenges, we focus on the additive intervention regime and propose nearly necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring that the invariant prediction model matches the causal outcome model. Exploiting the essentially necessary identifiability conditions, we introduce Negative Weight Distributionally Robust Optimization (NegDRO), a nonconvex continuous minimax optimization whose global optimizer recovers the causal outcome model. Unlike standard group DRO problems that maximize over the simplex, NegDRO allows negative weights on environment losses, which break the convexity. Despite its nonconvexity, we demonstrate that a standard gradient method converges to the causal outcome model, and we establish the convergence rate with respect to the sample size and the number of iterations. Our algorithm avoids exhaustive search, making it scalable especially when the number of covariates is large. The numerical results further validate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>
