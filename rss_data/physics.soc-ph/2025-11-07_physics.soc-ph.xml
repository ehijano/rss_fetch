      <title>Assessing Climate Vulnerability Risk for Substations in Massachusetts Via Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric grid is increasingly vital, supporting essential services such as healthcare, heating and cooling transportation, telecommunications, and water systems. This growing dependence on reliable power underscores the need for enhanced grid resilience. This study presents Eversource's Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) for bulk distribution substations in Massachusetts, evaluating risks from storm surge, sea level rise, precipitation, and extreme temperatures. The focus is on developing a cost-efficient model to guide targeted resilience investments. This is achieved by overcoming the limitations of single-variable analyses through hazard-specific assessments that integrate spatial, climate, electrical asset, and other relevant data; and applying sensitivity analysis to establish data-driven thresholds for actionable climate risks. By integrating geospatial analysis and data modeling with power engineering principles, this study provides a practical and replicable framework for equitable, data-informed climate adaptation planning. The results indicate that thresholds for certain climate hazards can be highly sensitive and result in significantly larger sets of stations requiring mitigation measures to adequately adapt to climate change, indicating that high-fidelity long-term climate projections are critical.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM-based agents for social science research: insights from citation network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates their potential to encapsulate the logic and patterns inherent in human behavior simulation by leveraging extensive web data pre-training. However, the boundaries of LLM capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents. CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.</description>

      <title>The Normal, the Natural, and the Harmonic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Use is made of rigorous definitions for the terms normal, natural, and harmonic to reveal a number of unfamiliar aspects about them. The Gaussian distribution is not sufficient to determine who is normal, and fluctuations above or below a natural-growth curve may or may not be natural. A recipe for harmonically sustained natural growth requires that the overlap during the substitution process must be limited. As a consequence the overall growth process must experience good as well as bad 'seasons'.</description>

      <title>Legal Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two physical systems are correlated in such a way that they appear to instantaneously affect one another, regardless of the distance between them. As commonly understood, Bell's Theorem famously demonstrates that any causal explanation of entanglement must discard either locality (the principle that nothing, including information, travels faster than light) or classical notions of realism (or both). Drawing on this concept, several legal scholars have metaphorically described 'entangled' legal concepts. For instance, if a state's highest court redefines the concept of 'foreseeability' in negligence law, this redefinition alters the concept of 'reasonable care' immediately in the eyes of the law. Godfrey (2024) is the first work to mathematically model entangled legal concepts, particularly in the context of legal interpretation. Here, we extend the quantification to the formulation and delineation of law (lawmaking) and the adjudication of law (judgment). In so doing, we connect legal entanglement to Sichelman's (2022) work on legal entropy, complexity, and the informational content of law. In addition to quantifying entanglement across various legal contexts, our approach provides broader insights. For example, it offers a more comprehensive analysis of the uses and limits of 'modularity' in law--specifically, the role legal boundaries (spatial or intangible) play in reducing information costs within legal systems. Moreover, we discuss how our model can improve theories of legal artificial intelligence. Finally, we explore the application of legal theory back to physics. If quantum physical entanglement operates analogously to legal entanglement, it requires discarding both locality and classical realism, though not in the manner commonly imagined.</description>

      <title>P\'olya urn model for analysis of football passes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes pass networks in football (soccer) using a stochastic model known as the P\'olya urn. By focusing on preferential selection, it theoretically demonstrates that the time evolution of networks can be characterized by a single parameter. Building on this result, a data analysis method is proposed and applied to a large-scale public dataset of professional football matches. The statistical properties of the preferential-selection parameter are examined, demonstrating its correlation with pass accuracy and with mean pass difficulty. This method is applicable to various evolving networks.</description>

      <title>Sub-exponential Growth in Online Word Usage: A Piecewise Power-Law Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion of ideas and language in society has conventionally been described by S-shaped models, such as the logistic curve. However, the role of sub-exponential growth -a slower than exponential pattern known in epidemiology- has been largely overlooked in broader social phenomena. Here, we present a piecewise power-law model to characterize complex growth curves with a few parameters. We systematically analyzed a large-scale dataset of approximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked to Wikipedia vocabulary, and observed consistent patterns in web search trend data (English, Spanish, and Japanese). Our analysis of the 2,965 selected items reveals that about 55% (1,625 items) were found to have no abrupt jumps and were well captured by one or two segments. For single-segment curves, we found that (i) the mode of the shape parameter alpha was near 0.5, indicating prevalent sub-exponential growth; (ii) the ultimate diffusion scale is primarily determined by the growth rate R, with minor contributions from alpha or the duration T; and (iii) alpha showed a tendency to vary with the nature of the topic, being smaller for niche/local topics and larger for widely shared ones. Furthermore, a micro-behavioral model distinguishing outward contact with strangers from inward interaction within their community suggests that alpha can be interpreted as an index of the preference for outward-oriented communication. These findings suggest that sub-exponential growth is a common pattern of social diffusion, and our model provides a practical framework for consistently describing, comparing, and interpreting complex and diverse growth curves.</description>

      <title>Habitat fragmentation promotes spatial scale separation under resource competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Habitat fragmentation, often driven by human activities, alters ecological landscapes by disrupting connectivity and reshaping species interactions. In such fragmented environments, habitats can be modeled as networks, where individuals disperse across interconnected patches. We consider an intraspecific competition model, where individuals compete for space while dispersing according to a nonlinear random walk, capturing the heterogeneity of the network. The interplay between asymmetric competition, dispersal dynamics, and spatial heterogeneity leads to nonuniform species distribution: individuals with stronger competitive traits accumulate in central (hub) habitat patches, while those with weaker traits are displaced toward the periphery. We provide analytical insights into this mechanism, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrating how competition and spatial structure jointly influence species segregation. In the large-network limit, this effect becomes extreme, with dominant individuals disappearing from peripheral patches and subordinate ones from central regions, establishing spatial segregation. This pattern may create favorable conditions for speciation, as physical separation can reinforce divergence within the population over time.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale community organization governs epidemic onset and spread in metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how internal community structure shapes the course of epidemics remains a fundamental challenge in modeling real-world populations. Standard metapopulation models often assume uniform mixing within communities, overlooking how internal heterogeneity affects global outcomes. Here, we develop a general framework for epidemic spreading in hierarchically structured metapopulations, where individuals interact locally within dense communities and move across a broader network. We show that transmission dynamics are governed by the mesoscale organization of these communities: highly connected groups accelerate and amplify outbreaks, while less connected ones dampen spread. Through a combination of mean-field theory, spectral analysis, and stability methods, we reveal a direct link between internal connectivity and the emergence of uneven, spatially structured epidemic patterns. We further validate these predictions using real-world data, where social contact networks capture the local scale of transmission while spatial transport networks govern global connectivity, confirming the robustness of our framework across scales. These results demonstrate how community structure fundamentally governs the shape of epidemics in complex, networked populations, offering new insights into vulnerability, containment, and epidemic control.</description>

      <title>Structurally balanced growing network as randomized P\'olya urn process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a process of growth of a signed network that strictly adheres to Heider structural balance rules, resulting in two opposing, growing factions. New agents make contact with a random existing agent and join one of the factions with the bias $p$ towards the group they made contact with. The evolution of the group sizes can be mapped to a randomized P\'olya urn model. Aside from $p=1$, the relative sizes of the two factions always tend towards $1/2$, but the behavior differs in the anti-bias regime ($p&lt;1/2$) and the biased one ($p&gt;1/2$). In the anti-bias regime, the expected faction sizes converge toward equality, regardless of initial differences, while in the biased regime, initial size difference persists over time. This difference is obscured by fluctuations, with the faction size distribution remaining unimodal even above $p&gt;1/2$, up until a characteristic point $p^{ch}$, where it becomes bimodal, with initially larger and smaller factions featuring their own distinguishable peaks. We discuss several approaches to estimate this characteristic value. At $p=1$, differences between the relative sizes of factions can persist indefinitely, although still subject to fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Who cares about physics today? A marketing strategy for the survival of fundamental science and the benefit of society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0082</link>
      <description>arXiv:1210.0082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It would seem that the present dry economic times impose a very precise focus for science in general and physics in particular: research, possibly of applied type. However in doing so two basic pillars of a healthy future for science are being undermined: fundamental research and public engagement. The first is what makes applications possible in the first place, many times with a path from inception to implementation that is as long and indirect as poorly advertised. The second pillar, public engagement, is mostly regarded as a commodity: if there is good level of funding scientists can consider spending money for public relations otherwise this is the first thing scientists cut because it is the least necessary. On the contrary, public engagement in science is very much needed, at the very least because the public is either an enemy or an ally, as testified respectively by the climate change denial and the 2009 Shuttle mission that people wanted in order to service the Hubble Space Telescope for the last time. In this article I will make the case for why popularizing science should be a funding priority, instead of a commodity, for both nation-wide organizations and local research institutions. I will take examples from my personal background with the hope that they will serve to enlighten a more general picture and to frame the discussion around concrete issues and practical avenues to be pursued immediately.</description>

      <title>Who is the root in a syntactic dependency structure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The syntactic structure of a sentence can be described as a tree that indicates the syntactic relationships between words. In spite of significant progress in unsupervised methods that retrieve the syntactic structure of sentences, guessing the right direction of edges is still a challenge. As in a syntactic dependency structure edges are oriented away from the root, the challenge of guessing the right direction can be reduced to finding an undirected tree and the root. The limited performance of current unsupervised methods demonstrates the lack of a proper understanding of what a root vertex is from first principles. We consider an ensemble of centrality scores, some that only take into account the free tree (non-spatial scores) and others that take into account the position of vertices (spatial scores). We test the hypothesis that the root vertex is an important or central vertex of the syntactic dependency structure. We confirm the hypothesis in the sense that root vertices tend to have high centrality and that vertices of high centrality tend to be roots. The best performance in guessing the root is achieved by novel scores that only take into account the position of a vertex and that of its neighbours. We provide theoretical and empirical foundations towards a universal notion of rootness from a network science perspective.</description>

      <title>A Criminology of Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the possibility of reaching human-like Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains controversial, the likelihood that the future will be characterized by a society with a growing presence of autonomous machines is high. Autonomous AI agents are already deployed and active across several industries and digital environments and alongside human-human and human-machine interactions, machine-machine interactions are poised to become increasingly prevalent. Given these developments, I argue that criminology must begin to address the implications of this transition for crime and social control. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory and Woolgar's decades-old call for a sociology of machines -- frameworks that acquire renewed relevance with the rise of generative AI agents -- I contend that criminologists should move beyond conceiving AI solely as a tool. Instead, AI agents should be recognized as entities with agency encompassing computational, social, and legal dimensions. Building on the literature on AI safety, I thus examine the risks associated with the rise of multi-agent AI systems, proposing a dual taxonomy to characterize the channels through which interactions among AI agents may generate deviant, unlawful, or criminal outcomes. I then advance and discuss four key questions that warrant theoretical and empirical attention: (1) Can we assume that machines will simply mimic humans? (2) Will crime theories developed for humans suffice to explain deviant or criminal behaviors emerging from interactions between autonomous AI agents? (3) What types of criminal behaviors will be affected first? (4) How might this unprecedented societal shift impact policing? These questions underscore the urgent need for criminologists to theoretically and empirically engage with the implications of multi-agent AI systems for the study of crime and play a more active role in debates on AI safety and governance.</description>
