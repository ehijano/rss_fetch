      <title>Seismic wave propagation in viscoelastic media under Atangana-Baleanu fractional dynamics: Model formulation and numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a one-dimensional viscoelastic seismic-wave model driven by the Atangana-BaleanuCaputo fractional derivative with a non-singular Mittag-Leffler kernel. A finite-difference discretization in space and an Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector scheme in time are used to compute solutions for several fractional orders. Simulations indicate that fractional memory alters both attenuation and dispersion, leading to non-exponential energy decay compared with the classical integer-order case.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Formulation for Accurate and Robust Determination of Soil Shear Strength from Triaxial Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an extended formulation of the Least Squares with Virtual Displacements (LSVD) method for estimating shear strength parameters from multiple soil samples under varying resistance conditions including cohesionless, frictional, and mixed types. LSVD is designed to identify a common tangent across n Mohr circles, even in the presence of measurement errors that render an exact solution infeasible. Beyond its original linear formulation, we introduce generalized LSVD variants like logarithmic, parabolic, polynomial, power law and generalized forms allowing the method to adapt to diverse failure envelope shapes observed in geotechnical materials. We benchmark these variants against established approaches such as the p-q method and CTPAC, analyzing performance under synthetic noise to simulate measurement uncertainty. This provides a comparative framework to assess each method's robustness, especially considering their differing selections of representative points on the Mohr circles. The results highlight LSVD's flexibility and reliability in modeling complex soil behavior and suggest its potential as a versatile tool for geomechanical analysis.</description>

      <title>Seesaw of Saltwater and Inundation Drives Methane Emissions in Coastal Tidal Wetlands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wetlands are significant carbon sinks, yet methane emissions partially offset this function due to its high global warming potential. Coastal tidal wetlands, unlike non-tidal wetlands, are regulated by oceanic drivers like salinity gradients and tidal inundation, which strongly influence methane production and release but remain poorly represented in regional assessments. Here, we estimate methane emissions from U.S. East Coast tidal marshes, by integrating ocean model, remote sensing datasets, empirical relationships from metadata. Spatially, emissions reflect the combined effects of marsh extent and per-unit-area flux rates, with hotspots occurring under lower salinity, higher inundation, and lower latitudes. Temporally, temperature and salinity dominate decadal-scale interannual variability. Between 2001 to 2020, total methane emissions are estimated at 0.019 - 0.038 Tg yr-1, with local fluxes rate ranging from 0 to 20 g m-2 day-1. Following pronounced hydrological variability in the early 2000s, emissions have increased steadily since 2007 at approximately 802 t yr-1, driven by warming, freshening, and enhanced inundation. Projections under IPCC climate scenarios indicate that increasing inundation will amplify methane emissions with sea-level rise, until a threshold near 0.75 m SLR, beyond which saltwater intrusion increasingly suppresses further growth, highlighting the critical role of salinity-inundation interactions in coastal methane dynamics.</description>

      <title>The EEPAS Model Revisited: Statistical Formalism and a High-Performance, Reproducible Open-Source Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While short-term models such as the Short-Term Earthquake Probability (STEP) and Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) are well established and supported by open-source software, medium- to long-term models, notably the Every Earthquake a Precursor According to Scale (EEPAS) and Proximity to Past Earthquakes (PPE), remain under-documented and largely inaccessible. Despite outperforming time-invariant models in regional studies, their mathematical foundations are often insufficiently formalized. This study addresses these gaps by formally deriving the EEPAS and PPE models within the framework of inhomogeneous Poisson point processes and clarifying the connection between empirical $\Psi$-scaling regressions and likelihood-based inference. We introduce a fully automated, open-source Python implementation of EEPAS that combines analytical modeling with Numba JIT acceleration, NumPy vectorization, and joblib parallelization, all configured via modular JSON files for usability and reproducibility. Integration with pyCSEP enables standardized evaluation and comparison. When applied to the Italy HORUS dataset, our system reproduces published results within one hour using identical initialization settings. It also provides a comprehensive pipeline from raw catalog to parameter estimation, achieving improved log-likelihoods and passing strict consistency tests without manual $\Psi$ identification. We position our framework as part of a growing open-source ecosystem for seismological research that spans the full workflow from data acquisition to forecast evaluation. Our framework fills a key gap in this ecosystem by providing robust tools for medium- to long-term statistical modeling of earthquake catalogs, which is an essential but underserved component in probabilistic seismic forecasting.</description>

      <title>Multi-Model Ensemble and Reservoir Computing for River Discharge Prediction in Ungauged Basins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the necessity for accurate flood prediction, many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations. Although numerous models for daily river discharge prediction exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major challenge. We address this with a novel method, HYdrological Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER). Our approach applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 47 "uncalibrated" catchment-based conceptual hydrological models. A reservoir computing (RC) model, a type of machine learning model, is then trained via linear regression to correct BMA output errors, a non-iterative process ensuring computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the required BMA and RC weights by mapping them to catchment attributes from gauged basins, creating a generalizable framework. Evaluated on 87 Japanese basins, in a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE, of 0.59) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (NSE 0.64) but required only 3 % of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (where only ~20 % of basins are gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (NSE 0.51) by leveraging the physical structure of the ensemble. In contrast, the LSTM's performance degraded substantially (NSE -0.61) due to data insufficiency. These results demonstrate that calibrating individual conceptual hydrological models is unnecessary when using a sufficiently large ensemble that is assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge prediction, particularly in ungauged basins. By eliminating basin-specific calibration, HYPER offers a scalable, interpretable framework for accurate hydrological prediction in diverse data-scarce regions.</description>
