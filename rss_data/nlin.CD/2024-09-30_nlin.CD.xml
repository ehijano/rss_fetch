      <title>Stability analysis of a charged particle subject to two non-stationary currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non relativistic motions of a charged particle in the electromagnetic field generated by two parallel electrically neutral vertical wires carrying time depends currents. Under quantitative conditions on the currents we prove the existence of a vertical strip of stable motions of the particle. The stable strip is contained in the plane of the two wires and the stability is understood in a stronger sense than the isoenergetic stability of Hamiltonian systems. Actually, also variations of the integral given by the linear momentum will be allowed.</description>

      <title>Harmonically Induced Shape Morphing of Bistable Buckled Beam with Static Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a constant static bias force on the dynamically induced shape morphing of a pre-buckled bistable beam, focusing on the beam's ability to change its vibration to be near different stable states under harmonic excitation. Our study explores four categories of oscillatory motions: switching, reverting, vacillating, and intra-well in the parameter space. We aim to achieve transitions between stable states of the pre-buckled bistable beam with minimal excitation amplitude. Our findings demonstrate the synergistic effects between dynamic excitation and static bias force, showing a broadening of the non-fractal region for switching behavior (i.e., switching from the first stable state to the second stable state) in the parameter space. This study advances the understanding of the dynamics of key structural components for multi-stable mechanical metamaterials, offering new possibilities for novel designs in adaptive applications.</description>

      <title>Harnessing and modulating chaos to sample from neural generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaos is generic in strongly-coupled recurrent networks of model neurons, and thought to be an easily accessible dynamical regime in the brain. While neural chaos is typically seen as an impediment to robust computation, we show how such chaos might play a functional role in allowing the brain to learn and sample from generative models. We construct architectures that combine a classic model of neural chaos either with a canonical generative modeling architecture or with energy-based models of neural memory. We show that these architectures have appealing properties for sampling, including easy biologically-plausible control of sampling rates via overall gain modulation.</description>

      <title>Influence of Feedback Phase on Time Delay Signature and Chaos Bandwidth in a Laser subject to Dual Optical Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor lasers subject to optical feedback can behave chaotically, which can be used as a source of randomness. The optical feedback, provided by mirrors at a distance, determines the characteristics of the chaos and thus the quality of the randomness. However, this fixed distance also shows itself in the intensity, an unwanted feature called the Time Delay Signature (TDS). One promising solution to suppress the TDS is using double optical feedback. We study this system numerically in this paper. In particular, we focus on the impact of the feedback phase, a sub-wavelength change in the position of the mirrors, on the TDS and chaos bandwidth (CBW) of the system. We show that by precisely setting the feedback parameters, including the feedback phases, the TDS can be suppressed, and that the feedback phase control is necessary rather than optional to robustly suppress the TDS. In addition, it is possible to suppress the TDS without loss of the CBW. At strong feedback rates the system can restabilize, and one can switch between a chaotic and steady state by changing only the feedback phase. Finally, we relate the feedback phase sensitivity to interference between the two delayed signals. This system is promising for applications of chaotic lasers as one can either suppress the TDS or increase the CBW.</description>
