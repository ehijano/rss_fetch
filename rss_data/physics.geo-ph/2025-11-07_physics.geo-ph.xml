      <title>Inference of microporosity phase properties in heterogeneous carbonate rock with data assimilation techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate digital rock modeling of carbonate rocks is limited by the difficulty in acquiring morphological information on small-scale pore structures. Defined as microporosity phases in computed tomography (micro-CT) images, these small-scale pore structures may provide crucial connectivity between resolved pores (macroporosity). However, some carbonate rocks are heterogeneous, and high-resolution scans are resource-intensive, impeding comprehensive sampling of microporosity phases. In this context, we propose the usage of the ensemble smoother multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) algorithm to infer the multiphase flow properties of microporosity phases from experimental observations for digital rock modeling. The algorithm's effectiveness and compatibility are validated through a case study on a set of mm-scale Estaillades drainage image data. The case study applies ESMDA to two capillary pressure models to infer the multiphase flow properties of microporosity phases. The capillary pressure curve and saturation map were used as observations to predict wetting phase saturation at six capillary pressure steps during iterative data assimilation. The ESMDA algorithm demonstrates improved performance with increasingly comprehensive observation data inputs, achieving better prediction than recently published alternative techniques. Additionally, ESMDA can assess the consistency between various forward physical models and experimental observations, serving as a diagnostic tool for future characterization. Given the diverse application conditions, we propose that ESMDA can be a general method in the characterization workflow of carbonate rocks.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Driven Downscaling for Climate Risk Assessment of Projected Temperature Extremes in the Nordic Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid changes and increasing climatic variability across the widely varied Koppen-Geiger regions of northern Europe generate significant needs for adaptation. Regional planning needs high-resolution projected temperatures. This work presents an integrative downscaling framework that incorporates Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), and Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer with Attention and Imbalance-Aware Network (GeoStaNet) models. The framework is evaluated with a multicriteria decision system, Deep Learning-TOPSIS (DL-TOPSIS), for ten strategically chosen meteorological stations encompassing the temperate oceanic (Cfb), subpolar oceanic (Cfc), warm-summer continental (Dfb), and subarctic (Dfc) climate regions. Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2-LM) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) outputs were bias-corrected during the 1951-2014 period and subsequently validated against earlier observations of day-to-day temperature metrics and diurnal range statistics. The ViT showed improved performance (Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.01 degrees C; R^2: 0.92), allowing for production of credible downscaled projections. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the Dfc and Dfb climate zones are projected to warm by 4.8 degrees C and 3.9 degrees C, respectively, by 2100, with expansion in the diurnal temperature range by more than 1.5 degrees C. The Time of Emergence signal first appears in subarctic winter seasons (Dfc: approximately 2032), signifying an urgent need for adaptation measures. The presented framework offers station-based, high-resolution estimates of uncertainties and extremes, with direct uses for adaptation policy over high-latitude regions with fast environmental change.</description>

      <title>GAIA: Geothermal Analytics and Intelligent Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geothermal field development typically involves complex processes that require multi-disciplinary expertise in each process. Thus, decision-making often demands the integration of geological, geophysical, reservoir engineering, and operational data under tight time constraints. We present Geothermal Analytics and Intelligent Agent, or GAIA, an AI-based system for automation and assistance in geothermal field development. GAIA consists of three core components: GAIA Agent, GAIA Chat, and GAIA Digital Twin, or DT, which together constitute an agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflow. Specifically, GAIA Agent, powered by a pre-trained large language model (LLM), designs and manages task pipelines by autonomously querying knowledge bases and orchestrating multi-step analyses. GAIA DT encapsulates classical and surrogate physics models, which, combined with built-in domain-specific subroutines and visualization tools, enable predictive modeling of geothermal systems. Lastly, GAIA Chat serves as a web-based interface for users, featuring a ChatGPT-like layout with additional functionalities such as interactive visualizations, parameter controls, and in-context document retrieval. To ensure GAIA's specialized capability for handling complex geothermal-related tasks, we curate a benchmark test set comprising various geothermal-related use cases, and we rigorously and continuously evaluate the system's performance. We envision GAIA as a pioneering step toward intelligent geothermal field development, capable of assisting human experts in decision-making, accelerating project workflows, and ultimately enabling automation of the development process.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Compound Flood Risk and Transition Zones via an Extended Joint Probability Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compound flooding from the combined effects of extreme storm surge, rainfall, and river flows poses significant risks to infrastructure and communities -- as demonstrated by hurricanes Isaac and Harvey. Yet, existing methods to quantify compound flood risk lack a unified probabilistic basis. Copula-based models capture the co-occurrence of flood drivers but not the likelihood of the flood response, while coupled hydrodynamic models simulate interactions but lack a probabilistic characterization of compound flood extremes. The Joint Probability Method (JPM), the foundation of coastal surge risk analysis, has never been formally extended to incorporate hydrologic drivers -- leaving a critical gap in quantifying compound flood risk and the statistical structure of compound flood transition zones (CFTZs). Here, we extend the JPM theory to hydrologic processes for quantifying the likelihood of compound flood depths across both tropical and non-tropical storms. This extended methodology incorporates rainfall fields, antecedent soil moisture, and baseflow alongside coastal storm surge, enabling: (1) a statistical description of the flood depth as the response to the joint distribution of hydrologic and coastal drivers, (2) a statistical delineation of the CFTZ based on exceedance probabilities, and (3) a systematic identification of design storms for specified return period flood depths, moving beyond design based solely on driver likelihoods. We demonstrate this method around Lake Maurepas, Louisiana. Results show a CFTZ more than double the area of prior event-specific delineations, with compound interactions increasing flood depths by up to 2.25 feet. This extended JPM provides a probabilistic foundation for compound flood risk assessment and planning.</description>

      <title>Insights on Numerical Damping Formulations Gained from Calibrating Two-Dimensional Ground Response Analyses at Downhole Array Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling seismic wave attenuation is critical for ground response analyses (GRAs), which aim to replicate local site effects in ground motions. However, theoretical transfer functions (TTFs) from GRAs often overestimate empirical transfer functions (ETFs) when the small-strain damping ratio ($D_{\text{min}}$) is set equal to laboratory measurements. Prior studies addressed this by inflating $D_{\text{min}}$ in one-dimensional (1D) GRAs to account for apparent damping mechanisms such as diffraction and mode conversions that cannot be captured in 1D. Although this approach improved fundamental-mode predictions, it often overdamped higher modes. This study explores more direct modeling of apparent damping using two-dimensional (2D) GRAs at four downhole array sites: Delaney Park (DPDA), I-15 (I15DA), Treasure Island (TIDA), and Garner Valley (GVDA). At each site, three numerical damping formulations, Full Rayleigh, Maxwell, and Rayleigh Mass, were implemented using both conventional $D_{\text{min}}$ and an inflated $D_{\text{min}}$ ($m \times D_{\text{min}}$) obtained from site-specific calibration. Results show that the appropriate $D_{\text{min}}$ multiplier ($m$) correlates with the site's velocity contrast. Using inflated $D_{\text{min}}$, Full Rayleigh and Maxwell damping systematically overdamped higher modes, with Maxwell damping also shifting modal peaks. In contrast, Rayleigh Mass damping consistently achieved the closest match to ETFs at three of the four sites while offering faster computational performance. These findings demonstrate that inflated $D_{\text{min}}$ can represent unmodeled attenuation in 2D GRAs, particularly at sites with low velocity contrast, and that frequency-dependent formulations such as Rayleigh Mass damping can more accurately predict site response than traditional frequency-independent approaches.</description>

      <title>SeismoStats: A Python Package for Statistical Seismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SeismoStats, a Python package that enables essential statistical seismology analyses, with a focus on well-established methods. The package provides user-friendly tools to download and manipulate earthquake catalogs, but also plotting functionalities to visualize them, as well as means to perform analyses such as estimating the a- and b-value of the Gutenberg-Richter law, or estimating the magnitude of completeness of any earthquake catalog. This is the first well-tested, well-documented, and openly accessible Python package with all these features. It is intended to serve as the nucleus of a long-term community effort, continually expanding in functionality through shared contributions. We invite seismologists and developers to contribute ideas and code to support and shape its future development.</description>

      <title>Super amplification of lunar response to gravitational waves driven by thick crust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moon has been long regarded as a natural resonator of gravitational waves (GWs) since 1960, showing great potential to fill the frequency gap left behind GW detections by ground- or space-based laser interferometry. However, the spatial variation of this amplification capacity on the Moon remains unclear. Here, we numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs by fully considering the fluctuant topography and laterally heterogeneous interior structures. Our results show that most regions on the Moon can amplify GWs with a ratio over 2, a finding significantly higher than previous estimations. Particularly, the amplification ratio can even reach factors of tens at the resonant frequency of ~0.015 Hz on the highlands surrounding the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, where the regional crust is the thickest. Our findings establish the thick-crust regions as critical zones of GW amplification, which is essential for future landing site selection and instrumental setting for GW detection on the Moon.</description>

      <title>A Geomechanically-Informed Framework for Wellbore Trajectory Prediction: Integrating First-Principles Kinematics with a Rigorous Derivation of Gated Recurrent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate wellbore trajectory prediction is a paramount challenge in subsurface engineering, governed by complex interactions between the drilling assembly and heterogeneous geological formations. This research establishes a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous framework for trajectory prediction that moves beyond empirical modeling to a geomechanically-informed, data-driven surrogate approach.The study leverages Log ASCII Standard (LAS) and wellbore deviation (DEV) data from 14 wells in the Gulfaks oil field, treating petrophysical logs not merely as input features, but as proxies for the mechanical properties of the rock that fundamentally govern drilling dynamics. A key contribution of this work is the formal derivation of wellbore kinematic models, including the Average Angle method and Dogleg Severity, from the first principles of vector calculus and differential geometry, contextualizing them as robust numerical integration schemes. The core of the predictive model is a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, for which we provide a complete, step-by-step derivation of the forward propagation dynamics and the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) training algorithm. This detailed theoretical exposition, often omitted in applied studies, clarifies the mechanisms by which the network learns temporal dependencies. The methodology encompasses a theoretically justified data preprocessing pipeline, including feature normalization, uniform depth resampling, and sequence generation. Trajectory post-processing and error analysis are conducted using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R2).</description>

      <title>Ionospheric responses over the Antarctic region to Intense Space Weather events: Plasma Convection vs. Auroral Precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present investigation is directed at exploring southern polar ionospheric responses to intense space weather events and their correlations with plasma convection and auroral precipitation. The main phases of six geomagnetic storms occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.</description>
