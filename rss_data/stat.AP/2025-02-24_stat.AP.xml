      <title>Distributed U-net model and Image Segmentation for Lung Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Until now, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, lung diseases, especially diseases such as lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), have become an urgent global health issue. In order to mitigate the goal problem, early detection and accurate diagnosis of these conditions are critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. To further research and reduce the error rate of hospital diagnoses, this comprehensive study explored the potential of computer-aided design (CAD) systems, especially utilizing advanced deep learning models such as U-Net. And compared with the literature content of other authors, this study explores the capabilities of U-Net in detail, and enhances the ability to simulate CAD systems through the VGG16 algorithm. An extensive dataset consisting of lung CT images and corresponding segmentation masks, curated collaboratively by multiple academic institutions, serves as the basis for empirical validation. In this paper, the efficiency of U-Net model is evaluated rigorously and precisely under multiple hardware configurations, such as single CPU, single GPU, distributed GPU and federated learning, and the effectiveness and development of the method in the segmentation task of lung disease are demonstrated. Empirical results clearly affirm the robust performance of the U-Net model, most effectively utilizing four GPUs for distributed learning, and these results highlight the potential of U-Net-based CAD systems for accurate and timely lung disease detection and diagnosis huge potential.</description>

      <title>Judging It, Washing It: Scoring and Greenwashing Corporate Climate Disclosures using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the use of large language models (LLMs) to both evaluate and greenwash corporate climate disclosures. First, we investigate the use of the LLM-as-a-Judge (LLMJ) methodology for scoring company-submitted reports on emissions reduction targets and progress. Second, we probe the behavior of an LLM when it is prompted to greenwash a response subject to accuracy and length constraints. Finally, we test the robustness of the LLMJ methodology against responses that may be greenwashed using an LLM. We find that two LLMJ scoring systems, numerical rating and pairwise comparison, are effective in distinguishing high-performing companies from others, with the pairwise comparison system showing greater robustness against LLM-greenwashed responses.</description>

      <title>Variational phylogenetic inference with products over bipartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian phylogenetics requires accurate and efficient approximation of posterior distributions over trees. In this work, we develop a variational Bayesian approach for ultrametric phylogenetic trees. We present a novel variational family based on coalescent times of a single-linkage clustering and derive a closed-form density of the resulting distribution over trees. Unlike existing methods for ultrametric trees, our method performs inference over all of tree space, it does not require any Markov chain Monte Carlo subroutines, and our variational family is differentiable. Through experiments on benchmark genomic datasets and an application to SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy while requiring significantly fewer gradient evaluations than existing state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Clustered Network Connectedness: A New Measurement Framework with Application to Global Equity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network connections, both across and within markets, are central in countless economic contexts. In recent decades, a large literature has developed and applied flexible methods for measuring network connectedness and its evolution, based on variance decompositions from vector autoregressions (VARs), as in Diebold and Yilmaz (2014). Those VARs are, however, typically identified using full orthogonalization (Sims, 1980), or no orthogonalization (Koop, Pesaran, and Potter, 1996; Pesaran and Shin, 1998), which, although useful, are special and extreme cases of a more general framework that we develop in this paper. In particular, we allow network nodes to be connected in "clusters", such as asset classes, industries, regions, etc., where shocks are orthogonal across clusters (Sims style orthogonalized identification) but correlated within clusters (Koop-Pesaran-Potter-Shin style generalized identification), so that the ordering of network nodes is relevant across clusters but irrelevant within clusters. After developing the clustered connectedness framework, we apply it in a detailed empirical exploration of sixteen country equity markets spanning three global regions.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Hybrid Design with Borrowing from Historical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In early phase drug development of combination therapy, the primary objective is to preliminarily assess whether there is additive activity from a novel agent when combined with an established monotherapy. Due to potential feasibility issues for conducting a large randomized study, uncontrolled single-arm trials have been the mainstream approach in cancer clinical trials. However, such trials often present significant challenges in deciding whether to proceed to the next phase of development due to the lack of randomization in traditional two-arm trials. A hybrid design, leveraging data from a completed historical clinical study of the monotherapy, offers a valuable option to enhance study efficiency and improve informed decision-making. Compared to traditional single-arm designs, the hybrid design may significantly enhance power by borrowing external information, enabling a more robust assessment of activity. The primary challenge of hybrid design lies in handling information borrowing. We introduce a Bayesian dynamic power prior (DPP) framework with three components of controlling amount of dynamic borrowing. The framework offers flexible study design options with explicit interpretation of borrowing, allowing customization according to specific needs. Furthermore, the posterior distribution in the proposed framework has a closed form, offering significant advantages in computational efficiency. The proposed framework's utility is demonstrated through simulations and a case study.</description>

      <title>The inverse Kalman filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the inverse Kalman filter (IKF), which enables exact matrix-vector multiplication between a covariance matrix from a dynamic linear model and any real-valued vector with linear computational cost. We integrate the IKF with the conjugate gradient algorithm, which substantially accelerates the computation of matrix inversion for a general form of covariance matrix, where other approximation approaches may not be directly applicable. We demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of the IKF approach through applications in nonparametric estimation of particle interaction functions, using both simulations and real cell trajectory data.</description>
