      <title>Discovering universal temperature regulation dynamics in animals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hibernation is an adaptation to extreme environmental seasonality that has been studied for almost 200 years, but our mechanistic understanding of the underlying physiological system remains lacking due to the partially observed nature of the system. During hibernation, small mammals, such as the Arctic ground squirrel, exhibit dramatic oscillations in body temperature, typically one of the only physiological states measured, of up to 40 $^{\circ}$C. These spikes are known as interbout arousals and typically occur 10-20 times throughout hibernation. The physiological mechanism that drives interbout arousals is unknown, but two distinct mechanisms have been hypothesized. Using model selection for partially observed systems, we are able to differentiate between these two mechanistic hypotheses using only body temperature data recorded from a free-ranging Arctic ground squirrel. We then modify our discovered physiological model of Arctic ground squirrel to include environmental information and find that we can qualitatively match body temperature data recorded from a wide range of species, including a bird, a shrew, and a bear, which also dynamically modulate body temperature. Our results suggest that a universal, environmentally sensitive mechanism could regulate body temperature across a diverse range of species -- a mechanistic restructuring of our current understanding of the physiological organization across species. While the findings presented here are applicable to thermophysiology, the general modeling procedure is applicable to time series data collected from partially observed biological, chemical, physical, mechanical, and cosmic systems for which the goal is to elucidate the underlying mechanism or control structure.</description>

      <title>Oscillation in the SIRS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the SIRS epidemic model, both analytically and on a square lattice. The analytic model has two stable solutions, post outbreak/epidemic (no infected, $I=0$) and the endemic state (constant number of infected: $I&gt;0$). When the model is implemented with noise, or on a lattice, a third state is possible, featuring regular oscillations. This is understood as a cycle of boom and bust, where an epidemic sweeps through, and dies out leaving a small number of isolated infecteds. As immunity wanes, herd immunity is lost throughout the population and the epidemic repeats. The key result is that the oscillation is an intrinsic feature of the system itself, not driven by external factors such as seasonality or behavioural changes. The model shows that non-seasonal oscillations, such as those observed for the omicron COVID variant, need no additional explanation such as the appearance of more infectious variants at regular intervals or coupling to behaviour. We infer that the loss of immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs on a timescale of about ten weeks.</description>

      <title>Bio-heat regimes in fractal-based models of tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous heat diffusion is investigated for biological tissues displaying a fractal structure and long-term thermal memory, which is modeled via a fractional derivative. For increasing values of the fractional derivation order, the tissue temperature displays three kinds of bio-heat regimes: damped (or sub-diffusive), critical damping and under-damped oscillations. The temperature profiles depend on the fractal dimension of the tissue but notably also on a parameter related to its topology: the spectral dimension. The parametric analysis reveals that these two parameters have antagonistic effects on the pseudo period of the temperature oscillations and their amplitudes. We discuss how our results might impact some treatment protocols.</description>

      <title>Intermittent flow paths in biofilms grown in a microfluidic channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biofilms exposed to flow experience shear stress, which leads to a competitive interaction between the growth and development of a biofilm and shearing. In this study, Pseudonomas fluorescene biofilm was grown in a microfluidic channel and exposed to forced flow of an aqueous solution of variable velocity. It can be observed that under certain conditions preferential flow paths form with a dynamic, but quasi-steady state interaction of growth, detachment, and re-attachment. We find that the regimes for preferential flow path development are determined by nutrient availability and the ratio of shear stress versus the biofilm's ability to resist shear forces. The intermittent regime of flow paths is mainly driven by the supply with nutrients, which we confirm by comparison with a numerical model based on coarse-grained molecular dynamics and Lattice Boltzmann hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>From Chaos to Coherence: Effects of High-Order Synaptic Correlations on Neural Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Network models have elucidated the interplay between structure and dynamics in biological neural networks, particularly the emergence of irregular and rhythmic activities in cortex. However, most studies have focused on networks with random or simple connectivity structures. Experimental observations find that high-order cortical connectivity patterns affect the temporal patterns of network activity, but a theory that relates such complex structure to network dynamics has yet to be developed. Here, we show that third- and higher-order cyclic correlations in synaptic connectivities greatly impact neuronal dynamics. Specifically, strong cyclic correlations in a network suppress chaotic dynamics, and promote oscillatory or fixed activity. The change in dynamics is related to the form of the unstable eigenvalues of the random connectivity matrix. A phase transition from chaotic to fixed or oscillatory activity coincides with the development of a cusp at the leading edge of the eigenvalue support. We also relate the dimensions of activity to the network structure.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber affects the lift of ray-inspired fins near a substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rays and skates tend to have different fin kinematics depending on their proximity to a ground plane such as the sea floor. Near the ground, rays tend to be more undulatory (high wavenumber), while far from the ground, rays tend to be more oscillatory (low wavenumber). It is unknown whether these differences are driven by hydrodynamics or other biological pressures. Here we show that near the ground, the time-averaged lift on a ray-like fin is highly dependent on wavenumber. We support our claims using a ray-inspired robotic rig that can produce oscillatory and undulatory motions on the same fin. Potential flow simulations reveal that lift is always negative because quasisteady forces overcome wake-induced forces. Three-dimensional flow measurements demonstrate that oscillatory wakes are more disrupted by the ground than undulatory wakes. All these effects lead to a suction force toward the ground that is stronger and more destabilizing for oscillatory fins than undulatory fins. Our results suggest that wavenumber plays a role in the near-ground dynamics of ray-like fins, particularly in terms of dorsoventral accelerations. The fact that lower wavenumber is linked with stronger suction forces offers a new way to interpret the depth-dependent kinematics of rays and ray-inspired robots.</description>

      <title>Unifying Interpretations of Phase Transitions in the Vicsek Model: Correlation Length as a Diagnostic Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vicsek Model is widely used in simulations of dry active matter. We re-examined two typical phase transitions in the original Vicsek model by using the velocity correlation length. One is the noise-driven disordered-to-ordered phase transition driven by noise, which was initially considered as a second-order transition (continuous transition), but was later demonstrated by Chate's detailed study to be a first-order transition. The other one is the disordered-to-ordered phase transition driven by average distance between particles, which is a second-order transition and satisfies the hyper-scaling relation of continuous transitions. We have discovered the change of correlation length during transition indicates a critical point in continuous transition while not in the discontinuous situation. We have also provided a method to classify phase transitions in active matter systems by using the correlation length and summarized previous work within the same framework. Finally, we end up with a potential application in experiments of bactirial swarms and robotic swarms. We hope our work paves the way for both theory and experiment development of active matter.</description>

      <title>Bridging-induced Aggregation in Neutral Polymers: Dynamics and Morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the aggregation behavior of neutral stiff (rod-like) and flexible polymer chains mediated by attractive crowders. Attractive crowders serve as bridging agents, inducing aggregation through effective intra-polymer attractions. The critical monomer-crowder attraction strength ($\epsilon_{mc}^*$) required for aggregation differs notably between rigid rods and flexible polymers. Interestingly, this aggregation threshold closely matches the critical attraction required for the extended-to-collapsed (coil-globule) transition of a single flexible polymer chain, suggesting a fundamental connection between single-chain collapse and multi-chain aggregation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $\epsilon_{mc}^*$ decreases with increasing system density and larger crowder sizes, highlighting the synergistic roles of crowding effects and crowder dimensions. Aggregate morphologies exhibit strong dependence on polymer flexibility: rigid rods predominantly form elongated cylindrical bundles, whereas flexible polymers aggregate into compact spherical clusters. These findings provide comprehensive insights into how bridging interactions driven by attractive crowders regulate polymer aggregation dynamics and morphologies, emphasizing the importance of polymer rigidity, crowder size, and system density.</description>

      <title>Influence of erythrocyte density on aggregability as a marker of cell age: Dissociation dynamics in extensional flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blood rheology and microcirculation are strongly influenced by red blood cell (RBC) aggregation. The aggregability of RBCs can vary significantly due to factors such as their mechanical and membrane surface properties, which are affected by cell aging in vivo. In this study, we investigate RBC aggregability as a function of their density, a marker of cell age and mechanical properties, by separating RBCs from healthy donors into different density fractions using Percoll density gradient centrifugation. We examine the dissociation rates of aggregates in a controlled medium supplemented with Dextran, employing an extensional flow technique based on hyperbolic microfluidic constrictions and image analysis, assisted by a convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to other techniques, our microfluidic experimental approach highlights the behavior of RBC aggregates in dynamic flow conditions relevant to microcirculation. Our results demonstrate that aggregate dissociation is strongly correlated with cell density and that aggregates formed from the denser fractions of RBCs are significantly more robust than those from the average cell population. This study provides insight into the effect of RBC aging in vivo on their mechanical properties and aggregability, underscoring the importance of further exploration of RBC aggregation in the context of cellular senescence and its potential implications for hemodynamics. Additionally, it suggests that this technique can complement existing methods for improved evaluation of RBC aggregability in health and disease.</description>

      <title>Patient-specific prediction of glioblastoma growth via reduced order modeling and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glioblastoma is among the most aggressive brain tumors in adults, characterized by patient-specific invasion patterns driven by the underlying brain microstructure. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept for a mathematical model of GBL growth, enabling real-time prediction and patient-specific parameter identification from longitudinal neuroimaging data.
  The framework exploits a diffuse-interface mathematical model to describe the tumor evolution and a reduced-order modeling strategy, relying on proper orthogonal decomposition, trained on synthetic data derived from patient-specific brain anatomies reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. A neural network surrogate learns the inverse mapping from tumor evolution to model parameters, achieving significant computational speed-up while preserving high accuracy.
  To ensure robustness and interpretability, we perform both global and local sensitivity analyses, identifying the key biophysical parameters governing tumor dynamics and assessing the stability of the inverse problem solution. These results establish a methodological foundation for future clinical deployment of patient-specific digital twins in neuro-oncology.</description>

      <title>Active Hydrodynamic Theory of Euchromatin and Heterochromatin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The genome contains genetic information essential for cell's life. The genome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its proper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments -- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active and silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work, we present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of euchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical forces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile stresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin droplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow, coalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such as gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations that drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the nucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These fluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously changing their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces, mechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's organization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding chromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.</description>
