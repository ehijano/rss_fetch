      <title>Efficient Model-Agnostic Continual Learning for Next POI Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation improves personalized location-based services by predicting users' next destinations based on their historical check-ins. However, most existing methods rely on static datasets and fixed models, limiting their ability to adapt to changes in user behavior over time. To address this limitation, we explore a novel task termed continual next POI recommendation, where models dynamically adapt to evolving user interests through continual updates. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires capturing shifting user behaviors while retaining previously learned knowledge. Moreover, it is essential to ensure efficiency in update time and memory usage for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose GIRAM (Generative Key-based Interest Retrieval and Adaptive Modeling), an efficient, model-agnostic framework that integrates context-aware sustained interests with recent interests. GIRAM comprises four components: (1) an interest memory to preserve historical preferences; (2) a context-aware key encoding module for unified interest key representation; (3) a generative key-based retrieval module to identify diverse and relevant sustained interests; and (4) an adaptive interest update and fusion module to update the interest memory and balance sustained and recent interests. In particular, GIRAM can be seamlessly integrated with existing next POI recommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GIRAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high efficiency in both update time and memory consumption.</description>

      <title>NeuroCLIP: Brain-Inspired Prompt Tuning for EEG-to-Image Multimodal Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in brain-inspired artificial intelligence have sought to align neural signals with visual semantics using multimodal models such as CLIP. However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality- level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.</description>

      <title>Sim4IA-Bench: A User Simulation Benchmark Suite for Next Query and Utterance Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Validating user simulation is a difficult task due to the lack of established measures and benchmarks, which makes it challenging to assess whether a simulator accurately reflects real user behavior. As part of the Sim4IA Micro-Shared Task at the Sim4IA Workshop, SIGIR 2025, we present Sim4IA-Bench, a simulation benchmark suit for the prediction of the next queries and utterances, the first of its kind in the IR com- munity. Our dataset as part of the suite comprises 160 real-world search sessions from the CORE search engine. For 70 of these sessions, up to 62 simulator runs are available, divided into Task A and Task B, in which different approaches predicted users next search queries or utterances. Sim4IA-Bench provides a basis for evaluating and comparing user simu- lation approaches and for developing new measures of simulator validity. Although modest in size, the suite represents the first publicly available benchmark that links real search sessions with simulated next-query pre- dictions. In addition to serving as a testbed for next query prediction, it also enables exploratory studies on query reformulation behavior, intent drift, and interaction-aware retrieval evaluation. We also introduce a new measure for evaluating next-query predictions in this task. By making the suite publicly available, we aim to promote reproducible research and stimulate further work on realistic and explainable user simulation for information access: https://github.com/irgroup/Sim4IA-Bench.</description>

      <title>Practical RAG Evaluation: A Rarity-Aware Set-Based Metric and Cost-Latency-Quality Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the guessing game in building production RAG. Classical rank-centric IR metrics (nDCG/MAP/MRR) are a poor fit for RAG, where LLMs consume a set of passages rather than a browsed list; position discounts and prevalence-blind aggregation miss what matters: whether the prompt at cutoff K contains the decisive evidence. Second, there is no standardized, reproducible way to build and audit golden sets. Third, leaderboards exist but lack end-to-end, on-corpus benchmarking that reflects production trade-offs. Fourth, how state-of-the-art embedding models handle proper-name identity signals and conversational noise remains opaque. To address these, we contribute: (1) RA-nWG@K, a rarity-aware, per-query-normalized set score, and operational ceilings via the pool-restricted oracle ceiling (PROC) and the percentage of PROC (%PROC) to separate retrieval from ordering headroom within a Cost-Latency-Quality (CLQ) lens; (2) rag-gs (MIT), a lean golden-set pipeline with Plackett-Luce listwise refinement whose iterative updates outperform single-shot LLM ranking; (3) a comprehensive benchmark on a production RAG (scientific-papers corpus) spanning dense retrieval, hybrid dense+BM25, embedding models and dimensions, cross-encoder rerankers, ANN (HNSW), and quantization; and (4) targeted diagnostics that quantify proper-name identity signal and conversational-noise sensitivity via identity-destroying and formatting ablations. Together, these components provide practitioner Pareto guidance and auditable guardrails to support reproducible, budget/SLA-aware decisions.</description>

      <title>Thinking Forward and Backward: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.</description>

      <title>Positional Bias in Long-Document Ranking: Impact, Assessment, and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01262v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tested over 20 Transformer models for ranking long documents (including recent LongP models trained with FlashAttention and RankGPT models "powered" by OpenAI and Anthropic cloud APIs). We compared them with the simple FirstP baseline, which applied the same model to truncated input (up to 512 tokens). On MS MARCO, TREC DL, and Robust04 no long-document model outperformed FirstP by more than 5% (on average). We hypothesized that this lack of improvement is not due to inherent model limitations, but due to benchmark positional bias (most relevant passages tend to occur early in documents), which is known to exist in MS MARCO. To confirm this, we analyzed positional relevance distributions across four long-document corpora (with six query sets) and observed the same early-position bias. Surprisingly, we also found bias in six BEIR collections, which are typically categorized as short-document datasets. We then introduced a new diagnostic dataset, MS MARCO FarRelevant, where relevant spans were deliberately placed beyond the first 512 tokens. On this dataset, many long-context models (including RankGPT) performed at random-baseline level, suggesting overfitting to positional bias. We also experimented with debiasing training data, but with limited success. Our findings (1) highlight the need for careful benchmark design in evaluating long-context models for document ranking, (2) identify model types that are more robust to positional bias, and (3) motivate further work on approaches to debias training data. We release our code and data to support further research.</description>

      <title>Read the Docs Before Rewriting: Equip Rewriter with Domain Knowledge via Continual Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based question-answering (QA) system enhances a large language model's knowledge by retrieving relevant documents based on user queries. Discrepancies between user queries and document phrasings often necessitate query rewriting. However, in specialized domains, the rewriter model may struggle due to limited domain-specific knowledge. To resolve this, we propose the R\&amp;R (Read the doc before Rewriting) rewriter, which involves continual pre-training on professional documents, akin to how students prepare for open-book exams by reviewing textbooks. Additionally, it can be combined with supervised fine-tuning for improved results. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that R\&amp;R excels in professional QA across multiple domains, effectively bridging the query-document gap, while maintaining good performance in general scenarios, thus advancing the application of RAG-based QA systems in specialized fields.</description>

      <title>Machine-Readable Ads: Accessibility and Trust Patterns for AI Web Agents interacting with Online Advertisements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous multimodal language models are rapidly evolving into web agents that can browse, click, and purchase items on behalf of users, posing a threat to display advertising designed for human eyes. Yet little is known about how these agents interact with ads or which design principles ensure reliable engagement. To address this, we ran a controlled experiment using a faithful clone of the news site TT.com, seeded with diverse ads: static banners, GIFs, carousels, videos, cookie dialogues, and paywalls. We ran 300 initial trials plus follow-ups using the Document Object Model (DOM)-centric Browser Use framework with GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and the pixel-based OpenAI Operator, across 10 realistic user tasks. Our results show these agents display severe satisficing: they never scroll beyond two viewports and ignore purely visual calls to action, clicking banners only when semantic button overlays or off-screen text labels are present. Critically, when sweepstake participation required a purchase, GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet subscribed in 100% of trials, and Gemini 2.0 Flash in 70%, revealing gaps in cost-benefit analysis. We identified five actionable design principles-semantic overlays, hidden labels, top-left placement, static frames, and dialogue replacement, that make human-centric creatives machine-detectable without harming user experience. We also evaluated agent trustworthiness through "behavior patterns" such as cookie consent handling and subscription choices, highlighting model-specific risk boundaries and the urgent need for robust trust evaluation frameworks in real-world advertising.</description>

      <title>M^2VAE: Multi-Modal Multi-View Variational Autoencoder for Cold-start Item Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold-start item recommendation is a significant challenge in recommendation systems, particularly when new items are introduced without any historical interaction data. While existing methods leverage multi-modal content to alleviate the cold-start issue, they often neglect the inherent multi-view structure of modalities, the distinction between shared and modality-specific features. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Multi-View Variational AutoEncoder (M^2VAE), a generative model that addresses the challenges of modeling common and unique views in attribute and multi-modal features, as well as user preferences over single-typed item features. Specifically, we generate type-specific latent variables for item IDs, categorical attributes, and image features, and use Product-of-Experts (PoE) to derive a common representation. A disentangled contrastive loss decouples the common view from unique views while preserving feature informativeness. To model user inclinations, we employ a preference-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to adaptively fuse representations. We further incorporate co-occurrence signals via contrastive learning, eliminating the need for pretraining. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>ConvMix: A Mixed-Criteria Data Augmentation Framework for Conversational Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational search aims to satisfy users' complex information needs via multiple-turn interactions. The key challenge lies in revealing real users' search intent from the context-dependent queries. Previous studies achieve conversational search by fine-tuning a conversational dense retriever with relevance judgments between pairs of context-dependent queries and documents. However, this training paradigm encounters data scarcity issues. To this end, we propose ConvMix, a mixed-criteria framework to augment conversational dense retrieval, which covers more aspects than existing data augmentation frameworks. We design a two-sided relevance judgment augmentation schema in a scalable manner via the aid of large language models. Besides, we integrate the framework with quality control mechanisms to obtain semantically diverse samples and near-distribution supervisions to combine various annotated data. Experimental results on five widely used benchmarks show that the conversational dense retriever trained by our ConvMix framework outperforms previous baseline methods, which demonstrates our superior effectiveness.</description>

      <title>ReFineG: Synergizing Small Supervised Models and LLMs for Low-Resource Grounded Multimodal NER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) extends traditional NER by jointly detecting textual mentions and grounding them to visual regions. While existing supervised methods achieve strong performance, they rely on costly multimodal annotations and often underperform in low-resource domains. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong generalization but suffer from Domain Knowledge Conflict, producing redundant or incorrect mentions for domain-specific entities. To address these challenges, we propose ReFineG, a three-stage collaborative framework that integrates small supervised models with frozen MLLMs for low-resource GMNER. In the Training Stage, a domain-aware NER data synthesis strategy transfers LLM knowledge to small models with supervised training while avoiding domain knowledge conflicts. In the Refinement Stage, an uncertainty-based mechanism retains confident predictions from supervised models and delegates uncertain ones to the MLLM. In the Grounding Stage, a multimodal context selection algorithm enhances visual grounding through analogical reasoning. In the CCKS2025 GMNER Shared Task, ReFineG ranked second with an F1 score of 0.6461 on the online leaderboard, demonstrating its effectiveness with limited annotations.</description>

      <title>TaoSR-AGRL: Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning Framework for E-commerce Search Relevance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative, reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance. TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of users.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Adversarial Defense for Vision-Language Models by Leveraging One-To-Many Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18770v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language (VL) models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. This work pioneers defense strategies against multimodal attacks, providing insights for building robust VLMs from both optimization and data perspectives.</description>

      <title>GraphRAFT: Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning for Knowledge Graphs on Graph Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have shown remarkable language processing and reasoning ability but are prone to hallucinate when asked about private data. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) retrieves relevant data that fit into an LLM's context window and prompts the LLM for an answer. GraphRAG extends this approach to structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and questions regarding entities multiple hops away. The majority of recent GraphRAG methods either overlook the retrieval step or have ad hoc retrieval processes that are abstract or inefficient. This prevents them from being adopted when the KGs are stored in graph databases supporting graph query languages. In this work, we present GraphRAFT, a retrieve-and-reason framework that finetunes LLMs to generate provably correct Cypher queries to retrieve high-quality subgraph contexts and produce accurate answers. Our method is the first such solution that can be taken off-the-shelf and used on KGs stored in native graph DBs. Benchmarks suggest that our method is sample-efficient and scales with the availability of training data. Our method achieves significantly better results than all state-of-the-art models across all four standard metrics on two challenging Q&amp;As on large text-attributed KGs.</description>

      <title>FS-DAG: Few Shot Domain Adapting Graph Networks for Visually Rich Document Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose Few Shot Domain Adapting Graph (FS-DAG), a scalable and efficient model architecture for visually rich document understanding (VRDU) in few-shot settings. FS-DAG leverages domain-specific and language/vision specific backbones within a modular framework to adapt to diverse document types with minimal data. The model is robust to practical challenges such as handling OCR errors, misspellings, and domain shifts, which are critical in real-world deployments. FS-DAG is highly performant with less than 90M parameters, making it well-suited for complex real-world applications for Information Extraction (IE) tasks where computational resources are limited. We demonstrate FS-DAG's capability through extensive experiments for information extraction task, showing significant improvements in convergence speed and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, this work highlights the ongoing progress in developing smaller, more efficient models that do not compromise on performance.

      <title>From Questions to Queries: An AI-powered Multi-Agent Framework for Spatial Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL), single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components, including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems, advancing the development of autonomous GIS.</description>
