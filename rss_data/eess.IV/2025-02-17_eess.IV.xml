      <title>Volumetric Temporal Texture Synthesis for Smoke Stylization using Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artistic stylization of 3D volumetric smoke data is still a challenge in computer graphics due to the difficulty of ensuring spatiotemporal consistency given a reference style image, and that within reasonable time and computational resources. In this work, we introduce Volumetric Neural Cellular Automata (VNCA), a novel model for efficient volumetric style transfer that synthesizes, in real-time, multi-view consistent stylizing features on the target smoke with temporally coherent transitions between stylized simulation frames. VNCA synthesizes a 3D texture volume with color and density stylization and dynamically aligns this volume with the intricate motion patterns of the smoke simulation under the Eulerian framework. Our approach replaces the explicit fluid advection modeling and the inter-frame smoothing terms with the self-emerging motion of the underlying cellular automaton, thus reducing the training time by over an order of magnitude. Beyond smoke simulations, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach by showcasing its applicability to mesh stylization.</description>

      <title>SASVi - Segment Any Surgical Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Foundation models, trained on multitudes of public datasets, often require additional fine-tuning or re-prompting mechanisms to be applied to visually distinct target domains such as surgical videos. Further, without domain knowledge, they cannot model the specific semantics of the target domain. Hence, when applied to surgical video segmentation, they fail to generalise to sections where previously tracked objects leave the scene or new objects enter. Methods: We propose SASVi, a novel re-prompting mechanism based on a frame-wise Mask R-CNN Overseer model, which is trained on a minimal amount of scarcely available annotations for the target domain. This model automatically re-prompts the foundation model SAM2 when the scene constellation changes, allowing for temporally smooth and complete segmentation of full surgical videos. Results: Re-prompting based on our Overseer model significantly improves the temporal consistency of surgical video segmentation compared to similar prompting techniques and especially frame-wise segmentation, which neglects temporal information, by at least 1.5%. Our proposed approach allows us to successfully deploy SAM2 to surgical videos, which we quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate for three different cholecystectomy and cataract surgery datasets. Conclusion: SASVi can serve as a new baseline for smooth and temporally consistent segmentation of surgical videos with scarcely available annotation data. Our method allows us to leverage scarce annotations and obtain complete annotations for full videos of the large-scale counterpart datasets. We make those annotations publicly available, providing extensive annotation data for the future development of surgical data science models.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing image super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution remote sensing images from low-resolution inputs, thereby addressing limitations imposed by sensors and imaging conditions. However, the inherent characteristics of remote sensing images, including diverse ground object types and complex details, pose significant challenges to achieving high-quality reconstruction. Existing methods typically employ a uniform structure to process various types of ground objects without distinction, making it difficult to adapt to the complex characteristics of remote sensing images. To address this issue, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model and design a set of heterogeneous experts. These experts are organized into multiple expert groups, where experts within each group are homogeneous while being heterogeneous across groups. This design ensures that specialized activation parameters can be employed to handle the diverse and intricate details of ground objects effectively. To better accommodate the heterogeneous experts, we propose a multi-level feature aggregation strategy to guide the routing process. Additionally, we develop a dual-routing mechanism to adaptively select the optimal expert for each pixel. Experiments conducted on the UCMerced and AID datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior SR reconstruction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/Mr-Bamboo/MFG-HMoE.</description>

      <title>Lifespan tree of brain anatomy: diagnostic values for motor and cognitive neurodegenerative diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by overlapping symptoms, may be challenging. Brain imaging coupled with artificial intelligence has been previously proposed for diagnostic support, but most of these methods have been trained to discriminate only isolated diseases from controls. Here, we develop a novel machine learning framework, named lifespan tree of brain anatomy, dedicated to the differential diagnosis between multiple diseases simultaneously. It integrates the modeling of volume changes for 124 brain structures during the lifespan with non-linear dimensionality reduction and synthetic sampling techniques to create easily interpretable representations of brain anatomy over the course of disease progression. As clinically relevant proof- of-concept applications, we constructed a cognitive lifespan tree of brain anatomy for the differential diagnosis of six causes of neurodegenerative dementia and a motor lifespan tree of brain anatomy for the differential diagnosis of four causes of parkinsonism using 37594 MRI as a training dataset. This original approach enhanced significantly the efficiency of differential diagnosis in the external validation cohort of 1754 cases, outperforming existing state-of-the art machine learning techniques. Lifespan tree holds promise as a valuable tool for differential diagnostic in relevant clinical conditions, especially for diseases still lacking effective biological markers.</description>

      <title>Automated Muscle and Fat Segmentation in Computed Tomography for Comprehensive Body Composition Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Body composition assessment using CT images can potentially be used for a number of clinical applications, including the prognostication of cardiovascular outcomes, evaluation of metabolic health, monitoring of disease progression, assessment of nutritional status, prediction of treatment response in oncology, and risk stratification for surgical and critical care outcomes. While multiple groups have developed in-house segmentation tools for this analysis, there are very limited publicly available tools that could be consistently used across different applications. To mitigate this gap, we present a publicly accessible, end-to-end segmentation and feature calculation model specifically for CT body composition analysis. Our model performs segmentation of skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) across the chest, abdomen, and pelvis area in axial CT images. It also provides various body composition metrics, including muscle density, visceral-to-subcutaneous fat (VAT/SAT) ratio, muscle area/volume, and skeletal muscle index (SMI), supporting both 2D and 3D assessments. The model is shared for public use. To evaluate the model, the segmentation was applied to both internal and external datasets, with body composition metrics analyzed across different age, sex, and race groups. The model achieved high dice coefficients on both internal and external datasets, exceeding 89% for skeletal muscle, SAT, and VAT segmentation. The model outperforms the benchmark by 2.40% on skeletal muscle and 10.26% on SAT compared to the manual annotations given by the publicly available dataset. Body composition metrics show mean relative absolute errors (MRAEs) under 10% for all measures. Furthermore, the model provided muscular fat segmentation with a Dice coefficient of 56.27%, which can be utilized for additional analyses as needed.</description>

      <title>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Diagnosis Employing YOLOv11, YOLOv8, ResNet50, and Inception-ResNet-v2 Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thousands of individuals succumb annually to leukemia alone. As artificial intelligence-driven technologies continue to evolve and advance, the question of their applicability and reliability remains unresolved. This study aims to utilize image processing and deep learning methodologies to achieve state-of-the-art results for the detection of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) using data that best represents real-world scenarios. ALL is one of several types of blood cancer, and it is an aggressive form of leukemia. In this investigation, we examine the most recent advancements in ALL detection, as well as the latest iteration of the YOLO series and its performance. We address the question of whether white blood cells are malignant or benign. Additionally, the proposed models can identify different ALL stages, including early stages. Furthermore, these models can detect hematogones despite their frequent misclassification as ALL. By utilizing advanced deep learning models, namely, YOLOv8, YOLOv11, ResNet50 and Inception-ResNet-v2, the study achieves accuracy rates as high as 99.7%, demonstrating the effectiveness of these algorithms across multiple datasets and various real-world situations.</description>

      <title>Towards Patient-Specific Surgical Planning for Bicuspid Aortic Valve Repair: Fully Automated Segmentation of the Aortic Valve in 4D CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most prevalent congenital heart defect and may require surgery for complications such as stenosis, regurgitation, and aortopathy. BAV repair surgery is effective but challenging due to the heterogeneity of BAV morphology. Multiple imaging modalities can be employed to assist the quantitative assessment of BAVs for surgical planning. Contrast-enhanced 4D computed tomography (CT) produces volumetric temporal sequences with excellent contrast and spatial resolution. Segmentation of the aortic cusps and root in these images is an essential step in creating patient specific models for visualization and quantification. While deep learning-based methods are capable of fully automated segmentation, no BAV-specific model exists. Among valve segmentation studies, there has been limited quantitative assessment of the clinical usability of the segmentation results. In this work, we developed a fully auto- mated multi-label BAV segmentation pipeline based on nnU-Net. The predicted segmentations were used to carry out surgically relevant morphological measurements including geometric cusp height, commissural angle and annulus diameter, and the results were compared against manual segmentation. Automated segmentation achieved average Dice scores of over 0.7 and symmetric mean distance below 0.7 mm for all three aortic cusps and the root wall. Clinically relevant benchmarks showed good consistency between manual and predicted segmentations. Overall, fully automated BAV segmentation of 3D frames in 4D CT can produce clinically usable measurements for surgical risk stratification, but the temporal consistency of segmentations needs to be improved.</description>

      <title>SegX: Improving Interpretability of Clinical Image Diagnosis with Segmentation-based Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image analysis faces a significant barrier due to the lack of interpretability. Conventional explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and SHAP, often highlight regions outside clinical interests. To address this issue, we propose Segmentation-based Explanation (SegX), a plug-and-play approach that enhances interpretability by aligning the model's explanation map with clinically relevant areas leveraging the power of segmentation models. Furthermore, we introduce Segmentation-based Uncertainty Assessment (SegU), a method to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction model by measuring the 'distance' between interpretation maps and clinically significant regions. Our experiments on dermoscopic and chest X-ray datasets show that SegX improves interpretability consistently across mortalities, and the certainty score provided by SegU reliably reflects the correctness of the model's predictions. Our approach offers a model-agnostic enhancement to medical image diagnosis towards reliable and interpretable AI in clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Multi-Omics Fusion with Soft Labeling for Enhanced Prediction of Distant Metastasis in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients after Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Omics fusion has emerged as a crucial preprocessing approach in the field of medical image processing, providing significant assistance to several studies. One of the challenges encountered in the integration of omics data is the presence of unpredictability arising from disparities in data sources and medical imaging equipment. In order to overcome this challenge and facilitate the integration of their joint application to specific medical objectives, this study aims to develop a fusion methodology that mitigates the disparities inherent in omics data. The utilization of the multi-kernel late-fusion method has gained significant popularity as an effective strategy for addressing this particular challenge. An efficient representation of the data may be achieved by utilizing a suitable single-kernel function to map the inherent features and afterward merging them in a space with a high number of dimensions. This approach effectively addresses the differences noted before. The inflexibility of label fitting poses a constraint on the use of multi-kernel late-fusion methods in complex nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) datasets, hence affecting the efficacy of general classifiers in dealing with high-dimensional characteristics. This innovative methodology aims to increase the disparity between the two cohorts, hence providing a more flexible structure for the allocation of labels. The examination of the NPC-ContraParotid dataset demonstrates the model's robustness and efficacy, indicating its potential as a valuable tool for predicting distant metastases in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).</description>

      <title>Towards Fine-grained Interactive Segmentation in Images and Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Models (SAMs) have emerged as foundational visual models for general interactive segmentation. Despite demonstrating robust generalization abilities, they still suffer performance degradations in scenarios demanding accurate masks. Existing methods for high-precision interactive segmentation face a trade-off between the ability to perceive intricate local details and maintaining stable prompting capability, which hinders the applicability and effectiveness of foundational segmentation models. To this end, we present an SAM2Refiner framework built upon the SAM2 backbone. This architecture allows SAM2 to generate fine-grained segmentation masks for both images and videos while preserving its inherent strengths. Specifically, we design a localization augment module, which incorporates local contextual cues to enhance global features via a cross-attention mechanism, thereby exploiting potential detailed patterns and maintaining semantic information. Moreover, to strengthen the prompting ability toward the enhanced object embedding, we introduce a prompt retargeting module to renew the embedding with spatially aligned prompt features. In addition, to obtain accurate high resolution segmentation masks, a mask refinement module is devised by employing a multi-scale cascaded structure to fuse mask features with hierarchical representations from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, revealing that the proposed method can produce highly precise masks for both images and videos, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Cervical Cancer Screening via Large-scale Pretraining and Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cervical cancer is a leading malignancy in female reproductive system. While AI-assisted cytology offers a cost-effective and non-invasive screening solution, current systems struggle with generalizability in complex clinical scenarios. To address this issue, we introduced Smart-CCS, a generalizable Cervical Cancer Screening paradigm based on pretraining and adaptation to create robust and generalizable screening systems. To develop and validate Smart-CCS, we first curated a large-scale, multi-center dataset named CCS-127K, which comprises a total of 127,471 cervical cytology whole-slide images collected from 48 medical centers. By leveraging large-scale self-supervised pretraining, our CCS models are equipped with strong generalization capability, potentially generalizing across diverse scenarios. Then, we incorporated test-time adaptation to specifically optimize the trained CCS model for complex clinical settings, which adapts and refines predictions, improving real-world applicability. We conducted large-scale system evaluation among various cohorts. In retrospective cohorts, Smart-CCS achieved an overall area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.965 and sensitivity of 0.913 for cancer screening on 11 internal test datasets. In external testing, system performance maintained high at 0.950 AUC across 6 independent test datasets. In prospective cohorts, our Smart-CCS achieved AUCs of 0.947, 0.924, and 0.986 in three prospective centers, respectively. Moreover, the system demonstrated superior sensitivity in diagnosing cervical cancer, confirming the accuracy of our cancer screening results by using histology findings for validation. Interpretability analysis with cell and slide predictions further indicated that the system's decision-making aligns with clinical practice. Smart-CCS represents a significant advancement in cancer screening across diverse clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>Fast Inexact Bilevel Optimization for Analytical Deep Image Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytical deep image prior (ADP) introduced by Dittmer et al. (2020) establishes a link between deep image priors and classical regularization theory via bilevel optimization. While this is an elegant construction, it involves expensive computations if the lower-level problem is to be solved accurately. To overcome this issue, we propose to use adaptive inexact bilevel optimization to solve ADP problems. We discuss an extension of a recent inexact bilevel method called the method of adaptive inexact descent of Salehi et al.(2024) to an infinite-dimensional setting required by the ADP framework. In our numerical experiments we demonstrate that the computational speed-up achieved by adaptive inexact bilevel optimization allows one to use ADP on larger-scale problems than in the previous literature, e.g. in deblurring of 2D color images.</description>

      <title>Video Soundtrack Generation by Aligning Emotions and Temporal Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce EMSYNC, a video-based symbolic music generation model that aligns music with a video's emotional content and temporal boundaries. It follows a two-stage framework, where a pretrained video emotion classifier extracts emotional features, and a conditional music generator produces MIDI sequences guided by both emotional and temporal cues. We introduce boundary offsets, a novel temporal conditioning mechanism that enables the model to anticipate and align musical chords with scene cuts. Unlike existing models, our approach retains event-based encoding, ensuring fine-grained timing control and expressive musical nuances. We also propose a mapping scheme to bridge the video emotion classifier, which produces discrete emotion categories, with the emotion-conditioned MIDI generator, which operates on continuous-valued valence-arousal inputs. In subjective listening tests, EMSYNC outperforms state-of-the-art models across all subjective metrics, for music theory-aware participants as well as the general listeners.</description>

      <title>Joint semi-supervised and contrastive learning enables domain generalization and multi-domain segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their effectiveness, current deep learning models face challenges with images coming from different domains with varying appearance and content. We introduce SegCLR, a versatile framework designed to segment images across different domains, employing supervised and contrastive learning simultaneously to effectively learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. We demonstrate the superior performance of SegCLR through a comprehensive evaluation involving three diverse clinical datasets of 3D retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images, for the slice-wise segmentation of fluids with various network configurations and verification across 10 different network initializations. In an unsupervised domain adaptation context, SegCLR achieves results on par with a supervised upper-bound model trained on the intended target domain. Notably, we discover that the segmentation performance of SegCLR framework is marginally impacted by the abundance of unlabeled data from the target domain, thereby we also propose an effective domain generalization extension of SegCLR, known also as zero-shot domain adaptation, which eliminates the need for any target domain information. This shows that our proposed addition of contrastive loss in standard supervised training for segmentation leads to superior models, inherently more generalizable to both in- and out-of-domain test data. We additionally propose a pragmatic solution for SegCLR deployment in realistic scenarios with multiple domains containing labeled data. Accordingly, our framework pushes the boundaries of deep-learning based segmentation in multi-domain applications, regardless of data availability - labeled, unlabeled, or nonexistent.</description>

      <title>Intensity-Spatial Dual Masked Autoencoder for Multi-Scale Feature Learning in Chest CT Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of medical image segmentation, challenges such as indistinct lesion features, ambiguous boundaries,and multi-scale characteristics have long revailed. This paper proposes an improved method named Intensity-Spatial Dual Masked AutoEncoder (ISD-MAE). Based on the tissue-contrast semi-masked autoencoder, a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) branch is introduced to perform intensity masking and spatial masking operations on chest CT images for multi-scale feature learning and segmentation tasks. The model utilizes a dual-branch structure and contrastive learning to enhance the ability to learn tissue features and boundary details. Experiments are conducted on multiple 2D and 3D datasets. The results show that ISD-MAE significantly outperforms other methods in 2D pneumonia and mediastinal tumor segmentation tasks. For example, the Dice score reaches 90.10% on the COVID19 LESION dataset, and the performance is relatively stable. However, there is still room for improvement on 3D datasets. In response to this, improvement directions are proposed, including optimizing the loss function, using enhanced 3D convolution blocks, and processing datasets from multiple perspectives.Our code is available at:https://github.com/prowontheus/ISD-MAE.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Framework for Automated Segmentation of Perivascular Spaces in Brain MRI with the nnU-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Enlargement of perivascular spaces (PVS) is common in neurodegenerative disorders including cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. PVS enlargement may indicate impaired clearance pathways and there is a need for reliable PVS detection methods which are currently lacking. Aim: To optimise a widely used deep learning model, the no-new-UNet (nnU-Net), for PVS segmentation. Methods: In 30 healthy participants (mean$\pm$SD age: 50$\pm$18.9 years; 13 females), T1-weighted MRI images were acquired using three different protocols on three MRI scanners (3T Siemens Tim Trio, 3T Philips Achieva, and 7T Siemens Magnetom). PVS were manually segmented across ten axial slices in each participant. Segmentations were completed using a sparse annotation strategy. In total, 11 models were compared using various strategies for image handling, preprocessing and semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross validation (5FCV). The main performance metric was the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results: The voxel-spacing agnostic model (mean$\pm$SD DSC=64.3$\pm$3.3%) outperformed models which resampled images to a common resolution (DSC=40.5-55%). Model performance improved substantially following iterative label cleaning (DSC=85.7$\pm$1.2%). Semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels (n=12,740) from 18 additional datasets improved the agreement between raw and predicted PVS cluster counts (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient=0.89, 95%CI=0.82-0.94). We extended the model to enable PVS segmentation in the midbrain (DSC=64.3$\pm$6.5%) and hippocampus (DSC=67.8$\pm$5%). Conclusions: Our deep learning models provide a robust and holistic framework for the automated quantification of PVS in brain MRI.</description>

      <title>Improving Quality Control Of MRI Images Using Synthetic Motion Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MRI quality control (QC) is challenging due to unbalanced and limited datasets, as well as subjective scoring, which hinder the development of reliable automated QC systems. To address these issues, we introduce an approach that pretrains a model on synthetically generated motion artifacts before applying transfer learning for QC classification. This method not only improves the accuracy in identifying poor-quality scans but also reduces training time and resource requirements compared to training from scratch. By leveraging synthetic data, we provide a more robust and resource-efficient solution for QC automation in MRI, paving the way for broader adoption in diverse research settings.</description>

      <title>MedMimic: Physician-Inspired Multimodal Fusion for Early Diagnosis of Fever of Unknown Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fever of unknown origin FUO remains a diagnostic challenge. MedMimic is introduced as a multimodal framework inspired by real-world diagnostic processes. It uses pretrained models such as DINOv2, Vision Transformer, and ResNet-18 to convert high-dimensional 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging into low-dimensional, semantically meaningful features. A learnable self-attention-based fusion network then integrates these imaging features with clinical data for classification. Using 416 FUO patient cases from Sichuan University West China Hospital from 2017 to 2023, the multimodal fusion classification network MFCN achieved macro-AUROC scores ranging from 0.8654 to 0.9291 across seven tasks, outperforming conventional machine learning and single-modality deep learning methods. Ablation studies and five-fold cross-validation further validated its effectiveness. By combining the strengths of pretrained large models and deep learning, MedMimic offers a promising solution for disease classification.</description>

      <title>The Devil is in the Prompts: De-Identification Traces Enhance Memorization Risks in Synthetic Chest X-Ray Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models, particularly text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, play a crucial role in medical image analysis. However, these models are prone to training data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy. Synthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in medical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data repository for this task. This study presents the first systematic attempt to identify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to training data memorization. Our analysis reveals two unexpected findings: (1) prompts containing traces of de-identification procedures (markers introduced to hide Protected Health Information) are the most memorized, and (2) among all tokens, de-identification markers contribute the most towards memorization. This highlights a broader issue with the standard anonymization practices and T2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. To exacerbate, existing inference-time memorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently reduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens. On this front, we propose actionable strategies for different stakeholders to enhance privacy and improve the reliability of generative models in medical imaging. Finally, our results provide a foundation for future work on developing and benchmarking memorization mitigation techniques for synthetic chest X-ray generation using the MIMIC-CXR dataset. The anonymized code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/diffusion_memorization-8011/</description>

      <title>The shape of the brain's connections is predictive of cognitive performance: an explainable machine learning study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shape of the brain's white matter connections is relatively unexplored in diffusion MRI tractography analysis. While it is known that tract shape varies in populations and across the human lifespan, it is unknown if the variability in dMRI tractography-derived shape may relate to the brain's functional variability across individuals. This work explores the potential of leveraging tractography fiber cluster shape measures to predict subject-specific cognitive performance. We implement machine learning models to predict individual cognitive performance scores. We study a large-scale database from the HCP-YA study. We apply an atlas-based fiber cluster parcellation to the dMRI tractography of each individual. We compute 15 shape, microstructure, and connectivity features for each fiber cluster. Using these features as input, we train a total of 210 models to predict 7 different NIH Toolbox cognitive performance assessments. We apply an explainable AI technique, SHAP, to assess the importance of each fiber cluster for prediction. Our results demonstrate that shape measures are predictive of individual cognitive performance. The studied shape measures, such as irregularity, diameter, total surface area, volume, and branch volume, are as effective for prediction as microstructure and connectivity measures. The overall best-performing feature is a shape feature, irregularity, which describes how different a cluster's shape is from an idealized cylinder. Further interpretation using SHAP values suggest that fiber clusters with features highly predictive of cognitive ability are widespread throughout the brain, including fiber clusters from the superficial association, deep association, cerebellar, striatal, and projection pathways. This study demonstrates the strong potential of shape descriptors to enhance the study of the brain's white matter and its relationship to cognitive function.</description>

      <title>S2CFormer: Reorienting Learned Image Compression from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have achieved significant success in learned image compression (LIC), with Swin Transformers emerging as the mainstream choice for nonlinear transforms. A common belief is that their sophisticated spatial operations contribute most to their efficacy. However, the crucial role of the feed-forward network (FFN) based Channel Aggregation module within the transformer architecture has been largely overlooked, and the over-design of spatial operations leads to a suboptimal trade-off between decoding latency and R-D performance. In this paper, we reevaluate the key factors behind the competence of transformers in LIC. By replacing spatial operations with identity mapping, we are surprised to find that channel operations alone can approach the R-D performance of the leading methods. This solid lower bound of performance emphasizes that the presence of channel aggregation is more essential for the LIC model to achieve competitive performance, while the previously complex spatial interactions are partly redundant. Based on this insight, we initiate the "S2CFormer" paradigm, a general architecture that reorients the focus of LIC from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation. We present two instantiations of the S2CFormer: S2C-Conv, and S2C-Attention. Each one incorporates a simple operator for spatial interaction and serves as nonlinear transform blocks for our LIC models. Both models demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) R-D performance and significantly faster decoding speed. These results also motivate further exploration of advanced FFN structures to enhance the R-D performance while maintaining model efficiency. With these foundations, we introduce S2C-Hybrid, an enhanced LIC model that combines the strengths of different S2CFormer instantiations. This model outperforms all the existing methods on several datasets, setting a new benchmark for efficient and high-performance LIC.</description>
