      <title>Inverse photoacoustic tomography problem in media with fractional attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse problem of recovering an initial source for the wave equation with fractional attenuation, motivated by photoacoustic tomography (PAT). The attenuation is modeled by a Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$. We establish uniqueness under a geometric foliation condition via an adaptation of two types of Carleman estimates to the fractional setting, prove stability through continuity inequalities for fractional time-derivatives of wave solutions, and derive a reconstruction scheme based on a Neumann series. While our results apply directly to PAT, we expect that the analytic approach and tools employed might be of broader relevance to the analysis of PDEs with memory effects and to inverse problems for attenuated wave models.</description>

      <title>Local boundedness for weak solutions to strongly degenerate orthotropic parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the local boundedness of local weak solutions to the parabolic equation \[ \partial_{t}u\,=\,\sum_{i=1}^{n}\partial_{x_{i}}\left[(\vert u_{x_{i}}\vert-\delta_{i})_{+}^{p-1}\frac{u_{x_{i}}}{\vert u_{x_{i}}\vert}\right]\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm{in}\,\,\,\Omega_{T}=\Omega\times(0,T]\,, \] where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $n\geq2$, $p\geq2$, $\delta_{1},\ldots,\delta_{n}$ are non-negative numbers and $\left(\,\cdot\,\right)_{+}$ denotes the positive part. The main novelty here is that the above equation combines an orthotropic structure with a strongly degenerate behavior. The core result of this paper thus extends a classical boundedness theorem, originally proved for the parabolic $p$-Laplacian, to a widely degenerate anisotropic setting. As a byproduct, we also obtain the local boundedness of local weak solutions to the isotropic counterpart of the above equation.</description>

      <title>Forward and backward problems for abstract time-fractional Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate forward and backward problems associated with abstract time-fractional Schr\"odinger equations $\mathrm{i}^\nu \partial_t^\alpha u(t) + A u(t)=0$, $\alpha \in (0,1)\cup (1,2)$ and $\nu\in\{1,\alpha\}$, where $A$ is a self-adjoint operator with compact resolvent on a Hilbert space $H$. This kind of equation, which incorporates the Caputo time-fractional derivative of order $\alpha$, models quantum systems with memory effects and anomalous wave propagation. We first establish the well-posedness of the forward problems in two scenarios: ($\nu=1,\,$ $\alpha \in (0,1)$) and ($\nu=\alpha,\,$ $\alpha \in (0,1)\cup (1,2)$). Then, we prove well-posedness and stability results for the backward problems depending on the two cases $\nu=1$ and $\nu=\alpha$. Our approach employs the solution's eigenvector expansion along with the properties of the Mittag-Leffler functions, including the distribution of zeros and asymptotic expansions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of some open problems.</description>

      <title>Inverse spectral problems for higher-order coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish uniqueness and stability inequalities for the problem of determining the higher-order coefficients of an elliptic operator from the corresponding boundary spectral data (BSD). Our analysis relies on the relationship between boundary spectral data and elliptic and hyperbolic Dirichlet to Neumann (DtN) maps. We also show how to adapt our analysis to obtain uniqueness and stability inequalities for determining the conductivity or the potential in an elliptic operator from the corresponding BSD.</description>

      <title>Rapid boundary stabilization of 1D nonlinear parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the rapid boundary stabilization of 1D nonlinear parabolic equations via the modal decomposition method. The nonlinear term is assumed to satisfy certain local Lipschitz continuity and global growth conditions. Through the modal decomposition, we construct a feedback control that modifies only the unstable eigenvalues to achieve spectral reduction. Under this control, we establish locally rapid stabilization by estimating the nonlinearity in Lyapunov stability analysis. Furthermore, utilizing the dissipative property, we derive a globally rapid stabilization result for dissipative systems such as the Burgers equation and the Allen-Cahn equation.</description>

      <title>Gamma Convergence of Partially Segregated Elliptic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study partially segregated elliptic systems through the use of penalized energy functionals. These systems arise from the minimization of Gross-Pitaevskii-type energies that capture the behavior of multi-component ultracold gas mixtures and other systems involving multiple interacting fluid or gas species. In the case when the domain is planar, i.e., in $\mathbb{R}^2$, our main result is the Gamma convergence of penalized energy to the constrained Dirichlet energy with strict segregation. The proof combines lower semicontinuity arguments with a recovery sequence construction based on geometric decompositions near interfaces and triple junctions. This establishes a rigorous variational link between the penalized and constrained formulations.</description>

      <title>The non-cutoff Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system with weak collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove global existence of smooth solutions near Maxwellians for the non-cutoff Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system in the weakly collisional regime. To address the weak dissipation of the non-cutoff linearized Boltzmann operator, we develop a refined velocity-weighted energy framework combined with vector-field techniques to control the transport term, nonlinear collisions, and the self-consistent electric field. This approach yields uniform-in-time bounds, captures enhanced dissipation of the solution, and establishes Landau damping for both the density and electric field, providing the first global-in-time result of this type for the non-cutoff Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system. Our approach is inspired by the recent work of Chaturvedi-Luk-Nguyen ({\it J. Amer. Math. Soc.} {\bf 36} (2023), no. 4, 1103--1189.)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study partial regularity for nondegenerate parabolic systems of double phase type, where the growth function is given by $H(z,s)=s^p+a(z)s^q$, $z=(x,t)\in\Omega_T$, with $\tfrac{2n}{n+2}&lt;p\le q$ and $a(z)$ a nonnegative $C^{0,\alpha,\frac{\alpha}{2}}$-continuous function for some $\alpha\in(0,1]$. As the main result we prove that if $q&lt; \min \{p+\tfrac{\alpha p }{n+2}, p+1 \}$ the spatial gradient of any weak solution is locally H\"older continuous, except on a set of measure zero.</description>

      <title>Local Well-Posedness For Barotropic Compressible Fluid-Viscoelastic Shell Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a three-dimensional barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes flow interacting with a viscoelastic shell that occupies a portion of the fluid boundary. The analysis is entirely Eulerian and the moving interface is parametrised by a localised Hanzawa transform supported near the shell patch, which preserves the transport structure of the continuity equation and avoids a global Lagrangian map. We prove local-in-time existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for compatible data and without imposing a vanishing initial shell displacement. The proof combines a well-posedness theory for the continuity equation, solved by the method of characteristics in the Hanzawa frame, with an analysis of the momentum-structure subproblem carried out by the classical linearisation-energy estimate -- fixed-point scheme on a fixed reference domain. A Banach fixed point then couples the two steps and closes the argument on a short time interval. We work with a viscosity-weighted energy that makes the scaling in the shear and bulk viscosities explicit. This yields bounds whose constants grow at most linearly in these parameters. In particular, the estimates are inviscid-limit compatible. The result complements the global finite-energy weak theory for compressible fluid-shell interaction by providing a local strong well-posedness statement in the same geometric configuration. It also extends strong boundary results beyond beams and plates to bending shells, and addresses the wave-to-bending direction suggested in the literature on compressible fluid-structure interaction at structural boundaries, while remaining fully Eulerian.</description>

      <title>Abnormal boundary decay for the fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that, for $\alpha \in (0,2)$, the $C^{1, \rm Dini}$ regularity assumption on an open set $D\subset \mathbb R^d$ is optimal for the standard boundary decay property for nonnegative $\alpha$-harmonic functions in $D$ and for the standard boundary decay property of the heat kernel $p^D(t,x,y)$ of the Dirichlet fractional Laplacian $\Delta^{\alpha/2}|_D$ by proving the following: (i) If $D$ is a $C^{1, \rm Dini}$ open set and $h$ is a non-negative function which is $\alpha$-harmonic in $D$ and vanishes near a portion of $\partial D$, then the rate at which $h(x)$ decays to 0 near that portion of $\partial D$ is ${\rm dist} (x, D^c)^{\alpha/2}$. (ii) If $D$ is a $C^{1, \rm Dini}$ open set, then, as $x\to \partial D$, the rate at which $p^D(t,x,y)$ tends to 0 is ${\rm dist} (x, D^c)^{\alpha/2}$. (iii) For any non-Dini modulus of continuity $\ell$, there exist non-$C^{1, \rm Dini}$ open sets $D$, with $\partial D$ locally being the graph of a $C^{1, \ell}$ function, such that the standard boundary decay properties above do not hold for $D$.</description>

      <title>Long time evolution of a pair of 2D viscous point vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the long-time evolution of two point vortices under the 2D Navier-Stokes tokes equations. Starting from initial data given by a pair of Dirac measures, we derive an asymptotic expansion for the vorticity over time scales significantly longer than the advection time, yet shorter than the diffusion time. Building on previous works \cite{GS24-1, DG24}, we construct suitable approximate solutions $\Omega_a$ and employ Arnold's method to define a nonlinear energy functional $E_\ve[\om]$, with respect to which the linearized operator $\Lambda^{E,\star}$ around $\Omega_a$ is nearly skew-adjoint. A key innovation in this work is the introduction of ``pseudo-momenta'': $\varrho^e_a, \varrho^o_a,\varrho^{te}_a, \varrho^{to}_a$, which correspond to eigenfunctions or other nontrivial elements in invariant subspaces of $\Lambda^E$, derived from the Lie structure of the 2D Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Two alternative proofs of weak Harnack inequality for mixed local and nonlocal $p$-Laplace equations with a nonhomogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of mixed local and nonlocal $p$-Laplace equations with prototype \[ -\Delta_p u + (-\Delta_p)^s u = f \quad \text{in } \Omega, \] where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is bounded and open. We provide sufficient condition on $f$ to ensure weak Harnack inequality with a tail term for sign-changing supersolutions. Two different proofs are presented, avoiding the Krylov--Safonov covering lemma and expansion of positivity: one via the John--Nirenberg lemma, the other via the Bombieri--Giusti lemma. To our knowledge, these approaches are new, even for $p = 2$ with $f \equiv 0$, and include a new proof of the reverse H\"older inequality for supersolutions. Further, we establish Harnack inequality for solutions by first deriving a local boundedness result, together with a tail estimate and an initial weak Harnack inequality.</description>

      <title>Negative Order Bochner-Riesz Operators for the Critical Magnetic Schr\"odinger Operator in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the sharp $L^p$-$L^q$ boundedness of the Bochner-Riesz operator $S^{\delta}_{\lambda}(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}})$ associated with a scaling-critical magnetic Schr\"odinger operator $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$, where $\delta \in (-3/2, 0)$. We determine the conditions on the exponents $p$ and $q$ under which the operator is bounded from $L^p(\mathbb{R}^2)$ to $L^q(\mathbb{R}^2)$. Our main result characterizes the boundedness region as a pentagonal subset $\Delta(\delta)$ of the $(1/p, 1/q)$-plane, extending previous uniform resolvent result in Fanelli, Zhang and Zheng[Int. Math. Res. Not., 20(2023), 17656-17703].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a thermodynamically consistent thermo-visco-elastic model describing the balance of internal energy in a heat-conducting inelastic body. In the considered problem, the temperature dependence appears in both the elastic and inelastic constitutive relations. For such a system, we introduce the concept of a weak entropy-energy solution, which satisfies the entropy equality instead of the internal energy equation. Although the model does not possess any mathematically favorable structural properties, such as Kelvin-Voigt type effects or simplifications eliminating temperature from the constitutive relations, we prove the global-in-time existence of weak entropy-energy solutions for large initial data.</description>

      <title>Mass concentration in a spatially inhomogeneous coagulation model with fast sedimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a spatially inhomogeneous coagulation model that contains a transport term in the spatial variable. The transport term models the vertical motion of particles due to gravity, thereby incorporating their fall into the dynamics. Local existence of mass-conserving solutions for a class of coagulation rates for which in the spatially homogeneous case instantaneous gelation (i.e., instantaneous loss of mass) occurs has been proved in [Cristian-Niethammer-Vel\'azquez, 2024]. In order to obtain some insight into how to prove global existence of solutions, we allow a fast sedimentation speed. For very fast sedimentation speed, we rigorously prove that solutions converge to a Dirac measure in the space variable. We also formally obtain in the limit a one-dimensional coagulation equation with diagonal kernel, i.e., only particles of the same size interact. This provides a physical intuition on how coagulation models with a diagonal kernel emerge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract differential-algebraic equations (ADAEs) of a semilinear type are studied. Theorems on the existence and uniqueness of solutions and the maximal interval of existence, on the global solvability of the ADAEs, the boundedness of solutions and the blow-up of solutions are presented. Previously, an ADAE is reduced to a system of explicit differential equations and algebraic equations by using projectors. The number of equations of the system depends on the index of the characteristic pencil of the ADAE. We consider the pencil of an arbitrarily high index.</description>

Abstract: We investigate traveling wave solutions in the two-species reaction-diffusion Lotka-Volterra competition system under weak competition. For the strict weak competition regime $(b&lt;a&lt;1/c,\,d&gt;0)$, we construct refined upper and lower solutions combined with the Schauder fixed point theorem to establish the existence of traveling waves for all wave speeds $s\geq s^*:=\max\{2,2\sqrt{ad}\}$, and provide verifiable sufficient conditions for the emergence of non-monotone waves. Such conditions for non-monotonic waves have not been explicitly addressed in previous studies. It is interesting to point out that our result for non-monotone waves also hold for the critical speed case $s=s^*$. In addition, in the critical weak competition case $(b&lt;a=1/c,\,d&gt;0)$, we rigorously prove, for the first time, the existence of front-pulse traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Inverse curvature flow of closed Legendre curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with an inverse curvature flow of $\ell$-convex Legendre curves. Since the Legendre curve is a natural generalization of regular curve, the flow is a generalization of the classical inverse curvature flow of regular curves. For the initial value problem, we study on the unique existence of the flow in global time, the monotonicity of the number of the singular cusps with respect to t &gt; 0 and the asymptotic behavior of the flow as $t \to \infty$. Regarding the asymptotics, the flow asymptotically converges to one of the self similar solutions by scaling appropriately, and the convergence is completely categorized depending on the initial curve.</description>

      <title>A New Quasi-Singularity Formation Mechanism for Second-order Hyperbolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel mechanism for quasi-singularity formation in both linear and nonlinear hyperbolic wave equations in two and three dimensions. We prove that over any finite time interval, there exist inputs such that the H\"older norm of the resulting wave field exceeds any prescribed bound. Conversely, the set of such almost-blowup points has vanishing measure when the aforementioned bound goes to infinity. This phenomenon thus defines a quasi-singular state, intermediate between classical singularity and regularity. Crucially, both the equation coefficients and the inputs can be arbitrarily smooth; the quasi-singularity arises intrinsically from the structure of the hyperbolic wave equation combined with specific input characteristics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour and existence of positive solutions for mixed local nonlocal elliptic equations with Hardy potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions to the following problem driven by the superposition of the Laplacian and the fractional Laplacian with Hardy potential \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned}
  -\Delta u + (-\Delta)^s u - \mu \frac{u}{|x|^2} &amp;= \lambda |u|^{p-2} u + |u|^{2^*-2} u \quad \text{in } \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N,
  u &amp;= 0 \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $ \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N $ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary, $ 0 &lt; s &lt; 1 $, $ 1 &lt; p &lt; 2^* $, with $ 2^* = \frac{2N}{N-2} $, $ \lambda &gt; 0 $, and $ \mu \in (0, \bar{\mu}) $ where $\bar \mu = \left( \frac{N-2}{2} \right)^2$.
  The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we establish uniform asymptotic estimates for solutions of the problem by means of a suitable transformation. Then, according to the value of the exponent $p$, we analyze three distinct cases and prove the existence of a positive solution. Moreover, in the sublinear regime $1 &lt; p &lt; 2$, we demonstrate the existence of multiple positive solutions for small perturbations of the fractional Laplacian.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider two different heat conducting fluids each modelled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system separated by a non-linear elastic Koiter shell. The motion of the shell changes the domain of definition of the two separated fluids. For this setting we show the existence of a weak solution. The heat capacity of the shell is given energetically. It allows to consider transmission laws ranging from insulation to superconductivity.We follow a variational approach for fluid-structure interactions. To include temperature a novel two step minimization scheme is used to produce an approximation. The weak solutions are energetically closed and include a strictly positive temperature.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness Result For Semi-linear Wave Equations With Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse problem of simultaneously recovering multiple unknown parameters for semilinear wave equations from boundary measurements. We consider an initial-boundary value problem for a wave equation with a general semilinear term and an internal source. The inverse problem is to determine the nonlinear coefficients (potentials), the source term, and the initial data from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map. Our approach combines higher-order linearization and the construction of complex geometrical optics (CGO) solutions. The main results establish that while unique recovery is not always possible, we can precisely characterize the gauge equivalence classes in the solutions to this inverse problem. For a wave equation with a polynomial nonlinearity of degree $n$, we prove that only the highest-order coefficient can be uniquely determined from the DtN map; the lower-order coefficients and the source can only be recovered up to a specific gauge transformation involving a function $\psi$. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions under which unique determination of all parameters is guaranteed. We also extend these results to various specific non-polynomial nonlinearities, demonstrating that the nature of the nonlinearity critically influences whether unique recovery or a gauge symmetry is obtained.</description>

      <title>The parabolic Dirichlet problem with continuous and H\"older boundary data, and rough coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide very mild sufficient conditions for space-time domains (non-necessarily cylindrical) which ensure that the continuous Dirichlet problem and the H\"older Dirichlet problem are well-posed, for any parabolic operator in divergence form with merely bounded coefficients. Concretely, we show that the parabolic measure exists, even for unbounded domains, hence solving an open problem posed by Genschaw and Hofmann (2020).
  This problem has inherent difficulties because of its parabolic nature, as the behavior of solutions near the boundary may depend strongly on the values of the coefficients of the operator. One of our sufficient conditions, the time-backwards capacity density condition, is a quantitative version of the parabolic Wiener's criterion, and hence is adapted to the operator under consideration. The other condition, the time-backwards Hausdorff content condition, is (albeit slightly stronger) purely geometrical and independent of the operator, hence much easier to check in practice.</description>

      <title>A Variational Method for Conformable Fractional Equations Using Rank-One Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make a complete variational treatment of rank-one Proper Generalised Decomposition for separable fractional partial differential equations with conformable derivatives. The setting is Hilbertian, the energy is induced by a symmetric coercive bilinear form, and the residual is placed in the dual space. A greedy rank-one update is obtained by maximizing an energy Rayleigh quotient over the rank-one manifold, followed by an exact line search. An exact one step energy decrease identity is proved, together with geometric decay of the energy error under a weak greedy condition that measures how well the search captures the Riesz representer of the residual. The alternating least squares realization is analyzed at the level of operators, including well posedness of the alternating subproblems, a characterization of stationary points, and monotonicity of the Rayleigh quotient along the inner iteration. Discretizations based on weighted finite elements and on Gr\"unwald type schemes are described in detail, including assembly, boundary conditions, complexity, and memory. Two model problems, a stationary fractional Poisson problem and a space time fractional diffusion problem, are treated from the continuous level down to matrices.</description>

      <title>A discrete data assimilation algorithm for the reconstruction of Gray--Scott dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gray--Scott model governs the interaction of two chemical species via a system of reaction-diffusion equations. Despite its simple form, it produces extremely rich patterns such as spots, stripes, waves, and labyrinths. That makes it ideal for studying emergent behavior, self-organization, and instability-driven pattern formation. It is also known for its sensitivity to poorly observed initial conditions. Using such initial conditions alone quickly leads simulations to deviate from the true dynamics. The present paper addresses this challenge with a nudging-based data assimilation algorithm: coarse, cell-averaged measurements are injected into the model through a feedback (nudging) term, implemented as a finite-volume interpolant. We prove two main results. (i) For the continuous problem, the nudged solution synchronizes with the true dynamics, and the $L^2$-error decays exponentially under conditions that tie observation resolution, nudging gains, and diffusion. (ii) For the fully discrete semi-implicit finite-volume scheme, the same synchronization holds, up to a mild time-step restriction. Numerical tests on labyrinthine patterns support the theory. They show recovery of fine structure from sparse data and clarify how the observation resolution, the nudging gain, and the frequency of updates affect the decay rate.</description>

      <title>Tensor tomography on asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a study of the inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform $I_m$ over symmetric $m$-tensor fields on asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces. This operator has a non-trivial kernel whenever $m\ge 1$. To propose a gauge representative to be reconstructed from X-ray data, we first prove a "tt-potential-conformal" decomposition theorem for $m$-tensor fields (where "tt" stands for transverse traceless), previously used in integral geometry on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary in Sharafutdinov, 2007; Dairbekov and Sharafutdinov, 2011. The proof is based on elliptic decompositions of the Guillemin-Kazhdan operators $\eta_\pm$ (Guillemin and Kazhdan, 1980) and leverages in the current setting the 0-calculus of Mazzeo-Melrose (Mazzeo and Melrose, 1987; Mazzeo, 1991). Iterating this decomposition gives rise to an "iterated-tt" representative modulo $\ker I_m$ for a tensor field, which is distinct from the often-used solenoidal representative.
  In the case of the Poincar\'e disk, we show that the X-ray transform of a tensor in iterated-tt form splits into components that are orthogonal relative to a specific $L^2$ structure in data space. For even tensor fields, we provide a full picture of the data space decomposition, in particular a range characterization of $I_{2n}$ for every $n$ in terms of moment conditions and spectral decay. Finally, we give explicit approaches for the reconstruction of even tensors in iterated-tt form from their X-ray transform or its normal operator, using specific knowledge of geodesically invariant distributions with one-sided Fourier content, whose properties are analyzed in detail.</description>

      <title>The Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields on radiative asymptotically flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a large class of asymptotically flat spacetimes which includes radiative perturbations of Minkowski space, we define a distinguished global Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields by means of the microlocal approach to non-elliptic Fredholm theory, working in the de,sc-pseudodifferential algebra due to Sussman. We extend the limiting absorption principle (the "$i\varepsilon$ prescription" for the Feynman propagator) to this setting. Motivated by the complicated Hamilton flow structure arising in this problem, we also prove a new localized radial point estimate in the spirit of Haber-Vasy which, under appropriate nondegeneracy assumptions, allows one to propagate microlocal regularity into a single radial point belonging to a larger radial set which can be a source, sink, or saddle for the Hamilton flow.</description>

      <title>A weighted formulation of refined decoupling and inequalities of Mizohata-Takeuchi-type for the moment curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a compact patch of a well-curved $C^{n+1}$ curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with induced Lebesgue measure ${\rm d} \lambda$, and let $g \mapsto \widehat{g \,{\rm d}\lambda}$ be the Fourier extension operator for $\Gamma$. Then we have, for arbitrary non-negative weights $w$, \begin{equation*}
  \int_{B_R} |\widehat{g \,{\rm d}\lambda}|^2w \leq C_{n,a} R^{a} \sup_S \left(\int_S w\right)\int_\Gamma |g|^2 \, {\rm d} \lambda
  \end{equation*} for any $a&gt; \frac{n-3}{2} + \frac{2}{n} - \frac{2}{n^2(n+1)}$, where the $\sup$ is over all $1$-neighbourhoods $S$ of hyperplanes whose normals are parallel to the tangent at some point of $\Gamma$. This represents partial progress on the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture for curves in dimensions $n \geq 3$, improving upon the exponent $a=n-1$ which can be obtained as a consequence of the Agmon-H\"ormander trace inequality. Our main tool in establishing this inequality will be a weighted formulation of refined decoupling for well-curved curves. We also discuss the sharpness of the exponents we obtain in this and in auxiliary results, and further explore this in the context of axiomatic decoupling for curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there are infinitely many pairwise nonhomothetic, complete, periodic metrics with constant scalar curvature that are conformal to the round metric on $S^n\setminus S^k$, where $k &lt; \frac{n-2}{2}$. These metrics are obtained by pulling back Yamabe metrics defined on products of $S^{n-k-1}$ and compact hyperbolic $(k+1)$-manifolds. Our main result proves that these solutions are generically distinct up to homothety. The core of our argument relies on classical rigidity theorems due to Obata and Ferrand, which characterize the round sphere by its conformal group.</description>

      <title>Estimates of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Li--Yau eigenvalue-diameter estimates, we investigate lower bounds for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue in terms of the diameter (or inscribed radius) of a graph. Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with boundary $B$. Assume that the interior $\Omega = V \setminus B$ is connected. Let $r$ be the inscribed radius of $(G, B)$ and $d$ be the maximum degree of $G$. We prove that $$\lambda_1(G, B) \geq \frac{d - 1}{r d^r},$$ which can be viewed as an analogue of the Lin--Yau bound and the Meng--Lin bound for normalized Dirichlet/Laplacian eigenvalues. We also derive the inequality $$\lambda_1(G, B) \geq \frac{1}{r |\Omega|}.$$ In particular, for a tree $T$ with at least $3$ vertices, we show that $$\lambda_1(T) \geq 4 \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{4r + 6} \geq \frac{1}{(r + 1)^2}.$$ Notably, both of the two preceding bounds are sharp up to a constant factor. We additionally examine upper bounds on the first Dirichlet eigenvalue under constraints on the numbers of interior and boundary vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04702v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the previous study (Ishida, 2025), the author proved the uniqueness of short-range potential functions using the Enss-Weder time-dependent method (Enss and Weder, 1995) for a two-body quantum system described by time-decaying harmonic oscillators. In this study, we extend the result of Ishida (2025) to the $N$-body case. We use the approaches developed in Enss and Weder (1995), Weder (1996), and Valencia and Weder (2012) to prove that the high-velocity limit of the scattering operator uniquely determines all the pairwise interaction potentials among the $N$ particles, focusing respectively on each fixed pair of particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rapid stabilization of an unstable wave equation, in which an unknown disturbance is located at the boundary condition. We address two different boundary conditions: Dirichlet- Dirichlet and Dirichlet-Neumann. In both cases, we design a feedback law, located at the same place as the unknown disturbance, that forces the exponential decay of the energy for any desired decay rate while suppressing the effects of the unknown disturbance. For the feedback design, we employ the backstepping method, Lyapunov techniques and the sign multivalued operator. The well-posedness of the closed-loop system, which is a differential inclusion, is shown with the maximal monotone operator theory.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limits \`a la Tanaka and large deviations for particle systems with network interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a unified framework to study non-exchangeable mean-field particle systems with some general interaction mechanisms. The starting point is a fixed-point formulation of particle systems originally due to Tanaka that allows us to prove mean-field limit and large deviation results in an abstract setting. While it has been recently shown that such formulation encompasses a large class of exchangeable particle systems, we propose here a setting for the non-exchangeable case, including the case of adaptive interaction networks. We introduce sufficient conditions on the network structure that imply the mean-field limit and a new large deviations principle for the interaction measure. Finally, we formally highlight important models for which it is possible to derive a closed PDE characterization of the limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study 4-dimensional Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds whose conformal class contains a K\"ahler metric. Such Einstein metrics are non-K\"ahler and admit a Killing field extending to the conformal infinity, and the Einstein equation reduces to a Toda-type equation. When the Killing field integrates to an $\mathbb{S}^1$-action, we formulate a Dirichlet boundary value problem and establish existence and uniqueness theory. This construction provides a non-perturbative realization of infinite-dimensional families of new Poincar\'e-Einstein metrics whose conformal infinities are of non-positive Yamabe type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1612.05096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the results regarding entropic convergence and the strong linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation (without external force) in [C. David Levermore. Entropic convergence and the linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation. Communications in Partial Differential Equations, 18(7-8):1231--1248, 1993] to the case of the Boltzmann equation with external force. Our starting point is the Boltzmann equation with an external force introduced in [Diogo Ars\'enio and Laure Saint-Raymond. From the Vlasov--Maxwell--Boltzmann System to Incompressible Viscous Electro-magneto-hydrodynamics, EMS Press, 2019], we then find new conditions on the force and rigorously prove the maintaining result by Levermore. More specifically, any sequence of DiPerna-Lions renormalized solutions of the Boltzmann equation with external force are shown to have fluctuations (about the global Maxwellian equilibrium $M$) that converge entropically (and hence strongly in $L^1$) to the solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation for any positive time, given that its initial fluctuations about $M$ converge entropically to the provided $L^2$ initial data of the linearized equation, where the force can be physically significant.</description>

      <title>Stability for the Surface Diffusion Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the global existence and stability of surface diffusion flow (the normal velocity is given by the Laplacian of the mean curvature) of smooth boundaries of subsets of the $n$--dimensional flat torus. More precisely, we show that if a smooth set is ``close enough'' to a strictly stable critical set for the Area functional under a volume constraint, then the surface diffusion flow of its boundary hypersurface exists for all time and asymptotically converges to the boundary of a ``translated'' of the critical set. This result was obtained in dimension $n=3$ by Acerbi, Fusco, Julin and Morini (extending previous results for spheres of Escher, Mayer and Simonett and Elliott and Garcke in dimension $n=2$). Our work generalizes such conclusion to any dimension $n\in\mathbb N$. For sake of clarity, we show all the details in dimension $n=4$ and we list the necessary modifications to the quantities involved in the proof in the general $n$--dimensional case, in the last section.</description>

This method is then implemented in 1D by suitable numerical approximation techniques. Numerical experiments complete this study to confirm the theoretical announced results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we contribute two results to the theory of the $2D$ Euler equations in vorticity form on the full plane. First, we establish a generalized Lagrangian representation of weak (in general measure-valued) solutions, which includes and extends classical results on the Lagrangianity of weak solutions. Second, we construct nonlinear Markov processes which are uniquely determined by a selection of weak solutions from initial data in $L^1\cap L^p$, $p \geq 2$, and related spaces such as the classical and uniformly localized Yudovich space. It is well-known that for $p &lt;\infty$ weak solutions are in general not unique, which renders a suitable selection nontrivial.</description>

For the model nonlinearity $f(u)=-u+|u|^{p-1}u$, $1&lt;p&lt;(n+2)/(n-2)$, arisen from finding standing waves of Klein-Gordon equation or nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, we show that, for each integer $k\ge 1$, the problem has a unique solution $u=u(|x|)$, $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, up to translation and reflection, that has precisely $k$ zeros for $|x|&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish H\"older regularity for the weak solution to a degenerate diffusion equation in the presence of a local (drift) potential and nonlocal (interaction) term, posed in a bounded domain with no-flux boundary conditions. The degeneracy is due to saturation, i.e., it occurs when the solution reaches its maximal value. As a byproduct of the established regularity and the underlying dissipative structure of the evolution, we prove the uniform convergence of contractive solutions to a stationary state as $t \to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to consider the Cauchy problem for a weakly coupled system of semi-linear damped wave equations with mixed nonlinear terms. Our main objective is to draw conclusions about the critical curve of this problem using tools from Harmonic Analysis. Precisely, we obtain a new critical curve $pq = 1+ \frac{2}{n}$ for $n =1,2$ by proving global (in time) existence of small data Sobolev solutions when $pq &gt; 1 +\frac{2}{n}$ and blow-up of weak solutions in finite time even for small data when $pq &lt; 1+ \frac{2}{n}$ for $n \geq 1$. From this, we infer the impact of the nonlinearities of time derivative-type on the critical curve associated with the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct global-in-time classical solutions to the nonlinear Vlasov-Maxwell system in a three-dimensional half-space beyond the vacuum scattering regime. Our approach combines the construction of stationary solutions to the associated boundary-value problem with a proof of their asymptotic dynamical stability in $L^\infty$ under small perturbations, providing a new framework for understanding long-time wave-particle interactions in the presence of boundaries and interacting magnetic fields. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first construction of asymptotically stable non-vacuum steady states under general perturbations in the full three-dimensional nonlinear Vlasov-Maxwell system.</description>

      <title>Vorticity blow-up for the 3D incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the finite-time blow-up for classical solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations with low-regularity initial vorticity. Applying the self-similar method and stability analysis of the self-similar system in critical Sobolev space, we prove that the vorticity of the axi-symmetric 3D Euler equations develops a finite-time singularity with certain scaling indices. Furthermore, we investigate the time integrability of the solutions. The proof is based on the new observations for the null structure of the transport term, and the parameter stability of the fundamental self-similar models.</description>

      <title>Cohomogeneity two Ricci solitons with sub-Euclidean volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new families of four-dimensional Ricci solitons of cohomogeneity two with volume collapsing ends. In a local presentation of the metric conformal to a product, we reduce the soliton equation to a degenerate Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation for the conformal factor coupled with ODEs. We obtain explicit complete expanding solitons as well as abstract existence results for shrinking and steady solitons with boundary. These families of Ricci solitons specialize to classical examples of Einstein and soliton metrics. We also classify local solutions of this Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation to prove rigidity for these solitons.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with thermodynamics. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.</description>

      <title>Bicomplex Hardy Classes of Solutions to Beltrami Equations and the Schwarz Boundary Value Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define Hardy classes of bicomplex-valued functions on the complex unit disk which solve bicomplex versions of the Beltrami and related equations. Using representations in terms of their complex-valued counterparts, we show these bicomplex-valued functions recover the boundary behavior associated with the classic holomorphic Hardy spaces. This work generalizes known results for complex-valued functions and continues recent work in the setting of bicomplex analogues of Hardy spaces of both holomorphic and generalized analytic functions. Also, we show Schwarz and Dirichlet boundary value problems associated with the bicomplex Beltrami equation are solvable and provide solution formulas.</description>
