      <title>The Role of Planetary-Scale Waves on the Stratospheric Superrotation in Titan's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze simulation results from the TitanWRF global circulation model to understand the mechanisms that maintain the equatorial superrotation in Titan's stratosphere. We find that the eddies associated with wave activities can transport angular momentum upgradient to zonal flow, leading to acceleration of the equatorial superrotation. The dominant wave modes identified in this study are consistent with previous studies, with zonal wavenumber 1 being the major contributor to the prograde acceleration. Despite the same conclusion of maintenance of equatorial superrotation via wave-mean interactions, we find that the way waves interact with the zonal flow in TitanWRF is slightly different from some other studies. We confirm our previous findings that in TitanWRF this occurs primarily during a dozen or so annual, short-duration (a few Titan sols) angular momentum "transfer events," which have a repeatable seasonal pattern but differ slightly in timing and magnitude between years. This is not the case in the Titan Atmosphere Model (TAM), which found milder angular momentum transfers that produced the strongest acceleration of superrotation around solstice in the upper stratosphere and more continuous year-around acceleration in the lower stratosphere. Despite differences in angular momentum transfer across models, we further find that, similar to the TAM wave analysis results, eddies generated by Rossby-Kelvin instabilities may be the major source of prograde angular momentum for the equatorial superrotation, although TitanWRF may also include contributions from the absorption of vertically propagating equatorial Kelvin waves. This differs from our previous work, which suggested barotropic waves were responsible for TitanWRF's solsticial transfer event.</description>

      <title>Scattering graph method for 3D radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel method for monochromatic scalar 3D radiative transfer, designed primarily for modelling remote sensing imaging, is presented. For simulating an observation of an imaging satellite instrument, the method uses a heuristic scattering coupling function to model the inter-pixel scattering of radiation, which is represented with a graph. The GPU-capable code implementation of the method, TURSCA, was validated against two established 3D RT models, Siro and SHDOM with relative agreement at 3% and 6%, respectively. The method opens up new avenues of research, especially in satellite-based remote sensing of atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Climatic Phase Transitions Unravel the Onset and Withdrawal of Indian Monsoon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The livelihood and food security of more than a billion people depend on the Indian monsoon (IM). Yet, a universal definition of the large-scale season and progress of IM is missing. Even though IM is a planetary-scale convectively coupled system arising largely from seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the definitions of its onset and progression are based on local weather observations, making them practically inutile due to the detection of bogus onsets. Using climate networks, we show that small-scale clusters of locally defined rainfall onsets coalesce through two abrupt climatic phase transitions defining large-scale monsoon onsets over Northeast India and the Indian peninsula, respectively. These abrupt transitions are interspersed with continuous growth of clusters. Breaking the conventional wisdom that IM starts from southern peninsula and expands northward and westward, we unveil that IM starts from Northeast India and expands westward and northward, covering the entire country. We show that the large-scale monsoon onset over the Indian peninsula is critically dependent on the characteristics of monsoon onset over Northeast India. Unlike existing definitions, a rapid and consistent northward propagation of rainfall establishing the ITCZ manifests after our network-based onset dates. Thus, our definition captures the IM onset better than the existing definitions.</description>
