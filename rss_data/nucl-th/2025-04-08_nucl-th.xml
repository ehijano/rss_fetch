      <title>Determination of $S_{18}$ from $^{9}$C breakup reaction within a four-body reaction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical factor $S_{18}$ for the $^{8}$B($p$,$\gamma$)$^{9}$C has indirectly been measured with the proton removal reactions from $^9$C, elastic breakup of $^9$C off a heavy target, and transfer reactions. Quite recently, the elastic breakup cross section data were reanalyzed with the continuum-discretized coupled channels method (CDCC) assuming a $p+{\rm ^{8}B}$ two-body model for $^9$C and the $S_{18}$ was modified. It was not well justified, however, to treat $^8$B as an inert nucleus given its proton separation energy is only 137~keV. We reexamine the elastic breakup of $^9$C by the four-body CDCC with a $p+p+{\rm ^{7}Be}$ three-body model for $^9$C and evaluate $S_{18}$. To achieve this, we propose a method to disentangle the $p+{\rm ^{8}B}+{\rm ^{208}Pb}$ three-body channel in the four-body CDCC calculation, for the first time. We calculate the elastic breakup cross section of $^9$C off a $^{208}$Pb target at 65~MeV/nucleon. The obtained breakup cross sections are decomposed into the contributions of the $p+{\rm ^{8}B}+{\rm ^{208}Pb}$ and $p+p+{\rm ^{7}Be}+{\rm ^{208}Pb}$ channels by using the solution of the complex-scaled Lippmann--Schwinger equation. The breakup cross section to the $p+{\rm ^{8}B}+{\rm ^{208}Pb}$ channel reproduces well the shape of the experimental data in the low breakup energy region, which is important for determining $S_{18}$. By fitting the theoretical result to the experimental data, the asymptotic normalization coefficient of $^9$C for the $p+{\rm ^{8}B}$ configuration is determined and we obtain $S_{18}=38.4\pm1.1$ eVb. This result is smaller than the previous value obtained with the three-body CDCC by about 45\%. Thus, our new results suggest the necessity of taking into account the fragile nature of $^{8}$B in the $^{9}$C breakup.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radii of light nuclei from variational Monte Carlo calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present variational Monte Carlo calculations of charge and magnetic radii in $A \le 10$ nuclei. The calculations are based on the Norfolk two- and three-nucleon interactions, and associated one- and two-nucleon electromagnetic charge and current operators derived up to next-to-next-to-next-to leading order in the chiral expansion. The charge and magnetic radii are extracted from the respective form factors. We find that the charge radii are within 5\% of the experimental values for the nuclei considered. For the magnetic radii, a comparison is available only with $^3$H and $^3$He electron scattering data that are affected by large error bars. We hope that our predictions foster an interest in precisely measuring magnetic radii of heavier systems.</description>

      <title>Non-negligible influence of shape inheritance and staggering on {\alpha} decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of findings in machine learning (ML) and decay theory are captured while exploring the role of deformation and preformation factors in {\alpha} decay. We provide a novel and practical paradigm for developing physics-driven machine learning in nuclear physics research by introducing known decay theory and statistical correlation analysis. Furthermore, this analysis verifies the Geiger-Nuttall law, and the relationship between the decay energy and {\alpha} formation amplitude, also releases a signal that nuclei with hexadecapole deformation are more likely to form {\alpha} clusters. In particular, we identify two novel phenomena, shape inheritance, in which the deformation properties are partially transmitted from parent to daughter nuclei; and half-life inversion due to shape staggering of adjacent even-even nuclei. This phenomenon occurs frequently in neutron-deficient nuclei near lead isotopes, which is consistent with shape coexistence in experiments. Surprisingly, it reappeared within the predicted half-life of the 119 and 120 isotope chains in the eighth period of the periodic table. The half-life considering the inversion effect is preferable for the study of new nuclides and shape coexistence in experiments.</description>

      <title>Probability for synthesis of superheavy nuclei with Z=121</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study the empirical method \cite{RN464} is used for calculating the evaporation residue (ER) cross section in the synthesis of superheavy nuclei (SHN). The superheavy nuclei examined in this work fall within the range $Z=112-118$. The theoretical calculations show good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, this model, along with an investigation of the optimal incident energy (OIE), is used to calculate the ER cross section for a hypothetical heavy system with $Z=121$. Five promising combinations are suggested for synthesis of SHN with $Z=121$: (1) ${^{50}}\mathrm{Ti}+{^{252}}\mathrm{Es}$, with the maximum ER cross section $\sigma_{3n}=24.5~\mathrm{fb}$, at the optimal incident energy, $\mathrm{OIE}=230~\mathrm{MeV}$; (2) ${^{50}}\mathrm{Ti}+{^{254}}\mathrm{Es}$, with the maximum ER cross section $\sigma_{3n}=11.8~\mathrm{fb}$, at the optimal incident energy, $\mathrm{OIE}=229~\mathrm{MeV}$; (3) ${^{51}}\mathrm{V}+{^{251}}\mathrm{Cf}$, with the maximum ER cross section $\sigma_{3n}=1.2~\mathrm{fb}$, at the optimal incident energy, $\mathrm{OIE}=238~\mathrm{MeV}$; (4) ${^{51}}\mathrm{V}+{^{249}}\mathrm{Cf}$, with the maximum ER cross section $\sigma_{3n}=1.0~\mathrm{fb}$, at the optimal incident energy, $\mathrm{OIE}=238~\mathrm{MeV}$; and (5) ${^{54}}\mathrm{Cr}+{^{247}}\mathrm{Bk}$, with the maximum ER cross section $\sigma_{2n}=0.9~\mathrm{fb}$, at the optimal incident energy, $\mathrm{OIE}=243~\mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the problem of scattering of charged particles, we introduce a new approach of taking the Coulomb interaction into account within the HORSE formalism. Compared to the conventional HORSE approach for uncharged particles, we add a diagonal Coulomb term to} the three-term recurrent relation for expansion coefficients in the asymptotic region. The method simplifies calculations and demonstrates a good agreement with numerical solution.</description>

      <title>Examination of the lattice QCD-motivated strong attractive $\Omega N$ potentials in the $\Omega^- n p$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the Faddeev equations in configuration space, we examine the $\Omega^{-} np$ system, employing strongly attractive lattice HAL QCD and Yukawa-type meson exchange potentials for the $\Omega N$ interaction. Our formalism incorporates the attractive Coulomb force between the $\Omega^{-}$ and proton, treating the system as three non-identical particle pairs (the $ABC$ model). In this study, we assess the impact of the Coulomb interaction on the system and compare our results with recent $\Omega NN$ ($AAC$ model) calculations obtained using various approaches. The $ABC$ model yields low-energy characteristics for the \(\Omega NN\) system that differ from previous calculations. The Coulomb potential has a marginal perturbative effect on the $AAC$ system, shifting the three-body binding energy by the Coulomb energy of the two-body $BC$ subsystem, but only slightly deviating the spatial configuration from isosceles triangle symmetry. These effects are primarily driven by the strong \(\Omega N\) interaction. We demonstrate that the large binding energy of the $\Omega^{-} np$ system arises from the short-range behavior of the $\Omega N$ potentials.</description>

      <title>Identifying $\alpha$-cluster configurations in $^{20}$Ne via ultracentral Ne+Ne Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial-state geometry in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides a unique probe to nuclear cluster structure $-$ a long-standing challenge in nuclear structure physics. Through the microscopic Brink model, we establish a quantitative framework to decode complicated cluster structures encoded in the cluster wave function, revealing non-negligible cluster components stemming from the rich structural degrees of freedom for the ground state of $^{20}$Ne. By combining this approach with advanced analytical calculation techniques, we demonstrate that the normalized symmetric cumulant NSC(3, 2) and Pearson coefficient $\rho (\varepsilon_{3}^{2},\ \delta d_{\perp})$ serve as robust discriminators between $5\alpha$ and $\alpha$+$^{16}$O cluster configurations in $^{20}$Ne. Our findings suggest that ultracentral Ne+Ne collisions at the LHC can experimentally isolate $\alpha$-clustering configurations via flow correlations, opening a new paradigm for probing clustering in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Fermi Operator Expansion for the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of phases in the inner crust of neutron stars are crucial for understanding the pulsar phenomena. However, the three-dimensional coordinate-space calculation of the phases is computationally demanding. We aim to generalize the Fermi Operator Expansion (FOE) method that is effective for finite-temperature coordinate-space simulation, from the Hartree-Fock theory to Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory including the pairing effects. Furthermore, the periodic structure with free neutrons in the inner crust requires us to treat the system with the band theory. We give a concise proof that the generalized density matrix in the HFB theory can be obtained with the FOE. The Chebyshev polynomial expansion is used for calculations of the HFB band theory. Using a model for a slab phase of the inner crust, the FOE method produces results in good agreement with those based on the diagonalization of the HFB Hamiltonian. The FOE method for the HFB band theory is a powerful tool for studying the non-trivial exotic structures in neutron stars. The FOE method is suitable for parallelization and further acceleration is possible with nearsightedness.</description>

      <title>Re-evaluation of the deuteron-deuteron thermonuclear reaction rates in metallic deuterium plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deuteron-deuteron (D-D) thermonuclear reaction rates in metallic environments (considering the electron screening effects) is re-evaluated using the S-factor functions which
  were obtained by fitting to low-energy data on D-D reactions.
  For this purpose, a fitted S-factor model based on the NACRE compilation is employed.
  This limited the energy range of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) for
  the $ ^{2}\textrm{H}\left(d,p\right) ^{3}\textrm{H}$ and $^{2} \textrm{H} \left(d,n\right) ^{3}\textrm{He}$ reactions.
  The corresponding Maxwellian-averaged thermonuclear reaction
  rates of relevance in astrophysical plasmas at temperatures in the
  range from $10^{6}$ K to $10^{10}\left(\textrm{or }1.3\times10^{8}\right)$ K are provided in tabular formats.
  In these evaluations,
  the screening energy is assumed to be $100, 400, 750, 1000$ eV and $1250$ eV.
  This series of values has been selected based on theoretical and experimental studies conducted so far.</description>

      <title>Color superconductivity under neutron-star conditions at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state of deconfined strongly interacting matter at high densities remains an open question, with effects from quark pairing in the preferred color-flavor-locked (CFL) ground state possibly playing an important role. Recent studies suggest that at least large pairing gaps in the CFL phase are incompatible with current astrophysical observations of neutron stars. At the same time, it has recently been shown that in two-flavor quark matter, subleading corrections from pairing effects can be much larger than would be na\"ively expected, even for comparatively small gaps. In the present Letter, we compute next-to-leading-order corrections to the pressure of quark matter in the CFL phase arising from the gap and the strong coupling constant, incorporating neutron-star equilibrium conditions and current state-of-the-art perturbative QCD results. We find that the corrections are again quite sizable, and they allow us to constrain the CFL gap in the quark energy spectrum to $\Delta_{\rm CFL} \lesssim 140~{\rm MeV}$ at a baryon chemical potential $\mu_{\rm B} = 2.6~{\rm GeV}$, even when allowing for a wide range of possible behaviors for the dependence of the gap on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation functions for axial-vector $T_{4c}$ and $T_{4b}$ tetraquarks: A TQ4Q1.1 update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and discuss the release of novel sets of collinear, variable-flavor-number-scheme fragmentation functions for axial-vector, fully heavy $T_{4c}(1^{+-})$ and $T_{4b}(1^{+-})$ tetraquarks. Working within the single-parton approximation at leading power and employing nonrelativistic QCD factorization adapted for tetraquark Fock states, we model the initial-scale fragmentation input using a recent calculation for the constituent heavy-quark channel. Standard DGLAP evolution is then applied, ensuring consistent implementation of evolution thresholds. To support phenomenology, we investigate NLL/NLO$^+$ rates for tetraquark-jet systems at the HL-LHC and FCC from (sym)JETHAD. This study further integrates exotic matter explorations with precision QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Study of Nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances from a Systematic Analysis of $K^\ast\Sigma$ Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic analysis of the $K^\ast\Sigma$ photoproduction off proton is performed with all the available differential cross section data. We carry out a strategy different from the previous studies of these reactions, that instead of fixing the parameters of the added resonances from PDG or pentaquark models, we add the resonance with a specific $J^P$ and leave its parameters to be determined from the experimental data. When adding only one resonance, the best result is to add one $N(3/2^-)$ resonance around $2097$ MeV, which substantially reduce the $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to $1.35$. There are two best solutions when adding two resonances, one is to add one $N^\ast(3/2^-)$ and one $N^\ast(7/2^-)$, the other is to add one $N^\ast(3/2^-)$ and one $\Delta^\ast(7/2^-)$, leading the $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to be $1.10$ and $1.09$, respectively. The mass values of the $N^\ast(3/2^-)$ in the two-resonance solutions are both near $2070$ MeV. Our solutions indicate that the $N(3/2^-)$ resonance around $2080$ MeV is strongly coupled with the $K^\ast\Sigma$ final state and support the molecular picture of $N(2080, 3/2^-)$.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>Finite-Temperature Perturbation Theory of Rotating Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the finite-temperature perturbation theory of interacting scalar fields under external rotation. Because of the translational non-invariance in the radial direction, Green's functions are described using the Fourier-Bessel basis, instead of the conventional Fourier basis. We derive the leading order correction to the partition function and the one-loop self-energy, which involve an analytically intractable integral with Bessel functions. The Feynman rules obtained in our perturbation theory suggest that the zero-temperature thermodynamics of the perturbatively interacting theory is unaffected by rotation, similarly to that of the noninteracting theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the femtoscopic correlation functions of charmonium-nucleon pairs, utilizing the lattice QCD phase shifts provided by the HAL QCD Collaboration. A model-independent formalism is employed to transform scattering phase shifts directly into momentum correlation functions, thereby circumventing the approximations inherent in traditional methods, such as the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshits model. The $J/\psi$-$p$ correlation functions, including spin-averaged and partial-wave results, are predicted using near-physical pion mass lattice results. The $\eta_c$-$p$ correlation function is calculated for the first time. The derived correlation functions provide critical references for future experiments, such as those at the LHC, where high-precision measurements of charmonium-nucleon correlations could unveil valuable insights into non-perturbative QCD dynamics.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the baryon time-like electromagnetic form factors in the electron-positron annihilation reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the experimental measurements of the electron-positron annihilation reactions into a baryon ($B$) and anti-baryon ($\bar{B}$) pair, the electromagnetic form factors of hyperons in the time-like region can be investigated within the vector meson dominance model. The theoretical model parameters are determined by fitting them to the total cross sections of the process $e^+e^-\to B \bar{B}$, and it is found that the current experimental data on the baryon electromagnetic form factors in the time-like region can be well reproduced. In addition to the total cross sections, the electromagnetic form factors $G_E$ and $G_M$, and the charge radii of those baryons are also estimated, which are in agreement with the experimental data. On the other hand, we have also investigated the nonmonotonic behavior of the time-like baryon electromagnetic form factors, and it is found that the previously proposed periodic behaviour of the nucleon time-like electromagnetic form factor is not confirmed. However, we do observe the nonmonotonic structures in the line shape of the baryon effective form factors or the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for the charmed baryon $\Lambda^+_c$. These features can be naturally explained by incorporating contributions from excited vector states. More precise measurements of the $e^+e^-\to B \bar{B}$ reaction offer a valuable opportunity to probe the properties of excited vector states, which are at present poorly known. Additionally, comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies of baryon timelike electromagnetic form factors can provide critical insights into the underlying mechanisms of electron-positron annihilation processes.</description>

      <title>Finite density signatures of confining and chiral dynamics in QCD thermodynamics and fluctuations of conserved charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate thermodynamic observables such as pressure, baryon number, entropy and energy density, as well as the second and fourth order baryon number cumulants in the phase structure of QCD. The intertwined confinement and chiral dynamics is resolved within functional QCD, aiming for quantitative accuracy at larger densities. Specifically it is shown that the self-consistent resolution of the confining gluonic background is crucial in particular for even the qualitative properties of the cumulants. Our results are in quantitative agreement with lattice and functional QCD benchmarks at vanishing and small chemical potentials. Moreover, they offer novel insights in the dynamics at larger chemical potentials including the regime of the critical end point. A welcome by-product of this analysis is the computation of the Polyakov loop potential in finite density QCD, which, alongside the aforementioned observables, can be used as input and benchmark for effective theory computations at finite density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) soft function for a generic hadroproduction process involving massive colored particles is analytically calculated at the one-loop level, extended to higher orders in the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$. We present both the azimuthal-angle-averaged and azimuthal-angle-dependent soft functions in impact-parameter space, making them suitable for small $q_T$ resummation calculations. Their analytic expressions are provided in terms of multiple polylogarithms. Our results offer essential ingredients for a complete higher-order perturbative calculation of the TMD soft function.</description>

      <title>Precision DIS thrust predictions for HERA and EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present predictions for the DIS 1-jettiness event shape $\tau_1^b$, or DIS thrust, using the framework of Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) for factorization, resummation of large logarithms, and rigorous treatment of nonperturbative power corrections, matched to fixed-order QCD away from the resummation region. Our predictions reach next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (N$^3$LL) accuracy in resummed perturbation theory, matched to $O(\alpha_s^2)$ fixed-order QCD calculations obtained using the program NLOJet++. We include a rigorous treatment of hadronization corrections, which are universal across different event shapes and kinematic variables $x$ and $Q$ at leading power, and supplement them with a systematic scheme to remove $O(\Lambda_\textrm{QCD})$ renormalon ambiguities in their definition. The framework of SCET allows us to connect smoothly the nonperturbative, resummation, and fixed-order regions, whose relative importance varies with $x$ and $Q$, and to rigorously estimate theoretical uncertainties, across a broad range of $x$ and $Q$ covering existing experimental results from HERA as well as expected new measurements from the upcoming Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC). Our predictions will serve as an important benchmark for the EIC program, enabling the precise determination of the QCD strong coupling $\alpha_s$ and the universal nonperturbative first moment parameter $\Omega_1$.</description>

      <title>Nuclear transparency and shadowing of the two-step process in the $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05129v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate nuclear transparency induced by pion electroproduction on nuclei $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ with our interest in the role of the two-step process in the Glauber multiple scattering theory. Based on the framework in which the quantum diffusion model is incorporated into the Glauber theory, the experimental data in the range of photon virtuality $0.5&lt; Q^2&lt; 10$ GeV$^2/c^2$ are analyzed, including the recent JLab data at the 6 GeV electron beam together with the proposal for the 12 GeV upgrade. Application of the quantum diffusion model during the formation length of the quark/antiquark $(q\bar{q})$ structure of a pion reproduces the increase in the nuclear transparency up to high $Q^2$, showing evidence for color transparency. In contrast, through the coherent length of the $\gamma^*$ fluctuation into $\rho^0$, the two-step process with the $\rho N$ scattering cross section chosen to be $\sigma_{\rho N}=\sigma_{\pi N}$ contributes to a reduction of the nuclear transparency in the whole range of $Q^2$. Combined with the one-step process (direct photon coupling) usually adopted in the original formulation of the Glauber theory, this reaction mechanism provides another source of the $Q^2$ dependence of the transparency at low virtualities through the shadowing in the initial state interaction. By the further absorption due to the shadowing, a better agreement is obtained with the pion transparency measured in the $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ reaction for $^{12}$C, $^{27}$Al, $^{63}$Cu, and $^{197}$Au nuclei.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the quantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear shell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit registers using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24 qubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement ($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\sim 8$ for some nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell, dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion. These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.</description>

      <title>On the Approach Towards Equilibrium Through Momentum-Dependent Relaxation:Insights from Evolution of the Moments in Kinetic Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of momentum-dependent relaxation time approximation in the Boltzmann equation within the Bjorken flow framework by analyzing the moments of the single-particle distribution function. The moment equations, which form an infinite hierarchy, provide important insights about the system dynamics and the approach towards equilibrium for systems far from equilibrium. We show that a momentum-dependent collision kernel couples moments through both the energy exponents and the angular dependence via various-order Legendre polynomials, resulting in an intricate system of infinitely coupled equations that are complex and numerically challenging to solve. We outline strategies for solving the coupled system, including a novel approach for managing the infinite hierarchy and handling the non-integer moments. We show a significant influence of momentum dependent relaxation time on the time evolution of the moments, particularly for higher-order moments and system with smaller shear viscosity over entropy density, emphasizing the importance of incorporating such dependence for a more accurate description of the system dynamics with low shear viscosity such as the quark-gluon-plasma produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central question in heavy-ion collisions is how the initial far-from-equilibrium medium evolves and thermalizes while it undergoes a rapid longitudinal expansion. In this work we use the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action for the first time to consider this question, focusing on $\phi^4$ scalar theory truncated at three loops. We calculate the momentum distribution of quasiparticles in the medium and show that isotropization takes place. We furthermore consider the thermal mass of quasiparticles and the importance of number-changing processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-body strong decays of the $f_0(1500)$, $f_0(1710)$, $a_0(1710)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2'(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$ resonances are investigated, assuming them as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons via $s$-wave interactions. The partial decay widths of all the possible two-body pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson final states are calculated considering the triangular diagrams. It is found that the ratios of branching fractions are similar to the previous results for most channels, which were obtained by using the real-axis method and considering the box diagrams. However, there are also differences. In addition, our focus is on the partial decay widths. More precise experimental measurements are needed to test the model calculations and determine the nature of these scalar and tensor mesons. It is anticipated that the BES\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}, Belle\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} and LHCb collaborations will conduct these measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>Probing strangeness with event topology classifiers in pp collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider with the rope hadronization mechanism in PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a deconfined and thermalized state of partons, known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP), leads to enhanced production of strange hadrons in contrast to proton-proton (pp) collisions, which are taken as baseline. This observation is known as strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions and is considered one of the important signatures that can signify the formation of QGP. However, in addition to strangeness enhancement, recent measurements hint at observing several heavy-ion-like features in high multiplicity pp collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Alternatively, event shape observables, such as transverse spherocity, transverse sphericity, charged particle flattenicity, and relative transverse activity classifiers, can fundamentally separate hard interaction-dominated jetty events from soft isotropic events. These features of event shape observables can probe the observed heavy-ion-like features in pp collisions with significantly reduced selection bias and can bring all collision systems on equal footing. In this article, we present an extensive summary of the strange particle ratios to pions as a function of different event classifiers using the PYTHIA~8 model with color reconnection and rope hadronization mechanisms to understand the microscopic origin of strangeness enhancement in pp collisions and also prescribe the applicability of these event classifiers in the context of strangeness enhancement. Charged particle flattenicity is found to be most suited for the study of strangeness enhancement, and it shows a quantitative enhancement similar to that seen for the analysis based on the number of multi-parton interactions.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the recent data from the BESIII collaboration on the $X(3872)$ state in the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ decay channels. The quantum number and mass of the $X(3872)$ state allow us to exploit the universal feature of the very near-threshold $D\bar D^*$ scattering in the $S$ wave. The analysis of $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ data and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ data separately as well as the combined analysis of these data together, all support the conclusion that $X(3872)$ is an extremely weakly bound charm meson molecule.</description>

      <title>Photon polarization tensor at finite temperature and density in a magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present analytical and numerical calculations for the photon polarization tensor at finite temperature and density in a constant magnetic field. We first discuss the tensor decomposition in the presence of the magnetic field, which breaks rotational symmetry. Then, we analytically perform all the momentum integrations and numerically take the Landau level sum. We confirm that the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor correctly reproduces the known result from the independent calculation. We utilize the Kramers-Kronig relation to estimate the real part numerically as a function of the momenta, the chemical potential, and the finite temperature. As an application, we consider the real photon limit and estimate the photon decay rate and the Stokes parameter in the hot and dense medium. We specifically quantify the difference between the X-mode and the O-mode with the polarization orthogonal and parallel to the magnetic field. As long as the magnetic field is weak, the decay rate of the X-mode photon is larger than that of the O-mode photon, while the O-mode becomes dominant due to the Landau level suppression of the X-mode at a strong magnetic field. We also find that the eigenmodes of the propagating photon change their polarization state with increasing density.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation has been extensively employed to compute the two-body electron-hole propagator and its poles which correspond to the neutral excitation energies of the system. Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Excited-State-Specific Kohn-Sham Formalism for the Asymmetric Hubbard Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on our recent study [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02052, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</description>

      <title>Tomography of the Rho meson in the QCD Instanton Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the rho meson unpolarized and polarized transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM). The corresponding TMDs in ILM are approximated by a constituent quark beam function in the leading Fock state multiplied by a rapidity-dependent factor resulting from the staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed longitudinal momentum, transverse separation, and rapidity. At the resolution of the ILM, all of the rho meson TMDs are symmetric in parton x for fixed transverse momentum, and Gaussian-like in the transverse momentum for fixed parton x. The latter is a direct consequence of the profiling of the quark zero modes in the ILM. The evolved TMDs at higher rapidity using the Collins-Soper kernel, and higher resolution using the renormalization group (RG), show substantial skewness towards low parton x.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flows of identified hadrons in the equal-velocity quark combination model at RHIC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ an equal-velocity quark combination model to study anisotropic flows $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC energies. Under the equal-velocity combination mechanism of constituent quarks at hadronization, we build analytical formulas of anisotropic flows of hadrons in terms of those of quarks just before hadronization. We systematically analyze the contribution of higher order flows of quarks, and show how simple formulas of $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons with the desired precision can be obtained by neglecting the small contribution of higher order flows of quarks. We systematically test these simple formulas of hadronic flows by the experimental data of $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons $\phi$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, $\Omega^{-}$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $\bar{\Xi}^{+}$, $\bar{\Omega}^{+}$, $p$ and $\bar{p}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 19.6, 54.4 and 200 GeV, and we find that the equal-velocity quark combination model can well describe the measured $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons in Au+Au collisions at those collision energies. We further study the obtained anisotropic flows of quarks and find two scaling properties\textcolor{red}{{} }which can be qualitatively understood by the hydrodynamic evolution of thermal quark medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Worldvolume fermion as baryon with homogeneous instantons in holographic $\mathrm{QCD}_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate holographically the effective theory of the worldvolume fermion on the flavor branes in the D3/D7 model with homogeneously smeared D(-1)-branes. As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the D(-1)-branes are instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. The background geometry of this model contains black brane (deconfined geometry) and bubble D3-brane solutions (confined geometry), all with a non-zero Romand-Romand zero form as axion. The dual theories to the backgrounds are respectively the Super Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature and three-dimensional confining Yang-Mills theory, all with a Chern-Simons term induced by instantons. In the confined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on $S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic flux on the D7-brane as a baryonic operator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation function of the flavored fermion on the D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic spectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined correlation function, and the mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our model is close to the associated experimental data. Moreover, the effective interaction terms of the holographic baryon and meson are derived and all the coupling constants take order of $N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation from the large N field theory. In the deconfined geometry, the holographic correlation function is also evaluated numerically while the fermion on D7-brane is identified to plasmino instead of baryon. The dispersion curves from the deconfined correlation function basically covers the results from the hard thermal loop approximation and may imply the instanton-induced interaction with spin. Overall, this work constructs a holographic theory about baryonic fermion and mesonic boson with instantons or CP violation.</description>

      <title>The Short-Baseline Near Detector at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SBND is a 112 ton liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino detector located 110 meters from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) target at Fermilab. Its main goals include searches for eV-scale sterile neutrinos as part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program, other searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, and precision studies of neutrino-argon interactions. In addition, SBND is providing a platform for LArTPC neutrino detector technology development and is an excellent training ground for the international group of scientists and engineers working towards the upcoming flagship Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). SBND began operation in July 2024, and started collecting stable neutrino beam data in December 2024 with an unprecedented rate of ~7,000 neutrino events per day. During its currently approved operation plans (2024-2027), SBND is expected to accumulate nearly 10 million neutrino interactions. The near detector dataset will be instrumental in testing the sterile neutrino hypothesis with unprecedented sensitivity in SBN and in probing signals of beyond the Standard Model physics. It will also be used to significantly advance our understanding of the physics of neutrino-argon interactions ahead of DUNE. After the planned accelerator restart at Fermilab (2029+), opportunities are being explored to operate SBND in antineutrino mode in order to address the scarcity of antineutrino-argon scattering data, or in a dedicated beam-dump mode to significantly enhance sensitivity to searches for new physics. SBND is an international effort, with approximately 40% of institutions from Europe, contributing to detector construction, commissioning, software development, and data analysis. Continued European involvement and leadership are essential during SBND's operations and analysis phase for both the success of SBND, SBN and its role leading up to DUNE.</description>
