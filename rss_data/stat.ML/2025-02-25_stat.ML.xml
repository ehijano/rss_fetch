      <title>Exact Recovery of Sparse Binary Vectors from Generalized Linear Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of exact recovery of a $k$-sparse binary vector from generalized linear measurements (such as logistic regression). We analyze the linear estimation algorithm (Plan, Vershynin, Yudovina, 2017), and also show information theoretic lower bounds on the number of required measurements. As a consequence of our results, for noisy one bit quantized linear measurements ($\mathsf{1bCSbinary}$), we obtain a sample complexity of $O((k+\sigma^2)\log{n})$, where $\sigma^2$ is the noise variance. This is shown to be optimal due to the information theoretic lower bound. We also obtain tight sample complexity characterization for logistic regression.
  Since $\mathsf{1bCSbinary}$ is a strictly harder problem than noisy linear measurements ($\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$) because of added quantization, the same sample complexity is achievable for $\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$. While this sample complexity can be obtained via the popular lasso algorithm, linear estimation is computationally more efficient. Our lower bound holds for any set of measurements for $\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$, (similar bound was known for Gaussian measurement matrices) and is closely matched by the maximum-likelihood upper bound. For $\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$, it was conjectured in Gamarnik and Zadik, 2017 that there is a statistical-computational gap and the number of measurements should be at least $(2k+\sigma^2)\log{n}$ for efficient algorithms to exist. It is worth noting that our results imply that there is no such statistical-computational gap for $\mathsf{1bCSbinary}$ and logistic regression.</description>

      <title>A Review of Causal Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make effective decisions, it is important to have a thorough understanding of the causal relationships among actions, environments, and outcomes. This review aims to surface three crucial aspects of decision-making through a causal lens: 1) the discovery of causal relationships through causal structure learning, 2) understanding the impacts of these relationships through causal effect learning, and 3) applying the knowledge gained from the first two aspects to support decision making via causal policy learning. Moreover, we identify challenges that hinder the broader utilization of causal decision-making and discuss recent advances in overcoming these challenges. Finally, we provide future research directions to address these challenges and to further enhance the implementation of causal decision-making in practice, with real-world applications illustrated based on the proposed causal decision-making. We aim to offer a comprehensive methodology and practical implementation framework by consolidating various methods in this area into a Python-based collection.

      <title>Statistical Inference in Reinforcement Learning: A Selective Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is concerned with how intelligence agents take actions in a given environment to maximize the cumulative reward they receive. In healthcare, applying RL algorithms could assist patients in improving their health status. In ride-sharing platforms, applying RL algorithms could increase drivers' income and customer satisfaction. Over the past decade, RL has been arguably one of the most vibrant research frontiers in machine learning. Nevertheless, statistics as a field, as opposed to computer science, has only recently begun to engage with RL both in depth and in breadth. This paper present a selective review of statistical inferential tools for RL, covering both hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction. Our goal is to highlight the value of statistical inference in RL for both the statistics and machine learning communities, and to promote the broader application of classical statistical inference tools in this vibrant area of research.</description>

      <title>Rectifying Conformity Scores for Better Conditional Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for generating confidence sets within the split conformal prediction framework. Our method performs a trainable transformation of any given conformity score to improve conditional coverage while ensuring exact marginal coverage. The transformation is based on an estimate of the conditional quantile of conformity scores. The resulting method is particularly beneficial for constructing adaptive confidence sets in multi-output problems where standard conformal quantile regression approaches have limited applicability. We develop a theoretical bound that captures the influence of the accuracy of the quantile estimate on the approximate conditional validity, unlike classical bounds for conformal prediction methods that only offer marginal coverage. We experimentally show that our method is highly adaptive to the local data structure and outperforms existing methods in terms of conditional coverage, improving the reliability of statistical inference in various applications.</description>

      <title>Subspace Recovery in Winsorized PCA: Insights into Accuracy and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the theoretical properties of subspace recovery using Winsorized Principal Component Analysis (WPCA), utilizing a common data transformation technique that caps extreme values to mitigate the impact of outliers. Despite the widespread use of winsorization in various tasks of multivariate analysis, its theoretical properties, particularly for subspace recovery, have received limited attention. We provide a detailed analysis of the accuracy of WPCA, showing that increasing the number of samples while decreasing the proportion of outliers guarantees the consistency of the sample subspaces from WPCA with respect to the true population subspace. Furthermore, we establish perturbation bounds that ensure the WPCA subspace obtained from contaminated data remains close to the subspace recovered from pure data. Additionally, we extend the classical notion of breakdown points to subspace-valued statistics and derive lower bounds for the breakdown points of WPCA. Our analysis demonstrates that WPCA exhibits strong robustness to outliers while maintaining consistency under mild assumptions. A toy example is provided to numerically illustrate the behavior of the upper bounds for perturbation bounds and breakdown points, emphasizing winsorization's utility in subspace recovery.</description>

      <title>Transformations of predictions and realizations in consistent scoring functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scoring functions constructed by transforming the realization and prediction variables of (strictly) consistent scoring functions have been widely studied empirically, yet their theoretical foundations remain unexplored. To address this gap, we establish formal characterizations of (strict) consistency for these transformed scoring functions and their elicitable functionals. Our analysis focuses on two interrelated cases: (a) transformations applied exclusively to the realization variable, and (b) bijective transformations applied jointly to both realization and prediction variables. We formulate analogous characterizations for (strict) identification functions. The resulting theoretical framework is broadly applicable to statistical and machine learning methodologies. When applied to Bregman and expectile scoring functions, our framework shows how it enables two critical advances: (a) rigorous interpretation of prior empirical findings from models trained with transformed scoring functions, and (b) systematic construction of novel identifiable and elicitable functionals, specifically the g-transformed expectation and g-transformed expectile. By unifying theoretical insights with practical applications, this work advances principled methodologies for designing scoring functions in complex predictive tasks.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample Analysis of Policy Evaluation for Robust Average Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first finite-sample analysis for policy evaluation in robust average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Prior works in this setting have established only asymptotic convergence guarantees, leaving open the question of sample complexity. In this work, we address this gap by establishing that the robust Bellman operator is a contraction under the span semi-norm, and developing a stochastic approximation framework with controlled bias. Our approach builds upon Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) techniques to estimate the robust Bellman operator efficiently. To overcome the infinite expected sample complexity inherent in standard MLMC, we introduce a truncation mechanism based on a geometric distribution, ensuring a finite constant sample complexity while maintaining a small bias that decays exponentially with the truncation level. Our method achieves the order-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for robust policy evaluation and robust average reward estimation, marking a significant advancement in robust reinforcement learning theory.</description>

      <title>Provable Benefits of Unsupervised Pre-training and Transfer Learning via Single-Index Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training and transfer learning are commonly used techniques to initialize training algorithms for neural networks, particularly in settings with limited labeled data. In this paper, we study the effects of unsupervised pre-training and transfer learning on the sample complexity of high-dimensional supervised learning. Specifically, we consider the problem of training a single-layer neural network via online stochastic gradient descent. We establish that pre-training and transfer learning (under concept shift) reduce sample complexity by polynomial factors (in the dimension) under very general assumptions. We also uncover some surprising settings where pre-training grants exponential improvement over random initialization in terms of sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Shallow ReLU Networks on Weakly Interacting Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the convergence of one-hidden-layer ReLU networks trained by gradient flow on $n$ data points. Our main contribution leverages the high dimensionality of the ambient space, which implies low correlation of the input samples, to demonstrate that a network with width of order $\log(n)$ neurons suffices for global convergence with high probability. Our analysis uses a Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz viewpoint along the gradient-flow trajectory, which provides an exponential rate of convergence of $\frac{1}{n}$. When the data are exactly orthogonal, we give further refined characterizations of the convergence speed, proving its asymptotic behavior lies between the orders $\frac{1}{n}$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, and exhibiting a phase-transition phenomenon in the convergence rate, during which it evolves from the lower bound to the upper, and in a relative time of order $\frac{1}{\log(n)}$.</description>

      <title>Your Assumed DAG is Wrong and Here's How To Deal With It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents prior knowledge of causal relationships between variables is a common starting point for cause-effect estimation. Existing literature typically invokes hypothetical domain expert knowledge or causal discovery algorithms to justify this assumption. In practice, neither may propose a single DAG with high confidence. Domain experts are hesitant to rule out dependencies with certainty or have ongoing disputes about relationships; causal discovery often relies on untestable assumptions itself or only provides an equivalence class of DAGs and is commonly sensitive to hyperparameter and threshold choices. We propose an efficient, gradient-based optimization method that provides bounds for causal queries over a collection of causal graphs -- compatible with imperfect prior knowledge -- that may still be too large for exhaustive enumeration. Our bounds achieve good coverage and sharpness for causal queries such as average treatment effects in linear and non-linear synthetic settings as well as on real-world data. Our approach aims at providing an easy-to-use and widely applicable rebuttal to the valid critique of `What if your assumed DAG is wrong?'.</description>

      <title>Random Projections and Natural Sparsity in Time-Series Classification: A Theoretical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series classification is essential across diverse domains, including medical diagnosis, industrial monitoring, financial forecasting, and human activity recognition. The Rocket algorithm has emerged as a simple yet powerful method, achieving state-of-the-art performance through random convolutional kernels applied to time-series data, followed by non-linear transformation. Its architecture approximates a one-hidden-layer convolutional neural network while eliminating parameter training, ensuring computational efficiency. Despite its empirical success, fundamental questions about its theoretical foundations remain unexplored. We bridge theory and practice by formalizing Rocket's random convolutional filters within the compressed sensing framework, proving that random projections preserve discriminative patterns in time-series data. This analysis reveals relationships between kernel parameters and input signal characteristics, enabling more principled approaches to algorithm configuration. Moreover, we demonstrate that its non-linearity, based on the proportion of positive values after convolutions, expresses the inherent sparsity of time-series data. Our theoretical investigation also proves that Rocket satisfies two critical conditions: translation invariance and noise robustness. These findings enhance interpretability and provide guidance for parameter optimization in extreme cases, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical application of time-series classification.</description>

      <title>On Quantile Regression Forests for Modelling Mixed-Frequency and Longitudinal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this thesis is to extend the applications of the Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) algorithm to handle mixed-frequency and longitudinal data. To this end, standard statistical approaches have been exploited to build two novel algorithms: the Mixed- Frequency Quantile Regression Forest (MIDAS-QRF) and the Finite Mixture Quantile Regression Forest (FM-QRF). The MIDAS-QRF combines the flexibility of QRF with the Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) approach, enabling non-parametric quantile estimation with variables observed at different frequencies. FM-QRF, on the other hand, extends random effects machine learning algorithms to a QR framework, allowing for conditional quantile estimation in a longitudinal data setting. The contributions of this dissertation lie both methodologically and empirically. Methodologically, the MIDAS-QRF and the FM-QRF represent two novel approaches for handling mixed-frequency and longitudinal data in QR machine learning framework. Empirically, the application of the proposed models in financial risk management and climate-change impact evaluation demonstrates their validity as accurate and flexible models to be applied in complex empirical settings.</description>

      <title>Differential privacy guarantees of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide differential privacy (DP) guarantees for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. In a first part, we establish DP guarantees on samples output by MCMC algorithms as well as Monte Carlo estimators associated with these methods under assumptions on the convergence properties of the underlying Markov chain. In particular, our results highlight the critical condition of ensuring the target distribution is differentially private itself. In a second part, we specialise our analysis to the unadjusted Langevin algorithm and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and establish guarantees on their (R\'enyi) DP. To this end, we develop a novel methodology based on Girsanov's theorem combined with a perturbation trick to obtain bounds for an unbounded domain and in a non-convex setting. We establish: (i) uniform in $n$ privacy guarantees when the state of the chain after $n$ iterations is released, (ii) bounds on the privacy of the entire chain trajectory. These findings provide concrete guidelines for privacy-preserving MCMC.</description>

      <title>Linear Bandits on Ellipsoids: Minimax Optimal Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear stochastic bandits where the set of actions is an ellipsoid. We provide the first known minimax optimal algorithm for this problem. We first derive a novel information-theoretic lower bound on the regret of any algorithm, which must be at least $\Omega(\min(d \sigma \sqrt{T} + d \|\theta\|_{A}, \|\theta\|_{A} T))$ where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ the time horizon, $\sigma^2$ the noise variance, $A$ a matrix defining the set of actions and $\theta$ the vector of unknown parameters. We then provide an algorithm whose regret matches this bound to a multiplicative universal constant. The algorithm is non-classical in the sense that it is not optimistic, and it is not a sampling algorithm. The main idea is to combine a novel sequential procedure to estimate $\|\theta\|$, followed by an explore-and-commit strategy informed by this estimate. The algorithm is highly computationally efficient, and a run requires only time $O(dT + d^2 \log(T/d) + d^3)$ and memory $O(d^2)$, in contrast with known optimistic algorithms, which are not implementable in polynomial time. We go beyond minimax optimality and show that our algorithm is locally asymptotically minimax optimal, a much stronger notion of optimality. We further provide numerical experiments to illustrate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>When to Forget? Complexity Trade-offs in Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims at removing the influence of specific data points from a trained model, striving to achieve this at a fraction of the cost of full model retraining. In this paper, we analyze the efficiency of unlearning methods and establish the first upper and lower bounds on minimax computation times for this problem, characterizing the performance of the most efficient algorithm against the most difficult objective function. Specifically, for strongly convex objective functions and under the assumption that the forget data is inaccessible to the unlearning method, we provide a phase diagram for the unlearning complexity ratio -- a novel metric that compares the computational cost of the best unlearning method to full model retraining. The phase diagram reveals three distinct regimes: one where unlearning at a reduced cost is infeasible, another where unlearning is trivial because adding noise suffices, and a third where unlearning achieves significant computational advantages over retraining. These findings highlight the critical role of factors such as data dimensionality, the number of samples to forget, and privacy constraints in determining the practical feasibility of unlearning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a refined analysis of the UCBVI algorithm (Azar et al., 2017), improving both the bonus terms and the regret analysis. Additionally, we compare our version of UCBVI with both its original version and the state-of-the-art MVP algorithm. Our empirical validation demonstrates that improving the multiplicative constants in the bounds has significant positive effects on the empirical performance of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>Function-Space Learning Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider layerwise function-space learning rates, which measure the magnitude of the change in a neural network's output function in response to an update to a parameter tensor. This contrasts with traditional learning rates, which describe the magnitude of changes in parameter space. We develop efficient methods to measure and set function-space learning rates in arbitrary neural networks, requiring only minimal computational overhead through a few additional backward passes that can be performed at the start of, or periodically during, training. We demonstrate two key applications: (1) analysing the dynamics of standard neural network optimisers in function space, rather than parameter space, and (2) introducing FLeRM (Function-space Learning Rate Matching), a novel approach to hyperparameter transfer across model scales. FLeRM records function-space learning rates while training a small, cheap base model, then automatically adjusts parameter-space layerwise learning rates when training larger models to maintain consistent function-space updates. FLeRM gives hyperparameter transfer across model width, depth, initialisation scale, and LoRA rank in various architectures including MLPs with residual connections and transformers with different layer normalisation schemes.</description>

      <title>Universality of High-Dimensional Logistic Regression and a Novel CGMT under Block Dependence with Applications to Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, a wave of research has characterized the exact asymptotic risk of many high-dimensional models in the proportional regime. Two foundational results have driven this progress: Gaussian universality, which shows that the asymptotic risk of estimators trained on non-Gaussian and Gaussian data is equivalent, and the convex Gaussian min-max theorem (CGMT), which characterizes the risk under Gaussian settings. However, these results rely on the assumption that the data consists of independent random vectors, an assumption that significantly limits its applicability to many practical setups. In this paper, we address this limitation by generalizing both results to the dependent setting. More precisely, we prove that Gaussian universality still holds for high-dimensional logistic regression under block dependence, and establish a novel CGMT framework that accommodates for correlation across both the covariates and observations. Using these results, we establish the impact of data augmentation, a widespread practice in deep learning, on the asymptotic risk.</description>

      <title>Universal AI maximizes Variational Empowerment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework unifying AIXI -- a model of universal AI -- with variational empowerment as an intrinsic drive for exploration. We build on the existing framework of Self-AIXI -- a universal learning agent that predicts its own actions -- by showing how one of its established terms can be interpreted as a variational empowerment objective. We further demonstrate that universal AI's planning process can be cast as minimizing expected variational free energy (the core principle of active Inference), thereby revealing how universal AI agents inherently balance goal-directed behavior with uncertainty reduction curiosity). Moreover, we argue that power-seeking tendencies of universal AI agents can be explained not only as an instrumental strategy to secure future reward, but also as a direct consequence of empowerment maximization -- i.e.\ the agent's intrinsic drive to maintain or expand its own controllability in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to show how these intrinsic motivations (empowerment, curiosity) systematically lead universal AI agents to seek and sustain high-optionality states. We prove that Self-AIXI asymptotically converges to the same performance as AIXI under suitable conditions, and highlight that its power-seeking behavior emerges naturally from both reward maximization and curiosity-driven exploration. Since AIXI can be view as a Bayes-optimal mathematical formulation for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), our result can be useful for further discussion on AI safety and the controllability of AGI.</description>

      <title>Financial fraud detection system based on improved random forest and gradient boosting machine (GBM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a financial fraud detection system based on improved Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Specifically, the system introduces a novel model architecture called GBM-SSRF (Gradient Boosting Machine with Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest), which cleverly combines the powerful optimization capabilities of the gradient boosting machine (GBM) with improved randomization. The computational efficiency and feature extraction capabilities of the Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest (SSRF) forest significantly improve the performance of financial fraud detection. Although the traditional random forest model has good classification capabilities, it has high computational complexity when faced with large-scale data and has certain limitations in feature selection. As a commonly used ensemble learning method, the GBM model has significant advantages in optimizing performance and handling nonlinear problems. However, GBM takes a long time to train and is prone to overfitting problems when data samples are unbalanced. In response to these limitations, this paper optimizes the random forest based on the structure, reducing the computational complexity and improving the feature selection ability through the structural simplification and enhancement of the random forest. In addition, the optimized random forest is embedded into the GBM framework, and the model can maintain efficiency and stability with the help of GBM's gradient optimization capability. Experiments show that the GBM-SSRF model not only has good performance, but also has good robustness and generalization capabilities, providing an efficient and reliable solution for financial fraud detection.</description>

Abstract: Coreset selection methods are effective in accelerating training and reducing memory requirements but remain largely unexplored in applied multimodal settings. We adapt a state-of-the-art (SoTA) coreset selection technique for multimodal data, focusing on the depth prediction task. Our experiments with embedding aggregation and dimensionality reduction approaches reveal the challenges of extending unimodal algorithms to multimodal scenarios, highlighting the need for specialized methods to better capture inter-modal relationships.</description>

      <title>A non-parametric optimal design algorithm for population pharmacokinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a non-parametric estimation algorithm designed to effectively estimate the joint distribution of model parameters with application to population pharmacokinetics. Our research group has previously developed the non-parametric adaptive grid (NPAG) algorithm, which while accurate, explores parameter space using an ad-hoc method to suggest new support points. In contrast, the non-parametric optimal design (NPOD) algorithm uses a gradient approach to suggest new support points, which reduces the amount of time spent evaluating non-relevant points and by this the overall number of cycles required to reach convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate that the NPOD algorithm achieves similar solutions to NPAG across two datasets, while being significantly more efficient in both the number of cycles required and overall runtime. Given the importance of developing robust and efficient algorithms for determining drug doses quickly in pharmacokinetics, the NPOD algorithm represents a valuable advancement in non-parametric modeling. Further analysis is needed to determine which algorithm performs better under specific conditions.</description>

      <title>Explaining the Success of Nearest Neighbor Methods in Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many modern methods for prediction leverage nearest neighbor search to find past training examples most similar to a test example, an idea that dates back in text to at least the 11th century and has stood the test of time. This monograph aims to explain the success of these methods, both in theory, for which we cover foundational nonasymptotic statistical guarantees on nearest-neighbor-based regression and classification, and in practice, for which we gather prominent methods for approximate nearest neighbor search that have been essential to scaling prediction systems reliant on nearest neighbor analysis to handle massive datasets. Furthermore, we discuss connections to learning distances for use with nearest neighbor methods, including how random decision trees and ensemble methods learn nearest neighbor structure, as well as recent developments in crowdsourcing and graphons.
  In terms of theory, our focus is on nonasymptotic statistical guarantees, which we state in the form of how many training data and what algorithm parameters ensure that a nearest neighbor prediction method achieves a user-specified error tolerance. We begin with the most general of such results for nearest neighbor and related kernel regression and classification in general metric spaces. In such settings in which we assume very little structure, what enables successful prediction is smoothness in the function being estimated for regression, and a low probability of landing near the decision boundary for classification. In practice, these conditions could be difficult to verify for a real dataset. We then cover recent guarantees on nearest neighbor prediction in the three case studies of time series forecasting, recommending products to people over time, and delineating human organs in medical images by looking at image patches. In these case studies, clustering structure enables successful prediction.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Gradient Flow Dynamics of Homogeneous Neural Networks Beyond the Origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works exploring the training dynamics of homogeneous neural network weights under gradient flow with small initialization have established that in the early stages of training, the weights remain small and near the origin, but converge in direction. Building on this, the current paper studies the gradient flow dynamics of homogeneous neural networks with locally Lipschitz gradients, after they escape the origin. Insights gained from this analysis are used to characterize the first saddle point encountered by gradient flow after escaping the origin. Also, it is shown that for homogeneous feed-forward neural networks, under certain conditions, the sparsity structure emerging among the weights before the escape is preserved after escaping the origin and until reaching the next saddle point.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Contrastive PAC Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study contrastive learning under the PAC learning framework. While a series of recent works have shown statistical results for learning under contrastive loss, based either on the VC-dimension or Rademacher complexity, their algorithms are inherently inefficient or not implying PAC guarantees. In this paper, we consider contrastive learning of the fundamental concept of linear representations. Surprisingly, even under such basic setting, the existence of efficient PAC learners is largely open. We first show that the problem of contrastive PAC learning of linear representations is intractable to solve in general. We then show that it can be relaxed to a semi-definite program when the distance between contrastive samples is measured by the $\ell_2$-norm. We then establish generalization guarantees based on Rademacher complexity, and connect it to PAC guarantees under certain contrastive large-margin conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient PAC learning algorithm for contrastive learning.</description>

      <title>CoRe: Coherency Regularization for Hierarchical Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical time series forecasting presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with noisy data that may not perfectly adhere to aggregation constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach to soft coherency in hierarchical time series forecasting using neural networks. We present a network coherency regularization method, which we denote as CoRe (Coherency Regularization), a technique that trains neural networks to produce forecasts that are inherently coherent across hierarchies, without strictly enforcing aggregation constraints. Our method offers several key advantages. (1) It provides theoretical guarantees on the coherency of forecasts, even for out-of-sample data. (2) It is adaptable to scenarios where data may contain errors or missing values, making it more robust than strict coherency methods. (3) It can be easily integrated into existing neural network architectures for time series forecasting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets, comparing it against state-of-the-art methods in both coherent and noisy data scenarios. Additionally, our method can be used within existing generative probabilistic forecasting frameworks to generate coherent probabilistic forecasts. Our results show improved generalization and forecast accuracy, particularly in the presence of data inconsistencies. On a variety of datasets, including both strictly hierarchically coherent and noisy data, our training method has either equal or better accuracy at all levels of the hierarchy while being strictly more coherent out-of-sample than existing soft-coherency methods.</description>

      <title>Since Faithfulness Fails: The Performance Limits of Neural Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural causal discovery methods have recently improved in terms of scalability and computational efficiency. However, our systematic evaluation highlights significant room for improvement in their accuracy when uncovering causal structures. We identify a fundamental limitation: neural networks cannot reliably distinguish between existing and non-existing causal relationships in the finite sample regime. Our experiments reveal that neural networks, as used in contemporary causal discovery approaches, lack the precision needed to recover ground-truth graphs, even for small graphs and relatively large sample sizes. Furthermore, we identify the faithfulness property as a critical bottleneck: (i) it is likely to be violated across any reasonable dataset size range, and (ii) its violation directly undermines the performance of neural discovery methods. These findings lead us to conclude that progress within the current paradigm is fundamentally constrained, necessitating a paradigm shift in this domain.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias of Gradient Descent for Non-Homogeneous Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the asymptotic implicit bias of gradient descent (GD) for generic non-homogeneous deep networks under exponential loss. Specifically, we characterize three key properties of GD iterates starting from a sufficiently small empirical risk, where the threshold is determined by a measure of the network's non-homogeneity. First, we show that a normalized margin induced by the GD iterates increases nearly monotonically. Second, we prove that while the norm of the GD iterates diverges to infinity, the iterates themselves converge in direction. Finally, we establish that this directional limit satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem. Prior works on implicit bias have focused exclusively on homogeneous networks; in contrast, our results apply to a broad class of non-homogeneous networks satisfying a mild near-homogeneity condition. In particular, our results apply to networks with residual connections and non-homogeneous activation functions, thereby resolving an open problem posed by Ji and Telgarsky (2020).</description>

      <title>Detecting OOD Samples via Optimal Transport Scoring Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To deploy machine learning models in the real world, researchers have proposed many OOD detection algorithms to help models identify unknown samples during the inference phase and prevent them from making untrustworthy predictions. Unlike methods that rely on extra data for outlier exposure training, post hoc methods detect Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples by developing scoring functions, which are model agnostic and do not require additional training. However, previous post hoc methods may fail to capture the geometric cues embedded in network representations. Thus, in this study, we propose a novel score function based on the optimal transport theory, named OTOD, for OOD detection. We utilize information from features, logits, and the softmax probability space to calculate the OOD score for each test sample. Our experiments show that combining this information can boost the performance of OTOD with a certain margin. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Notably, OTOD outperforms the state-of-the-art method GEN by 7.19% in the mean FPR@95 on the CIFAR-10 benchmark using ResNet-18 as the backbone, and by 12.51% in the mean FPR@95 using WideResNet-28 as the backbone. In addition, we provide theoretical guarantees for OTOD. The code is available in https://github.com/HengGao12/OTOD.</description>

      <title>A Fenchel-Young Loss Approach to Data-Driven Inverse Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven inverse optimization seeks to estimate unknown parameters in an optimization model from observations of optimization solutions. Many existing methods are ineffective in handling noisy and suboptimal solution observations and also suffer from computational challenges. In this paper, we build a connection between inverse optimization and the Fenchel-Young (FY) loss originally designed for structured prediction, proposing a FY loss approach to data-driven inverse optimization. This new approach is amenable to efficient gradient-based optimization, hence much more efficient than existing methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for the proposed method and use extensive simulation and real-data experiments to demonstrate its significant advantage in parameter estimation accuracy, decision error and computational speed.</description>

      <title>Flow-based linear embedding for Bayesian filtering of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian filtering for high-dimensional nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems is a fundamental yet challenging problem in many fields of science and engineering. Existing methods face significant obstacles: Gaussian-based filters struggle with non-Gaussian distributions, sequential Monte Carlo methods are computationally intensive and prone to particle degeneracy in high dimensions, and deep learning approaches often fail to balance accuracy and efficiency in complex filtering tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-based Bayesian filter (FBF) that integrates normalizing flows to construct a latent linear state-space model with Gaussian filtering distributions. This framework enables efficient density estimation and sampling through invertible transformations provided by normalizing flows, which can be learned directly from data, thereby eliminating the need for prior knowledge of system dynamics or observation models. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of FBF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>PLS-based approach for fair representation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of fair representation learning by proposing Fair Partial Least Squares (PLS) components. PLS is widely used in statistics to efficiently reduce the dimension of the data by providing representation tailored for the prediction. We propose a novel method to incorporate fairness constraints in the construction of PLS components. This new algorithm provides a feasible way to construct such features both in the linear and the non linear case using kernel embeddings. The efficiency of our method is evaluated on different datasets, and we prove its superiority with respect to standard fair PCA method.</description>

      <title>A calibration test for evaluating set-based epistemic uncertainty representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate representation of epistemic uncertainty is a challenging yet essential task in machine learning. A widely used representation corresponds to convex sets of probabilistic predictors, also known as credal sets. One popular way of constructing these credal sets is via ensembling or specialized supervised learning methods, where the epistemic uncertainty can be quantified through measures such as the set size or the disagreement among members. In principle, these sets should contain the true data-generating distribution. As a necessary condition for this validity, we adopt the strongest notion of calibration as a proxy. Concretely, we propose a novel statistical test to determine whether there is a convex combination of the set's predictions that is calibrated in distribution. In contrast to previous methods, our framework allows the convex combination to be instance dependent, recognizing that different ensemble members may be better calibrated in different regions of the input space. Moreover, we learn this combination via proper scoring rules, which inherently optimize for calibration. Building on differentiable, kernel-based estimators of calibration errors, we introduce a nonparametric testing procedure and demonstrate the benefits of capturing instance-level variability on of synthetic and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>A Gap Between the Gaussian RKHS and Neural Networks: An Infinite-Center Asymptotic Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have characterized the function-space inductive bias of infinite-width bounded-norm single-hidden-layer neural networks as a kind of bounded-variation-type space. This novel neural network Banach space encompasses many classical multivariate function spaces including certain Sobolev spaces and the spectral Barron spaces. Notably, this Banach space also includes functions that exhibit less classical regularity such as those that only vary in a few directions. On bounded domains, it is well-established that the Gaussian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) strictly embeds into this Banach space, demonstrating a clear gap between the Gaussian RKHS and the neural network Banach space. It turns out that when investigating these spaces on unbounded domains, e.g., all of $\mathbb{R}^d$, the story is fundamentally different. We establish the following fundamental result: Certain functions that lie in the Gaussian RKHS have infinite norm in the neural network Banach space. This provides a nontrivial gap between kernel methods and neural networks by the exhibition of functions in which kernel methods can do strictly better than neural networks.</description>

      <title>Worst-case Error Bounds for Online Learning of Smooth Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online learning is a model of machine learning where the learner is trained on sequential feedback. We investigate worst-case error for the online learning of real functions that have certain smoothness constraints. Suppose that $\mathcal{F}_q$ is the class of all absolutely continuous functions $f: [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $\|f'\|_q \le 1$, and $\operatorname{opt}_p(\mathcal{F}_q)$ is the best possible upper bound on the sum of the $p^{\text{th}}$ powers of absolute prediction errors for any number of trials guaranteed by any learner. We show that for any $\delta, \epsilon \in (0, 1)$, $\operatorname{opt}_{1+\delta} (\mathcal{F}_{1+\epsilon}) = O(\min(\delta, \epsilon)^{-1})$. Combined with the previous results of Kimber and Long (1995) and Geneson and Zhou (2023), we achieve a complete characterization of the values of $p, q \ge 1$ that result in $\operatorname{opt}_p(\mathcal{F}_q)$ being finite, a problem open for nearly 30 years.
  We study the learning scenarios of smooth functions that also belong to certain special families of functions, such as polynomials. We prove a conjecture by Geneson and Zhou (2023) that it is not any easier to learn a polynomial in $\mathcal{F}_q$ than it is to learn any general function in $\mathcal{F}_q$. We also define a noisy model for the online learning of smooth functions, where the learner may receive incorrect feedback up to $\eta \ge 1$ times, denoting the worst-case error bound as $\operatorname{opt}^{\text{nf}}_{p, \eta} (\mathcal{F}_q)$. We prove that $\operatorname{opt}^{\text{nf}}_{p, \eta} (\mathcal{F}_q)$ is finite if and only if $\operatorname{opt}_p(\mathcal{F}_q)$ is. Moreover, we prove for all $p, q \ge 2$ and $\eta \ge 1$ that $\operatorname{opt}^{\text{nf}}_{p, \eta} (\mathcal{F}_q) = \Theta (\eta)$.</description>

      <title>Iterative Flow Matching -- Path Correction and Gradual Refinement for Enhanced Generative Modeling</title>

Abstract: Generative models for image generation are now commonly used for a wide variety of applications, ranging from guided image generation for entertainment to solving inverse problems. Nonetheless, training a generator is a non-trivial feat that requires fine-tuning and can lead to so-called hallucinations, that is, the generation of images that are unrealistic. In this work, we explore image generation using flow matching. We explain and demonstrate why flow matching can generate hallucinations, and propose an iterative process to improve the generation process. Our iterative process can be integrated into virtually $\textit{any}$ generative modeling technique, thereby enhancing the performance and robustness of image synthesis systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we establish a new margin-based generalization bound for voting classifiers, refining existing results and yielding tighter generalization guarantees for widely used boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1997). Furthermore, the new margin-based generalization bound enables the derivation of an optimal weak-to-strong learner: a Majority-of-3 large-margin classifiers with an expected error matching the theoretical lower bound. This result provides a more natural alternative to the Majority-of-5 algorithm by (H\o gsgaard et al. 2024) , and matches the Majority-of-3 result by (Aden-Ali et al. 2024) for the realizable prediction model.</description>

      <title>Optimal Kernel Learning for Gaussian Process Models with High-Dimensional Input</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression is a popular surrogate modeling tool for computer simulations in engineering and scientific domains. However, it often struggles with high computational costs and low prediction accuracy when the simulation involves too many input variables. For some simulation models, the outputs may only be significantly influenced by a small subset of the input variables, referred to as the ``active variables''. We propose an optimal kernel learning approach to identify these active variables, thereby overcoming GP model limitations and enhancing system understanding. Our method approximates the original GP model's covariance function through a convex combination of kernel functions, each utilizing low-dimensional subsets of input variables. Inspired by the Fedorov-Wynn algorithm from optimal design literature, we develop an optimal kernel learning algorithm to determine this approximation. We incorporate the effect heredity principle, a concept borrowed from the field of ``design and analysis of experiments'', to ensure sparsity in active variable selection. Through several examples, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternative approaches in correctly identifying active input variables and improving prediction accuracy. It is an effective solution for interpreting the surrogate GP regression and simplifying the complex underlying system.</description>

      <title>Volume Optimality in Conformal Prediction with Structured Prediction Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction is a widely studied technique to construct prediction sets of future observations. Most conformal prediction methods focus on achieving the necessary coverage guarantees, but do not provide formal guarantees on the size (volume) of the prediction sets. We first prove an impossibility of volume optimality where any distribution-free method can only find a trivial solution. We then introduce a new notion of volume optimality by restricting the prediction sets to belong to a set family (of finite VC-dimension), specifically a union of $k$-intervals. Our main contribution is an efficient distribution-free algorithm based on dynamic programming (DP) to find a union of $k$-intervals that is guaranteed for any distribution to have near-optimal volume among all unions of $k$-intervals satisfying the desired coverage property. By adopting the framework of distributional conformal prediction (Chernozhukov et al., 2021), the new DP based conformity score can also be applied to achieve approximate conditional coverage and conditional restricted volume optimality, as long as a reasonable estimator of the conditional CDF is available. While the theoretical results already establish volume-optimality guarantees, they are complemented by experiments that demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform existing methods in many settings.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Input Data Collection for Ranking and Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a ranking and selection (R&amp;S) problem when all solutions share common parametric Bayesian input models updated with the data collected from multiple independent data-generating sources. Our objective is to identify the best system by designing a sequential sampling algorithm that collects input and simulation data given a budget. We adopt the most probable best (MPB) as the estimator of the optimum and show that its posterior probability of optimality converges to one at an exponential rate as the sampling budget increases. Assuming that the input parameters belong to a finite set, we characterize the $\epsilon$-optimal static sampling ratios for input and simulation data that maximize the convergence rate. Using these ratios as guidance, we propose the optimal sampling algorithm for R&amp;S (OSAR) that achieves the $\epsilon$-optimal ratios almost surely in the limit. We further extend OSAR by adopting the kernel ridge regression to improve the simulation output mean prediction. This not only improves OSAR's finite-sample performance, but also lets us tackle the case where the input parameters lie in a continuous space with a strong consistency guarantee for finding the optimum. We numerically demonstrate that OSAR outperforms a state-of-the-art competitor.</description>

      <title>Fitting networks with a cancellation trick</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degree-corrected block model (DCBM), latent space model (LSM), and $\beta$-model are all popular network models. We combine their modeling ideas and propose the logit-DCBM as a new model. Similar as the $\beta$-model and LSM, the logit-DCBM contains nonlinear factors, where fitting the parameters is a challenging open problem. We resolve this problem by introducing a cancellation trick. We also propose R-SCORE as a recursive community detection algorithm, where in each iteration, we first use the idea above to update our parameter estimation, and then use the results to remove the nonlinear factors in the logit-DCBM so the renormalized model approximately satisfies a low-rank model, just like the DCBM. Our numerical study suggests that R-SCORE significantly improves over existing spectral approaches in many cases. Also, theoretically, we show that the Hamming error rate of R-SCORE is faster than that of SCORE in a specific sparse region, and is at least as fast outside this region.</description>

      <title>Posterior Inference with Diffusion Models for High-dimensional Black-box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing high-dimensional and complex black-box functions is crucial in numerous scientific applications. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful method for sample-efficient optimization, it struggles with the curse of dimensionality and scaling to thousands of evaluations. Recently, leveraging generative models to solve black-box optimization problems has emerged as a promising framework. However, those methods often underperform compared to BO methods due to limited expressivity and difficulty of uncertainty estimation in high-dimensional spaces. To overcome these issues, we introduce \textbf{DiBO}, a novel framework for solving high-dimensional black-box optimization problems. Our method iterates two stages. First, we train a diffusion model to capture the data distribution and an ensemble of proxies to predict function values with uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection as a posterior inference problem to balance exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional spaces. Concretely, we fine-tune diffusion models to amortize posterior inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various synthetic and real-world black-box optimization tasks. Our code is publicly available \href{https://github.com/umkiyoung/DiBO}{here}</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Active Learning for Gaussian Process Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) or kernel ridge regression is a widely used and powerful tool for nonlinear prediction. Therefore, active learning (AL) for GPR, which actively collects data labels to achieve an accurate prediction with fewer data labels, is an important problem. However, existing AL methods do not theoretically guarantee prediction accuracy for target distribution. Furthermore, as discussed in the distributionally robust learning literature, specifying the target distribution is often difficult. Thus, this paper proposes two AL methods that effectively reduce the worst-case expected error for GPR, which is the worst-case expectation in target distribution candidates. We show an upper bound of the worst-case expected squared error, which suggests that the error will be arbitrarily small by a finite number of data labels under mild conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Functional Bayesian Additive Regression Trees with Shape Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the great success of Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) on regression, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach for the function-on-scalar regression problem, termed as Functional BART (FBART). Utilizing spline-based function representation and tree-based domain partition model, FBART offers great flexibility in characterizing the complex and heterogeneous relationship between the response curve and scalar covariates. We devise a tailored Bayesian backfitting algorithm for estimating the parameters in the FBART model. Furthermore, we introduce an FBART model with shape constraints on the response curve, enhancing estimation and prediction performance when prior shape information of response curves is available. By incorporating a shape-constrained prior, we ensure that the posterior samples of the response curve satisfy the required shape constraints (e.g., monotonicity and/or convexity). Our proposed FBART model and its shape-constrained version are the new advances of BART models for functional data. Under certain regularity conditions, we derive the posterior convergence results for both FBART and its shape-constrained version. Finally, the superiority of the proposed methods over other competitive counterparts is validated through simulation experiments under various settings and analyses of two real datasets.</description>

      <title>Achieving Fair PCA Using Joint Eigenvalue Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used method for dimensionality reduction, but it often overlooks fairness, especially when working with data that includes demographic characteristics. This can lead to biased representations that disproportionately affect certain groups. To address this issue, our approach incorporates Joint Eigenvalue Decomposition (JEVD), a technique that enables the simultaneous diagonalization of multiple matrices, ensuring fair and efficient representations. We formally show that the optimal solution of JEVD leads to a fair PCA solution. By integrating JEVD with PCA, we strike an optimal balance between preserving data structure and promoting fairness across diverse groups. We demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline approaches in fairness and representational quality on various datasets. It retains the core advantages of PCA while ensuring that sensitive demographic attributes do not create disparities in the reduced representation.</description>

      <title>Supervised contrastive learning from weakly-labeled audio segments for musical version matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting musical versions (different renditions of the same piece) is a challenging task with important applications. Because of the ground truth nature, existing approaches match musical versions at the track level (e.g., whole song). However, most applications require to match them at the segment level (e.g., 20s chunks). In addition, existing approaches resort to classification and triplet losses, disregarding more recent losses that could bring meaningful improvements. In this paper, we propose a method to learn from weakly annotated segments, together with a contrastive loss variant that outperforms well-studied alternatives. The former is based on pairwise segment distance reductions, while the latter modifies an existing loss following decoupling, hyper-parameter, and geometric considerations. With these two elements, we do not only achieve state-of-the-art results in the standard track-level evaluation, but we also obtain a breakthrough performance in a segment-level evaluation. We believe that, due to the generality of the challenges addressed here, the proposed methods may find utility in domains beyond audio or musical version matching.</description>

      <title>Deep Minimax Classifiers for Imbalanced Datasets with a Small Number of Minority Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a minimax classifier is well-established in statistical decision theory, but its implementation via neural networks remains challenging, particularly in scenarios with imbalanced training data having a limited number of samples for minority classes. To address this issue, we propose a novel minimax learning algorithm designed to minimize the risk of worst-performing classes. Our algorithm iterates through two steps: a minimization step that trains the model based on a selected target prior, and a maximization step that updates the target prior towards the adversarial prior for the trained model. In the minimization, we introduce a targeted logit-adjustment loss function that efficiently identifies optimal decision boundaries under the target prior. Moreover, based on a new prior-dependent generalization bound that we obtained, we theoretically prove that our loss function has a better generalization capability than existing loss functions. During the maximization, we refine the target prior by shifting it towards the adversarial prior, depending on the worst-performing classes rather than on per-class risk estimates. Our maximization method is particularly robust in the regime of a small number of samples. Additionally, to adapt to overparameterized neural networks, we partition the entire training dataset into two subsets: one for model training during the minimization step and the other for updating the target prior during the maximization step. Our proposed algorithm has a provable convergence property, and empirical results indicate that our algorithm performs better than or is comparable to existing methods.

      <title>All You Need for Counterfactual Explainability Is Principled and Reliable Estimate of Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This position paper argues that, to its detriment, transparency research overlooks many foundational concepts of artificial intelligence. Here, we focus on uncertainty quantification -- in the context of ante-hoc interpretability and counterfactual explainability -- showing how its adoption could address key challenges in the field. First, we posit that uncertainty and ante-hoc interpretability offer complementary views of the same underlying idea; second, we assert that uncertainty provides a principled unifying framework for counterfactual explainability. Consequently, inherently transparent models can benefit from human-centred explanatory insights -- like counterfactuals -- which are otherwise missing. At a higher level, integrating artificial intelligence fundamentals into transparency research promises to yield more reliable, robust and understandable predictive models.</description>

      <title>Moving Past Single Metrics: Exploring Short-Text Clustering Across Multiple Resolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster number is typically a parameter selected at the outset in clustering problems, and while impactful, the choice can often be difficult to justify. Inspired by bioinformatics, this study examines how the nature of clusters varies with cluster number, presenting a method for determining cluster robustness, and providing a systematic method for deciding on the cluster number. The study focuses specifically on short-text clustering, involving 30,000 political Twitter bios, where the sparse co-occurrence of words between texts makes finding meaningful clusters challenging. A metric of proportional stability is introduced to uncover the stability of specific clusters between cluster resolutions, and the results are visualised using Sankey diagrams to provide an interrogative tool for understanding the nature of the dataset. The visualisation provides an intuitive way to track cluster subdivision and reorganisation as cluster number increases, offering insights that static, single-resolution metrics cannot capture. The results show that instead of seeking a single 'optimal' solution, choosing a cluster number involves balancing informativeness and complexity.</description>

      <title>Class-Dependent Perturbation Effects in Evaluating Time Series Attributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in time series applications, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are essential for understanding their predictions. Within XAI, feature attribution methods aim to identify which input features contributed the most to a model's prediction, with their evaluation typically relying on perturbation-based metrics. Through empirical analysis across multiple datasets, model architectures, and perturbation strategies, we identify important class-dependent effects in these metrics: they show varying effectiveness across classes, achieving strong results for some while remaining less sensitive to others. In particular, we find that the most effective perturbation strategies often demonstrate the most pronounced class differences. Our analysis suggests that these effects arise from the learned biases of classifiers, indicating that perturbation-based evaluation may reflect specific model behaviors rather than intrinsic attribution quality. We propose an evaluation framework with a class-aware penalty term to help assess and account for these effects in evaluating feature attributions. Although our analysis focuses on time series classification, these class-dependent effects likely extend to other structured data domains where perturbation-based evaluation is common.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern fire management systems increasingly rely on satellite data and weather forecasting; however, access to comprehensive datasets remains limited due to proprietary restrictions. Despite the ecological significance of wildfires, large-scale, multi-regional research is constrained by data scarcity. Russian diverse ecosystems play a crucial role in shaping Eurasian fire dynamics, yet they remain underexplored. This study addresses existing gaps by introducing an open-access dataset that captures detailed fire incidents alongside corresponding meteorological conditions. We present one of the most extensive datasets available for wildfire analysis in Russia, covering 13 consecutive months of observations. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we conduct exploratory data analysis and develop predictive models to identify key fire behavior patterns across different fire categories and ecosystems. Our results highlight the critical influence of environmental factor patterns on fire occurrence and spread behavior. By improving the understanding of wildfire dynamics in Eurasia, this work contributes to more effective, data-driven approaches for proactive fire management in the face of evolving environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards Auto-Regressive Next-Token Prediction: In-Context Learning Emerges from Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) abilities. However, existing theoretical analysis of ICL primarily exhibits two limitations: (a) Limited i.i.d. Setting. Most studies focus on supervised function learning tasks where prompts are constructed with i.i.d. input-label pairs. This i.i.d. assumption diverges significantly from real language learning scenarios where prompt tokens are interdependent. (b) Lack of Emergence Explanation. Most literature answers what ICL does from an implicit optimization perspective but falls short in elucidating how ICL emerges and the impact of pre-training phase on ICL. In our paper, to extend (a), we adopt a more practical paradigm, auto-regressive next-token prediction (AR-NTP), which closely aligns with the actual training of language models. Specifically, within AR-NTP, we emphasize prompt token-dependency, which involves predicting each subsequent token based on the preceding sequence. To address (b), we formalize a systematic pre-training and ICL framework, highlighting the layer-wise structure of sequences and topics, alongside a two-level expectation. In conclusion, we present data-dependent, topic-dependent and optimization-dependent PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for pre-trained LLMs, investigating that ICL emerges from the generalization of sequences and topics. Our theory is supported by experiments on numerical linear dynamic systems, synthetic GINC and real-world language datasets.</description>

      <title>Data Analysis Prediction over Multiple Unseen Datasets: A Vector Embedding Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The massive increase in the data volume and dataset availability for analysts compels researchers to focus on data content and select high-quality datasets to enhance the performance of analytics operators. While selecting the highest quality data for analysis highly increases task accuracy and efficiency, it is still a hard task, especially when the number of available inputs is very large. To address this issue, we propose a novel methodology that infers the outcome of analytics operators by creating a model from datasets similar to the queried one. Dataset similarity is performed via projecting each dataset to a vector embedding representation. The vectorization process is performed using our proposed deep learning model NumTabData2Vec, which takes a whole dataset and projects it into a lower vector embedding representation space. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the prediction performance and the execution time of our framework to another state-of-the-art modelling operator framework, illustrating that our approach predicts analytics outcomes accurately. Furthermore, our vectorization model can project different real-world scenarios to a lower vector embedding representation and distinguish between them.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of rank aggregation methods for the partial label ranking problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \textit{label ranking} problem is a supervised learning scenario in which the learner predicts a \textit{total order} of the class labels for a given input instance. Recently, research has increasingly focused on the \textit{partial label ranking} problem, a generalization of the label ranking problem that allows \textit{ties} in the predicted orders. So far, most existing learning approaches for the partial label ranking problem rely on approximation algorithms for rank aggregation in the final prediction step. This paper explores several alternative aggregation methods for this critical step, including scoring-based and probabilistic-based rank aggregation approaches. To enhance their suitability for the more general partial label ranking problem, the investigated methods are extended to increase the likelihood of producing ties. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that scoring-based variants consistently outperform the current state-of-the-art method in handling incomplete information. In contrast, probabilistic-based variants fail to achieve competitive performance.</description>

Abstract: We establish thresholds for the feasibility of random multi-graph alignment in two models. In the Gaussian model, we demonstrate an "all-or-nothing" phenomenon: above a critical threshold, exact alignment is achievable with high probability, while below it, even partial alignment is statistically impossible. In the sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, we rigorously identify a threshold below which no meaningful partial alignment is possible and conjecture that above this threshold, partial alignment can be achieved. To prove these results, we develop a general Bayesian estimation framework over metric spaces, which provides insight into a broader class of high-dimensional statistical problems.</description>

      <title>CoT-UQ: Improving Response-wise Uncertainty Quantification in LLMs with Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks but struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in their generated responses. This limitation makes it challenging to detect misinformation and ensure reliable decision-making. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs are primarily prompt-wise rather than response-wise, often requiring multiple response samples, which incurs high computational costs. Moreover, LLMs have been shown to be overconfident, particularly when using reasoning steps to derive their answers. In this work, we propose CoT-UQ, a response-wise UQ framework that integrates LLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the UQ process. CoT-UQ captures critical information during inference by extracting keywords from each reasoning step and assessing their importance to the final answer. This key reasoning information is then aggregated to produce a final uncertainty estimate. We conduct extensive experiments based on LLaMA Family with model sizes varying from 8B to 13B across logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-UQ significantly outperforms existing UQ methods, achieving an average improvement of 5.9% AUROC compared to current UQ methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZBox1005/CoT-UQ.</description>

      <title>Kandinsky Conformal Prediction: Beyond Class- and Covariate-Conditional Coverage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing prediction sets with coverage guarantees. Classical methods, such as split conformal prediction, provide marginal coverage, ensuring that the prediction set contains the label of a random test point with a target probability. However, these guarantees may not hold uniformly across different subpopulations, leading to disparities in coverage. Prior work has explored coverage guarantees conditioned on events related to the covariates and label of the test point. We present Kandinsky conformal prediction, a framework that significantly expands the scope of conditional coverage guarantees. In contrast to Mondrian conformal prediction, which restricts its coverage guarantees to disjoint groups -- reminiscent of the rigid, structured grids of Piet Mondrian's art -- our framework flexibly handles overlapping and fractional group memberships defined jointly on covariates and labels, reflecting the layered, intersecting forms in Wassily Kandinsky's compositions. Our algorithm unifies and extends existing methods, encompassing covariate-based group conditional, class conditional, and Mondrian conformal prediction as special cases, while achieving a minimax-optimal high-probability conditional coverage bound. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach through empirical evaluation on real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study regret minimization in repeated first-price auctions (FPAs), where a bidder observes only the realized outcome after each auction -- win or loss. This setup reflects practical scenarios in online display advertising where the actual value of an impression depends on the difference between two potential outcomes, such as clicks or conversion rates, when the auction is won versus lost. We analyze three outcome models: (1) adversarial outcomes without features, (2) linear potential outcomes with features, and (3) linear treatment effects in features. For each setting, we propose algorithms that jointly estimate private values and optimize bidding strategies, achieving near-optimal regret bounds. Notably, our framework enjoys a unique feature that the treatments are also actively chosen, and hence eliminates the need for the overlap condition commonly required in causal inference.</description>

      <title>Stronger Neyman Regret Guarantees for Adaptive Experimental Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the design of adaptive, sequential experiments for unbiased average treatment effect (ATE) estimation in the design-based potential outcomes setting. Our goal is to develop adaptive designs offering sublinear Neyman regret, meaning their efficiency must approach that of the hindsight-optimal nonadaptive design. Recent work [Dai et al, 2023] introduced ClipOGD, the first method achieving $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ expected Neyman regret under mild conditions. In this work, we propose adaptive designs with substantially stronger Neyman regret guarantees. In particular, we modify ClipOGD to obtain anytime $\widetilde{O}(\log T)$ Neyman regret under natural boundedness assumptions. Further, in the setting where experimental units have pre-treatment covariates, we introduce and study a class of contextual "multigroup" Neyman regret guarantees: Given any set of possibly overlapping groups based on the covariates, the adaptive design outperforms each group's best non-adaptive designs. In particular, we develop a contextual adaptive design with $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ anytime multigroup Neyman regret. We empirically validate the proposed designs through an array of experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of classification with selectively labeled data, whose distribution may differ from the full population due to historical decision-making. We exploit the fact that in many applications historical decisions were made by multiple decision-makers, each with different decision rules. We analyze this setup under a principled instrumental variable (IV) framework and rigorously study the identification of classification risk. We establish conditions for the exact identification of classification risk and derive tight partial identification bounds when exact identification fails. We further propose a unified cost-sensitive learning (UCL) approach to learn classifiers robust to selection bias in both identification settings. We further theoretically and numerically validate the efficacy of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robust Kernel Hypothesis Testing under Data Corruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general method for constructing robust permutation tests under data corruption. The proposed tests effectively control the non-asymptotic type I error under data corruption, and we prove their consistency in power under minimal conditions. This contributes to the practical deployment of hypothesis tests for real-world applications with potential adversarial attacks. For the two-sample and independence settings, we show that our kernel robust tests are minimax optimal, in the sense that they are guaranteed to be non-asymptotically powerful against alternatives uniformly separated from the null in the kernel MMD and HSIC metrics at some optimal rate (tight with matching lower bound). We point out that existing differentially private tests can be adapted to be robust to data corruption, and we demonstrate in experiments that our proposed tests achieve much higher power than these private tests. Finally, we provide publicly available implementations and empirically illustrate the practicality of our robust tests.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation results for neural networks with non-polynomial activation function over non-compact domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the universal approximation property of single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks beyond compact domains, which is of particular interest for the approximation within weighted $C^k$-spaces and weighted Sobolev spaces over unbounded domains. More precisely, by assuming that the activation function is non-polynomial, we establish universal approximation results within function spaces defined over non-compact subsets of a Euclidean space, including $L^p$-spaces, weighted $C^k$-spaces, and weighted Sobolev spaces, where the latter two include the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. Moreover, we provide some dimension-independent rates for approximating a function with sufficiently regular and integrable Fourier transform by neural networks with non-polynomial activation function.</description>

      <title>Compactly-supported nonstationary kernels for computing exact Gaussian processes on big data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaussian process (GP) is a widely used probabilistic machine learning method with implicit uncertainty characterization for stochastic function approximation, stochastic modeling, and analyzing real-world measurements of nonlinear processes. Traditional implementations of GPs involve stationary kernels (also termed covariance functions) that limit their flexibility, and exact methods for inference that prevent application to data sets with more than about ten thousand points. Modern approaches to address stationarity assumptions generally fail to accommodate large data sets, while all attempts to address scalability focus on approximating the Gaussian likelihood, which can involve subjectivity and lead to inaccuracies. In this work, we explicitly derive an alternative kernel that can discover and encode both sparsity and nonstationarity. We embed the kernel within a fully Bayesian GP model and leverage high-performance computing resources to enable the analysis of massive data sets. We demonstrate the favorable performance of our novel kernel relative to existing exact and approximate GP methods across a variety of synthetic data examples. Furthermore, we conduct space-time prediction based on more than one million measurements of daily maximum temperature and verify that our results outperform state-of-the-art methods in the Earth sciences. More broadly, having access to exact GPs that use ultra-scalable, sparsity-discovering, nonstationary kernels allows GP methods to truly compete with a wide variety of machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Tensor Product Neural Networks for Functional ANOVA Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpretability for machine learning models is becoming more and more important as machine learning models become more complex. The functional ANOVA model, which decomposes a high-dimensional function into a sum of lower dimensional functions so called components, is one of the most popular tools for interpretable AI, and recently, various neural network models have been developed for estimating each component in the functional ANOVA model. However, such neural networks are highly unstable when estimating components since the components themselves are not uniquely defined. That is, there are multiple functional ANOVA decompositions for a given function. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model which guarantees a unique functional ANOVA decomposition and thus is able to estimate each component stably. We call our proposed model ANOVA-NODE since it is a modification of Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE) for the functional ANOVA model. Theoretically, we prove that ANOVA-NODE can approximate a smooth function well. Additionally, we experimentally show that ANOVA-NODE provides much more stable estimation of each component and thus much more stable interpretation when training data and initial values of the model parameters vary than existing neural network models do.</description>

      <title>Explaining Quantum Circuits with Shapley Values: Towards Explainable Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods of artificial intelligence (AI) and especially machine learning (ML) have been growing ever more complex, and at the same time have more and more impact on people's lives. This leads to explainable AI (XAI) manifesting itself as an important research field that helps humans to better comprehend ML systems. In parallel, quantum machine learning (QML) is emerging with the ongoing improvement of quantum computing hardware combined with its increasing availability via cloud services. QML enables quantum-enhanced ML in which quantum mechanics is exploited to facilitate ML tasks, typically in the form of quantum-classical hybrid algorithms that combine quantum and classical resources. Quantum gates constitute the building blocks of gate-based quantum hardware and form circuits that can be used for quantum computations. For QML applications, quantum circuits are typically parameterized and their parameters are optimized classically such that a suitably defined objective function is minimized. Inspired by XAI, we raise the question of the explainability of such circuits by quantifying the importance of (groups of) gates for specific goals. To this end, we apply the well-established concept of Shapley values. The resulting attributions can be interpreted as explanations for why a specific circuit works well for a given task, improving the understanding of how to construct parameterized (or variational) quantum circuits, and fostering their human interpretability in general. An experimental evaluation on simulators and two superconducting quantum hardware devices demonstrates the benefits of the proposed framework for classification, generative modeling, transpilation, and optimization. Furthermore, our results shed some light on the role of specific gates in popular QML approaches.</description>

      <title>A New Causal Rule Learning Approach to Interpretable Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpretability plays a critical role in the application of statistical learning for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) for complex diseases. In this study, we leverage a rule-based workflow, namely causal rule learning (CRL) to estimate and enhance our understanding of HTE for atrial septal defect, addressing an overlooked question in previous literature: what if an individual simultaneously belongs to multiple groups with different average treatment effects? The CRL process consists of three steps: rule discovery, which generates a set of causal rules with corresponding subgroup average treatment effects; rule selection, which identifies a subset of these rules to deconstruct individual-level treatment effects as a linear combination of subgroup-level effects; and rule analysis, which outlines a detailed procedure for further analyzing each selected rule from multiple perspectives to identify the most promising rules for validation. Extensive simulation studies and real-world data analysis demonstrate that CRL outperforms other methods in providing interpretable estimates of HTE, especially when dealing with complex ground truth and sufficient sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Continuous Diffusion for Mixed-Type Tabular Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10431v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models, commonly referred to as diffusion models, have proven to be successful at generating text and image data. However, their adaptation to mixed-type tabular data remains underexplored. In this work, we propose CDTD, a Continuous Diffusion model for mixed-type Tabular Data. CDTD is based on a novel combination of score matching and score interpolation to enforce a unified continuous noise distribution for both continuous and categorical features. We explicitly acknowledge the necessity of homogenizing distinct data types by relying on model-specific loss calibration and initialization schemes.To further address the high heterogeneity in mixed-type tabular data, we introduce adaptive feature- or type-specific noise schedules. These ensure balanced generative performance across features and optimize the allocation of model capacity across features and diffusion time. Our experimental results show that CDTD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark models, captures feature correlations exceptionally well, and that heterogeneity in the noise schedule design boosts sample quality. Replication code is available at https://github.com/muellermarkus/cdtd.</description>

      <title>Score-based Causal Representation Learning: Linear and General Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00849v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses intervention-based causal representation learning (CRL) under a general nonparametric latent causal model and an unknown transformation that maps the latent variables to the observed variables. Linear and general transformations are investigated. The paper addresses both the identifiability and achievability aspects. Identifiability refers to determining algorithm-agnostic conditions that ensure recovering the true latent causal variables and the latent causal graph underlying them. Achievability refers to the algorithmic aspects and addresses designing algorithms that achieve identifiability guarantees. By drawing novel connections between score functions (i.e., the gradients of the logarithm of density functions) and CRL, this paper designs a score-based class of algorithms that ensures both identifiability and achievability. First, the paper focuses on linear transformations and shows that one stochastic hard intervention per node suffices to guarantee identifiability. It also provides partial identifiability guarantees for soft interventions, including identifiability up to mixing with parents for general causal models and perfect latent graph recovery for sufficiently non-linear causal models. Secondly, it focuses on general transformations and shows that two stochastic hard interventions per node suffice for identifiability. This is achieved by defining a differentiable loss function whose global optima ensures identifiability for general CRL. Notably, one does not need to know which pair of interventional environments have the same node intervened. Finally, the theoretical results are empirically validated via experiments on structured synthetic data and image data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Optimization for Prediction with Missing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When training predictive models on data with missing entries, the most widely used and versatile approach is a pipeline technique where we first impute missing entries and then compute predictions. In this paper, we view prediction with missing data as a two-stage adaptive optimization problem and propose a new class of models, adaptive linear regression models, where the regression coefficients adapt to the set of observed features. We show that some adaptive linear regression models are equivalent to learning an imputation rule and a downstream linear regression model simultaneously instead of sequentially. We leverage this joint-impute-then-regress interpretation to generalize our framework to non-linear models. In settings where data is strongly not missing at random, our methods achieve a 2-10% improvement in out-of-sample accuracy.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Gaussian Process Bandits with Unknown Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01632v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimisation requires fitting a Gaussian process model, which in turn requires specifying prior on the unknown black-box function -- most of the theoretical literature assumes this prior is known. However, it is common to have more than one possible prior for a given black-box function, for example suggested by domain experts with differing opinions. In some cases, the type-II maximum likelihood estimator for selecting prior enjoys the consistency guarantee, but it does not universally apply to all types of priors. If the problem is stationary, one could rely on the Regret Balancing scheme to conduct the optimisation, but in the case of time-varying problems, such a scheme cannot be used. To address this gap in existing research, we propose a novel algorithm, PE-GP-UCB, which is capable of solving time-varying Bayesian optimisation problems even without the exact knowledge of the function's prior. The algorithm relies on the fact that either the observed function values are consistent with some of the priors, in which case it is easy to reject the wrong priors, or the observations are consistent with all candidate priors, in which case it does not matter which prior our model relies on. We provide a regret bound on the proposed algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm on toy and real-world time-varying problems and show that it outperforms the maximum likelihood estimator, fully Bayesian treatment of unknown prior and Regret Balancing.</description>

      <title>A flexible Bayesian g-formula for causal survival analyses with time-dependent confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02306v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In longitudinal observational studies with time-to-event outcomes, a common objective in causal analysis is to estimate the causal survival curve under hypothetical intervention scenarios. The g-formula is a useful tool for this analysis. To enhance the traditional parametric g-formula, we developed an alternative g-formula estimator, which incorporates the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) into the modeling of the time-evolving generative components, aiming to mitigate the bias due to model misspecification. We focus on binary time-varying treatments and introduce a general class of g-formulas for discrete survival data that can incorporate the longitudinal balancing scores. The minimum sufficient formulation of these longitudinal balancing scores is linked to the nature of treatment strategies, i.e., static or dynamic. For each type of treatment strategy, we provide posterior sampling algorithms. We conducted simulations to illustrate the empirical performance of the proposed method and demonstrate its practical utility using data from the Yale New Haven Health System's electronic health records.</description>

      <title>On Convergence of Adam for Stochastic Optimization under Relaxed Assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Adaptive Momentum Estimation (Adam) algorithm is highly effective in training various deep learning tasks. Despite this, there's limited theoretical understanding for Adam, especially when focusing on its vanilla form in non-convex smooth scenarios with potential unbounded gradients and affine variance noise. In this paper, we study vanilla Adam under these challenging conditions. We introduce a comprehensive noise model which governs affine variance noise, bounded noise and sub-Gaussian noise. We show that Adam can find a stationary point with a $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log T)/\sqrt{T})$ rate in high probability under this general noise model where $T$ denotes total number iterations, matching the lower rate of stochastic first-order algorithms up to logarithm factors. More importantly, we reveal that Adam is free of tuning step-sizes with any problem-parameters, yielding a better adaptation property than the Stochastic Gradient Descent under the same conditions. We also provide a probabilistic convergence result for Adam under a generalized smooth condition which allows unbounded smoothness parameters and has been illustrated empirically to more accurately capture the smooth property of many practical objective functions.</description>

      <title>Scalarisation-based risk concepts for robust multi-objective optimisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust optimisation is a well-established framework for optimising functions in the presence of uncertainty. The inherent goal of this problem is to identify a collection of inputs whose outputs are both desirable for the decision maker, whilst also being robust to the underlying uncertainties in the problem. In this work, we study the multi-objective case of this problem. We identify that the majority of all robust multi-objective algorithms rely on two key operations: robustification and scalarisation. Robustification refers to the strategy that is used to account for the uncertainty in the problem. Scalarisation refers to the procedure that is used to encode the relative importance of each objective to a scalar-valued reward. As these operations are not necessarily commutative, the order that they are performed in has an impact on the resulting solutions that are identified and the final decisions that are made. The purpose of this work is to give a thorough exposition on the effects of these different orderings and in particular highlight when one should opt for one ordering over the other. As part of our analysis, we showcase how many existing risk concepts can be integrated into the specification and solution of a robust multi-objective optimisation problem. Besides this, we also demonstrate how one can principally define the notion of a robust Pareto front and a robust performance metric based on our ``robustify and scalarise'' methodology. To illustrate the efficacy of these new ideas, we present two insightful case studies which are based on real-world data sets.</description>

      <title>Towards Certification of Uncertainty Calibration under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since neural classifiers are known to be sensitive to adversarial perturbations that alter their accuracy, \textit{certification methods} have been developed to provide provable guarantees on the insensitivity of their predictions to such perturbations. Furthermore, in safety-critical applications, the frequentist interpretation of the confidence of a classifier (also known as model calibration) can be of utmost importance. This property can be measured via the Brier score or the expected calibration error. We show that attacks can significantly harm calibration, and thus propose certified calibration as worst-case bounds on calibration under adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we produce analytic bounds for the Brier score and approximate bounds via the solution of a mixed-integer program on the expected calibration error. Finally, we propose novel calibration attacks and demonstrate how they can improve model calibration through \textit{adversarial calibration training}.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Bridge Implicit Models</title>

Abstract: Denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) are a powerful variant of diffusion models for interpolating between two arbitrary paired distributions given as endpoints. Despite their promising performance in tasks like image translation, DDBMs require a computationally intensive sampling process that involves the simulation of a (stochastic) differential equation through hundreds of network evaluations. In this work, we take the first step in fast sampling of DDBMs without extra training, motivated by the well-established recipes in diffusion models. We generalize DDBMs via a class of non-Markovian diffusion bridges defined on the discretized timesteps concerning sampling, which share the same marginal distributions and training objectives, give rise to generative processes ranging from stochastic to deterministic, and result in diffusion bridge implicit models (DBIMs). DBIMs are not only up to 25$\times$ faster than the vanilla sampler of DDBMs but also induce a novel, simple, and insightful form of ordinary differential equation (ODE) which inspires high-order numerical solvers. Moreover, DBIMs maintain the generation diversity in a distinguished way, by using a booting noise in the initial sampling step, which enables faithful encoding, reconstruction, and semantic interpolation in image translation tasks.

      <title>Quriosity: Analyzing Human Questioning Behavior and Causal Inquiry through Curiosity-Driven Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) technology has changed our role in interacting with these models. Instead of primarily testing these models with questions we already know answers to, we are now using them for queries where the answers are unknown to us, driven by human curiosity. This shift highlights the growing need to understand curiosity-driven human questions - those that are more complex, open-ended, and reflective of real-world needs. To this end, we present Quriosity, a collection of 13.5K naturally occurring questions from three diverse sources: human-to-search-engine queries, human-to-human interactions, and human-to-LLM conversations. Our comprehensive collection enables a rich understanding of human curiosity across various domains and contexts. Our analysis reveals a significant presence of causal questions (up to 42%) in the dataset, for which we develop an iterative prompt improvement framework to identify all causal queries and examine their unique linguistic properties, cognitive complexity and source distribution. Our paper paves the way for future work on causal question identification and open-ended chatbot interactions.</description>

      <title>Private Online Learning via Lazy Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of private online learning, specifically, online prediction from experts (OPE) and online convex optimization (OCO). We propose a new transformation that transforms lazy online learning algorithms into private algorithms. We apply our transformation for differentially private OPE and OCO using existing lazy algorithms for these problems. Our final algorithms obtain regret, which significantly improves the regret in the high privacy regime $\varepsilon \ll 1$, obtaining $\sqrt{T \log d} + T^{1/3} \log(d)/\varepsilon^{2/3}$ for DP-OPE and $\sqrt{T} + T^{1/3} \sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{2/3}$ for DP-OCO. We also complement our results with a lower bound for DP-OPE, showing that these rates are optimal for a natural family of low-switching private algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reassessing How to Compare and Improve the Calibration of Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A machine learning model is calibrated if its predicted probability for an outcome matches the observed frequency for that outcome conditional on the model prediction. This property has become increasingly important as the impact of machine learning models has continued to spread to various domains. As a result, there are now a dizzying number of recent papers on measuring and improving the calibration of (specifically deep learning) models. In this work, we reassess the reporting of calibration metrics in the recent literature. We show that there exist trivial recalibration approaches that can appear seemingly state-of-the-art unless calibration and prediction metrics (i.e. test accuracy) are accompanied by additional generalization metrics such as negative log-likelihood. We then use a calibration-based decomposition of Bregman divergences to develop a new extension to reliability diagrams that jointly visualizes calibration and generalization error, and show how our visualization can be used to detect trade-offs between calibration and generalization. Along the way, we prove novel results regarding the relationship between full calibration error and confidence calibration error for Bregman divergences. We also establish the consistency of the kernel regression estimator for calibration error used in our visualization approach, which generalizes existing consistency results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Thresholds for the Alignments of Partially Correlated Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of recovering the hidden vertex correspondence between two correlated random graphs. We propose the partially correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs model, wherein a pair of induced subgraphs with a certain number are correlated. We investigate the information-theoretic thresholds for recovering the latent correlated subgraphs and the hidden vertex correspondence. We prove that there exists an optimal rate for partial recovery for the number of correlated nodes, above which one can correctly match a fraction of vertices and below which correctly matching any positive fraction is impossible, and we also derive an optimal rate for exact recovery. In the proof of possibility results, we propose correlated functional digraphs, which partition the edges of the intersection graph into two types of components, and bound the error probability by lower-order cumulant generating functions. The proof of impossibility results build upon the generalized Fano's inequality and the recovery thresholds settled in correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs model.</description>

      <title>Mitigating over-exploration in latent space optimization using LES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop Latent Exploration Score (LES) to mitigate over-exploration in Latent Space Optimization (LSO), a popular method for solving black-box discrete optimization problems. LSO utilizes continuous optimization within the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and is known to be susceptible to over-exploration, which manifests in unrealistic solutions that reduce its practicality. LES leverages the trained decoder's approximation of the data distribution, and can be employed with any VAE decoder - including pretrained ones - without additional training, architectural changes or access to the training data. Our evaluation across five LSO benchmark tasks and twenty-two VAE models demonstrates that LES always enhances the quality of the solutions while maintaining high objective values, leading to improvements over existing solutions in most cases. We believe that new avenues to LSO will be opened by LES' ability to identify out of distribution areas, differentiability, and computational tractability. Open source code for LES is available at https://github.com/OmerRonen/les.</description>

      <title>Is Efficient PAC Learning Possible with an Oracle That Responds 'Yes' or 'No'?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The empirical risk minimization (ERM) principle has been highly impactful in machine learning, leading both to near-optimal theoretical guarantees for ERM-based learning algorithms as well as driving many of the recent empirical successes in deep learning. In this paper, we investigate the question of whether the ability to perform ERM, which computes a hypothesis minimizing empirical risk on a given dataset, is necessary for efficient learning: in particular, is there a weaker oracle than ERM which can nevertheless enable learnability? We answer this question affirmatively, showing that in the realizable setting of PAC learning for binary classification, a concept class can be learned using an oracle which only returns a single bit indicating whether a given dataset is realizable by some concept in the class. The sample complexity and oracle complexity of our algorithm depend polynomially on the VC dimension of the hypothesis class, thus showing that there is only a polynomial price to pay for use of our weaker oracle. Our results extend to the agnostic learning setting with a slight strengthening of the oracle, as well as to the partial concept, multiclass and real-valued learning settings. In the setting of partial concept classes, prior to our work no oracle-efficient algorithms were known, even with a standard ERM oracle. Thus, our results address a question of Alon et al. (2021) who asked whether there are algorithmic principles which enable efficient learnability in this setting.</description>

      <title>Adding Conditional Control to Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models that allow for precise control over the characteristics of the generated samples. While these diffusion models trained on large datasets have achieved success, there is often a need to introduce additional controls in downstream fine-tuning processes, treating these powerful models as pre-trained diffusion models. This work presents a novel method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to add such controls using an offline dataset comprising inputs and labels. We formulate this task as an RL problem, with the classifier learned from the offline dataset and the KL divergence against pre-trained models serving as the reward functions. Our method, $\textbf{CTRL}$ ($\textbf{C}$onditioning pre-$\textbf{T}$rained diffusion models with $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning), produces soft-optimal policies that maximize the abovementioned reward functions. We formally demonstrate that our method enables sampling from the conditional distribution with additional controls during inference. Our RL-based approach offers several advantages over existing methods. Compared to classifier-free guidance, it improves sample efficiency and can greatly simplify dataset construction by leveraging conditional independence between the inputs and additional controls. Additionally, unlike classifier guidance, it eliminates the need to train classifiers from intermediate states to additional controls. The code is available at https://github.com/zhaoyl18/CTRL.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimization for Randomized Algorithms: A Case Study on Random Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00584v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms exploit stochasticity to reduce computational complexity. One important example is random feature regression (RFR) that accelerates Gaussian process regression (GPR). RFR approximates an unknown function with a random neural network whose hidden weights and biases are sampled from a probability distribution. Only the final output layer is fit to data. In randomized algorithms like RFR, the hyperparameters that characterize the sampling distribution greatly impact performance, yet are not directly accessible from samples. This makes optimization of hyperparameters via standard (gradient-based) optimization tools inapplicable. Inspired by Bayesian ideas from GPR, this paper introduces a random objective function that is tailored for hyperparameter tuning of vector-valued random features. The objective is minimized with ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI). EKI is a gradient-free particle-based optimizer that is scalable to high-dimensions and robust to randomness in objective functions. A numerical study showcases the new black-box methodology to learn hyperparameter distributions in several problems that are sensitive to the hyperparameter selection: two global sensitivity analyses, integrating a chaotic dynamical system, and solving a Bayesian inverse problem from atmospheric dynamics. The success of the proposed EKI-based algorithm for RFR suggests its potential for automated optimization of hyperparameters arising in other randomized algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new approach to addressing positive and unlabeled (PU) data through the double exponential tilting model (DETM). Traditional methods often fall short because they only apply to selected completely at random (SCAR) PU data, where the labeled positive and unlabeled positive data are assumed to be from the same distribution. In contrast, our DETM's dual structure effectively accommodates the more complex and underexplored selected at random PU data, where the labeled and unlabeled positive data can be from different distributions. We rigorously establish the theoretical foundations of DETM, including identifiability, parameter estimation, and asymptotic properties. Additionally, we move forward to statistical inference by developing a goodness-of-fit test for the SCAR condition and constructing confidence intervals for the proportion of positive instances in the target domain. We leverage an approximated Bayes classifier for classification tasks, demonstrating DETM's robust performance in prediction. Through theoretical insights and practical applications, this study highlights DETM as a comprehensive framework for addressing the challenges of PU data.</description>

      <title>Have ASkotch: A Neat Solution for Large-scale Kernel Ridge Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a fundamental computational tool, appearing in problems that range from computational chemistry to health analytics, with a particular interest due to its starring role in Gaussian process regression. However, full KRR solvers are challenging to scale to large datasets: both direct (i.e., Cholesky decomposition) and iterative methods (i.e., PCG) incur prohibitive computational and storage costs. The standard approach to scale KRR to large datasets chooses a set of inducing points and solves an approximate version of the problem, inducing points KRR. However, the resulting solution tends to have worse predictive performance than the full KRR solution. In this work, we introduce a new solver, ASkotch, for full KRR that provides better solutions faster than state-of-the-art solvers for full and inducing points KRR. ASkotch is a scalable, accelerated, iterative method for full KRR that provably obtains linear convergence. Under appropriate conditions, we show that ASkotch obtains condition-number-free linear convergence. This convergence analysis rests on the theory of ridge leverage scores and determinantal point processes. ASkotch outperforms state-of-the-art KRR solvers on a testbed of 23 large-scale KRR regression and classification tasks derived from a wide range of application domains, demonstrating the superiority of full KRR over inducing points KRR. Our work opens up the possibility of as-yet-unimagined applications of full KRR across a number of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Causal Discovery without Acyclicity Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has proved a promising alternative for conventional local heuristics in score-based approaches to learning directed acyclic causal graphs (DAGs) from observational data. However, the intricate acyclicity constraint still challenges the efficient exploration of the vast space of DAGs in existing methods. In this study, we introduce ALIAS (reinforced dAg Learning wIthout Acyclicity conStraints), a novel approach to causal discovery powered by the RL machinery. Our method features an efficient policy for generating DAGs in just a single step with an optimal quadratic complexity, fueled by a novel parametrization of DAGs that directly translates a continuous space to the space of all DAGs, bypassing the need for explicitly enforcing acyclicity constraints. This approach enables us to navigate the search space more effectively by utilizing policy gradient methods and established scoring functions. In addition, we provide compelling empirical evidence for the strong performance of ALIAS in comparison with state-of-the-arts in causal discovery over increasingly difficult experiment conditions on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fast computation of large kernel sums is a challenging task, which arises as a subproblem in any kernel method. We approach the problem by slicing, which relies on random projections to one-dimensional subspaces and fast Fourier summation. We prove bounds for the slicing error and propose a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approach for selecting the projections based on spherical quadrature rules. Numerical examples demonstrate that our QMC-slicing approach significantly outperforms existing methods like (QMC-)random Fourier features, orthogonal Fourier features or non-QMC slicing on standard test datasets.</description>

      <title>Universality in Transfer Learning for Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of transfer learning and fine-tuning in linear models for both regression and binary classification. In particular, we consider the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a linear model initialized with pretrained weights and using a small training data set from the target distribution. In the asymptotic regime of large models, we provide an exact and rigorous analysis and relate the generalization errors (in regression) and classification errors (in binary classification) for the pretrained and fine-tuned models. In particular, we give conditions under which the fine-tuned model outperforms the pretrained one. An important aspect of our work is that all the results are "universal", in the sense that they depend only on the first and second order statistics of the target distribution. They thus extend well beyond the standard Gaussian assumptions commonly made in the literature. Furthermore, our universality results extend beyond standard SGD training to the test error of a classification task trained using a ridge regression.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for image generation and denoising. Typically, generative models learn a trajectory between the starting noise distribution and the target data distribution. Recently Liu et al. (2023b) designed a novel alternative generative model Rectified Flow (RF), which aims to learn straight flow trajectories from noise to data using a sequence of convex optimization problems with close ties to optimal transport. If the trajectory is curved, one must use many Euler discretization steps or novel strategies, such as exponential integrators, to achieve a satisfactory generation quality. In contrast, RF has been shown to theoretically straighten the trajectory through successive rectifications, reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) while sampling. It has also been shown empirically that RF may improve the straightness in two rectifications if one can solve the underlying optimization problem within a sufficiently small error. In this paper, we make two key theoretical contributions: 1) we provide the first theoretical analysis of the Wasserstein distance between the sampling distribution of RF and the target distribution. Our error rate is characterized by the number of discretization steps and a \textit{new formulation of straightness} stronger than that in the original work. 2) under a mild regularity assumption, we show that for a rectified flow from a Gaussian to any general target distribution with finite first moment (e.g. mixture of Gaussians), two rectifications are sufficient to achieve a straight flow, which is in line with the previous empirical findings. Additionally, we also present empirical results on both simulated and real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Skills from Unlabeled Prior Data for Efficient Online Exploration</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised pretraining has been transformative in many supervised domains. However, applying such ideas to reinforcement learning (RL) presents a unique challenge in that fine-tuning does not involve mimicking task-specific data, but rather exploring and locating the solution through iterative self-improvement. In this work, we study how unlabeled offline trajectory data can be leveraged to learn efficient exploration strategies. While prior data can be used to pretrain a set of low-level skills, or as additional off-policy data for online RL, it has been unclear how to combine these ideas effectively for online exploration. Our method SUPE (Skills from Unlabeled Prior data for Exploration) demonstrates that a careful combination of these ideas compounds their benefits. Our method first extracts low-level skills using a variational autoencoder (VAE), and then pseudo-labels unlabeled trajectories with optimistic rewards and high-level action labels, transforming prior data into high-level, task-relevant examples that encourage novelty-seeking behavior. Finally, SUPE uses these transformed examples as additional off-policy data for online RL to learn a high-level policy that composes pretrained low-level skills to explore efficiently. In our experiments, SUPE consistently outperforms prior strategies across a suite of 42 long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Code: https://github.com/rail-berkeley/supe.</description>

      <title>Deep Autoencoder with SVD-Like Convergence and Flat Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</description>

      <title>Tree-Wasserstein Distance for High Dimensional Data with a Latent Feature Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding meaningful distances between high-dimensional data samples is an important scientific task. To this end, we propose a new tree-Wasserstein distance (TWD) for high-dimensional data with two key aspects. First, our TWD is specifically designed for data with a latent feature hierarchy, i.e., the features lie in a hierarchical space, in contrast to the usual focus on embedding samples in hyperbolic space. Second, while the conventional use of TWD is to speed up the computation of the Wasserstein distance, we use its inherent tree as a means to learn the latent feature hierarchy. The key idea of our method is to embed the features into a multi-scale hyperbolic space using diffusion geometry and then present a new tree decoding method by establishing analogies between the hyperbolic embedding and trees. We show that our TWD computed based on data observations provably recovers the TWD defined with the latent feature hierarchy and that its computation is efficient and scalable. We showcase the usefulness of the proposed TWD in applications to word-document and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, demonstrating its advantages over existing TWDs and methods based on pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Assimilation via Score-based Sequential Langevin Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents score-based sequential Langevin sampling (SSLS), a novel approach to nonlinear data assimilation within a recursive Bayesian framework. The proposed method decomposes the assimilation process into alternating prediction and update steps, leveraging dynamic models for state prediction while incorporating observational data through score-based Langevin Monte Carlo during updates. To address challenges in posterior sampling, we introduce an annealing strategy within the update mechanism. We provide theoretical guarantees for SSLS convergence in total variation (TV) distance under certain conditions, providing insights into error behavior with respect to key hyper-parameters. Our numerical experiments across challenging scenarios -- including high-dimensional systems, strong nonlinearity, and sparse observations -- demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method. Furthermore, SSLS effectively quantifies the uncertainty associated with the estimated states, making it particularly valuable for the error calibration.</description>

      <title>Practical Performative Policy Learning with Strategic Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performative policy learning problem, where agents adjust their features in response to a released policy to improve their potential outcomes, inducing an endogenous distribution shift. There has been growing interest in training machine learning models in strategic environments, including strategic classification and performative prediction. However, existing approaches often rely on restrictive parametric assumptions: micro-level utility models in strategic classification and macro-level data distribution maps in performative prediction, severely limiting scalability and generalizability. We approach this problem as a complex causal inference task, relaxing parametric assumptions on both micro-level agent behavior and macro-level data distribution. Leveraging bounded rationality, we uncover a practical low-dimensional structure in distribution shifts and construct an effective mediator in the causal path from the deployed model to the shifted data. We then propose a gradient-based policy optimization algorithm with a differentiable classifier as a substitute for the high-dimensional distribution map. Our algorithm efficiently utilizes batch feedback and limited manipulation patterns. Our approach achieves high sample efficiency compared to methods reliant on bandit feedback or zero-order optimization. We also provide theoretical guarantees for algorithmic convergence. Extensive and challenging experiments on high-dimensional settings demonstrate our method's practical efficacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circuits based on sum-product structure have become a ubiquitous representation to compactly encode knowledge, from Boolean functions to probability distributions. By imposing constraints on the structure of such circuits, certain inference queries become tractable, such as model counting and most probable configuration. Recent works have explored analyzing probabilistic and causal inference queries as compositions of basic operators to derive tractability conditions. In this paper, we take an algebraic perspective for compositional inference, and show that a large class of queries - including marginal MAP, probabilistic answer set programming inference, and causal backdoor adjustment - correspond to a combination of basic operators over semirings: aggregation, product, and elementwise mapping. Using this framework, we uncover simple and general sufficient conditions for tractable composition of these operators, in terms of circuit properties (e.g., marginal determinism, compatibility) and conditions on the elementwise mappings. Applying our analysis, we derive novel tractability conditions for many such compositional queries. Our results unify tractability conditions for existing problems on circuits, while providing a blueprint for analysing novel compositional inference queries.</description>

      <title>Gentle Local Robustness implies Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robustness and generalization ability of machine learning models are of utmost importance in various application domains. There is a wide interest in efficient ways to analyze those properties. One important direction is to analyze connection between those two properties. Prior theories suggest that a robust learning algorithm can produce trained models with a high generalization ability. However, we show in this work that the existing error bounds are vacuous for the Bayes optimal classifier which is the best among all measurable classifiers for a classification problem with overlapping classes. Those bounds cannot converge to the true error of this ideal classifier. This is undesirable, surprizing, and never known before. We then present a class of novel bounds, which are model-dependent and provably tighter than the existing robustness-based ones. Unlike prior ones, our bounds are guaranteed to converge to the true error of the best classifier, as the number of samples increases. We further provide an extensive experiment and find that two of our bounds are often non-vacuous for a large class of deep neural networks, pretrained from ImageNet.</description>

      <title>Posterior Approximation using Stochastic Gradient Ascent with Adaptive Stepsize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable algorithms of posterior approximation allow Bayesian nonparametrics such as Dirichlet process mixture to scale up to larger dataset at fractional cost. Recent algorithms, notably the stochastic variational inference performs local learning from minibatch. The main problem with stochastic variational inference is that it relies on closed form solution. Stochastic gradient ascent is a modern approach to machine learning and is widely deployed in the training of deep neural networks. In this work, we explore using stochastic gradient ascent as a fast algorithm for the posterior approximation of Dirichlet process mixture. However, stochastic gradient ascent alone is not optimal for learning. In order to achieve both speed and performance, we turn our focus to stepsize optimization in stochastic gradient ascent. As as intermediate approach, we first optimize stepsize using the momentum method. Finally, we introduce Fisher information to allow adaptive stepsize in our posterior approximation. In the experiments, we justify that our approach using stochastic gradient ascent do not sacrifice performance for speed when compared to closed form coordinate ascent learning on these datasets. Lastly, our approach is also compatible with deep ConvNet features as well as scalable to large class datasets such as Caltech256 and SUN397.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noises: Optimal Convergence without Gradient Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the study of heavy-tailed noises in first-order nonconvex stochastic optimization has gotten a lot of attention since it was recognized as a more realistic condition as suggested by many empirical observations. Specifically, the stochastic noise (the difference between the stochastic and true gradient) is considered to have only a finite $\mathfrak{p}$-th moment where $\mathfrak{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$ instead of assuming it always satisfies the classical finite variance assumption. To deal with this more challenging setting, people have proposed different algorithms and proved them to converge at an optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate for smooth objectives after $T$ iterations. Notably, all these new-designed algorithms are based on the same technique - gradient clipping. Naturally, one may want to know whether the clipping method is a necessary ingredient and the only way to guarantee convergence under heavy-tailed noises. In this work, by revisiting the existing Batched Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (Batched NSGDM) algorithm, we provide the first convergence result under heavy-tailed noises but without gradient clipping. Concretely, we prove that Batched NSGDM can achieve the optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate even under the relaxed smooth condition. More interestingly, we also establish the first $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{2\mathfrak{p}}})$ convergence rate in the case where the tail index $\mathfrak{p}$ is unknown in advance, which is arguably the common scenario in practice.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Experiments Under High-Dimensional and Data Sparse Settings: Applications for Educational Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In online educational platforms, adaptive experiment designs play a critical role in personalizing learning pathways, instructional sequencing, and content recommendations. Traditional adaptive policies, such as Thompson Sampling, struggle with scalability in high-dimensional and sparse settings such as when there are large amount of treatments (arms) and limited resources such as funding and time to conduct to a classroom constraint student size. Furthermore, the issue of under-exploration in large-scale educational interventions can lead to suboptimal learning recommendations. To address these challenges, we build upon the concept of lenient regret, which tolerates limited suboptimal selections to enhance exploratory learning, and propose a framework for determining the feasible number of treatments given a sample size. We illustrate these ideas with a case study in online educational learnersourcing examples, where adaptive algorithms dynamically allocate peer-crafted interventions to other students under active recall exercise. Our proposed Weighted Allocation Probability Adjusted Thompson Sampling (WAPTS) algorithm enhances the efficiency of treatment allocation by adjusting sampling weights to balance exploration and exploitation in data-sparse environments. We present comparative evaluations of WAPTS across various sample sizes (N=50, 300, 1000) and treatment conditions, demonstrating its ability to mitigate under-exploration while optimizing learning outcomes.</description>

      <title>Rational Tuning of LLM Cascades via Probabilistic Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the reliability of large language models (LLMs) has recently garnered significant attention. Given LLMs' propensity to hallucinate, as well as their high sensitivity to prompt design, it is already challenging to predict the performance of an individual LLM. However, the problem becomes more complex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each model's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of different models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for the joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a framework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade using continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds using grid search, our parametric Markov-copula model significantly improves runtime scaling with respect to the length of the cascade and the desired resolution of the cost-error curve, turning them from intractable into low-order polynomial. In addition, the optimal thresholds computed using our continuous optimization-based algorithm increasingly outperform those found via grid search as cascade length grows, improving the area under the cost-error curve by 1.9% on average for cascades consisting of at least three models. Overall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for tuning LLM cascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic methods in analyzing LLM systems.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Representations of scRNA-seq Data for Improved Clustering with Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data is often conducted through network projections such as coexpression networks, primarily due to the abundant availability of network analysis tools for downstream tasks. However, this approach has several limitations: loss of higher-order information, inefficient data representation caused by converting a sparse dataset to a fully connected network, and overestimation of coexpression due to zero-inflation. To address these limitations, we propose conceptualizing scRNA-seq expression data as hypergraphs, which are generalized graphs in which the hyperedges can connect more than two vertices. In the context of scRNA-seq data, the hypergraph nodes represent cells and the edges represent genes. Each hyperedge connects all cells where its corresponding gene is actively expressed and records the expression of the gene across different cells. This hypergraph conceptualization enables us to explore multi-way relationships beyond the pairwise interactions in coexpression networks without loss of information. We propose two novel clustering methods: (1) the Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (DIPHW) and (2) the Coexpression and Memory-Integrated Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (CoMem-DIPHW). They outperform established methods on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. The improvement brought by our proposed methods is especially significant when data modularity is weak. Furthermore, CoMem-DIPHW incorporates the gene coexpression network, cell coexpression network, and the cell-gene expression hypergraph from the single-cell abundance counts data altogether for embedding computation. This approach accounts for both the local level information from single-cell level gene expression and the global level information from the pairwise similarity in the two coexpression networks.</description>

      <title>Linear $Q$-Learning Does Not Diverge in $L^2$: Convergence Rates to a Bounded Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms. It is widely believed that $Q$-learning with linear function approximation (i.e., linear $Q$-learning) suffers from possible divergence until the recent work Meyn (2024) which establishes the ultimate almost sure boundedness of the iterates of linear $Q$-learning. Building on this success, this paper further establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rate of linear $Q$-learning iterates (to a bounded set). Similar to Meyn (2024), we do not make any modification to the original linear $Q$-learning algorithm, do not make any Bellman completeness assumption, and do not make any near-optimality assumption on the behavior policy. All we need is an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy with an adaptive temperature. The key to our analysis is the general result of stochastic approximations under Markovian noise with fast-changing transition functions. As a side product, we also use this general result to establish the $L^2$ convergence rate of tabular $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy, for which we rely on a novel pseudo-contraction property of the weighted Bellman optimality operator.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Gibbs algorithm with high probability at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper gives a bound on the generalization error of the Gibbs algorithm, which recovers known data-independent bounds for the high temperature range and extends to the low-temperature range, where generalization depends critically on the data-dependent loss-landscape. It is shown, that with high probability the generalization error of a single hypothesis drawn from the Gibbs posterior decreases with the total prior volume of all hypotheses with similar or smaller empirical error. This gives theoretical support to the belief in the benefit of flat minima. The zero temperature limit is discussed and the bound is extended to a class of similar stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Finite sample bounds for barycenter estimation in geodesic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the barycenter of a distribution given i.i.d. data in a geodesic space. Assuming an upper curvature bound in Alexandrov's sense and a support condition ensuring the strong geodesic convexity of the barycenter problem, we establish finite-sample error bounds in expectation and with high probability. Our results generalize Hoeffding- and Bernstein-type concentration inequalities from Euclidean to geodesic spaces. Building on these concentration inequalities, we derive statistical guarantees for two efficient algorithms for the computation of barycenters.</description>
