      <title>How large is the error effect when summing or averaging nonlinear field normalization citation counts at the paper level?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summing or averaging nonlinearly field-normalized citation counts is a common but methodologically problematic practice, as it violates mathematical principles. The issue originates from the nonlinear transformation, which disrupts the equal-interval property of the data. Such unequal data do not satisfy the necessary conditions for summation. In our study, we normalized citation counts of papers from all sample universities using six linear and nonlinear methods, and then computed the total and average scores for each university under each method. By benchmarking against raw citations and linear normalized scores, we explore how large the error effect is from summing or averaging the nonlinear field normalized citation counts. Our empirical results indicate that the error exists but is relatively small. We further found that the magnitude of the error is significantly influenced by whether the sample publications are homogeneous or heterogeneous. This study has significant implications for whether the results obtained through nonlinear methods on a single level can be directly summed or averaged when calculating the overall impact of a research unit.</description>

      <title>Research Output on Alopecia Areata Disease: A Scientometric Analysis of Publications from 2010 to 2019</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study is undertaken to find out the publication trends on Alopecia Areata Disease during 2010-2019 from the global perspective. The study mainly focus on distribution of research output, top journals for publications, most prolific authors, authorship pattern, and citations pattern on Alopecia Areata Disease. The results indicate that highest growth rate of publications occurred during the year 2019. Columbia University topped the scene among all institutes. The maximum publications were more than four authored publications. Christiano AM and Clynes R were found to be the most prolific authors. It is also found that most of the prolific authors (by number of publications) do appear in highly cited publications list. Alopecia Areata Disease researchers mostly preferred using article publications to communicate their findings.</description>

      <title>Library and Culture: A Scientometric Analysis and Visualization of Research Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significance of libraries in preserving and maintaining history and traditional culture cannot be overlooked. It is from this purpose that libraries are to envisage in their programmes cultural activities which must be collected, documented and preserved for posterity. The usefulness of preserved information lies in the fact that the generation to come will be able to establish their identity. This will also assist them with a foundation to build from. This study focus on the growth and development of Library and Culture research in forms of publications reflected in Web of Science database, during the span of 2010-2019. A total 890 publications were found and the highest 124 (13.93%) publications published in 2019.The analysis maps comprehensively the parameters of total output, growth of output, authorship, institution wise and country-level collaboration patterns, major contributors (individuals, top publication sources, institutions, and countries). It exposed that the most prolific author is Lo P secured first place by contributing 4 (0.45%) publications, followed by Bressan V 3 (0.34%) publications in Library and Culture literature. Journal of Academic Librarianship produced the highest number of records 29 (3.26%) followed by Australian Library Journal having contributed 21 (2.36%).It is identified the domination of Wuhan University; School Information Management had contributed 6 (0.67%) of total research output. Authors from USA published the highest number of publications with a total of 244 (27.42%), followed by UK and Australia with 118 (13.26%) and 76 (8.54%) publications were produced respectively.</description>

      <title>Using language models to label clusters of scientific documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated label generation for clusters of scientific documents is a common task in bibliometric workflows. Traditionally, labels were formed by concatenating distinguishing characteristics of a cluster's documents; while straightforward, this approach often produces labels that are terse and difficult to interpret. The advent and widespread accessibility of generative language models, such as ChatGPT, make it possible to automatically generate descriptive and human-readable labels that closely resemble those assigned by human annotators. Language-model label generation has already seen widespread use in bibliographic databases and analytical workflows. However, its rapid adoption has outpaced the theoretical, practical, and empirical foundations. In this study, we address the automated label generation task and make four key contributions: (1) we define two distinct types of labels: characteristic and descriptive, and contrast descriptive labeling with related tasks; (2) we provide a formal descriptive labeling that clarifies important steps and design considerations; (3) we propose a structured workflow for label generation and outline practical considerations for its use in bibliometric workflows; and (4) we develop an evaluative framework to assess descriptive labels generated by language models and demonstrate that they perform at or near characteristic labels, and highlight design considerations for their use. Together, these contributions clarify the descriptive label generation task, establish an empirical basis for the use of language models, and provide a framework to guide future design and evaluation efforts.</description>

      <title>Towards Defect Phase Diagrams: From Research Data Management to Automated Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defect phase diagrams provide a unified description of crystal defect states for materials design and are central to the scientific objectives of the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 1394. Their construction requires the systematic integration of heterogeneous experimental and simulation data across research groups and locations. In this setting, research data management (RDM) is a key enabler of new scientific insight by linking distributed research activities and making complex data reproducible and reusable.
  To address the challenge of heterogeneous data sources and formats, a comprehensive RDM infrastructure has been established that links experiment, data, and analysis in a seamless workflow. The system combines: (1) a joint electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, (2) easy-to-use large-object data storage, (3) automatic metadata extraction from heterogeneous and proprietary file formats, (4) interactive provenance graphs for data exploration and reuse, and (5) automated reporting and analysis workflows. The two key technological elements are the openBIS electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, and a newly developed companion application that extends openBIS with large-scale data handling, automated metadata capture, and federated access to distributed research data.
  This integrated approach reduces friction in data capture and curation, enabling traceable and reusable datasets that accelerate the construction of defect phase diagrams across institutions.</description>
