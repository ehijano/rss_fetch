      <title>Rubber band filters: optimal padding without edge artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bandpass filtering techniques are widely used in spectroscopy. However, conventional symmetric-padding filtering methods introduce boundary artifacts that distort the signal at the edges. We present a rubber band filter: a robust method for achieving band-limited filtering without these detrimental edge artifacts. The technique applies an optimal padding scheme during the filtering process, thereby overcoming longstanding challenges in achieving artifact-free filtering. Importantly, it is iterative and requires only a few extra Fourier transforms over conventional approaches. We demonstrate its superiority and versatility by applying it to three spectroscopic examples -- time-domain spectroscopy, Fourier-transform spectroscopy, and dual-comb spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling in Staggered-Gyromagnetic Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the realization of intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a two-dimensional photonic crystal composed of staggered-gyromagnetic cylinders in a modified honeycomb lattice. The system exhibits a Mexican-hat-like band structure and helical spin textures, which is the major characteristics of Rashba SOC. Through both full-wave simulations and k-p theory, we confirm the emergence of spin-split bands and vortex-like spin textures centered at the Brillouin zone. In addition, under oblique incidence, the Rashba band dispersion gives rise to concurrent negative and a positive refraction. These results establish a platform for exploring intrinsic Rashba photonics and spin-controlled wave transport in periodic systems.</description>

      <title>Monolithic interferometric modules for multi-axis coordinate positioning with sub-nanometre precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on developing, characterizing, and verifying a compact, monolithic laser interferometric assembly designed for high-precision two- and three-axis displacement measurements in coordinate positioning systems. The design targets OEM integration into advanced precision motion platforms, including nanometrology instruments, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. Using a single laser source, the assembly integrates multiple interferometers into a monolithic L-shaped base frame, enabling sub-nanometer periodic error in X-Y motion systems while minimizing geometric and thermal instabilities. The pre-aligned and pre-adjusted architecture simplifies integration, enhances long-term stability, and ensures consistent metrological performance. The system's verification protocol employs quadrature phase analysis and systematic error metrics to characterize performance and optimise assembly. The results indicate sub-nanometer measurement capability and suggest the system's suitability for scalable implementation in advanced coordinate metrology applications.</description>

      <title>Vacuum squeezing enhanced micrometer scale vapor cell magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an optical magnetometer enhanced by vacuum-squeezed light, employing an Mx magnetometer based on $^{87}$Rb vapor in a micrometer-scale cell (~100 $\mu$m). Using the well-established polarization self-rotation effect in a room-temperature $^{87}$Rb vapor cell, we achieve -3 dB of vacuum squeezing within the noise spectral window of 100 Hz to several MHz, corresponding to 3.5 dB squeezing when accounting for optical losses. Leveraging this level of squeezing, we demonstrate a magnetic field sensitivity of approx. 1 pT$/$$\sqrt{Hz}$. The combination of vacuum-squeezed light and micrometer-scale vapor cells paves the way for compact, low-power-consumption atomic sensors with enhanced performance.</description>

      <title>Mid-IR hyperspectral imaging with undetected photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing with undetected photons has become a vibrant, application-driven research domain with a special focus on the mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelength region. Since the mid-IR contains spectral bands with highly specific and strong molecular absorbance signatures, often referred to as fingerprints, a multitude of different samples and their compositions can be detected and quantified spectroscopically. Enhancing this inherently sample alteration-free spectroscopic method with imaging capabilities leads to a powerful technique for environmental monitoring and biomedical applications that enables automated diagnostics while omitting time-consuming and non-reversible labeling steps. To evade the shortcomings of state-of-the-art instruments for mid-IR hyperspectral microscopy related to cost, complexity, power-consumption, and performance, which are associated with technological challenges for mid-IR cameras and low-noise and broadband mid-IR sources, here, we construct a proof-of-concept nonlinear interferometer in a wide-field imaging arrangement combined with high-resolution spectral acquisition by pixelwise quantum Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. For the broadband range of 2300-3100 cm$^{-1}$, covering the important CH-stretch band, we perform hyperspectral imaging that simultaneously resolves 3500 spatial modes, each with a spectral resolution of 10 cm$^{-1}$ leveraging in total around $10^5$ spatio-spectrally entangled photon modes. Our image acquisition uses a commercial, megapixel sCMOS camera, while a medium-power and compact c.w. pump laser is the only necessary light source.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Insight Drives Multimodal Vortex-Field Dynamics via Streamline Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the 1970s, analogies between laser dynamics and (super)fluid systems have elucidated phenomena from superconductivity to BoseEinstein condensation. Inspired by Coullet et al.s 1989 formalization of optical vortices via hydrodynamic whirlpools, we here advance a hydrodynamic paradigm for vortex_beam propagation. By treating the Poynting_vector trajectories as energy streamlines, we establish a three_dimensional map of photon trajectories and energy flow. Angular_spectrum engineering in momentum space, together with the fluid_continuity equation, is used to sculpt these streamlines and thereby tailor multimodal, independently tunable propagation behaviors. The resulting beams simultaneously suppress diffraction_ and OAM_induced broadening and inherit the diffraction_free, self_healing, self_accelerating, and self_similar traits of classic structured modes, with adjustable energy_density profiles to compensate loss. Optical_tweezer measurements, akin to particle_tracking velocimetry of fluid dynamics, confirm that trapped microspheres trace the prescribed streamlines, laying the groundwork for future precision three_dimensional photonic manipulation. In a free_space communication case study, streamline_engineered multimodal vortex beams deliver an order_of_magnitude increase in independent channels, enhanced turbulence resilience, and non_line_of_sight capability. This hydrodynamic framework thus furnishes a versatile, experimentally verified toolkit for multimodal control of vortex beams and substantially broadens their application scope, while opening new avenues for fluid dynamics simulations using optical analogues.</description>

      <title>Biexciton-polariton coupling mediated by dark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-exciton correlations shape the photo-induced response of nanostructured materials, particularly when interactions are enhanced by light confinement. Here multidimensional coherent spectroscopy is used to quantify biexciton and exciton-polariton dynamics in a semiconductor microcavity. One- and two-quantum spectra, which are dominated by polariton-related contributions, also include a polarization-dependent biexciton feature whose magnitude and spectral coordinates depend on the detuning between the cavity mode and the exciton resonance. Comparison of spectra acquired using collinear and noncollinear experimental geometries indicates that excitation wavevector plays no significant role in this behavior. The measured energy dispersion and cavity enhancement are not compatible with uncoupled biexcitons or bipolaritons. To explain the measurements, an indirect biexciton-photon coupling model is introduced whereby biexcitons are formed from dark excitons that Coulomb couple to the bright-exciton fraction of the polaritons. The model addresses inconsistent observations of biexcitons previously reported in semiconductor microcavities and is generalizable to any material where optically dark excitons contribute to light-matter interaction. Our results suggest a mechanism to access long-lived dark excitons through multi-exciton correlations in strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Label-free microscope for rheological imaging of cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many essential cellular functions depend on the viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm. While techniques such as optical tweezers and atomic force microscopy can measure these properties, their reliance on localized probes prevents intracellular imaging and perturbs native cellular behaviour. Label-free microscopy offers a non-invasive alternative for observing intracellular dynamics. However, limitations in signal-to-noise ratio and imaging speed typically restrict analysis to diffusivity, leaving cellular viscous properties inaccessible. Here, we introduce rheoSCAT, a label-free, phase-sensitive microscope engineered with ultra-low phase noise. This system enables measurements of intracellular dynamics at frequencies up to 50 kHz, twenty times faster than previous label-free approaches. Applied to live cancer cells, this technique establishes a connection between label-free microscopy and rheology. The high speed of our technique reveals viscoelastic behaviours that were previously inaccessible, which we show are consistent with probe-based microrheology observations. The rheological images produced distinguish intra- and extracellular regions with high contrast, resolve spatial variations in cellular mechanics, and enable monitoring of cellular state and stress over time. The ability to quantitatively map intracellular energetics and viscoelasticity offers a powerful tool for advancing fundamental cell biology, cancer research, clinical diagnostics, and drug development.</description>

      <title>Extracting Nonlinear Dynamical Response Functions from Time Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework based on the functional derivative to extract nonlinear dynamical response functions from the temporal evolution of physical quantities, without explicitly computing multipoint correlation functions. We validate our approach by calculating the second- and third-order optical responses in the Rice-Mele model and further apply it to a many-body interacting system using a tensor network method. This framework is broadly applicable to any method that can compute real-time dynamics, offering a powerful and versatile tool for investigating nonlinear responses in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Temporal modulation of second harmonic generation in ferroelectrics by a pulsed electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the relationship between electric polarization modulation $\Delta P$ in ferroelectrics induced by a low-frequency pulsed electric field and the corresponding second harmonic intensity modulation $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Using nonlinear response theory, we derive their time-domain expressions linear in the pulse amplitude, revealing that not only the electric field but also its time derivative contributes to $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Furthermore, even when the time-derivative component is negligible, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can be in antiphase with the pulsed field and thus with $\Delta P$. These theoretical predictions are further supported by real-time simulations of a model for electronic ferroelectrics. Our results demonstrate that the commonly assumed relation $\Delta P \propto \Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can break down under certain conditions, reflecting the complex-valued and frequency-dependent nature of nonlinear dynamical susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Violation of Bell Inequality with Unentangled Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Violation of local realism via Bell inequality - a profound and counterintuitive manifestation of quantum theory that conflicts with the prediction of local realism - is viewed to be intimately linked with quantum entanglement. Experimental demonstrations of such a phenomenon using quantum entangled states are among the landmark experiments of modern physics and paved the way for quantum technology. Here we report the violation of the Bell inequality that cannot be described by quantum entanglement in the system but arises from quantum indistinguishability by path identity, shown by the multi-photon frustrated interference. By analyzing the measurement of four-photon frustrated interference within the standard Bell-test formalism, we find a violation of Bell inequality by more than four standard deviations. Our work establishes a connection between quantum correlation and quantum indistinguishability, providing insights into the fundamental origin of the counterintuitive characteristics observed in quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Information-Driven Optical Design with Interchanging Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through the information content of their measurements alone, enabling application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed to automate this process through gradient-based. In this work, we study IDEAL across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage, long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for real-world imaging system design.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of interacting cavity solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the equations governing the motion of Kerr solitons in pair waveforms. Recent experiments in microresonators have studied a variety of interaction effects in multisoliton waveforms, including collisions and formation of soliton molecules and crystals. Here we analyze the effective interaction that arises from the coupling of soliton-tail overlap nonlinearity with global soliton variables associated with the breaking of translation symmetry. The interaction is either purely repulsive, or alternates between attraction and repulsion, according to whether the decay of soliton tails is monotone or oscillatory. In the latter case, stable fixed points of the effective dynamical system signify stable soliton molecule configuration, but the exponential weakening of the interaction with increasing inter-soliton separation may prevent the molecule from forming in experimentally accessible time scales. Our theory becomes asymptotically exact in the large-separation limit, and we verify the theoretical calculations using soliton trajectories extracted from direct numerical solutions of the wave equation.</description>

      <title>Purcell enhancement of photogalvanic currents in a van der Waals plasmonic self-cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavities provide a means to manipulate the optical and electronic responses of quantum materials by selectively enhancing light-matter interaction at specific frequencies and momenta. While cavities typically involve external structures, exfoliated flakes of van der Waals (vdW) materials can form intrinsic self-cavities due to their small finite dimensions, confining electromagnetic fields into plasmonic cavity modes, characterized by standing-wave current distributions. While cavity-enhanced phenomena are well-studied at optical frequencies, the impact of self-cavities on nonlinear electronic responses--such as photogalvanic currents--remains largely unexplored, particularly in the terahertz regime, critical for emerging ultrafast optoelectronic technologies. Here, we report a self-cavity-induced Purcell enhancement of photogalvanic currents in the vdW semimetal WTe$_2$. Using ultrafast optoelectronic circuitry, we measured coherent near-field THz emission resulting from nonlinear photocurrents excited at the sample edges. We observed enhanced emission at finite frequencies, tunable via excitation fluence and sample geometry, which we attribute to plasmonic interference effects controlled by the cavity boundaries. We developed an analytical theory that captures the cavity resonance conditions and spectral response across multiple devices. Our findings establish WTe$_2$ as a bias-free, geometry-tunable THz emitter and demonstrate the potential of self-cavity engineering for controlling nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: In modern imaging systems that computationally process raw measurements before or instead of human viewing, information content matters more than visual appearance. However, developing information estimators that can handle the complexity of real-world measurements yet remain practical enough for widespread use has proven challenging. We introduce a data-driven approach for estimating mutual information between unknown objects and their noisy measurements. Our technique fits probabilistic models to measurements and their noise processes, quantifying information content without requiring ground truth data or making assumptions about object structure. We validate our approach across diverse applications-color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and microscopy-demonstrating that information estimates reliably predict system performance. Finally, we introduce Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL), which optimizes imaging systems to maximize information capture. Our work unlocks information theory as a powerful, practical tool for analyzing and designing imaging systems across a broad range of applications.

      <title>Resolution Limit in Microsphere-Assisted Super-Resolution Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visualization in the virtual image formed by dielectric microparticles has been shown to enable the distinction of objects that remain indistinguishable under direct observation. We perform the resolution analysis based on a full two-dimensional simulation of optical image formation taking into account the diffraction of partially coherent light on the microparticle and the objects under study. The oscillating nature of optical resolution is demonstrated depending on the size of the microparticle. The presence of strong resonances is observed in both transmission and reflection modes. It is shown that as the size of the object decreases, the optical resolution tends to the classical limit. An analytical estimate for the resolution criterion in microsphere-assisted imaging is presented.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide electric field localization to be used as a fluorescence enhancement tool for the closely located fluorophores. However, metallic structures exhibit non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which suppresses the boost in the photoluminescence spectrum due to inhomogeneous medium. Compensation to non-radiative losses is fundamentally restricted, therefore defining the critical interparticle distances, where the fluorescence enhancement is detectable hold utmost importance for device applications. In this work, we numerically identified the critical interparticle distances of a metal nanoparticle (MNP) and quantum emitters (QEs) with angstrom resolution by analyzing the interplay between quantum yield and non-radiative decay. By engaging a collimated light application on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance, we simulated an active fluorescence enhancement switch yielding observable 7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. The provided free space simulation includes the complete response of AgNP with retardation and higher order multi-polar effects for which the previous analytical works fall short. While the model bridges the absorption and emission spectra via corresponding Stokes shift values and presents a general approach for the interaction of QEs and MNPs in Rayleigh regime, it can be extended to Mie regime for larger QEs and can be modified for dielectric device environment.</description>

      <title>Compact, Large-Scale Photonic Neurons by Modulation-and-Weight Microring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11369v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fabrication imperfections, spatial constraints, and prohibitive costs collectively impede the scalability of neuromorphic photonics. In this work, we introduce a large-scale, compact photonic neuron in which each microring performs modulation and weighting simultaneously. This dual functionality is realized by leveraging both the carrier effect and thermal tunability, thereby merging modulation and weighting to conserve on-chip area, enhancing tuning efficiency, and capitalizing on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) for scalable implementations. In addition, we investigated a range of configurations for the proposed neuron to better tailor its behavior to various computational tasks. To illustrate the adaptability of the system's tasks, we explore both spatial and temporal domains, highlighting its versatility through two representative tasks: image processing and, for the first time, financial time series analysis, which represents a promising new frontier for neuromorphic photonics. These findings underscore the considerable promise of photonic computing in addressing a breadth of real-world challenges, particularly under escalating demands for both scalability and flexibility.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Scaling Quantum Microscopy: Experiment and Theory</title>

Abstract: Entangled biphoton sources exhibit nonclassical characteristics and have been applied to imaging techniques such as ghost imaging, quantum holography, and quantum optical coherence tomography. The development of wide-field quantum imaging to date has been hindered by low spatial resolutions, speeds, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs). Here, we present quantum microscopy by coincidence (QMC) with balanced pathlengths, which enables super-resolution imaging at the Heisenberg limit with substantially higher speeds and CNRs than existing wide-field quantum imaging methods. QMC benefits from a configuration with balanced pathlengths, where a pair of entangled photons traversing symmetric paths with balanced optical pathlengths in two arms behave like a single photon with half the wavelength, leading to 2-fold resolution improvement. Concurrently, QMC resists stray light up to 155 times stronger than classical signals. The low intensity and entanglement features of biphotons in QMC promise nondestructive bioimaging. QMC advances quantum imaging to the microscopic level with significant improvements in speed and CNR toward bioimaging of cancer cells. We experimentally and theoretically prove that the configuration with balanced pathlengths illuminates an avenue for quantum-enhanced coincidence imaging at the Heisenberg limit.</description>

      <title>Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) where the AC field plays an explicit role. The modified FDR is non-Markovian even if the undriven particle-bath system is Markovian without the external field. We provide an illustration of the usefulness of these results and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Observing High-dimensional Bell Inequality Violations using Multi-Outcome Spectral Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify and violate a Bell inequality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or Bell-nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing Bell-nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</description>
