      <title>Underprepared for Physics: Reframing the narrative on readiness and instruction in calculus-based, introductory physics courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the U.S., introductory calculus-based courses often acts as a gatekeeper to STEM degrees. But access to the prerequisite math is far from equal--students from low-income and racially marginalized communities are far less likely to have the chance to take calculus before college. These disparities are then compounded by rigid placement systems that reward procedural fluency in algebra and trigonometry, while overlooking the conceptual quantitative reasoning that physics truly demands. Labeling students as "underprepared" ignores the structural causes of these gaps and places the burden of remediation on those least supported. This article challenges that broken-student narrative and advocates for instructional redesigns that meet students where they are. We spotlight Rutgers University's Extended Analytical Physics program, a long-running initiative that embeds physics quantitative literacy (PQL) into extended, credit-bearing courses, demonstrating how departments can expand access without compromising rigor. On a national scale, the TIPSSS network (Transforming Introductory Physics Sequences to Support all Students) is bringing together departments invested in similar reforms. Collectively, these efforts point toward a future where calculus-based physics becomes a pathway to opportunity, not a barrier.</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum Information Science Pre-College Education: The Case for Learning Sciences Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum information science advances and the need for pre-college engagement grows, a critical question remains: How can young learners be prepared to participate in a field so radically different from what they have encountered before? This paper argues that meeting this challenge will require strong interdisciplinary collaboration with the Learning Sciences (LS), a field dedicated to understanding how people learn and designing theory-guided environments to support learning. Drawing on lessons from previous STEM education efforts, we discuss two key contributions of the learning sciences to quantum information science (QIS) education. The first is design-based research, the signature methodology of learning sciences, which can inform the development, refinement, and scaling of effective QIS learning experiences. The second is a framework for reshaping how learners reason about, learn and participate in QIS practices through shifts in knowledge representations that provide new forms of engagement and associated learning. We call for a two-way partnership between quantum information science and the learning sciences, one that not only supports learning in quantum concepts and practices but also improves our understanding of how to teach and support learning in highly complex domains. We also consider potential questions involved in bridging these disciplinary communities and argue that the theoretical and practical benefits justify the effort.</description>

      <title>Learning quantum properties with informationally redundant external representations: An eye-tracking study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research indicates that the use of multiple external representations MERs has the potential to support learning, especially in complex scientific areas, such as quantum physics. In particular, the provision of informationally redundant external representations can have advantageous effects on learning outcomes. This is of special relevance for quantum education, where various external representations are available and their effective use is recognised as crucial to student learning. However, research on the effects of informationally redundant external representations in quantum learning is limited. The present study aims to contribute to the development of effective learning materials by investigating the effects of learning with informationally redundant external representations on students' learning of quantum physics. Using a between-subjects design, 113 students were randomly assigned to one of four learning conditions. The control group learnt with a traditional multimedia learning unit on the behaviour of a single photon in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The three intervention groups received redundant essential information in the Dirac formalism, the Bloch sphere, or both. The use of eye tracking enabled insight into the learning process depending on the external representations provided. While the results indicate no effect of the study condition on learning outcomes (content knowledge and cognitive load), the analysis of visual behaviour reveals decreased learning efficiency with the addition of the Bloch sphere to the multimedia learning unit. The results are discussed based on current insight in learning with MERs. The study emphasises the need for careful instructional design to balance the associated cognitive load when learning with informationally redundant external representations.</description>
