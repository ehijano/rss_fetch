      <title>Machine Learning for Exoplanet Detection: A Comparative Analysis Using Kepler Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our understanding of planetary systems and opened new avenues for astronomical research. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework for exoplanet identification using a time-series photometric dataset from the Kepler Space Telescope, comprising 3,198 flux measurements across 5,074 stars. We investigate the performance of four supervised classification algorithms, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, using a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion matrices, and learning curves. Among the models, Random Forest achieves the highest accuracy (99.8\%) and near-perfect F1-scores, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness. KNN also performs strongly, achieving 99.3\% accuracy, while Decision Tree demonstrates moderate performance with 97.1\% accuracy, and Logistic Regression trails behind with the lowest accuracy and generalization at 95.8\%. Notably, the application of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improves performance across all models by addressing class imbalance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest, in handling large volumes of photometric data for automated exoplanet detection. This approach holds significant potential for implementation at ground-based facilities, such as the Iranian National Observatory (INO), where such extensive and precise datasets can further advance exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts.</description>

      <title>Forecasting steam mass flow in power plants using the parallel hybrid network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and sustainable power generation is a crucial concern in the energy sector. In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parametrized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 minutes into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model. These findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of how integrating quantum and classical machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world challenges faced by the energy sector, ultimately leading to optimized power plant operations. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first parallel hybrid quantum-classical architecture deployed on a real-world power-plant dataset, illustrating how near-term quantum resources can already augment classical analytics in the energy sector.</description>

      <title>Strong anomalous diffusion for free-ranging birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion and anomalous diffusion are widely observed and used to study movement across organisms, resulting in extensive use of the mean and mean-squared displacement (MSD). However, these measures - corresponding to specific displacement moments - do not capture the full complexity of movement behavior. Using high-resolution data from over 70 million localizations of young and adult free-ranging Barn Owls (\textit{Tyto alba}), we reveal strong anomalous diffusion as nonlinear growth of displacement moments. The moment spectrum function $\lambda_t(q)$ -- defined by $\left&lt;|\bm{x}(t)|^q\right&gt; \sim t^{\lambda_t(q)}$ -- displays piecewise linearity in $q$, with a critical moment marking the crossover between scaling regimes. This highlights the need of a broad spectrum of displacement moments to characterize movement, which we link to age-specific ecological drivers. Furthermore, a characteristic timescale of five minutes marks an unexpected transition from a convex to a concave $\lambda_t(q)$. Using two stochastic models - a bounded L\'evy walk and a multi-mode behavioral model - we account for the observed phenomena, showing good agreement with data, relating age-specific behavioral states to environmentally confined movement, and demonstrating how L\'evy walk-like patterns can arise from underlying behavioral structure. Finally, we discuss the ecological significance of our results, arguing that strong anomalous diffusion may be widespread in animal movement.</description>

      <title>Testing of tempered fractional Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose here a testing methodology based on the autocovariance, detrended moving average, and time-averaged mean-squared displacement statistics for tempered fractional Brownian motions (TFBMs) which are related to the notions of semi-long range dependence and transient anomalous diffusion. In this framework, we consider three types of TFBMs: two with a tempering factor incorporated into their moving-average representation, and one with a tempering parameter added to the autocorrelation formula. We illustrate their dynamics with the use of quantile lines. Using the proposed methodology, we provide a comprehensive power analysis of the tests. It appears that the tests allow distinguishing between the tempered processes with different Hurst parameters.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Atomic Charge State and Atomic Number for VAMOS++ Magnetic Spectrometer using Deep Neural Networks and Fractionally Labelled Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer is a multi-parametric system that integrates ion optical magnetic elements with a multi-detector stack. The magnetic elements, along with the tracking and timing detectors and the trajectory reconstruction method, provide the analysis of the magnetic rigidity, the trajectory length between the beam interaction point and the focal plane of the spectrometer, and the related velocity and mass-over-charge ratio. The segmented ionization chamber provides the energy measurements necessary to analyze the atomic charge state and atomic number. However, this analysis critically suffers from inherent limitations due to the variable thickness and non-uniformity of the entrance window of the ionization chamber and other detector imperfections. Conventionally, this meticulous, detailed analysis is exceptionally tedious, often requiring several months to complete. We present a novel method utilizing deep neural networks, trained on an experimental dataset with only a small fraction of precisely labeled events for the lowest and best-resolved atomic charge states or numbers. This innovative approach enables the networks to autonomously and accurately classify the remaining events. This method drastically accelerates the acquisition of high-resolution atomic charge state and atomic number spectra, reducing analysis time from months to mere hours. Crucially, by discarding human bias, this approach ensures standardized, optimal, and reproducible results with unprecedented efficiency.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Emissivity Retrieval from Hyperspectral Data via Physics-Guided Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given remotely-sensed radiance measurement.</description>
