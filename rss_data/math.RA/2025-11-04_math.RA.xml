      <title>The pairwise distributive law of semilattice congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the congruence lattice of a semilattice satsifies a form of distributivity relative to principal congruences of the form $ \Theta_{t \odot s, s}$. Particularly, we establish that semilattice congruences obey the ``pairwise distributive law": \[ (\cap_{i \in w} \Omega_{i}) \vee \Theta_{t \odot s, s} = \cap_{k,r \in w} \big( (\Omega_{k} \cap \Omega_{r}) \vee \Theta_{t \odot s, s} \big) \] for any family of congruences $\{ \Omega_{i} : i\in w \}$, with $w$ a possibly infinite set.</description>

      <title>Free polynomial strong bimonoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, in weighted automata theory the weight structure of strong bimonoids has found much interest; they form a generalization of semirings and are closely related to near-semirings studied in algebra. Here, we define polynomials over a set $X$ of indeterminates as well as an addition and a multiplication. We show that with these operations, they form a right-distributive strong bimonoid, that this polynomial strong bimonoid is free over $X$ in the class of all right-distributive strong bimonoids and that it is both left- and right-cancellative. We show by purely algebraic reasoning that two arbitrary terms are equivalent modulo the laws of right-distributive strong bimonoids if and only if their representing polynomials are equivalent by the laws of only associativity and commutativity of addition and associativity of multiplication. We give effective procedures for constructing the representing polynomials. As a consequence, we obtain that the equivalence of arbitrary terms modulo the laws of right-distributive strong bimonoids can be decided in exponential time. Using term-rewriting methods, we show that each term can be reduced to a unique polynomial as normal form. We also derive corresponding results for the free idempotent right-distributive polynomial strong bimonoid over $X$. We construct an idempotent strong bimonoid which is weakly locally finite but not locally finite and show an application of it in weighted automata theory.</description>

      <title>Derived operations satisfy standard identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A derived operation is a bilinear operation on a commutative associative algebra $A$ defined intrinsically out of its product and several derivations of the product. We show that operators of left (or right) multiplications of a derived operation always satisfy a "standard identity" of certain order. In particular, it implies that each Rankin-Cohen bracket of modular forms, as well as each higher bracket of Kontsevich's universal deformation quantization formula for Poisson structures on $\mathbb{R}^n$, satisfies standard identities.</description>

      <title>Finite Structure and Radical Theory of Commutative Ternary $\Gamma$-Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop the algebraic foundation of finite commutative ternary $\Gamma$-semirings by identifying their intrinsic invariants, lattice organization, and radical behavior that generalize classical semiring and $\Gamma$-ring frameworks.
  Methods: Finite models of commutative ternary $\Gamma$-semirings are constructed under the axioms of closure, distributivity, and symmetry. Structural and congruence lattices are analyzed, and subdirect decomposition theorems are established through ideal-theoretic arguments.
  Results: Each finite commutative ternary $\Gamma$-semiring admits a unique (up to isomorphism) decomposition into subdirectly irreducible components. Radical and ideal correspondences parallel classical results for binary semirings, while the classification of all non-isomorphic systems of order $\lvert T\rvert\!\le\!4$ confirms the structural consistency of the theory.
 Conclusion: The paper provides a compact algebraic framework linking ideal theory and decomposition in finite ternary $\Gamma$-semirings, establishing the basis for later computational and categorical developments.</description>

      <title>Regular actions and semisimplicity of conformal modules over the general conformal algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a regular action in the category of conformal modules over Lie conformal algebras with Virasoro elements. We show that a finite conformal module over the general conformal algebra $\mathfrak{gc}_1$ (resp., $\mathfrak{gc}_N$ with $N\ge2$) is semisimple if and only if there exists a pair of different Virasoro elements (resp., canonical Virasoro elements) with regular actions. Along the way to finding a semisimplicity criteria, we also discuss the classification of Virasoro elements of $\mathfrak{gc}_N$ in-depth, leading us to construct a huge number of new Virasoro conformal modules.</description>

      <title>Lie Algebra Decomposition Classes for Reductive Algebraic Groups in Arbitrary Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decomposition classes provide a way of partitioning the Lie algebras of an algebraic group into equivalence classes based on the Jordan decomposition. In this paper, we investigate the decomposition classes of the Lie algebras of connected reductive algebraic groups, over algebraically closed fields of arbitrary characteristic. We extend some results previously proved under restrictions on the characteristic, and introduce Levi-type decomposition classes to account for some of the difficulties encountered in bad characteristic. We also establish properties of Lusztig-Spaltenstein induction of non-nilpotent orbits, extending the known results for nilpotent orbits.</description>

      <title>A Complete Classification of Ideal Chomp Games on Low-Rank Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We completely classify winning strategies in the Ideal Chomp Game played on $\bar{K}$-algebras R of rank at most 6. In this two-player combinatorial game, players alternately add generators to build an ideal inside a given ring R, with the player who builds an ideal equal to the entire ring losing. We prove that player A has a winning strategy on all $\bar{K}$-algebras R up to rank 6 except for five specific cases: $\bar{K}$ itself, $\bar{K}[x, y]/(x, y)^2$, and three other local algebras. Our methods combine game-theoretic analysis with the structure theory of Artinian rings and computational verification. We also discuss a classical result of Henson on winning strategies in the Ideal Chomp Game, as well as ideas and open questions about the Ideal Chomp Game on higher-dimensional $\bar{K}$-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.01326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study extended associative semigroups (briefly, EAS), an algebraic structure used to define generalizations of the operad of associative algebras, and the subclass of commutative extended diassociative semigroups (briefly, CEDS), which are used to define generalizations of the operad of pre-Lie algebras. We give families of examples based on semigroups or on groups, as well as a classification of EAS of cardinality two. We then define linear extended associative semigroups as linear maps satisfying a variation of the braid equation. We explore links between linear EAS and bialgebras and Hopf algebras. We also study the structure of nondegenerate finite CEDS and show that they are obtained by semidirect and direct products involving two groups.</description>

Abstract: We introduce noncommutative rings with $DK$-property (Dubrovin-Komarnytsky's property) and investigate elementary divisor rings with such property. Mostly we pay attention to these kinds of noncommutative rings which have stable range $1$. A theory of reduction matrices over such rings is constructed. As a consequence, new families of non-commutative rings of elementary divisor rings are constructed.</description>

      <title>Higher power polyadic group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically develops the theory of polyadic group rings, a higher arity generalization of classical group rings $\mathcal{R}[\mathsf{G}]$. We construct the fundamental operations of these structures, defining the $\mathbf{m}_{r}$-ary addition and $\mathbf{n}_{r} $-ary multiplication for a polyadic group ring $\mathrm{R}^{[\mathbf{m} _{r},\mathbf{n}_{r}]}=\mathcal{R}^{[m_{r},n_{r}]}[\mathsf{G}^{[n_{g}]}]$ built from a nonderived $(m_{r},n_{r})$-ring and a nonderived $n_{g}$-ary group. A central result is the derivation of the "quantization" conditions that interrelate these arities, governed by the arity freedom principle, which also extends to operations with higher polyadic powers. We establish key algebraic properties, including conditions for total associativity and the existence of a zero element and identity. The concepts of the polyadic augmentation map and augmentation ideal are generalized, providing a bridge to the classical theory. The framework is illustrated with explicit examples, solidifying the theoretical constructions. This work establishes a new foundation in ring theory with potential applications in cryptography and coding theory, as evidenced by recent schemes utilizing polyadic structures.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the weighted KLRW algebras of finite type, and their cyclotomic quotients, are cellular algebras. The cellular bases are explicitly described using crystal graphs. As a special case, this proves that the KLR algebras of finite type are cellular. As one application, we give explicit formulas for the graded decomposition numbers of the cyclotomic algebras in level one.</description>

      <title>Interval Replacements of Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define two notions. The first one is a $rank\ compression\ system$ $\xi$ for a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$ that assigns each interval subposet $I$ to an order-preserving map $\xi_I \colon I^{\xi} \to \mathbf{P}$ satisfying some conditions, where $I^{\xi}$ is a connected finite poset. An example is given by the $total$ compression system that assigns each $I$ to the inclusion of $I$ into $\mathbf{P}$. The second one is an $I$-$rank$ of a persistence module $M$ under $\xi$, the family of which is called the $interval\ rank\ invariant$ of $M$ under $\xi$. A compression system $\xi$ makes it possible to define the $interval\ replacement$ (also called the interval-decomposable approximation) not only for 2D persistence modules but also for any persistence modules over any finite poset. We will show that the forming of the interval replacement preserves the interval rank invariant, which is a stronger property than the preservation of the usual rank invariant. Moreover, to know what is preserved by the replacement explicitly, we will give a formula of the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ in terms of the structure linear maps of $M$ for any compression system $\xi$. The formula leads us to a concept of essential cover, which gives us a sufficient condition for the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ to coincide with that under another compression system $\zeta$. This is applied to the case where $\xi = \mathrm{tot}$, the value of $I$-rank under which is equal to the generalized rank invariant introduced by Kim--M{\'e}moli, to give an alternative proof of their theorem computing the generalized rank invariant by using a zigzag path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coefficient algebra of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra on a finite-dimensional representation is defined as the subalgebra generated by all coefficients of the corresponding characteristic polynomial. We explore connections between classical invariant theory and the coefficient algebras of finite-dimensional complex Lie algebras on some representations. Specifically, we prove that with respect to any symmetric power of the standard representation: (a) the coefficient algebra of the upper triangular solvable complex Lie algebra is isomorphic to the ring of symmetric polynomials; (b) the coefficient algebra of the general linear complex Lie algebra is isomorphic to the invariant ring of the general linear group with the conjugacy action on the full space of matrices; and (c) the coefficient algebra of the special linear complex Lie algebra can be generated by classical trace functions. As an application, we determine the characteristic polynomial of the special linear complex Lie algebra on its standard representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general construction of eventually periodic projective resolutions for modules over quotients of rings of finite left global dimension by a regular central element. Our approach utilizes a construction of Shamash, combined with the iterated mapping cone technique, to systematically 'purge' homology from a complex. The construction is applied specifically to the integral group rings of groups with finite virtual cohomological dimension. We demonstrate the computability of our method through explicit calculations for several families of groups including hyperbolic triangle groups and mapping class groups of the punctured plane.</description>
