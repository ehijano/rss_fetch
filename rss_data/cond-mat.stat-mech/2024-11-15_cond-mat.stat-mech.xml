      <title>Coarsening and universality on a growing surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model in which particles belonging to two species proliferate with volume exclusion on an expanding surface. If the surface expands uniformly, we show that the domains formed by the two species present a critical behavior. We compute the critical exponents characterizing the decay of interfaces and the size distribution of domains using a mean-field theory. These mean-field exponents agree very accurately with those fitted in numerical simulations, suggesting that the theory is exact.</description>

      <title>Universal scale-free decay of spatial correlations in $d$-dimensional interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the correlations between the position of a tagged tracer and the density of surrounding bath particles is key to understanding tracer diffusion in interacting particle systems. We address this problem analytically for both hard-core and soft-core interactions, using minimal yet paradigmatic models in $d$ spatial dimensions. In both cases, we derive analytical expressions for the spatial correlation profiles in the reference frame of the tracer. We reveal unexpected universal features in their large-distance behavior, characterized by power-law tails with exponents that depend solely on the spatial dimensionality of the system. Beyond these simple models, we demonstrate the robustness of our results across different regimes using particle-based numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Scaling theory for the collapse of a trapped Bose gas in a synthetic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have analytically explored both the zero temperature and the finite temperature scaling theory for the collapse of an attractively interacting 3-D harmonically trapped Bose gas in a synthetic magnetic field. We have considered short ranged (contact) attractive inter-particle interactions and Hartree-Fock approximation for the same. We have separately studied the collapse of both the condensate and the thermal cloud below and above the condensation point, respectively. We have obtained an anisotropy, artificial magnetic field, and temperature dependent critical number of particles for the collapse of the condensate. We have found a dramatic change in the critical exponent (from $\alpha=1$ to $0$) of the specific heat ($C_v\propto|T-T_c|^{\alpha}$) when the thermal cloud is about to collapse with the critical number of particles ($N=N_c$) just below and above the condensation point. All the results obtained by us are experimentally testable within the present-day experimental set-up for the ultracold systems in the magneto-optical traps.</description>

      <title>Numerical prediction of the steady-state distribution under stochastic resetting from measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common and effective method for calculating the steady-state distribution of a process under stochastic resetting is the renewal approach that requires only the knowledge of the reset-free propagator of the underlying process and the resetting time distribution. The renewal approach is widely used for simple model systems such as a freely diffusing particle with exponentially distributed resetting times. However, in many real-world physical systems, the propagator, the resetting time distribution, or both are not always known beforehand. In this study, we develop a numerical renewal method to determine the steady-state probability distribution of particle positions based on the measured system propagator in the absence of resetting combined with the known or measured resetting time distribution. We apply and validate our method in two distinct systems: one involving interacting particles and the other featuring strong environmental memory. Thus, the renewal approach can be used to predict the steady state under stochastic resetting of any system, provided that the free propagator can be measured and that it undergoes complete resetting.</description>

      <title>Quantum master equation from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to derive a quantum master equation for a system weakly coupled to a chaotic finite-sized bath prepared in a pure state. We show that the emergence of Markovianity is controlled by the spectral function of the ETH and that local detailed balance emerges in the Markovian regime for a broad class of pure bath states. We numerically verify this result by comparing the master equation to dynamics computed using exact diagonalization of a chaotic Hamiltonian. We also compare the master equation to exact dynamics for an integrable bath and find that at finite size they strongly disagree. Our work puts forward eigenstate thermalization as a foundation for open quantum systems theory, thus extending it beyond ensemble bath preparations to chaotic many-body environments in generic pure states.</description>

      <title>Thermal Pseudo-Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generalisation of the thermal entropy to complex inverse temperatures, which we call the thermal pseudo-entropy. We show that this quantity represents the pseudo-entropy of the transition matrix between Thermofield Double states at different times. We have studied its properties in various quantum mechanical setups, Schwarzian theory, Random Matrix Theories, and 2D CFTs, including symmetric orbifolds. Our findings indicate a close relationship between the averaged thermal pseudo-entropy and the spectral form factor, which is instrumental in distinguishing chaotic and integrable models. Moreover, we have observed a logarithmic scaling of this quantity in models with a continuous spectrum, with a universal coefficient that is sensitive to the scaling of the density of states near the edge of the spectrum. Lastly, we found the connection between the real and imaginary parts of the thermal pseudo-entropy through the Kramers-Kronig relations.</description>

      <title>Single-File Diffusion of Active Brownian Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-file diffusion (SFD) is a key mechanism underlying transport phenomena in confined physical and biological systems. In a typical SFD process, microscopic particles are restricted to moving in a narrow channel where they cannot pass one another, resulting in constrained motion and anomalous diffusion at long times. In this study, we use Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical theory to investigate the SFD of active Brownian particles (ABPs) -- a minimal model of active colloids. Using a combination of scaling relations and heuristic arguments, we derive an accurate analytical expression for a tagged ABP's mean square displacement (MSD). We find the MSD exhibits ballistic behavior at short times, which can quantitatively be related to the reduced kinetic temperature of the single-file ABP system. We also find that while the characteristic subdiffusive scaling of SFD $[\langle (\Delta x)^2 \rangle \sim t^{1/2}]$ is preserved at long times, self-propulsion introduces significant modifications to the 1D-mobility, which can be directly related to the constant P\'eclet (Pe) compressibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized 1D-mobility, initially proposed by Kollmann for equilibrium systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{90}$, 180602 (2003)], can be extended to active systems with minimal modification. These findings have important implications for tuning particle transport at the microscale and provide a basis for understanding active matter in geometries with highly restricted motion.</description>

      <title>Critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Precision bounds for multiple currents in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic (TUR) and kinetic (KUR) uncertainty relations are fundamental bounds constraining the fluctuations of current observables in classical, non-equilibrium systems. Several works have verified, however, violations of these classical bounds in open quantum systems, motivating the derivation of new quantum TURs and KURs that account for the role of quantum coherence. Here, we go one step further by deriving multidimensional KUR and TUR for multiple observables in open quantum systems undergoing Markovian dynamics. Our derivation exploits a multi-parameter metrology approach, in which the Fisher information matrix plays a central role. Crucially, our bounds are tighter than previously derived quantum TURs and KURs for single observables, precisely because they incorporate correlations between multiple observables. We also find an intriguing quantum signature of correlations that is captured by the off-diagonal element of the Fisher information matrix, which vanishes for classical stochastic dynamics. By considering two examples, namely a coherently driven qubit system and the three-level maser, we demonstrate that the multidimensional quantum KUR bound can even be saturated when the observables are perfectly correlated.</description>

      <title>Interdependent scaling exponents in the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the phenomenological renormalization group to resting-state fMRI time series of brain activity in a large population. By recursively coarse-graining the data, we compute scaling exponents for the series variance, log probability of silence, and largest covariance eigenvalue. The exponents clearly exhibit linear interdependencies, which we derive analytically in a mean-field approach. We find a significant correlation of exponent values with the gray matter volume and cognitive performance. Akin to scaling relations near critical points in thermodynamics, our findings suggest scaling interdependencies are intrinsic to brain organization and may also exist in other complex systems.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior and level spacing statistics in a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies of the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian [K. Swaminathan et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043215 (2023)], we introduce the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model, a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor, in order to better understand the quasiparticle localization and interesting coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior present in the former model. The OBS model is the sum of terms that have direct counterparts in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian, each of which is parameterized by a coupling constant. Exact diagonalization reveals that the energy spectrum and non-equilibrium dynamics of the OBS model are essentially the same as that of the dice lattice for some values of the coupling constants. The quasiparticle localization and breaking of ergodicity manifest in a striking manner in the level spacing distribution. Its near Poissonian form provides evidence for the existence of local integrals of motion and establishes the OBS model as a non-trivial integrable generalization of the projected Creutz ladder Hamiltonian. These results show that level spacing statistics is a promising tool to study quasiparticle excitations in flat band superconductors.</description>

      <title>A Krylov space approach to Singular Value Decomposition in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel tridiagonalization approach for non-Hermitian random matrices and Hamiltonians using singular value decomposition (SVD). This technique leverages the real and non-negative nature of singular values, bypassing the complex eigenvalues typically found in non-Hermitian systems. We analyze the tridiagonal elements, namely the Lanczos coefficients and the associated Krylov (spread) complexity, appropriately defined through the SVD, across several examples including Ginibre ensembles and the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We demonstrate that in chaotic cases, the complexity exhibits a distinct peak due to the repulsion between singular values, a feature absent in integrable cases. Using our approach, we analytically compute the Krylov complexity for two-dimensional non-Hermitian random matrices within a subset of non-Hermitian symmetry classes including time-reversal, time-reversal$^{\dagger}$, chiral, and sublattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>A Sinking Approach to Explore Arbitrary Areas in Free Energy Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the time-scale limitations in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, numerous enhanced sampling methods have been developed to expedite the exploration of complex free energy landscapes. A commonly employed approach accelerates the sampling of degrees of freedom associated with predefined collective variables (CVs), which typically tends to traverse the entire CV range. However, in many scenarios, the focus of interest is on specific regions within the CV space. In this paper, we introduce a novel "sinking" approach that enables enhanced sampling of arbitrary areas within the CV space. We begin by proposing a gridded convolutional approximation that productively replicates the effects of metadynamics, a powerful CV-based enhanced sampling technique. Building on this, we present the SinkMeta method, which "sinks" the interior bias potential to create a restraining potential "cliff" at the grid edges. This technique can confine the exploration of CVs in MD simulations to a predefined area. Our experimental results demonstrate that SinkMeta requires minimal sampling steps to estimate the free energy landscape for CV subspaces of various shapes and dimensions, including irregular two-dimensional regions and one-dimensional pathways between metastable states. We believe that SinkMeta will pioneer a new paradigm for sampling partial phase spaces, especially offering an efficient and flexible solution for sampling minimum free energy paths in high-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence is now a widely used tool in molecular science. Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: Neural Spline Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) Neural Spline Flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) Conditional Flow Matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models appears the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib\textsubscript{9} peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.</description>

      <title>Diffusive dynamics of charge regulated macro-ion solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Onsager's variational principle is generalized to address the diffusive dynamics of an electrolyte solution composed of charge-regulated macro-ions and counterions. The free energy entering the Rayleighian corresponds to the Poisson-Boltzmann theory augmented by the charge-regulation mechanism. The dynamical equations obtained by minimizing the Rayleighian include the classical Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations, the Debye-Falkenhagen equation, and their modifications in the presence of charge regulation. By analyzing the steady state, we show that the charge regulation has an important impact on the non-equilibrium macro-ion spatial distribution and their effective charge, deviating significantly from their equilibrium values. Our model, based on Onsager's variational principle offers a unified approach to the diffusive dynamics of electrolytes containing components that undergo various charge association/dissociation processes.</description>

      <title>Distinctive features of inhomogeneous spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review presents recent developments in the study of inhomogeneous XX spin chains, highlighting results on perfect state transfer, out-of-equilibrium stationary dynamics in open systems, and entanglement and correlations in ground states. We discuss the conditions on couplings that enable perfect state transfer, examine how heat currents scale when the chains are coupled to thermal baths, explore the role of tridiagonal matrices in approximating the entanglement Hamiltonian and investigate bulk and boundary entanglement negativity and correlation decay. These findings underscore some of the distinctive physical behavior of inhomogeneous spin chains and their potential applications in quantum information and thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Noise-driven odd elastic waves in living chiral active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral active matter is predicted to exhibit odd elasticity, with nontraditional elastic response arising from a combination of chirality, being out of equilibrium, and the presence of nonreciprocal interactions. One of the resulting phenomena is the possible occurrence of odd elastic waves in overdamped systems, although its experimental realization still remains elusive. Here we show that in overdamped active systems, noise is required to generate persistent elastic waves. In the chiral crystalline phase of active matter, such as that found recently in populations of swimming starfish embryos, the noise arises from self-driving of active particles and their mutual collisions, a key factor that has been missing in previous studies. We identify the criterion for the occurrence of noise-driven odd elastic waves, and postulate the corresponding phase diagram for the general chiral active crystals. Our results can be used to predict the experimental conditions for achieving a transition to self-sustained elastic waves in overdamped active systems.</description>

      <title>NEP-MB-pol: A unified machine-learned framework for fast and accurate prediction of water's thermodynamic and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water's unique hydrogen-bonding network and anomalous properties present significant challenges for accurately modeling its structural, thermodynamic, and transport behavior across varied conditions. Although machine-learned potentials have advanced the prediction of individual properties, a unified computational framework capable of simultaneously capturing water's complex and subtle properties with high accuracy has remained elusive. Here, we address this challenge by introducing NEP-MB-pol, a highly accurate and efficient neuroevolution potential trained on extensive MB-pol reference data with coupled-cluster-level accuracy, combined with path-integral molecular dynamics and quantum-correction techniques to incorporate nuclear quantum effects. This NEP-MB-pol framework reproduces experimentally measured structural, thermodynamic, and transport properties of water across a broad temperature range, achieving simultaneous, fast, and accurate prediction of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Our approach provides a unified and robust tool for exploring thermodynamic and transport properties of water under diverse conditions, with significant potential for broader applications across research fields.</description>

      <title>Superposition of plane waves in high spatial dimensions: from landscape complexity to the deepest minimum value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce and analyse some statistical properties of a class of models of random landscapes of the form ${\cal H}({\bf x})=\frac{\mu}{2}{\bf x}^2+\sum_{l=1}^M \phi_l({\bf k}_l\cdot {\bf x}), \, \, {\bf x}\in \mathbb{R}^N,\,\, \mu&gt;0 $ where both the functions $\phi_l(z)$ and vectors ${\bf k}_l$ are random. An important example of such landscape describes superposition of $M$ plane waves with random amplitudes, directions of the wavevectors, and phases, further confined by a parabolic potential of curvature $\mu$.
  Our main efforts are directed towards analysing the landscape features in the limit $N\to \infty, M\to \infty$ keeping $\alpha=M/N$ finite. In such a limit we find (i) the rates of asymptotic exponential growth with $N$ of the mean number of all critical points and of local minima known as the annealed complexities and (ii) the expression for the mean value of the deepest landscape minimum (the ground-state energy). In particular, for the latter we derive the Parisi-like optimisation functional and analyse conditions for the optimiser to reflect various phases for different values of $\mu$ and $\alpha$: replica-symmetric, one-step and full replica symmetry broken, as well as criteria for continuous, Gardner and random first order transitions between different phases.</description>

      <title>Deformation of Marchenko-Pastur distribution for the correlated time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the eigenvalue of the Wishart matrix, which is created from a time series with temporal correlation. When there is no correlation, the eigenvalue distribution of the Wishart matrix is known as the Marchenko-Pastur distribution (MPD) in the double scaling limit. When there is temporal correlation, the eigenvalue distribution converges to the deformed MPD which has a longer tail and higher peak than the MPD. Here we discuss the moments of distribution and convergence to the deformed MPD for the Gaussian process with a temporal correlation. We show that the second moment increases as the temporal correlation increases. When the temporal correlation is the power decay, we observe a phenomenon such as a phase transition. When $\gamma&gt;1/2$ which is the power index of the temporal correlation, the second moment of the distribution is finite and the largest eigenvalue is finite. On the other hand, when $\gamma\leq 1/2$, the second moment is infinite and the largest eigenvalue is infinite. Using finite scaling analysis, we estimate the critical exponent of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Taming a Maxwell's demon for experimental stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A diffusive process that is reset to its origin at random times, so-called stochastic resetting (SR), is an ubiquitous expedient in many natural systems . Yet, beyond its ability to improve the efficiency of target searching, SR is a true non-equilibrium thermodynamic process that brings forward new and challenging questions . Here, we show how the recent developments of experimental information thermodynamics renew the way to address SR and can lead, beyond a new understanding, to better control on the non-equilibrium nature of SR. This thermodynamically controlled SR is experimentally implemented within a time-dependent optical trapping potential. We show in particular that SR converts heat into work from a single bath continuously and without feedback. This implements a Maxwell's demon that constantly erases information. In our experiments, the erasure takes the form of a protocol that allows to evaluate the true energetic cost of SR. We show that using an appropriate measure of the available information, this cost can be reduced to a reversible minimum while being bounded by the Landauer limit. We finally reveal that the individual trajectories generated by the demon all break ergodicity and thus demonstrate the non-ergodic nature of the demon's modus operandi. Our results offer new approaches to processes, such as SR, where the informational framework provides key experimental tools for their non-equilibrium thermodynamic control.</description>

      <title>Second law of thermodynamics: A case study searching for quantum non-thermodynamic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics has led to an interesting discovery: With locally nonchaotic barriers, as Boltzmann's H-theorem is inapplicable, there exist nontrivial non-thermodynamic systems that can produce useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect, thereby breaking the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics. The previous analyses used classical mechanical models. In the current investigation, the study is extended to quantum mechanics. First, we confirm that the Fermi-Dirac distribution and the Bose-Einstein distribution are inherently consistent with the heat-engine statement of the second law of thermodynamics. It reiterates the robustness of the overall framework of quantum statistical mechanics. Next, we perform thermodynamic analysis on a set of simple-step scattering problems. The result suggests that a bound state has a strong tendency to adhere to the second law of thermodynamics, while an unbound state may not. It implies that non-thermodynamic phenomena favor unquantized energy.</description>

      <title>Second law of thermodynamics: Spontaneous cold-to-hot heat transfer in a nonchaotic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09161v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been known that, fundamentally different from a large body of rarefied gas, when a Knudsen gas is immersed in a thermal bath, it may never reach thermal equilibrium. The root cause is nonchaoticity: as the particle-particle collisions are sparse, the particle trajectories tend to be independent of each other. Usually, this counterintuitive phenomenon is studied through kinetic theory and is not considered a thermodynamic problem. In current research, we show that if incorporated in a compound setup, such an intrinsically nonequilibrium behavior has nontrivial consequences and cannot circumvent thermodynamics: cold-to-hot heat transfer may happen spontaneously, either continuously (with an energy barrier) or cyclically (with time-dependent entropy barriers). It allows for production of useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect. As the system obeys the first law of thermodynamics, it breaks the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric effect for a $Q$-clock type system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in a working substance corresponding to a square lattice of spins with $Q$ possible orientations, known as the ``$Q$-state clock model". When the $Q$-state clock model has $Q\geq 5$ possible configurations, it presents the famous Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) phase associated with vortices states. We calculate thermodynamic quantities using Monte Carlo simulations for even $Q$ numbers, ranging from $Q=2$ to $Q=8$ spin orientations per site in a lattice. We use lattices of different sizes with $L\times L = 8^{2}, 16^{2}, 32^{2}, 64^{2}, \text{and}\ 128^{2}$ sites, considering free boundary conditions and an external magnetic field varying between $B = 0$ and $B=1$ in natural units of the system. By obtaining the entropy, it is possible to quantify the MCE through an isothermal process in which the external magnetic field on the spin system is varied. In particular, we find the values of $Q$ that maximize the MCE depending on the lattice size and the magnetic phase transitions linked with the process. Given the broader relevance of the $Q$-state clock model in areas such as percolation theory, neural networks, and biological systems, where multi-state interactions are essential, our study provides a robust framework in applied quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and related fields.</description>

Abstract: The article deals with the challenge of the construction of solutions to hierarchies of fundamental evolution equations for many colliding particles. The method of cluster expansions of the groups of operators of the Liouville equations for observables and a state is used to establish the generating operators of expansions representing solutions of the Cauchy problems of the BBGKY hierarchy (Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon) as well as of the dual BBGKY hierarchy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Charge and Entanglement Criticality in a U(1)-Symmetric Hybrid Circuit of Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study critical properties of the entanglement and charge-sharpening measurement-induced phase transitions in a non-unitary quantum circuit evolving with a U(1) conserved charge. Our numerical estimation of the critical properties of the entanglement transition at finite system sizes appears distinct from the generic non-conserving case and percolation. We provide two possible interpretations of this observation: (a) these two transitions occur at different measurement rates in the thermodynamic limit, but at finite system sizes their critical fans overlap and the critical exponents we probed here show a combination of both the criticality. Nonetheless, the multifractal properties of the entanglement transition remain distinct from the generic case without any symmetry, indicating a unique universality class due to the U(1) symmetry. (b) these two transitions occur at the same measurement rate at any length scale. Within this interpretation, our estimation of all the critical exponents are sharply different than the non-conserving case, again confirming the presence of a new universality class due U(1) symmetry. We compute entanglement critical exponents and correlation functions via various ancilla measures, use a transfer matrix for multifractality, and compute correlators associated with charge sharpening to explain these findings. Through these correlators, we also find evidence consistent with the charge-sharpening transition being of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type (including the predicted ``jump'' in stiffness), which simultaneously argues for a broad critical fan for this transition. As a result, attempts to measure critical properties in this finite-size system will see anomalously large exponents predicted by our numerical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum scattering is used ubiquitously in both experimental and theoretical physics across a wide range of disciplines, from high-energy physics to mesoscopic physics. In this work, we uncover universal relations for the energy fluctuations of a quantum system scattering inelastically with a particle at arbitrary kinetic energies. In particular, we prove a fluctuation relation describing an asymmetry between energy absorbing and releasing processes which relies on the non-unital nature of the underlying quantum map. This allows us to derive a bound on the average energy exchanged. We find that energy releasing processes are dominant when the kinetic energy of the particle is comparable to the system energies, but are forbidden at very high kinetic energies where well known fluctuation relations are recovered. Our work provides a unified view of energy fluctuations when the source driving the system is not macroscopic but rather an auxiliary quantum particle in a scattering process.</description>

      <title>Complete Positivity and Thermal Relaxation in Quadratic Quantum Master Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of this paper is to develop a systematic method for deriving quantum master equations that satisfy the requirements of a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map, further describing thermal relaxation processes. In this paper, we assume that the quantum master equation is obtained through the canonical quantization of the generalized Brownian motion proposed in our recent paper [T. Koide and F. Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A 494, 129277 (2024)]. At least classically, this dynamics describes the thermal relaxation process regardless of the choice of the system Hamiltonian. The remaining task is to identify the parameters ensuring that the quantum master equation meets complete positivity. We limit our discussion to many-body quadratic Hamiltonians and establish a CPTP criterion for our quantum master equation. This criterion is useful for applying our quantum master equation to models with interaction such as a network model, which has been used to investigate how quantum effects modify heat conduction.</description>

      <title>Thermomechanical Approach to Calculating Mechanical Stresses in Inhomogeneous Fluids and Its Applications to Ionic Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This extended article presents a thermomechanical approach for calculating the stress tensor from the thermodynamic potential of inhomogeneous fluids and some applications to ionic fluids. The technique, based on the invariance of the fluid's thermodynamic potential with respect to spatial transformations of translation and rotation, offers an alternative to the general covariant approach developed by two of the authors. We apply this technique to both pure mean-field theories of fluids in general and a theory that includes thermal fluctuations of the order parameter, using the example of ionic fluids. Additionally, we apply the thermomechanical approach to fluid models with vector order parameters, such as liquid dielectrics. For this case, we obtain a general expression for the stress tensor. Furthermore, we discuss specific issues related to the calculation of disjoining pressure in ionic fluids confined in nanoscale slit-like pores with metal or dielectric walls, using the Coulomb gas model. To test the robustness of the proposed approach, we reproduce a number of known results from the statistical theory of inhomogeneous fluids and obtain several new ones.</description>

Abstract: The mean square displacement (MSD) of intruders (tracer particles) immersed in a multicomponent granular mixture made up of smooth inelastic hard spheres in a homogeneous cooling state is explicitly computed. The multicomponent granular mixture is constituted by $s$ species with different masses, diameters, and coefficients of restitution. In the hydrodynamic regime, the time decay of the granular temperature of the mixture gives rise to a time decay of the intruder's diffusion coefficient $D_0$. The corresponding MSD of the intruder is determined by integrating the corresponding diffusion equation. As expected from previous works on binary mixtures, we find a logarithmic time dependence of the MSD which involves the coefficient $D_0$. To analyze the dependence of the MSD on the parameter space of the system, the diffusion coefficient is explicitly determined by considering the so-called second Sonine approximation (two terms in the Sonine polynomial expansion of the intruder's distribution function). The theoretical results for $D_0$ are compared with those obtained by numerically solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. We show that the second Sonine approximation improves the predictions of the first Sonine approximation, especially when the intruders are much lighter than the particles of the granular mixture. In the long-time limit, our results for the MSD agree with those recently obtained by Bodrova [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{109}, 024903 (2024)] when $D_0$ is determined by considering the first Sonine approximation.</description>

      <title>Spread Complexity Rate as Proper Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a precise relation between the rate of complexity of quantum states excited by local operators in two-dimensional conformal field theories and the radial momentum of particles in 3-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. Similar relations have been anticipated based on qualitative models for operator growth. Here, we make this correspondence sharp with two key ingredients: the precise definition of quantum complexity given by the spread complexity of states, and the match of its growth rate to the bulk momentum measured in the proper radial distance coordinate.</description>
