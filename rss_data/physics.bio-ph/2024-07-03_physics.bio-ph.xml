      <title>Mid-Infrared Hyperspectral Microscopy with Broadband 1-GHz Dual Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared microscopy is an important tool for biological analyses, allowing a direct probe of molecular bonds in their low energy landscape. In addition to the label-free extraction of spectroscopic information, the application of broadband sources can provide a third dimension of chemical specificity. However, to enable widespread deployment, mid-infrared microscopy platforms need to be compact and robust while offering high speed, broad bandwidth and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this study, we experimentally showcase the integration of a broadband, high-repetition-rate dual-comb spectrometer (DCS) in the mid-infrared range with a scanning microscope. We employ a set of 1-GHz mid-infrared frequency combs, demonstrating their capability for high-speed and broadband hyperspectral imaging of polymers and ovarian tissue. The system covers 1000 $\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ at $\mathrm{\nu_c=2941 \; cm^{-1}}$ with 12.86 kHz spectra acquisition rate and 5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ spatial resolution. Taken together, our experiments and analysis elucidate the trade-off between bandwidth and speed in DCS as it relates to microscopy. This provides a roadmap for the future advancement and application of high-repetition-rate DCS hyperspectral imaging.</description>

      <title>Biophysical effects and neuromodulatory dose of transcranial ultrasonic stimulation</title>

Abstract: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) has the potential to usher in a new era for human neuroscience by allowing spatially precise and high-resolution non-invasive targeting of both deep and superficial brain regions. Currently, fundamental research on the mechanisms of interaction between ultrasound and neural tissues is progressing in parallel with application-focused research. However, a major hurdle in the wider use of TUS is the selection of optimal parameters to enable safe and effective neuromodulation in humans. In this paper, we will discuss the major factors that determine both the safety and efficacy of TUS. We will discuss the thermal and mechanical biophysical effects of ultrasound, which underlie its biological effects, in the context of their relationships with tunable parameters. Based on this knowledge of biophysical effects, and drawing on concepts from radiotherapy, we propose a framework for conceptualising TUS dose.</description>

      <title>Systematizing Cellular Complexity: A Hilbertian Approach To Biological Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04627v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Examining individual components of cellular systems has been successful in uncovering molecular reactions and interactions. However, the challenge lies in integrating these components into a comprehensive system-scale map. This difficulty arises due to factors such as missing links (unknown variables), overlooked nonlinearities in high-dimensional parameter space, downplayed natural noisiness and stochasticity, and a lack of focus on causal influence and temporal dynamics. Composite static and phenomenological descriptions, while appearing complicated, lack the essence of what makes the biological systems truly "complex".
  The formalization of system-level problems is therefore important in constructing a meta-theory of biology. Addressing fundamental aspects of cellular regulation, adaptability, and noise management is vital for understanding the robustness and functionality of biological systems. These aspects encapsulate the challenges that cells face in maintaining stability, responding to environmental changes, and harnessing noise for functionality. This work examines these key problems that cells must solve, serving as a template for such formalization and as a step towards the axiomatization of biological investigations. Through a detailed exploration of cellular mechanisms, particularly homeostatic configuration, ion channels and harnessing noise, this paper aims to illustrate complex concepts and theories in a tangible context, providing a bridge between abstract theoretical frameworks and concrete biological phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Mereological Approach to Higher-Order Structure in Complex Systems: from Macro to Micro with M\"obius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14423v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relating microscopic interactions to macroscopic observables is a central challenge in the study of complex systems. Addressing this question requires understanding both pairwise and higher-order interactions, but the latter are less well understood. We present a unified mathematical formalism for deriving higher-order interactions from macroscopic observables, relative to a chosen decomposition of the system into its parts. Applying this framework to a diverse range of systems, we demonstrate that many existing notions of higher-order interactions, from epistasis in genetics and many-body couplings in physics, to synergy in game theory and artificial intelligence, naturally and uniquely arise from an appropriate mereological decomposition through the M\"obius inversion theorem. By revealing the common mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate phenomena, our work highlights the fundamental role of decomposition choice in the definition and estimation of higher-order interactions. We discuss how this unifying perspective can facilitate the transfer of insights across domains, guide the selection of appropriate system decompositions, and enable the search for new notions of interaction. To illustrate how this works in practice, we derive a new decomposition of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and show that it correctly disentangles divergences among the variables of simulated spin models. Our results suggest that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a powerful and practical lens for understanding the emergence of complex behaviour from the interplay of microscopic parts, with applications across a wide range of disciplines.</description>
