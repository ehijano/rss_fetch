      <title>Synthetic Query Generation using Large Language Models for Virtual Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Assistants (VAs) are important Information Retrieval platforms that help users accomplish various tasks through spoken commands. The speech recognition system (speech-to-text) uses query priors, trained solely on text, to distinguish between phonetically confusing alternatives. Hence, the generation of synthetic queries that are similar to existing VA usage can greatly improve upon the VA's abilities -- especially for use-cases that do not (yet) occur in paired audio/text data.
  In this paper, we provide a preliminary exploration of the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic queries that are complementary to template-based methods. We investigate whether the methods (a) generate queries that are similar to randomly sampled, representative, and anonymized user queries from a popular VA, and (b) whether the generated queries are specific.
  We find that LLMs generate more verbose queries, compared to template-based methods, and reference aspects specific to the entity. The generated queries are similar to VA user queries, and are specific enough to retrieve the relevant entity. We conclude that queries generated by LLMs and templates are complementary.</description>

      <title>TIM: Temporal Interaction Model in Notification System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern mobile applications heavily rely on the notification system to acquire daily active users and enhance user engagement. Being able to proactively reach users, the system has to decide when to send notifications to users. Although many researchers have studied optimizing the timing of sending notifications, they only utilized users' contextual features, without modeling users' behavior patterns. Additionally, these efforts only focus on individual notifications, and there is a lack of studies on optimizing the holistic timing of multiple notifications within a period. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Temporal Interaction Model (TIM), which models users' behavior patterns by estimating CTR in every time slot over a day in our short video application Kuaishou. TIM leverages long-term user historical interaction sequence features such as notification receipts, clicks, watch time and effective views, and employs a temporal attention unit (TAU) to extract user behavior patterns. Moreover, we provide an elegant strategy of holistic notifications send time control to improve user engagement while minimizing disruption. We evaluate the effectiveness of TIM through offline experiments and online A/B tests. The results indicate that TIM is a reliable tool for forecasting user behavior, leading to a remarkable enhancement in user engagement without causing undue disturbance.</description>

      <title>Grapevine Disease Prediction Using Climate Variables from Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Imagery via a Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection and management of grapevine diseases are important in pursuing sustainable viticulture. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging the TabPFN model to forecast blockwise grapevine diseases using climate variables from multi-sensor remote sensing imagery. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques with detailed environmental data, our approach significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of disease prediction in vineyards. The TabPFN model's experimental evaluations showcase comparable performance to traditional gradient-boosted decision trees, such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM. The model's capability to process complex data and provide per-pixel disease-affecting probabilities enables precise, targeted interventions, contributing to more sustainable disease management practices. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of combining Transformer models with remote sensing data in precision agriculture, offering a scalable solution for improving crop health and productivity while reducing environmental impact.</description>

      <title>Guiding Catalogue Enrichment with User Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Techniques for knowledge graph (KGs) enrichment have been increasingly crucial for commercial applications that rely on evolving product catalogues. However, because of the huge search space of potential enrichment, predictions from KG completion (KGC) methods suffer from low precision, making them unreliable for real-world catalogues. Moreover, candidate facts for enrichment have varied relevance to users. While making correct predictions for incomplete triplets in KGs has been the main focus of KGC method, the relevance of when to apply such predictions has been neglected. Motivated by the product search use case, we address the angle of generating relevant completion for a catalogue using user search behaviour and the users property association with a product. In this paper, we present our intuition for identifying enrichable data points and use general-purpose KGs to show-case the performance benefits. In particular, we extract entity-predicate pairs from user queries, which are more likely to be correct and relevant, and use these pairs to guide the prediction of KGC methods. We assess our method on two popular encyclopedia KGs, DBPedia and YAGO 4. Our results from both automatic and human evaluations show that query guidance can significantly improve the correctness and relevance of prediction.</description>

      <title>The Treatment of Ties in Rank-Biased Overlap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) is a similarity measure for indefinite rankings: it is top-weighted, and can be computed when only a prefix of the rankings is known or when they have only some items in common. It is widely used for instance to analyze differences between search engines by comparing the rankings of documents they retrieve for the same queries. In these situations, though, it is very frequent to find tied documents that have the same score. Unfortunately, the treatment of ties in RBO remains superficial and incomplete, in the sense that it is not clear how to calculate it from the ranking prefixes only. In addition, the existing way of dealing with ties is very different from the one traditionally followed in the field of Statistics, most notably found in rank correlation coefficients such as Kendall's and Spearman's. In this paper we propose a generalized formulation for RBO to handle ties, thanks to which we complete the original definitions by showing how to perform prefix evaluation. We also use it to fully develop two variants that align with the ones found in the Statistics literature: one when there is a reference ranking to compare to, and one when there is not. Overall, these three variants provide researchers with flexibility when comparing rankings with RBO, by clearly determining what ties mean, and how they should be treated. Finally, using both synthetic and TREC data, we demonstrate the use of these new tie-aware RBO measures. We show that the scores may differ substantially from the original tie-unaware RBO measure, where ties had to be broken at random or by arbitrary criteria such as by document ID. Overall, these results evidence the need for a proper account of ties in rank similarity measures such as RBO.</description>

      <title>Progressive Query Expansion for Retrieval Over Cost-constrained Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query expansion has been employed for a long time to improve the accuracy of query retrievers. Earlier works relied on pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) techniques, which augment a query with terms extracted from documents retrieved in a first stage. However, the documents may be noisy hindering the effectiveness of the ranking. To avoid this, recent studies have instead used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate additional content to expand a query. These techniques are prone to hallucination and also focus on the LLM usage cost. However, the cost may be dominated by the retrieval in several important practical scenarios, where the corpus is only available via APIs which charge a fee per retrieved document. We propose combining classic PRF techniques with LLMs and create a progressive query expansion algorithm ProQE that iteratively expands the query as it retrieves more documents. ProQE is compatible with both sparse and dense retrieval systems. Our experimental results on four retrieval datasets show that ProQE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 37% and is the most cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Exploring Large Language Models for Relevance Judgments in Tetun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cranfield paradigm has served as a foundational approach for developing test collections, with relevance judgments typically conducted by human assessors. However, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new possibilities for automating these tasks. This paper explores the feasibility of using LLMs to automate relevance assessments, particularly within the context of low-resource languages. In our study, LLMs are employed to automate relevance judgment tasks, by providing a series of query-document pairs in Tetun as the input text. The models are tasked with assigning relevance scores to each pair, where these scores are then compared to those from human annotators to evaluate the inter-annotator agreement levels. Our investigation reveals results that align closely with those reported in studies of high-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Fetch-A-Set: A Large-Scale OCR-Free Benchmark for Historical Document Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Fetch-A-Set (FAS), a comprehensive benchmark tailored for legislative historical document analysis systems, addressing the challenges of large-scale document retrieval in historical contexts. The benchmark comprises a vast repository of documents dating back to the XVII century, serving both as a training resource and an evaluation benchmark for retrieval systems. It fills a critical gap in the literature by focusing on complex extractive tasks within the domain of cultural heritage. The proposed benchmark tackles the multifaceted problem of historical document analysis, including text-to-image retrieval for queries and image-to-text topic extraction from document fragments, all while accommodating varying levels of document legibility. This benchmark aims to spur advancements in the field by providing baselines and data for the development and evaluation of robust historical document retrieval systems, particularly in scenarios characterized by wide historical spectrum.</description>

      <title>Text Information Retrieval in Tetun: A Preliminary Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tetun is one of Timor-Leste's official languages alongside Portuguese. It is a low-resource language with over 932,400 speakers that started developing when Timor-Leste restored its independence in 2002. The media mainly uses Tetun, and more than ten national online newspapers actively broadcast news in Tetun every day. However, since information retrieval-based solutions for Tetun do not exist, finding Tetun information on the internet is challenging. This work aims to investigate and develop solutions that can enable the application of information retrieval techniques to develop search solutions for Tetun. We present a preliminary result of an experiment conducted on the task of ad-hoc retrieval in Tetun.</description>

      <title>Graph Reasoning for Explainable Cold Start Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cold start problem, where new users or items have no interaction history, remains a critical challenge in recommender systems (RS). A common solution involves using Knowledge Graphs (KG) to train entity embeddings or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Since KGs incorporate auxiliary data and not just user/item interactions, these methods can make relevant recommendations for cold users or items. Graph Reasoning (GR) methods, however, find paths from users to items to recommend using relations in the KG and, in the context of RS, have been used for interpretability. In this study, we propose GRECS: a framework for adapting GR to cold start recommendations. By utilizing explicit paths starting for users rather than relying only on entity embeddings, GRECS can find items corresponding to users' preferences by navigating the graph, even when limited information about users is available. Our experiments show that GRECS mitigates the cold start problem and outperforms competitive baselines across 5 standard datasets while being explainable. This study highlights the potential of GR for developing explainable recommender systems better suited for managing cold users and items.</description>

      <title>Matryoshka Representation Learning for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representation learning is essential for deep-neural-network-based recommender systems to capture user preferences and item features within fixed-dimensional user and item vectors. Unlike existing representation learning methods that either treat each user preference and item feature uniformly or categorize them into discrete clusters, we argue that in the real world, user preferences and item features are naturally expressed and organized in a hierarchical manner, leading to a new direction for representation learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel matryoshka representation learning method for recommendation (MRL4Rec), by which we restructure user and item vectors into matryoshka representations with incrementally dimensional and overlapping vector spaces to explicitly represent user preferences and item features at different hierarchical levels. We theoretically establish that constructing training triplets specific to each level is pivotal in guaranteeing accurate matryoshka representation learning. Subsequently, we propose the matryoshka negative sampling mechanism to construct training triplets, which further ensures the effectiveness of the matryoshka representation learning in capturing hierarchical user preferences and item features. The experiments demonstrate that MRL4Rec can consistently and substantially outperform a number of state-of-the-art competitors on several real-life datasets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Riwei-HEU/MRL.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Enhanced Retrieval for Question Answering of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation has revolutionized large language model (LLM) outputs by providing factual supports. Nevertheless, it struggles to capture all the necessary knowledge for complex reasoning questions. Existing retrieval methods typically divide reference documents into passages, treating them in isolation. These passages, however, are often interrelated, such as passages that are contiguous or share the same keywords. Therefore, recognizing the relatedness is crucial for enhancing the retrieval process. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval method, called GNN-Ret, which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance retrieval by considering the relatedness between passages. Specifically, we first construct a graph of passages by connecting passages that are structure-related and keyword-related. A graph neural network (GNN) is then leveraged to exploit the relationships between passages and improve the retrieval of supporting passages. Furthermore, we extend our method to handle multi-hop reasoning questions using a recurrent graph neural network (RGNN), named RGNN-Ret. At each step, RGNN-Ret integrates the graphs of passages from previous steps, thereby enhancing the retrieval of supporting passages. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNN-Ret achieves higher accuracy for question answering with a single query of LLMs than strong baselines that require multiple queries, and RGNN-Ret further improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 10.4% accuracy improvement on the 2WikiMQA dataset.</description>

      <title>Anna Karenina Strikes Again: Pre-Trained LLM Embeddings May Favor High-Performing Learners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised clustering of student responses to open-ended questions into behavioral and cognitive profiles using pre-trained LLM embeddings is an emerging technique, but little is known about how well this captures pedagogically meaningful information. We investigate this in the context of student responses to open-ended questions in biology, which were previously analyzed and clustered by experts into theory-driven Knowledge Profiles (KPs). Comparing these KPs to ones discovered by purely data-driven clustering techniques, we report poor discoverability of most KPs, except for the ones including the correct answers. We trace this "discoverability bias" to the representations of KPs in the pre-trained LLM embeddings space.</description>

      <title>Harnessing AI for efficient analysis of complex policy documents: a case study of Executive Order 14110</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy documents, such as legislation, regulations, and executive orders, are crucial in shaping society. However, their length and complexity make interpretation and application challenging and time-consuming. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has the potential to automate the process of analyzing these documents, improving accuracy and efficiency. This study aims to evaluate the potential of AI in streamlining policy analysis and to identify the strengths and limitations of current AI approaches. The research focuses on question answering and tasks involving content extraction from policy documents. A case study was conducted using Executive Order 14110 on "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence" as a test case. Four commercial AI systems were used to analyze the document and answer a set of representative policy questions. The performance of the AI systems was compared to manual analysis conducted by human experts. The study found that two AI systems, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3 Opus, demonstrated significant potential for supporting policy analysis, providing accurate and reliable information extraction from complex documents. They performed comparably to human analysts but with significantly higher efficiency. However, achieving reproducibility remains a challenge, necessitating further research and development.</description>

      <title>Link Prediction in Bipartite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite networks serve as highly suitable models to represent systems involving interactions between two distinct types of entities, such as online dating platforms, job search services, or ecommerce websites. These models can be leveraged to tackle a number of tasks, including link prediction among the most useful ones, especially to design recommendation systems. However, if this task has garnered much interest when conducted on unipartite (i.e. standard) networks, it is far from being the case for bipartite ones. In this study, we address this gap by performing an experimental comparison of 19 link prediction methods able to handle bipartite graphs. Some come directly from the literature, and some are adapted by us from techniques originally designed for unipartite networks. We also propose to repurpose recommendation systems based on graph convolutional networks (GCN) as a novel link prediction solution for bipartite networks. To conduct our experiments, we constitute a benchmark of 3 real-world bipartite network datasets with various topologies. Our results indicate that GCN-based personalized recommendation systems, which have received significant attention in recent years, can produce successful results for link prediction in bipartite networks. Furthermore, purely heuristic metrics that do not rely on any learning process, like the Structural Perturbation Method (SPM), can also achieve success.</description>

Abstract: The performance of deep learning-based natural language processing systems is based on large amounts of labeled training data which, in the clinical domain, are not easily available or affordable. Weak supervision and in-context learning offer partial solutions to this issue, particularly using large language models (LLMs), but their performance still trails traditional supervised methods with moderate amounts of gold-standard data. In particular, inferencing with LLMs is computationally heavy. We propose an approach leveraging fine-tuning LLMs and weak supervision with virtually no domain knowledge that still achieves consistently dominant performance. Using a prompt-based approach, the LLM is used to generate weakly-labeled data for training a downstream BERT model. The weakly supervised model is then further fine-tuned on small amounts of gold standard data. We evaluate this approach using Llama2 on three different n2c2 datasets. With no more than 10 gold standard notes, our final BERT models weakly supervised by fine-tuned Llama2-13B consistently outperformed out-of-the-box PubMedBERT by 4.7% to 47.9% in F1 scores. With only 50 gold standard notes, our models achieved close performance to fully fine-tuned systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling the Vocabulary of Non-autoregressive Models for Efficient Generative Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Retrieval introduces a new approach to Information Retrieval by reframing it as a constrained generation task, leveraging recent advancements in Autoregressive (AR) language models. However, AR-based Generative Retrieval methods suffer from high inference latency and cost compared to traditional dense retrieval techniques, limiting their practical applicability. This paper investigates fully Non-autoregressive (NAR) language models as a more efficient alternative for generative retrieval. While standard NAR models alleviate latency and cost concerns, they exhibit a significant drop in retrieval performance (compared to AR models) due to their inability to capture dependencies between target tokens. To address this, we question the conventional choice of limiting the target token space to solely words or sub-words. We propose PIXAR, a novel approach that expands the target vocabulary of NAR models to include multi-word entities and common phrases (up to 5 million tokens), thereby reducing token dependencies. PIXAR employs inference optimization strategies to maintain low inference latency despite the significantly larger vocabulary. Our results demonstrate that PIXAR achieves a relative improvement of 31.0% in MRR@10 on MS MARCO and 23.2% in Hits@5 on Natural Questions compared to standard NAR models with similar latency and cost. Furthermore, online A/B experiments on a large commercial search engine show that PIXAR increases ad clicks by 5.08% and revenue by 4.02%.</description>

      <title>Non-autoregressive Personalized Bundle Generation</title>

Abstract: The personalized bundle generation problem, which aims to create a preferred bundle for user from numerous candidate items, receives increasing attention in recommendation. However, existing works ignore the order-invariant nature of the bundle and adopt sequential modeling methods as the solution, which might introduce inductive bias and cause a large latency in prediction. To address this problem, we propose to perform the bundle generation via non-autoregressive mechanism and design a novel encoder-decoder framework named BundleNAT, which can effectively output the targeted bundle in one-shot without relying on any inherent order. In detail, instead of learning sequential dependency, we propose to adopt pre-training techniques and graph neural network to fully embed user-based preference and item-based compatibility information, and use a self-attention based encoder to further extract global dependency pattern. We then design a permutation-equivariant decoding architecture that is able to directly output the desired bundle in a one-shot manner. Experiments on three real-world datasets from Youshu and Netease show the proposed BundleNAT significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in average by up to 35.92%, 10.97% and 23.67% absolute improvements in Precision, Precision+, and Recall, respectively.</description>

      <title>ElasticRec: A Microservice-based Model Serving Architecture Enabling Elastic Resource Scaling for Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing popularity of recommendation systems (RecSys), the demand for compute resources in datacenters has surged. However, the model-wise resource allocation employed in current RecSys model serving architectures falls short in effectively utilizing resources, leading to sub-optimal total cost of ownership. We propose ElasticRec, a model serving architecture for RecSys providing resource elasticity and high memory efficiency. ElasticRec is based on a microservice-based software architecture for fine-grained resource allocation, tailored to the heterogeneous resource demands of RecSys. Additionally, ElasticRec achieves high memory efficiency via our utility-based resource allocation. Overall, ElasticRec achieves an average 3.3x reduction in memory allocation size and 8.1x increase in memory utility, resulting in an average 1.6x reduction in deployment cost compared to state-of-the-art RecSys inference serving system.</description>

      <title>EEG-ImageNet: An Electroencephalogram Dataset and Benchmarks with Image Visual Stimuli of Multi-Granularity Labels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and reconstructing what we see from brain activity gives us a special insight into investigating how the biological visual system represents the world. While recent efforts have achieved high-performance image classification and high-quality image reconstruction from brain signals collected by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG), the expensiveness and bulkiness of these devices make relevant applications difficult to generalize to practical applications. On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease of use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has not been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce EEG-ImageNet, a novel EEG dataset comprising recordings from 16 subjects exposed to 4000 images selected from the ImageNet dataset. EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than existing similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object classification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%. These results demonstrate the dataset's potential to advance EEG-based visual brain-computer interfaces, understand the visual perception of biological systems, and provide potential applications in improving machine visual models.</description>

Abstract: In this demonstration, we present Country Guesser, a live system that guesses the country that a photo is taken in. In particular, given a Google Street View image, our federated ranking model uses a combination of computer vision, machine learning and text retrieval methods to compute a ranking of likely countries of the location shown in a given image from Street View. Interestingly, using text-based features to probe large pre-trained language models can assist to provide cross-modal supervision. We are not aware of previous country guessing systems informed by visual and textual features.</description>

      <title>SciMMIR: Benchmarking Scientific Multi-modal Information Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) is a rapidly evolving field, where significant progress, particularly in image-text pairing, has been made through advanced representation learning and cross-modality alignment research. However, current benchmarks for evaluating MMIR performance in image-text pairing within the scientific domain show a notable gap, where chart and table images described in scholarly language usually do not play a significant role. To bridge this gap, we develop a specialised scientific MMIR (SciMMIR) benchmark by leveraging open-access paper collections to extract data relevant to the scientific domain. This benchmark comprises 530K meticulously curated image-text pairs, extracted from figures and tables with detailed captions in scientific documents. We further annotate the image-text pairs with two-level subset-subcategory hierarchy annotations to facilitate a more comprehensive evaluation of the baselines. We conducted zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations on prominent multi-modal image-captioning and visual language models, such as CLIP and BLIP. Our analysis offers critical insights for MMIR in the scientific domain, including the impact of pre-training and fine-tuning settings and the influence of the visual and textual encoders. All our data and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/Wusiwei0410/SciMMIR.</description>

      <title>Unified Low-rank Compression Framework for Click-through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction models play an important role in modern industrial recommendation scenarios. However, high memory overhead and computational costs limit their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Low-rank approximation is an effective method for computer vision and natural language processing models, but its application in compressing CTR prediction models has been less explored. Due to the limited memory and computing resources, compression of CTR prediction models often confronts three fundamental challenges, i.e., (1). How to reduce the model sizes to adapt to edge devices? (2). How to speed up CTR prediction model inference? (3). How to retain the capabilities of original models after compression? Previous low-rank compression research mostly uses tensor decomposition, which can achieve a high parameter compression ratio, but brings in AUC degradation and additional computing overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a unified low-rank decomposition framework for compressing CTR prediction models. We find that even with the most classic matrix decomposition SVD method, our framework can achieve better performance than the original model. To further improve the effectiveness of our framework, we locally compress the output features instead of compressing the model weights. Our unified low-rank compression framework can be applied to embedding tables and MLP layers in various CTR prediction models. Extensive experiments on two academic datasets and one real industrial benchmark demonstrate that, with 3-5x model size reduction, our compressed models can achieve both faster inference and higher AUC than the uncompressed original models.

      <title>Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast for Mitigating Popularity Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) typically suffers from the significant challenge of popularity bias due to the uneven distribution of items in real-world datasets. This bias leads to a significant accuracy gap between popular and unpopular items. It not only hinders accurate user preference understanding but also exacerbates the Matthew effect in recommendation systems. To alleviate popularity bias, existing efforts focus on emphasizing unpopular items or separating the correlation between item representations and their popularity. Despite the effectiveness, existing works still face two persistent challenges: (1) how to extract common supervision signals from popular items to improve the unpopular item representations, and (2) how to alleviate the representation separation caused by popularity bias. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of popularity bias and propose Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast (PAAC) to address two challenges. Specifically, we use the common supervisory signals modeled in popular item representations and propose a novel popularity-aware supervised alignment module to learn unpopular item representations. Additionally, we suggest re-weighting the contrastive learning loss to mitigate the representation separation from a popularity-centric perspective. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and rationale of PAAC in mitigating popularity bias through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/miaomiao-cai2/KDD2024-PAAC.</description>

      <title>TeraHAC: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering of Trillion-Edge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce TeraHAC, a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm which scales to trillion-edge graphs. Our algorithm is based on a new approach to computing $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate HAC, which is a novel combination of the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm and the notion of $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate HAC. Our approach allows us to partition the graph among multiple machines and make significant progress in computing the clustering within each partition before any communication with other partitions is needed.
  We evaluate TeraHAC on a number of real-world and synthetic graphs of up to 8 trillion edges. We show that TeraHAC requires over 100x fewer rounds compared to previously known approaches for computing HAC. It is up to 8.3x faster than SCC, the state-of-the-art distributed algorithm for hierarchical clustering, while achieving 1.16x higher quality. In fact, TeraHAC essentially retains the quality of the celebrated HAC algorithm while significantly improving the running time.</description>

      <title>LLaMA-E: Empowering E-commerce Authoring with Object-Interleaved Instruction Following</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: E-commerce authoring entails creating engaging, diverse, and targeted content to enhance preference elicitation and retrieval experience. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content generation, they often fall short in e-commerce applications due to their limited memorization of domain-specific features. This paper proposes LLaMA-E, the unified e-commerce authoring models that address the contextual preferences of customers, sellers, and platforms, the essential objects in e-commerce operation. We design the instruction set derived from tasks of ads generation, query-enhanced product title rewriting, product classification, purchase intent speculation, and general e-commerce Q&amp;A. The instruction formulation ensures the interleaved cover of the presented and required object features, allowing the alignment of base models to parameterise e-commerce knowledge comprehensively. The proposed LLaMA-E models achieve state-of-the-art evaluation performance and exhibit the advantage in zero-shot practical applications. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM tailored to empower authoring applications with comprehensive scenario understanding by integrating features focused on participated objects.</description>

      <title>Block-Diagonal Orthogonal Relation and Matrix Entity for Knowledge Graph Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary aim of Knowledge Graph embeddings (KGE) is to learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations for predicting missing facts. While rotation-based methods like RotatE and QuatE perform well in KGE, they face two challenges: limited model flexibility requiring proportional increases in relation size with entity dimension, and difficulties in generalizing the model for higher-dimensional rotations. To address these issues, we introduce OrthogonalE, a novel KGE model employing matrices for entities and block-diagonal orthogonal matrices with Riemannian optimization for relations. This approach enhances the generality and flexibility of KGE models. The experimental results indicate that our new KGE model, OrthogonalE, is both general and flexible, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art KGE models while substantially reducing the number of relation parameters.</description>
