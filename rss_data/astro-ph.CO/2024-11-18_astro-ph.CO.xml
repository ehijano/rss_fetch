      <title>Gas thermodynamics meets galaxy kinematics: Joint mass measurements for eROSITA galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass of galaxy clusters is a critical quantity for probing cluster cosmology and testing theories of gravity, but its measurement could be biased given assumptions are inevitable. In this paper, we employ and compare two mass proxies for galaxy clusters: thermodynamics of the intracluster medium and kinematics of member galaxies. We select 22 galaxy clusters from the cluster catalog in the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) that have sufficient optical and near-infrared observations. We generate multi-band images in the energy range of (0.3, 7) keV for each cluster, and derive their temperature profiles, gas mass profiles and hydrostatic mass profiles using a parametric approach that does not assume dark matter halo models. With spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies collected from multiple surveys, we numerically solve the spherical Jeans equation for their dynamical mass profiles. Our results quantify the correlation between dynamical mass and line-of-sight velocity dispersion with an rms scatter of 0.14 dex. We find the two mass proxies lead to roughly the same total mass, with no observed systematic bias. As such, the $\sigma_8$ tension is not specific to hydrostatic mass or weak lensing shears, but also appears with galaxy kinematics. We also compare our hydrostatic masses with the latest weak lensing masses inferred with scaling relations. The comparison shows the weak lensing mass is significantly higher than our hydrostatic mass by $\sim$110%. This might explain the significantly larger value of $\sigma_8$ from the latest measurement using eRASS1 clusters than almost all previous estimates in the literature. Finally, we test the radial acceleration relation (RAR) established in disk galaxies. We confirm the missing baryon problem in the inner region of galaxy clusters using three independent mass proxies for the first time.</description>

      <title>Primordial blackhole formation: Exploring chaotic potential with a sharp step via the GLMS perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sharp step on a chaotic potential can enhance primordial curvature fluctuations on smaller scales to the $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ to form primordial black holes (PBHs). The present study discusses an inflationary potential with a sharp step that results in the formation of PBHs in four distinct mass ranges. Also this inflationary model allows the separate consideration of observable parameters $n_s$ and $r$ on the CMB scale from the physics at small scales, where PBHs formation occur. In this work we computed the fractional abundance of PBHs ($f_{PBH}$) using the GLMS approximation of peak theory and also the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. In the two typical mass windows, $10^{-13}M_\odot$ and $10^{-11}M_\odot$, $f_{PBH}$ calculated using the GLMS approximation is nearly equal to 1 and that calculated via PS is of $10^{-3}$. In the other two mass windows $1M_\odot$ and $6M_\odot$, $f_{PBH}$ obtained using GLMS approximation is 0.01 and 0.001 respectively, while $f_{PBH}$ calculated via PS formalism yields $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-6}$. The results obtained via GLMS approximation are found to be consistent with observational constraints. A comparative analysis of $f_{PBH}$ obtained using the GLMS perspective and the PS formalism is also included.</description>

      <title>Modeling beam chromaticity for high-resolution CMB analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of beam chromaticity, i.e., the frequency dependence of the beam window function, on cosmological and astrophysical parameter constraints from CMB power spectrum observations. We show that for future high-resolution CMB measurements it is necessary to include a color-corrected beam for each sky component with a distinct spectral energy distribution. We introduce a formalism able to easily implement the beam chromaticity in CMB power spectrum likelihood analyses and run a case study using a Simons Observatory (SO) Large Aperture Telescope-like experimental setup and within the public SO software stack. To quantify the impact, we assume that beam chromaticity is present in simulated spectra but omitted in the likelihood analysis. We find that, for passbands of fractional width $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 0.2$, neglecting this effect leads to significant biases, with astrophysical foreground parameters shifting by more than $2\sigma$ and cosmological parameters by significant fractions of the error.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Gasoline: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxy formation with Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first set of high-resolution, hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of galaxy formation in a Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) framework. These simulations were performed with a new version of the GASOLINE2 code, known as FUZZY-GASOLINE, which can simulate quantum FDM effects alongside a comprehensive baryonic model that includes metal cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and black hole physics, previously used in the NIHAO simulation suite. Using thirty zoom-in simulations of galaxies with halo masses in the range $10^9 \lesssim M_{\text{halo}}/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{11}$, we explore how the interplay between FDM quantum potential and baryonic processes influences dark matter distributions and observable galaxy properties. Our findings indicate that both baryons and low-mass FDM contribute to core formation within dark matter profiles, though through distinct mechanisms: FDM-induced cores emerge in all haloes, particularly within low-mass systems at high redshift, while baryon-driven cores form within a specific mass range and at low redshift. Despite these significant differences in dark matter structure, key stellar observables such as star formation histories and velocity dispersion profiles remain remarkably similar to predictions from the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model, making it challenging to distinguish between CDM and FDM solely through stellar observations.</description>

      <title>Thermo-Coupled Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early dark energy solutions to the Hubble tension introduce an additional scalar field which is frozen at early times but becomes dynamical around matter-radiation equality. In order to alleviate the tension, the scalar's share of the total energy density must rapidly shrink from $\sim 10\%$ at the onset of matter domination to $\ll 1\%$ by recombination. This typically requires a steep potential that is imposed $\textit{ad hoc}$ rather than emerging from a concrete particle physics model. Here, we point out an alternative possibility: a homogeneous scalar field coupled quadratically to a cosmological background of light thermal relics (such as the Standard Model neutrino) will acquire an effective potential which can reproduce the dynamics necessary to alleviate the tension. We identify the relevant parameter space for this "thermo-coupled" scenario and study its unique phenomenology at the background level, including the back-reaction on the neutrino mass. Follow-up numerical work is necessary to determine the constraints placed on the model by early-time measurements.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Early Universe Cosmology on Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of gravitational waves (GWs) to probe the pre-BBN era of the early universe, focusing on the effects of energy injection. Specifically, we examine a hidden sector alongside the Standard Model that undergoes a strong first-order phase transition (FOPT), producing a GW signal. Once the phase transition has completed, energy injection initiates reheating in the hidden sector, which positions the hidden sector field so that additional phase transitions can occur. This can result in a total of three distinct phase transitions with a unique three-peak GW spectrum. Among these transitions, the first and third are of the standard type, while the intermediate second transition is inverted, moving from a broken to an unbroken phase. Using polynomial potentials as a framework, we derive analytical relations among the phase transition parameters and the resulting GW spectrum. Our results indicate that the second and third transitions generate GWs with higher amplitudes than the first, with a peak frequency ratio differing by up to an order of magnitude. This three-peak GW spectrum is detectable by upcoming facilities such as LISA, BBO, and UDECIGO. Notably, the phenomenon is robust across various potentials and model parameters, suggesting that hidden sector GWs provide a powerful tool for exploring new physics scenarios in the pre-BBN era.</description>

      <title>The Neutrino Mass Bound from Leptogenesis Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit unflavoured leptogenesis in the seesaw model applying recent improvements in the computation of $CP$-conserving and $CP$-violating equilibration rates. These are relevant for the relativistic regime of the sterile Majorana fermions and the dynamics of the Standard Model particles acting as spectator processes. In order to probe the regime of large (${\cal O}(10^2)$) washout parameters, we add $\Delta L = 2$ washout processes, which we derive in the CTP-formalism. We then perform a parameter scan of the final baryon asymmetry and find a constraint $m_{\text{lightest}} \lesssim 0.15 \, \rm eV$ on the absolute neutrino mass scale, which is slightly less stringent than previously reported bounds obtained without the aforementioned improvements. The relaxation of the bounds is mainly due to partially equilibrated spectator fields, which protect part of the asymmetry from washout and lead to larger final asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Two-Component Boosted Dark Matter in Directional Detector Mediated By Dark Photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores a two-component dark matter model in which one component, heavier dark matter, annihilates into a lighter dark matter. The lighter dark matter is expected to generate detectable signals in detectors due to its enhanced momentum, enabling direct detection even for MeV-scale dark matter. We investigate the effectiveness of directional direct detections, especially the nuclear emulsion detector NEWSdm, in verifying these boosted dark matter particles through nuclear recoil. In particular, we focus on light nuclei, such as protons and carbon, as suitable targets for this detection method due to their high sensitivity to MeV-scale dark matter. By modeling the interactions mediated by a dark photon in a hidden U(1)$_D$ gauge symmetry framework, we calculate the expected dark matter flux and scattering rates for various detector configurations. Our results show that nuclear emulsions have the potential to yield distinct, direction-sensitive dark matter signals from the Galactic center, providing a new way to probe low-mass dark matter parameter spaces that evade conventional detection methods.</description>

      <title>On the dark matter origin of an LDMX signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fixed target experiments where beam electrons are focused upon a thin target have shown great potential for probing new physics, including the sub-GeV dark matter (DM) paradigm. However, a signal in future experiments such as the light dark matter experiment (LDMX) would require an independent validation to assert its DM origin. To this end, we propose to combine LDMX and next generation DM direct detection (DD) data in a four-step analysis strategy, which we here illustrate with Monte Carlo simulations. In the first step, the hypothetical LDMX signal (i.e. an excess in the final state electron energy and transverse momentum distributions) is $\textit{recorded}$. In the second step, a DM DD experiment operates with increasing exposure to test the DM origin of the LDMX signal. Here, LDMX and DD data are simulated. In the third step, a posterior probability density function (pdf) for the DM model parameters is extracted from the DD data, and used to $\textit{predict}$ the electron recoil energy and transverse momentum distributions at LDMX. In the last step, $\textit{predicted}$ and $\textit{recorded}$ electron recoil energy and transverse momentum distributions are compared in a chi-square test. We present the results of this comparison in terms of a threshold exposure that a DD experiment has to operate with to assert whether $\textit{predicted}$ and $\textit{recorded}$ distributions $\textit{can}$ be statistically dependent. We find that this threshold exposure grows with the DM particle mass, $m_\chi$. It varies from 0.012 kg-year for a DM mass of $m_\chi=4$ MeV to 1 kg-year for $m_\chi=25$ MeV, which is or will soon be within reach.</description>

      <title>Two-loop corrections in power spectrum in models of inflation with PBHs formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the two-loop corrections in curvature perturbation power spectrum in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase employed for PBHs formation. Among the total eleven one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams, we calculate the corrections from the ``double scoop" two-loop diagram involving two vertices of quartic Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that the fractional two-loop correction in power spectrum scales like the square of the fractional one-loop correction. We confirm our previous findings that the loop corrections become arbitrarily large when the transition from the USR phase to the final attractor phase is very sharp. This suggests that in order for the analysis to be under perturbative control against the loop corrections, one requires a mild transition with a long enough relaxation period towards the final attractor phase.</description>

      <title>Numerical gravitational backreaction on cosmic string loops from simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the results of performing computational gravitational backreaction on cosmic string loops taken from a network simulation. The principal effect of backreaction is to smooth out small-scale structure on loops, which we demonstrate by various measures including the average loop power spectrum and the distribution of kink angles on the loops. Backreaction does lead to self-intersections in most cases, but these are typically small. An important effect discussed in prior work is the rounding off of kinks to form cusps, but we find that the cusps produced by that process are very weak and do not significantly contribute to the total gravitational-wave radiation of the loop. We comment briefly on extrapolating our results to loops as they would be found in nature.</description>

      <title>Simulating the LOcal Web (SLOW) -- III: Synchrotron emission from the local cosmic web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims: Detecting diffuse synchrotron emission from the cosmic web is still a challenge for current radio telescopes. We aim to make predictions about the detectability of cosmic web filaments from simulations. Methods: We present the first cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a 500 $h^{-1} c$Mpc volume with an on-the-fly spectral cosmic ray (CR) model. This allows us to follow the evolution of populations of CR electrons and protons within every resolution element of the simulation. We modeled CR injection at shocks, while accounting for adiabatic changes to the CR population and high-energy-loss processes of electrons. The synchrotron emission was then calculated from the aged electron population, using the simulated magnetic field, as well as different models for the origin and amplification of magnetic fields. We used constrained initial conditions, which closely resemble the local Universe, and compared the results of the cosmological volume to a zoom-in simulation of the Coma cluster, to study the impact of resolution and turbulent reacceleration of CRs on the results. Results: We find a consistent injection of CRs at accretion shocks onto cosmic web filaments and galaxy clusters. This leads to diffuse emission from filaments of the order $S_\nu \approx 0.1 \: \mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ for a potential LOFAR observation at 144~MHz, when assuming the most optimistic magnetic field model. The flux can be increased by up to two orders of magnitude for different choices of CR injection parameters. This can bring the flux within a factor of ten of the current limits for direct detection. We find a spectral index of the simulated synchrotron emission from filaments of $\alpha \approx$ -1.0 -- -1.5 in the LOFAR band.</description>

      <title>Radiative transfer of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons at cosmic dawn with realistic gas physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lyman-$\alpha$ photons enable the cosmic dawn 21-cm signal through a process called the Wouthuysen-Field effect. An accurate model of the signal in this epoch hinges on the accuracy of the computation of the Ly$\alpha$ coupling, which requires one to calculate the specific intensity of Ly$\alpha$ photons emitted from the first stars. Most traditional calculations of the Ly$\alpha$ coupling assume a delta-function scattering cross-section, as the resonant nature of the Ly$\alpha$ scattering makes an accurate radiative transfer (RT) solution computationally expensive. Attempts to improve upon this traditional approach using numerical RT have recently emerged. However, some of these treatments suffer from assumptions such as a uniform gas distribution, coherent scattering in the gas frame and isotropic scattering. While others which do not account for these only do so through certain schemes along with core-skipping algorithms. We present results from a self-consistent Monte Carlo RT simulations devoid of any of the assumptions in the previous work for the first time. We find that gas bulk motion is the most important effect to account for in RT resulting in an RMS difference of 38% in the 21-cm signal and anisotropic scattering being the least important effect contributing to less than 3% RMS difference in 21-cm signal. We also evaluate the 21-cm power spectrum and compare that with the traditional results at cosmic dawn. This work points the way towards higher-accuracy models to enable better inferences from future measurements.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Recombination in the Presence of Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>

Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) may explain observations of magnetic fields on extragalactic scales. They are most cleanly constrained by measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) anisotropies. Their effects on cosmic recombination may even be at the heart of the resolution of the Hubble tension. We present the most detailed analysis of the effects of PMFs on cosmic recombination to date. To this end we extend the public magneto-hydrodynamic code {\sl ENZO} with a new cosmic recombination routine, Monte-Carlo simulations of Lyman-$\alpha$ photon transport, and a Compton drag term in the baryon momentum equation. The resulting code allows us, for the first time, to realistically predict the impact of PMFs on the cosmic ionization history and the clumping of baryons during cosmic recombination. Our results identify the importance of mixing of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons between overdense- and underdense- regions for small PMF strength. This mixing speeds up recombination beyond the speed-up due to clumping. We also investigate the effects of pecuilar flows on the recombination rate and find it to be small for small PMF strengths. For non-helical PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum we find a surprising dependency of results on ultra-violet magnetic modes. We further show that the increase in the ionization fraction at low redshift by hydrodynamic baryon heating due to PMF dissipation is completely compensated by the faster recombination from baryon clumping. The present study shall serve as a theoretical foundation for a future precise comparison of recombination with PMFs to CMB data.</description>

      <title>Hybrid inflation and gravitational waves from accidentally light scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a hybrid-inflation model where the inflaton potential is generated radiatively, as gauge symmetries guarantee it to be accidentally flat at tree level. The model can be regarded as a small-field version of Natural Inflation, with inflation ending when the mass of a second scalar, the waterfall field, turns tachyonic. This provides a minimal, robust realization of hybrid inflation, which predicts specific correlations among Cosmic Microwave Background observables. Tachyonic preheating leads to the production of gravitational waves which, for a low inflationary scale, might be detected by upcoming experiments. Simple variations of the model can give rise to topological defects, such as unstable domain walls. Their dynamics produces a stochastic gravitational wave background, which can be compatible with the recent detection by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Consistent Theories for the DESI dark energy fit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for physically consistent realizations of evolving dark energy suggested by the cosmological fit of DESI, Planck and Supernovae data. First we note that any lagrangian description of the standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w$, allows for the addition of a cosmological constant. We perform the cosmological fit finding new regions of parameter space that however continue to favour dark energy with $w&lt;-1$ at early times, that is challenging to realize in consistent theories. Next, in the spirit of effective field theories, we consider the effect of higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the equation of state of dark energy around the present epoch. We find that non-linear corrections of the equation of state are weakly constrained, thus opening the way to scenarios that differ from CPL at early times, possibly with $w&gt;-1$ at all times. We present indeed scenarios where evolving dark energy can be realized through quintessence models. We introduce in particular the ramp model where dark energy coincides with CPL at late times and approximates to a cosmological constant at early times. The latter model provides a much better fit than $\Lambda$CDM, and only slightly worse than $w_0w_a$CDM, but with the notable advantage of being described by a simple and theoretically consistent lagrangian of a canonical quintessence model.</description>

Abstract: The chameleon screening mechanism has been constrained many a time using dynamic and kinematic galaxy cluster observables. Current constraints are, however, insensitive to different mass components within galaxy clusters and have been mainly focused on a single mass density profile, the Navarro-Frenk-While mass density model. In this work, we extend the study of the Chameleon screening mechanism in galaxy clusters by considering a series of mass density models, namely: generalized-Navarro-Frenk-While, b-Navarro-Frenk-While, Burket, Isothermal and Einasto. The coupling strength ($\beta$) and asymptotic value of the chameleon field ($\phi_\infty$) are constrained by using kinematics analyses of simulated galaxy clusters, generated both assuming General Relativity and a strong chameleon scenario. By implementing a Bayesian analysis we comprehensively show that the biases introduced due to an incorrect assumption of the mass model are minimal. Similarly, we also demonstrate that a spurious detection of evidence for modifications to gravity is highly unlikely when utilizing the kinematics of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Quintessential early dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a unified model of early and late dark energy. We call it {\it quintessential early dark energy} model in which early and late dark energy are explained by a single scalar field. In other words two different energy scales are related by a single scalar field potential. To achieve this we introduce the modified steep exponential potential. This potential has a hilltop nature during the early time which consists of a flat region followed by a steep region. This nature of the potential plays a crucial role in achieving early dark energy solution. During recent time, the potential can almost mimic the cosmological constant which can result into late time acceleration. But, at the perturbation level the potential shows significant difference with the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also constrain and compare the models for steep exponential, modified steep exponential, axionlike and power law potentials by using the available background cosmological data from CMB, BAO (including DESI DR1 2024), supernovae (Pantheon$+$, DESY5 and Union3) and Hubble parameter measurements. Even after the presence of required EDE solution in all four potentials we don't get any significant improvement in the value of $H_0$. The maximum improvement we get in the present value of Hubble parameter compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is for the axionlike potential. For other potentials the constraints are similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also see that the data prefers $\Lambda$CDM model over the considered scalar field models at least for the data combinations with Pantheon$+$ and Union3.</description>

      <title>Composite running vacuum in the Universe: implications on the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility that the vacuum energy density (VED) could be time dependent in the expanding Universe is intuitively more reasonable than just a rigid cosmological constant for the entire cosmic history. The framework of the running vacuum model (RVM) is a salient example derived from QFT in curved spacetime, wherein the VED appears as a power series of the Hubble rate, $H(t)$, and its derivatives. The RVM contributes to alleviate the cosmological tensions and at a more fundamental level it also helps to smooth out certain hardcore aspects of the cosmological constant problem. Composite dark energy (DE) extensions of the RVM are possible, in which the DE is a mixed fluid made out of running vacuum and an entity X called ``phantom matter'' which, I should stress, is radically different from phantom DE, since the former produces positive pressure like ordinary matter (therein its name). The prototype is the old $\Lambda$XCDM model from 2006. Recently a simplified version of the latter, called the $w$XCDM, has proven capable to yield a truly outstanding fit to the cosmological data with dramatic implications for mitigating the cosmological tensions. The analysis is sensitive to the kind of BAO data used, transversal (2D) or anisotropic (3D). For both BAO types the overall fit quality is substantially better than for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, and the growth tension becomes alleviated. Nevertheless, only for 2D BAO the $H_0$-tension can be completely cut down. Most notably, this scenario favours (at $3.3\sigma$ c.l.) quintessence-like behavior around our time, as recently reported by the DESI Collaboration. In what follows I will summarize in very simple phenomenological terms the essentials of the RVM idea and its composite extensions, as well as the remarkable practical implications ensuing from such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as Standard Candles for Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, fast radio bursts (FRBs) have become a thriving field in astronomy and cosmology. Due to their extragalactic and cosmological origin, they are useful to study the cosmic expansion and the intergalactic medium (IGM). In the literature, the dispersion measure (DM) of FRB has been considered extensively. It could be used as an indirect proxy of the luminosity distance $d_L$ of FRB. The observed DM contains the contributions from the Milky Way (MW), the MW halo, IGM, and the host galaxy. Unfortunately, IGM and the host galaxy of FRB are poorly known to date, and hence the large uncertainties of $\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$ in DM plague the FRB cosmology. Could we avoid DM in studying cosmology? Could we instead consider the luminosity distance $d_L$ directly in the FRB cosmology? We are interested to find a way out for this problem in the present work. From the lessons of calibrating type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as standard candles, we consider a universal subclassification scheme for FRBs, and there are some empirical relations for them. In the present work, we propose to calibrate type Ib FRBs as standard candles by using a tight empirical relation without DM. The calibrated type Ib FRBs at high redshifts can be used like SNIa to constrain the cosmological models. We also test the key factors affecting the calibration and the cosmological constraints. Notice that the results are speculative, since they are based on simulations for the future (instead of now). We stress that the point in the present work is just to propose a viable method and a workable pipeline using type Ib FRBs as standard candles for cosmology in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a simple and efficient Python code to perform Bayesian forecasting for gravitational waves (GW) produced by Extreme-Mass-Ratio-Inspiral systems (EMRIs). The code runs on GPUs for an efficient parallelised computation of thousands of waveforms and sampling of the posterior through a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. EMRI_MC generates EMRI waveforms based on the so--called kludge scheme, and propagates it to the observer accounting for cosmological effects in the observed waveform due to modified gravity/dark energy. The code provides a helpful resource for forecasts for interferometry missions in the milli-Hz scale, e.g the satellite-mission LISA.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that a possible relationship between the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant $H_{0}$ and the universe's quantum complexity can be established in the context of a new proposal for quantum gravity, according to which spacetime must emerge from quantum correlations without correlata. Such a bridge between $H_{0}$ and the universe's complexity can represent an important step to understanding the Hubble tension by introducing a quantum gravity perspective for cosmological observations: regarding the degree of quantum complexity we measure around us.</description>

      <title>Cogenesis of baryon and dark matter with PBH and QCD axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With entropy injection, an early matter-dominated epoch (EMD) impels the axion decay constant $f_a$ towards larger values to produce correct axion dark matter (DM) abundance, thereby unfolding the low-mass axion ($m_a\lesssim 10^{-5}$ eV) parameter space to be searched for in axion experiments. We implement this proposition in a scenario where $f_a$ and the leptogenesis scale in a seesaw mechanism are equivalent. We show, that if instead, the EMD is provided by evaporating ultralight primordial black holes (PBH), the scenario becomes strikingly testable with gravitational waves (GW) background alongside the axion searches. In particular, while being consistent with correct axion DM abundance, the scale $f_a\gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV, corresponding to the unflavored regime of leptogenesis with hierarchical right-handed neutrinos, can be probed with GW and axion experiments, which is otherwise not testable at neutrino or collider experiments. Additionally, axions produced from PBH evaporation can give rise to dark radiation within reach of future cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Primordial power spectrum at N3LO in effective theories of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework to compute the primordial power spectrum up to next-to-next-to-next to leading order (N3LO) in the Hubble-flow parameters for a large class of effective theories of inflation. We assume that the quadratic action for perturbations is characterized by two functions of time, the kinetic amplitude and the speed of sound, that are independent of the Fourier mode $k$. Using the Green's function method introduced by Stewart and Gong and extended by Auclair and Ringeval, we determine the primordial power spectrum fully expanded around a pivot scale up to N3LO, starting from a given generic action for perturbations. As a check, we reproduce the state-of-the-art results for scalar and the tensor power spectra of the simplest "vanilla" models of single-field inflation. The framework applies to Weinberg's effective field theory of inflation (with the condition of no parity violation) and to the effective theory of spontaneous de Sitter-symmetry breaking. As a concrete application, we provide the expression for the N3LO power spectrum of $R+R^2$ Starobinsky inflation in metric variables. All expressions are provided in terms of an expansion in one single parameter, the number of inflationary e-foldings $N_\ast$. Surprisingly, we find that, compared to previous leading-order calculations, for $N_\ast = 55$ the N3LO correction results in a $7\%$ decrease of the predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio, in addition to a deviation from the consistency relation and a prediction of a negative running $\alpha_\mathrm{s}=-\frac{1}{2}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)^2+\ldots$ of the scalar tilt. These results provide precise theoretical predictions for the next generation of CMB observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of an early dark energy component (EDE) present during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) on the elemental abundances of deuterium D/H, and helium $Y_p$, as well as the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$. We consider a simple model of EDE that is constant up to a critical time. After this critical time, the EDE transitions into either a radiation component that interacts with the electromagnetic plasma, a dark radiation component that is uncoupled from the plasma, or kination that is also uncoupled. We use measured values of the abundances and $N_{\rm eff}$ as determined by CMB observations to establish limits on the input parameters of this EDE model. In addition, we explore how those parameters are correlated with BBN inputs; the baryon to photon ratio $\eta_b$, neutron lifetime $\tau_n$, and number of neutrinos $N_\nu$. Finally, we study whether this setup can alleviate the tension introduced by recent measurements of the primordial helium abundance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-Interacting Dark Matter models can successfully explain dark matter (DM) production through interactions confined within the dark sector. However, they often lack measurable experimental signals due to their secluded nature. Including a feeble interaction with the visible sector through a Higgs portal leads not only to potential detection avenues and richer thermal production dynamics, but also to a possible explanation of the initial dark sector population through the freeze-in mechanism. In this work we study, by solving the full system of coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities and temperatures of all the involved states, three scenarios of this type where the DM is: a real scalar with broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$, a complex scalar with unbroken $\mathbb{Z}_3$, and a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ scalar with an additional scalar mediator. All of these models have viable dark matter candidates in a cannibal phase while having different detection profiles. We show that cosmological bounds can be either exacerbated or evaded by changing the dark sector interactions, leading to potential signatures in long-lived particle and indirect detection experiments.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the minimal Nelson-Barr model for solving the strong CP problem through the idea of spontaneous CP breaking. The minimal model suffers from the quality problem, which means that the strong CP angle is generated by higher-dimensional operators and one-loop effects. Consequently, it has been considered that there is a cosmological domain wall problem and that leptogenesis does not work. We point out that just imposing an additional approximate global symmetry solves the quality problem. We also propose a simple solution to the domain wall problem and show that the thermal leptogenesis scenario works.</description>

      <title>Crescendo Beyond the Horizon: More Gravitational Waves from Domain Walls Bounded by Inflated Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) signals offer a unique window into the dynamics of the early universe. GWs may be generated by the topological defects produced in the early universe, which contain information on the symmetry of UV physics. We consider the case in which a two-step phase transition produces a network of domain walls bounded by cosmic strings. Specifically, we focus on the case in which there is a hierarchy in the symmetry-breaking scales, and a period of inflation pushes the cosmic string generated in the first phase transition outside the horizon before the second phase transition. We show that the GW signal from the evolution and collapse of this string-wall network has a unique spectrum, and the resulting signal strength can be sizeable. In particular, depending on the model parameters, the resulting signal can show up in a broad range of frequencies and can be discovered by a multitude of future probes, including the pulsar timing arrays and space- and ground-based GW observatories. As an example that naturally gives rise to this scenario, we present a model with the first phase transition followed by a brief period of thermal inflation driven by the field responsible for the second stage of symmetry breaking. The model can be embedded into a supersymmetric setup, which provides a natural realization of this scenario. In this case, the successful detection of the peak of the GW spectrum probes the soft supersymmetry breaking scale and the wall tension.</description>

      <title>Captured molecules could make a Bose star visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Bose star passing through cold molecular clouds may capture atoms, molecules and dust particles. The observational signature of such an event would be a relatively small amount of matter that is gravitationally bound. This binding may actually be provided by invisible dark matter forming the Bose star. We may expect a relative excess of heavier atoms, molecules, and solid dust compared to the content of giant cold molecular clouds since the velocity of heavy particles at a given temperature is lower and it may be small compared to the escape velocity, $v_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt{3k_\mathrm{B} T/m_\mathrm{gas}} \ll v_\mathrm{esc}=\sqrt{2GM/R}$. Finally, the velocity of this captured matter cloud may correlate with the expected velocity of free dark matter particles (e.g. expected axion wind velocity relative to Earth).</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional optimisation of the scanning strategy for the LiteBIRD space mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large angular scale surveys in the absence of atmosphere are essential for measuring the primordial $B$-mode power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Since this proposed measurement is about three to four orders of magnitude fainter than the temperature anisotropies of the CMB, in-flight calibration of the instruments and active suppression of systematic effects are crucial. We investigate the effect of changing the parameters of the scanning strategy on the in-flight calibration effectiveness, the suppression of the systematic effects themselves, and the ability to distinguish systematic effects by null-tests. Next-generation missions such as LiteBIRD, modulated by a Half-Wave Plate (HWP), will be able to observe polarisation using a single detector, eliminating the need to combine several detectors to measure polarisation, as done in many previous experiments and hence avoiding the consequent systematic effects. While the HWP is expected to suppress many systematic effects, some of them will remain. We use an analytical approach to comprehensively address the mitigation of these systematic effects and identify the characteristics of scanning strategies that are the most effective for implementing a variety of calibration strategies in the multi-dimensional space of common spacecraft scan parameters. We also present Falcons, a fast spacecraft scanning simulator that we developed to investigate this scanning parameter space.</description>

      <title>Probing radiative electroweak symmetry breaking with colliders and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative symmetry breaking provides an appealing explanation for electroweak symmetry breaking and addresses the hierarchy problem. We present a comprehensive phenomenological study of this scenario, focusing on its key feature: the logarithmic-shaped potential. This potential gives rise to a relatively light scalar boson that mixes with the Higgs boson and leads to first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early Universe. Our detailed analysis includes providing exact and analytical solutions for the vacuum structure and scalar interactions, classifying four patterns of cosmic thermal history, and calculating the supercooled FOPT dynamics and GWs. By combining future collider and gravitational wave experiments, we can probe the conformal symmetry breaking scales up to $10^5-10^8$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dark Matter Abundance in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scenario to obtain the correct relic abundance for thermally under-produced dark matter. This scenario utilizes a strongly first-order phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm PT}$ that gives rise to dark matter mass $m$. Freeze-out in the broken phase can yield the desired abundance in the entire region currently allowed by observational bounds and theoretical constraints for $10^2 T_{\rm PT} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^4 T_{\rm PT}$. We show that the accompanying gravitational waves are strong enough to be detected by many upcoming and proposed experiments. This, in tandem with dark matter indirect searches, provides a multi-messenger probe of such models. Positive signals in the future can help reconstruct the potential governing the phase transition and shed light on an underlying particle physics realization.</description>

      <title>Low-scale Mirror Standard Model Dark Matter and its Detection via Gravitational Waves and the Guitar Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What if the dark matter Sector is truly dark, self-interacting and unreachable by terrestrial experiments? How could we find hints of such dark sector if it is experimentally unreachable by any terrestrial experiment? We study a low-scale mirror Standard Model which can act as a model for dark matter, which interacts only gravitationally with the Standard Model particles. The mirror Standard Model sector particles are stable particles can comprise a measurable part of the dark matter of the Universe. These mirror Standard Model particles acquire mass through a low-temperature dark first order phase transition. We examine in detail this dark phase transition and we indicate how stochastic gravitational waves can be generated through this transition. For the model we use, the produced energy spectrum of the gravitational waves can be detected by the Square Kilometer Array. Moreover, we propose a possible way to detect effects of the particle nature of dark matter, using observational data coming from the guitar nebula, which can work if dark matter is collisional, so interacting dark matter. Without specifying a model for interacting dark matter, thus choosing an agnostic approach for interacting dark matter, we assume that the guitar nebula bow shock is generated by the interaction of the high speed neutron star that passes through the interstellar medium, which is assumed to be comprised by interacting dark matter and hydrogen. Our main proposal is that the opening angle of the bow shock can be directly related to the speed of sound of the dark matter particles, and a large angle of the bow shock could be a strong indicator that the interstellar medium is comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen gas. This is motivated by the Bosma effect.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first sensitivities to GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter using neutrino detectors, showing that these surpass current solar limits and direct detection results.</description>
