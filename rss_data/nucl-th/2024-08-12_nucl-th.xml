      <title>Neutron multiplicity counting distribution reconstruction from moments using Meixner polynomial expansion and N-forked branching approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods used to infer nuclear parameters from neutron count statistics fall into two categories depending on whether they use moments or count number probabilities. As probabilities are in general more difficult to calculate, we are interested here in the reconstruction of distributions from their first moments. For this, we explore two approaches. The first one relies on a generalization of the 2-forked branching correlation (quadratic) approximation used in the PMZBB and Poisson radical distributions, the second one is based on the expansion of the distribution on a basis of Meixner discrete orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Radiative Corrections and the Renormalization Group for the Two-Nucleon Interaction in Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a combination of effective field theory and the renormalization group to determine the impact of radiative corrections on the nucleon-nucleon potential and the binding energy of the deuteron. In order to do so, we present a modified version of pionless effective field theory inspired by earlier work in nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics. The renormalization group improvement of the deuteron binding energy leads to a shift on the order of a few percent and is consistent with the experimental value. This work serves as a starting point for a dedicated study of radiative corrections in few-body systems relevant for precision tests of the Standard Model in an effective field theory framework.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of N=50 isotones with the valence-space density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently proposed combination of the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group (VS-IMSRG) with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) offers a scalable and flexible many-body approach for strongly correlated open-shell nuclei. We use the VS-DMRG to investigate the low-lying spectroscopy of N=50 isotones, which are characteristic for their transition between single-particle and collective excitations. We also study electromagnetic transitions and show the advantage of the VS-DMRG to capture the underlying physics more efficiently, with significantly improved convergence compared to state-of-the-art shell-model truncations. Combined with an analysis of quantum information measures, this further establishes the VS-DMRG as a valuable method for ab initio calculations of nuclei.</description>

      <title>Accessing the speed of sound in relativistic ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions using the mean transverse momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been argued that the speed of sound of the strong interaction at high temperature can be measured using the variation of the mean transverse momentum with the particle multiplicity in ultracentral heavy-ion collisions. We test this correspondence by running hydrodynamic simulations at zero impact parameter with several equations of state, at several colliding energies from 0.2 TeV to 15 TeV per nucleon pair. The correspondence is found to be precise and robust for a smooth, boost-invariant fluid and an ideal detector. We discuss the differences between this ideal setup and an actual experiment. We conclude that the extraction of the speed of sound from data is reliable, and that the main uncertainty comes from our poor knowledge of the distribution of density fluctuations at the early stages of the collision.</description>

      <title>From chiral EFT to perturbative QCD: a Bayesian model mixing approach to symmetric nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraining the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting, dense matter is the focus of intense experimental, observational, and theoretical effort. Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) can describe the EOS between the typical densities of nuclei and those in the outer cores of neutron stars while perturbative QCD (pQCD) can be applied to properties of deconfined quark matter, both with quantified theoretical uncertainties. However, describing the complete range of densities between nuclear saturation and an almost-free quark gas with a single EOS that has well-quantified uncertainties is a challenging problem. In this work, we argue that Bayesian multi-model inference from $\chi$EFT and pQCD can help bridge the gap between the two theories. We develop a correlated Bayesian model mixing approach that uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to assimilate different information into a single QCD EOS for symmetric nuclear matter. In the present implementation, this mixed EOS is informed solely by those of $\chi$EFT and pQCD, together with the associated truncation errors. The GP is trained on the pressure as a function of number density in the low-density and high-density regions where $\chi$EFT and pQCD are, respectively, valid. We impose priors on the GP kernel hyperparameters to suppress unphysical correlations between these regimes. This results in smooth $\chi$EFT-to-pQCD curves for both the pressure and the speed of sound. We show that using uncorrelated pointwise mixing requires uncontrolled extrapolation of at least one of $\chi$EFT or pQCD into regions where the perturbative series breaks down and leads to an acausal EOS. We also discuss future extensions and applications to neutron star matter guided by recent EOS constraints from nuclear theory, nuclear experiment, and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Small systems and the single-hit approximation in the AMY parton cascade ALPACA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how momentum anisotropies arise in small collision systems is important for a quantitative understanding of collectivity in terms of QCD dynamics in small and large collision systems. In this letter we present results for small collision systems from the newly developed parton cascade \textsc{Alpaca}, which faithfully encodes the AMY effective kinetic theory. \textsc{Alpaca} reproduces quantitatively previously know results from a calculation in the single-hit approximation for small values of the coupling. We discuss in detail how such a comparison is to be carried out. Particularly at larger coupling a generic differences between the two approaches becomes apparent, namely that in parton cascades particles interact over a finite distance while in direct integrations of the Boltzmann equation the interactions are local. This leads to quantitative differences in the extracted values for the elliptic flow coefficient. These discrepancies appear in situations where the mean free path is not large compared to the interaction time and the applicability of kinetic theory is thus questionable.</description>
