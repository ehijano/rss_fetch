      <title>Are some books better than others?</title>

Abstract: Scholars, awards committees, and laypeople frequently discuss the merit of written works. Literary professionals and journalists differ in how much perspectivism they concede in their book reviews. Here, we quantify how strongly book reviews are determined by the actual book contents vs. idiosyncratic reader tendencies. In our analysis of 624,320 numerical and textual book reviews, we find that the contents of professionally published books are not predictive of a random reader's reading enjoyment. Online reviews of popular fiction and non-fiction books carry up to ten times more information about the reviewer than about the book. For books of a preferred genre, readers might be less likely to give low ratings, but still struggle to converge in their relative assessments. We find that book evaluations generalize more across experienced review writers than casual readers. When discussing specific issues with a book, one review text had poor predictability of issues brought up in another review of the same book. We conclude that extreme perspectivism is a justifiable position when researching literary quality, bestowing literary awards, and designing recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Lens: Quantifying the Impact of Scientific Documentaries through Amazon Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Engaging the public with science is critical for a well-informed population. A popular method of scientific communication is documentaries. Once released, it can be difficult to assess the impact of such works on a large scale, due to the overhead required for in-depth audience feedback studies. In what follows, we overview our complementary approach to qualitative studies through quantitative impact and sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews for several scientific documentaries. In addition to developing a novel impact category taxonomy for this analysis, we release a dataset containing 1296 human-annotated sentences from 1043 Amazon reviews for six movies created in whole or part by the Advanced Visualization Lab (AVL). This interdisciplinary team is housed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and consists of visualization designers who focus on cinematic presentations of scientific data. Using this data, we train and evaluate several machine learning and large language models, discussing their effectiveness and possible generalizability for documentaries beyond those focused on for this work. Themes are also extracted from our annotated dataset which, along with our large language model analysis, demonstrate a measure of the ability of scientific documentaries to engage with the public.</description>
