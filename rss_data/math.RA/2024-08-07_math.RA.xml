      <title>Galois Theory under inverse semigroup actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Galois theory of commutative rings under actions of finite inverse semigroups. We present equivalences for the definition of Galois extension as well as a Galois correspondence theorem. We also show how the theory behaves in the case of inverse semigroups with zero.</description>

      <title>Groupoid Graded Semisimple Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of groupoid graded semisimple rings. Our rings are neither unital nor one-sided artinian. Instead, they exhibit a strong version of having local units and being locally artinian, and we call them $\Gamma_0$-artinian. One of our main results is a groupoid graded version of the Wedderburn-Artin Theorem, where we characterize groupoid graded semisimple rings as direct sums of graded simple $\Gamma_0$-artinian rings and we exhibit the structure of this latter class of rings. In this direction, we also prove a groupoid graded version of Jacobson-Chevalley density theorem. We need to define and study properties of groupoid gradings on matrix rings (possibly of infinite size) over groupoid graded rings, and specially over groupoid graded division rings. Because of that, we study groupoid graded division rings and their graded modules. We consider a natural notion of freeness for groupoid graded modules that, when specialized to group graded rings, gives the usual one, and show that for a groupoid graded division ring all graded modules are free (in this sense). Contrary to the group graded case, there are groupoid graded rings for which all graded modules are free according to our definition, but they are not graded division rings. We exhibit an easy example of this kind of rings and characterize such class among groupoid graded semisimple rings. We also relate groupoid graded semisimple rings with the notion of semisimple category defined by B. Mitchell. For that, we show the link between functors from a preadditive category to abelian groups and graded modules over the groupoid graded ring associated to this category, generalizing a result of P. Gabriel. We characterize simple artinian categories and categories for which every functor from them to abelian groups is free in the sense of B. Mitchell.</description>

      <title>Element absorb Topology on rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new Topology related to special elements in a noncummutative rings. Consider a ring $R$, we denote by $\textrm{Id}(R)$ the set of all idempotent elements in $R$. Let $a$ is an element of $R$. The element absorb Topology related to $a$ is defined as $\tau_a:=\{ I\subseteq R | Ia \subseteq I\} \subseteq P(R)$. Since this topology is obtained from act of ring, it explains Some of algebraic properties of ring in Topological language .In a special case when $e$ ia an idempotent element, $\tau_e:=\{ I\subseteq R | Ie \subseteq I\} \subseteq P(R)$. We present Topological description of the pierce decomposition $ R=Re\oplus R(1-e)$.</description>

      <title>Enriched duality in double categories II: modules and comodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we continue the investigation of certain enrichments of dual algebraic structures in monoidal double categories, that was initiated in [Vas19]. First, we re-visit monads and comonads in double categories and establish a tensored and cotensored enrichment of the former in the latter, under general conditions. These include monoidal closedness and local presentability of the double category, notions that are proposed as tools required for our main results, but are of interest in their own right. The natural next step involves categories of the newly introduced modules for monads and comodules for comonads in double categories. After we study their main categorical properties, we establish a tensored and cotensored enrichment of modules in comodules, as well as an enriched fibration structure that involves (co)modules over (co)monads in double categories. Applying this abstract double categorical framework to the setting of V-matrices produces an enrichment of the category of V-enriched modules (fibred over V-categories) in V-enriched comodules (opfibred over V-cocategories), which is the many-object generalization of the respective result for modules (over algebras) and comodules (over coalgebras) in monoidal categories.</description>

      <title>Flat comodules and contramodules as directed colimits, and cotorsion periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02734v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a follow-up to arXiv:2212.09639. We consider two algebraic settings of comodules over a coring and contramodules over a topological ring with a countable base of two-sided ideals. These correspond to two (noncommutative) algebraic geometry settings of certain kind of stacks and ind-affine ind-schemes. In the context of a coring $\mathcal C$ over a noncommutative ring $A$, we show that all $A$-flat $\mathcal C$-comodules are $\aleph_1$-directed colimits of $A$-countably presentable $A$-flat $\mathcal C$-comodules. In the context of a complete, separated topological ring $\mathfrak R$ with a countable base of neighborhoods of zero consisting of two-sided ideals, we prove that all flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules are $\aleph_1$-directed colimits of countably presentable flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules. We also describe arbitrary complexes, short exact sequences, and pure acyclic complexes of $A$-flat $\mathcal C$-comodules and flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules as $\aleph_1$-directed colimits of similar complexes of countably presentable objects. The arguments are based on a very general category-theoretic technique going back to an unpublished 1977 preprint of Ulmer and rediscovered in arXiv:2310.16773. Applications to cotorsion periodicity and coderived categories of flat objects in the respective settings are discussed. In particular, in any acyclic complex of cotorsion $\mathfrak R$-contramodules, all the contramodules of cocycles are cotorsion.</description>

      <title>Operad and cohomology of associative algebras with generalized derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An associative algebra with a generalized derivation is called an AsGDer triple. We introduce the operad that encodes AsGDer triples, and prove it is a Koszul operad. Using its Koszul dual cooperad, we introduce the homotopy version of AsGDer triples. As an application, we construct the AsGDer cohomology theory for AsGDer triples, and show that the formal deformation of an AsGDer triple is controlled by the AsGDer cohomology.</description>

      <title>Unfurling Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.06311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the behavior of categorical actions of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ under the deformation of their spectra. We give conditions under which the general point of a family of categorical actions of $\mathfrak{g}$ carry an action of a larger Lie algebra $\mathfrak{\tilde{g}}$, which we call an {\bf unfurling} of $\mathfrak{g}$. This is closely related to the folding of Dynkin diagrams, but to avoid confusion, we think it is better to use a different term.
  Our motivation for studying this topic is the difficulty of proving that explicitly presented algebras and categories in the theory of higher representation theory have the "expected size." Deformation is a powerful technique for showing this because of the upper semicontinuity of dimension under deformation. In particular, we'll use this to show the non-degeneracy (in the sense of Khovanov-Lauda) of the 2-quantum group $\mathcal U$ for an arbitrary Cartan datum and any homogeneous choice of parameters.</description>

      <title>Coderived and contraderived categories of locally presentable abelian DG-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of an abelian DG-category, introduced by the first-named author in arXiv:2110.08237, unites the notions of abelian categories and (curved) DG-modules in a common framework. In this paper we consider coderived and contraderived categories in the sense of Becker. Generalizing some constructions and results from the preceding papers by Becker arXiv:1205.4473 and by the present authors arXiv:2101.10797, we define the contraderived category of a locally presentable abelian DG-category $\mathbf B$ with enough projective objects and the coderived category of a Grothendieck abelian DG-category $\mathbf A$. We construct the related abelian model category structures and show that the resulting exotic derived categories are well-generated. Then we specialize to the case of a locally coherent Grothendieck abelian DG-category $\mathbf A$, and prove that its coderived category is compactly generated by the absolute derived category of finitely presentable objects of $\mathbf A$, thus generalizing a result from the second-named author's preprint arXiv:1412.1615. In particular, the homotopy category of graded-injective left DG-modules over a DG-ring with a left coherent underlying graded ring is compactly generated by the absolute derived category of DG-modules with finitely presentable underlying graded modules. We also describe compact generators of the coderived categories of quasi-coherent matrix factorizations over coherent schemes.</description>

      <title>A study on the domain independence of the Laurent property, the irreducibility and the coprimeness in lattice equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Laurent property, the irreducibility and the coprimeness for lattice equations (partial difference equations), mainly focusing on how the choice of initial value problem (the choice of domain) affects these properties. We show that these properties do not depend on the choice of domain as long as they are considered together. In other words, these properties are inherent to a difference equation. Applying our result, we discuss the reductions of lattice equations. We show that any reduction of a Laurent system, even if the lattices have torsion elements, preserves the Laurent property.</description>

      <title>Kronecker coefficients and Harrison centers of Green's ring of the symmetric group $S_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the structure of the representation ring of the symmetric group $S_6$. The Kronecker coefficients and all power formulas of irreducible representations of $S_6$ are computed using the character theory of finite groups. In addition, by direct sum decomposition of tensor products of different irreducible representations of $S_6$, we characterise generators of the representation ring $\mathcal{R}(S_6)$, show that its unit group $U(\mathcal{R}(S_6))$ is a Klein four-group and related results on the structure of primitive idempotents. Furthermore, we introduce Harrison center theory to study the representation ring and show that the Harrison center of the cubic form induced by the generating relations of $\mathcal{R}(S_6)$ is isomorphic to itself. Finally, we conclude with some open problems for future consideration.</description>
