      <title>Closed-Form Expressions for Five-Digit Reflex Camber-Line Design Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite nearly a century of use in tailless and flying-wing aircraft, the NACA five-digit reflex camber-line family lacks published closed-form expressions for the governing design integrals; practitioners have instead relied on numerical quadrature and tabulated constants available only for a limited set of standard configurations. This paper addresses that gap by deriving closed-form analytical expressions for all lift and zero-moment integrals in terms of elementary functions of the breakpoint and maximum-camber-location parameters. A trigonometric substitution eliminates the endpoint singularities introduced by the Glauert transformation, yielding integrals expressible as inverse trigonometric functions combined with explicit polynomials. The breakpoint parameter is determined by solving a single transcendental equation, and the remaining camber-line constants follow from direct evaluation without numerical integration. Independent verification by numerical quadrature confirms agreement with the analytical expressions to machine precision. Comparison with historical tabulations shows that the closed-form values satisfy the zero-moment design condition to machine precision, whereas substituting the tabulated breakpoints back into the same condition yields residuals nine to thirteen orders of magnitude larger, consistent with the rounding and computational precision available when the original tabulations were produced.</description>

      <title>Finite-Inertia Corrections and Breakdown of Gor'kov Theory in Acoustic Levitation of Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic levitation is widely used for contactless droplet manipulation, yet the standard Gor'kov description obtained by time averaging the acoustic field lacks a quantitative validity criterion. In this work, we derive Gor'kov theory as the leading-order slow time limit of the instantaneous radiation force, compute the first finite-inertia correction, and obtain a simple breakdown parameter. The correction reduces the effective trapping drift and predicts fast time oscillations of amplitude $x_1^{\mathrm{max}}\sim\lambda/8$, corresponding to hundreds of micron for typical ultrasonic levitation experiments. This sets a measurable criterion for experiments using phased transducer arrays. Our results provide a universal rule of thumb for acoustic trap design and clarify where time-averaged radiation force models fail.</description>

      <title>Data-driven reduced order model for residence time distribution analysis of an industrial-scale continuous casting tundish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous casting tundish plays a critical role as a metallurgical reactor in the continuous casting process, with its flow characteristics serving as a key parameter in the production of high-quality steel. These characteristics are typically assessed through residence time distribution (RTD) curves. This study examines the flow behaviour in a single-strand continuous casting tundish through a combination of numerical simulations and experimental validation. Steady-state full order model (FOM) simulations are performed under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions to evaluate the influence of thermal buoyancy on the velocity field, which is found to be negligible. The resulting flow fields are used to initialize transient tracer transport simulations for determining the RTD and flow volume partitioning. Subsequently, a data-driven reduced order model (ROM) is developed to predict the RTD response. Comparison of RTD curves obtained from experiments, FOM, and ROM shows excellent agreement, with the ROM accurately capturing the key flow characteristics at a fraction of the computational cost. These results highlight the potential of ROM techniques for efficient real-time analysis, design, and optimization of tundish operations in metallurgical processes.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic flows induced by localized torques (rotlets) in wedge-shaped geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wedge-shaped geometries in low-Reynolds-number flows are of increasing importance, for instance, in the design of microfluidic devices. The corresponding Green's functions describing the induced flow in response to a locally applied force were derived some time ago. To achieve a complete characterization of particle motion at low Reynolds numbers, we derive the flow response to locally applied torques. This is accomplished through a direct calculation based on the Fourier-Kontorovich-Lebedev transform. We then illustrate the resulting flow fields, highlighting their structure, key features, and dependence on the geometry and orientation of the applied torque. Based on these solutions, we compute the corresponding hydrodynamic mobility tensor that couples torque and motion. Owing to the broken spatial symmetry imposed by the wedge-shaped confinement, a particle subjected to a torque will experience not only rotational motion but also translational motion. These results provide analytical tools relevant for predicting and controlling particle behavior in confined microfluidic environments.</description>

      <title>Coupled Modal-Nonmodal Interactions Due to Periodic, Infinite Train of Convecting Vortices (TCV)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Events during transition to turbulence either follow modal or non-modal routes, or combinations of the two. Here, we report a computational investigation of strong freestream excitation caused by a train of convecting vortices. For this TCV excitation, we show a strong interaction of modal and non-modal components causing a spectacular growth of disturbances. We propose this as the mechanism for the severe encounters due to convective vortical disturbances on the underlying shear layer.</description>

      <title>Solving nonlinear subsonic compressible flow in infinite domain via multi-stage neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In aerodynamics, accurately modeling subsonic compressible flow over airfoils is critical for aircraft design. However, solving the governing nonlinear perturbation velocity potential equation presents computational challenges. Traditional approaches often rely on linearized equations or finite, truncated domains, which introduce non-negligible errors and limit applicability in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel framework utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the full nonlinear compressible potential equation in an unbounded (infinite) domain. We address the unbounded-domain and convergence challenges inherent in standard PINNs by incorporating a coordinate transformation and embedding physical asymptotic constraints directly into the network architecture. Furthermore, we employ a Multi-Stage PINN (MS-PINN) approach to iteratively minimize residuals, achieving solution accuracy approaching machine precision. We validate this framework by simulating flow over circular and elliptical geometries, comparing our results against traditional finite-domain and linearized solutions. Our findings quantify the noticeable discrepancies introduced by domain truncation and linearization, particularly at higher Mach numbers, and demonstrate that this new framework is a robust, high-fidelity tool for computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Morphology of ice structures induced by a freezing rivulet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the solidification of a water rivulet flowing over a cold inclined substrate and the resulting formation of three-dimensional ice structures. Using a controlled hydraulic and thermal setup, combined with spatiotemporal phase-shifting profilometry and infrared thermography, we characterize both the transient evolution and the final morphology of the ice. We show that a typical experiment proceeds through three stages: formation of a straight ice ridge that stabilizes the rivulet, destabilization and lateral excursions of the flow leading to rapid transverse spreading of the ice structure, and progressive thickening and smoothing of the ice block. Across a wide range of flow rates, inclinations and thermal conditions, the final morphology comprises an upstream triangular lateral envelope, followed by a downstream region of nearly constant width once the substrate edges are reached. Infrared measurements reveal that the rivulet residence time on the substrate follows a Gaussian distribution in the azimuthal angle, implying that the central region of the structure is visited far more frequently than its lateral edges. Focusing on the domain where the height has converged at the end of the experiments, we develop a two-dimensional theoretical model that couples a hydrodynamic model for the rivulet geometry with heat transport in both liquid and solid phases. In the large P\'eclet number limit, the model predicts an exponential increase of the stationary ice height along the flow direction and it shows an excellent agreement with the experimental height field. We further show how the combination of the stationary height profile and the non-uniform residence time distribution controls the angular convergence of the ice cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Implicit Large Eddy Simulation of Nearly Incompressible Flows with a Discontinuous Galerkin-Boltzmann Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-order implicit large eddy simulation (ILES) approach for simulating flows at the nearly incompressible regime. Our methodology based on utilization of a nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization of the Boltzmann equations. The compactness and low-dissipative nature of the discontinuous Galerkin method are leveraged to mimic traditional large eddy simulations with subgrid-scale models. One of the key requirements of ILES is to provide dissipation only within a narrow band of high wavenumbers. This is validated through numerical experiments on the Taylor-Green Vortex problem in detail at a Reynolds number where varying scales of coherent turbulent structures are present. Furthermore, the approach is validated for external aerodynamic configurations by simulating the flow over a sphere at a Reynolds number of $Re=3700$, capturing the laminar-turbulent transition and the complex multiscale vortex dynamics characteristic of this regime. The results demonstrate the capability of the high-order DG-Boltzmann formulation to accurately capture transitional and turbulent flow features without the use of explicit sub-grid scale modeling, highlighting its potential as a robust and physically consistent framework for ILES of nearly incompressible turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>A biological hydraulic accumulator: How the squirting cucumber, Ecballium elaterium, squirts its seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seed dispersal is a fundamental process that allows offspring to reach suitable habitats and colonize new environments. While most plants rely on external vectors, some have evolved mechanisms that employ the buildup of liquid pressure in a closed compartment and its explosive release to disperse their seeds. This form of energy storage, reinvented by humans for engineering applications, is termed a hydraulic accumulator. Here we investigated the fluid mechanics involved in dispersal in the squirting cucumber, Ecballium elaterium integrating high-speed videography (up to 10 000 fps), microtomography, and internal pressure sensors. We recorded long-term pressure time series showing that E. elaterium exhibits circadian (24 hour) and ultradian (short-period) rhythms. Remarkably, the measurements revealed a lack of correlation between fruit and stem turgor; while the stem showed strong circadian cycles, the fruit often did not, suggesting isolated physiological processes in different tissues. The fruit's spongy wall tissue stores elastic potential energy as turgor pressure builds to nearly one atmosphere (92-99 kPa). Upon detachment, this energy is rapidly released to expel a turbulent, particle-laden liquid jet. Microtomography revealed that the seeds are packed around a central funiculus, a configuration that optimizes their exit through the basal orifice at velocities of up to 30 m/s. Seeds eventually move faster than the liquid droplets during the later stages of ejection as they shed their liquid coating. This sophisticated mechanism ensures a broad dispersal cone, effectively spreading offspring across space and environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Toward a theoretical framework for self-diffusiophoretic propulsion near a wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the self-diffusiophoretic motion of a catalytically active spherical particle confined within a wedge-shaped domain. Using the Fourier-Kontorovich-Lebedev transform, we solve the Laplace equation for the concentration field in the diffusion-dominated regime. The method of images is employed to obtain the first and second reflections of the concentration field, accounting for both monopole and dipole contributions of the particle's surface activity. Based on these results, we derive leading-order expressions for the self-induced phoretic velocity in the far-field limit and examine how it varies with the wedge opening angle and the particle's position within the domain. Our findings reveal that the wedge geometry significantly affects both the magnitude and direction of particle motion. Our study provides a systematic framework for understanding active particle dynamics near corners, with implications for microfluidic design and control of autophoretic particles in confined geometries.</description>

      <title>On the Theory of Absorption of Sound Waves via the Bulk Viscosity in the Partially Ionized Solar Chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk viscosity and thermodynamic variables of a hydrogen-helium cocktail: internal energy, enthalpy, pressure, their derivatives, heat capacities per constant density and pressure are obtained using temperature and density height profiles of the solar atmosphere [Avrett &amp; Loeser, ApJS Vol. 175, 229 (2008)]. The qualitative evaluation for the necessary sound wave energy flux to heat the solar chromosphere is determined to be 320 kW/m$^2$. It is concluded that the bulk viscosity creates the dominating mechanism of acoustic waves damping and it is not necessary to introduce artificial viscosity or to conclude that shear viscosity is not sufficient for chromosphere heating; the volume viscosity induced wave absorption is sufficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerosol-cloud interactions represent the largest uncertainty in climate-change assessment, and while cloud turbulence is considered crucial for droplet growth, its precise role remains unclear. Our laboratory-controlled studies show that turbulence does not always enhance collision and coalescence; instead, its influence emerges only when droplets have a sufficiently broad size distribution. The dissipative-scale droplet behaviour underscores the importance of improved parameterisations to accurately model cloud microphysics.</description>

      <title>Reversibility, Chaos, and Attractors in Periodically Sheared Elastic Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of filaments in flow are central to understanding a wide range of biological and soft-matter systems, yet their behavior under time-dependent forcing remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the long-time dynamics of Brownian inextensible elastic filaments subjected to strong uniform oscillatory shear by combining microfluidic experiments on actin filaments with numerical simulations based on a fluctuating Euler-Bernoulli elastica model in a viscous fluid. As the oscillation period increases, irreversibility emerges from the interplay of flow-induced deformations and thermal noise. This leads to a departure from reversible, deterministic rigid-body dynamics: in this regime, the filaments cycle between nearly straight, flow-aligned conformations at full periods and buckled shapes at half periods. Owing to the time-glide symmetry of the system, two such attracting states in fact coexist with a phase shift of half a period. The system spontaneously selects one, but occasionally switches between them as a result of noise, producing intermittent transitions between apparent order and disorder. This system constitutes an experimentally accessible realization of stochastic symmetry breaking, attractor hopping, and intermittency in a minimal nonequilibrium soft-matter system, with novel implications for the design and control of soft matter systems under time-dependent flows.</description>

      <title>Carbon mineralization in CO2-seawater-basalt systems: Reactive transport dynamics and vesicular pore architecture controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon mineralization in basaltic rocks may offer rapid, permanent \ce{CO2} storage, yet fundamental controls on reactive transport and precipitation patterns remain poorly understood. This study integrates flow-through experiments at 80\degree C using \ce{CO2}-acidified seawater with geochemical simulation and multi-scale pore imaging to elucidate mineralization dynamics in basaltic glass. Results reveal that carbonate precipitation is nucleation-controlled and stochastic rather than growth-controlled and deterministic, with isolated accumulations forming randomly despite continuous supersaturation. Residence time exerts primary control: reducing flow rate from 0.05 to 0.005\,mL/min proved necessary for visible precipitation. Post-experiment analyses identified calcium carbonate and smectite phases. Multi-scale characterization of three basalt facies revealed that connected porosity fractions (1.3--32\%) differ significantly from total porosity (18--42\%), demonstrating that network topology controls permeability. Micro-CT analysis revealed that pore coordination numbers in basalts (modal = 2) were notably lower than those in reservoir sandstones, creating serial flow paths that are vulnerable to catastrophic permeability loss from modest precipitation. Precipitation-induced clogging scenarios were proposed, where distributed small precipitates cause more severe permeability degradation than large accumulations. The use of seawater complicates geochemistry and reduces mineralization efficiency compared to freshwater. Findings emphasize the need for probabilistic reactive transport modeling frameworks and realistic pore topologies, which are fundamentally different from conventional CCS operations.</description>

      <title>Achieving Extraordinary Acoustic Transmission in a Single Slit by Boundary Impedance Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extraordinary acoustic transmission is commonly associated with periodic or multi-aperture structures. In this work, we show that a single subwavelength slit can support strongly enhanced transmission when its boundary response is described by an effective impedance. Using a reduced analytical model together with numerical calculations, we demonstrate that appropriate impedance tuning leads to efficient coupling between the incident field and the slit mode, resulting in transmission levels approaching unity. The observed enhancement is governed by impedance matching rather than geometric periodicity, highlighting a minimal mechanism for extraordinary transmission. This study establishes boundary impedance control as a versatile route for manipulating acoustic wave transport through deeply subwavelength apertures.</description>

      <title>The Minimal Attached Eddy in Wall Turbulence: Statistical Foundations, Inverse Identification and Influence Kernels</title>

Abstract: Townsend's attached eddy hypothesis models the logarithmic region of high Reynolds number wall turbulence as a random superposition of wall-attached, geometrically self-similar eddies whose sizes obey a scale-invariant population law. Building on the statistical framework of Woodcock and Marusic (2015), the present work (i) poses an inverse problem to infer the ideal single-eddy contribution (influence) functions for the mean velocity and Reynolds stresses from DNS moments, (ii) uses these inferred kernels to guide a minimal Biot-Savart-consistent hairpin-type eddy built from Rankine vortex rods together with an inviscid image system, and (iii) introduces a spectral Influence kernel that maps a self-similar eddy footprint to its one-dimensional energy spectrum. The Influence-kernel viewpoint yields a transparent explanation for the emergence (and limitations) of the linear part of the energy spectrum, provides a clear scale-by-scale decomposition and helps rationalize why simple eddy templates can reproduce a broad set of log-layer statistics once the mean-flow anchoring is fixed.</description>

      <title>A systematic characterisation of canopy density based on turbulent-structure penetration</title>

Abstract: Turbulent flows over canopies of rigid elements with different geometries and Reynolds numbers (Re) are investigated to identify and characterise different canopy density regimes. In the sparse regime, turbulence penetrates relatively unhindered within the canopy, whereas in the dense regime, the penetration is limited. A common measure of canopy density is the ratio of frontal to bed area, the frontal density $\lambda_f$. This is effective for canopies with no preferential orientation, but we observe that it does not accurately predict the density regime for less conventional ones, so it may not encapsulate the governing physics. Instead, we propose density metrics based on the position and extent of eddies of intense Reynolds shear stress. We analyse a series of direct simulations for isotropic and anisotropic layouts, across a range of $\lambda_f$, height, element width-to-pitch ratio and Re. Canopies with streamwise-packed elements but large spanwise gaps allow significant turbulence penetration, and appear sparse compared to isotropic or spanwise-packed canopies with the same $\lambda_f$. Turbulence penetration depends essentially on the spanwise gap, and increases with it, but depends also on Re. A canopy can behave as dense at low Re, but as sparser as Re increases. This suggests that turbulence penetration depends on the size of the spanwise gap relative to the typical width of the overlying eddies. Turbulence penetrates easily when the spanwise gap is larger than the eddy size, and is essentially precluded from penetrating in the opposite case. A penetration length can then be defined that is of the order of the spanwise gap or the eddy size, whichever is smaller. If the penetration length is small compared to the canopy height, the canopy behaves as dense; if it is comparable, as intermediate; and if it is roughly equal or larger, as sparse.</description>
