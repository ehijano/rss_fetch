      <title>Role of AI Innovation, Clean Energy and Digital Economy towards Net Zero Emission in the United States: An ARDL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current paper investigates the influences of AI innovation, GDP growth, renewable energy utilization, the digital economy, and industrialization on CO2 emissions in the USA from 1990 to 2022, incorporating the ARDL methodology. The outcomes observe that AI innovation, renewable energy usage, and the digital economy reduce CO2 emissions, while GDP expansion and industrialization intensify ecosystem damage. Unit root tests (ADF, PP, and DF-GLS) reveal heterogeneous integration levels amongst components, ensuring robustness in the ARDL analysis. Complementary methods (FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR) validate the results, enhancing their reliability. Pairwise Granger causality assessments identify strong unidirectional connections within CO2 emissions and AI innovation, as well as the digital economy, underscoring their significant roles in ecological sustainability. This research highlights the requirement for strategic actions to nurture equitable growth, including advancements in AI technology, green energy adoption, and environmentally conscious industrial development, to improve environmental quality in the United States.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Changes to Healthcare Utilization After a Reduction in Cost-sharing Among Deductible Plan Enrollees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health plan deductibles are a form of cost-sharing that require patients to pay out-of-pocket before insurance pays for benefits. Deductible plans have become increasingly common in the United Sates to mitigate escalating healthcare costs. Quantifying the impact of increased cost-sharing from deductibles on utilization is a challenging empirical question because individuals and employers self-select into plans with deductibles. We evaluated the impact of cost-sharing in plans with deductibles by leveraging an accidental injury to a family member as an instrumental variable that strongly predicted the non-injured family member reaching their deductible maximum, which resulted in a reduction in cost-sharing. Our outcome measures examined utilization subject to cost-sharing as compared to utilization exempt from cost-sharing. Using data from the same healthcare system to control for quality and provider network, we found that reaching the deductible increased emergency department (ED) utilization by 10.0 percentage points (pp). Nearly one-quarter of the increased ED utilization was potentially avoidable. Wellness visits not subject to cost-sharing decreased by 5.7 pp. Results were similar for high-deductible plans and for families meeting their maximum out-of-pocket amount. These findings provide causal evidence that individuals enrolled in plans with deductibles change utilization patterns after an exogenous reduction in cost-sharing.</description>

      <title>General Training and Worker Motivation: Experimental Evidence on Discretionary Effort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the reaction of workers to employer-sponsored general training that provides skills useful not only in the incumbent employer but also in other firms in the industry. While previous research has focused primarily on workers' responses to wage renegotiation, our work extends this understanding by exploring an additional dimension -- workers' discretionary effort beyond their job duties, which is not verifiable. We conduct a laboratory experiment to observe workers' responses in such an effort to different training intensities. We find that workers generally increase their discretionary effort in response to general training, regardless of whether it is employer-sponsored or mandated. Moreover, the employer's intention behind offering training influences both effort and workers' renegotiation responses. Additionally, when workers can penalize employers, they do so, although higher employer-determined training intensities mitigate this behavior.</description>

      <title>Supply chain network rewiring dynamics at the firm-level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supply chain networks (SCN) form the structural backbone of any society. They constitute the societal metabolism that literally produces everything for everybody by coordinating practically every single person on the planet. SCNs are by no means static but undergo permanent change through the entry and exit of firms and the re-arrangement of supply relations. Here we use a unique dataset to explore the temporal evolution of firms and their supplier-buyer relations of a national SCN. Monthly reported value added tax data from Hungary from 2014 to 2022 allows us to reconstruct the entire economy with 711,248 companies and 38,644,400 connections, covering practically every re-structuring event of an entire economy at firm-level resolution. We find that per year about 25\% of firms exit the SCN while 28\% new ones enter. On average, 55\% of all supply-links present in one year will not be present in the next. We report the half-life time of supply-links to be 13 months. New links attach super-preferentially to firms with a probability, $p(i)\propto k_i^{1.08}$, with $k_i$ firm $i$'s number of supply-connections. We calibrate a simple statistical network generation model that reproduces the stylized characteristics of the dominant Hungarian SCN. The model not only reproduces local network features such as in- and out-degree distributions, assortativity and clustering structure, but also captures realistic systemic risk profiles. We discuss the present model in how rewiring dynamics of the economy is essential for quantifying its resilience and to estimate shock propagation.</description>

      <title>Demand Estimation with Text and Image Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a demand estimation method that leverages unstructured text and image data to infer substitution patterns. Using pre-trained deep learning models, we extract embeddings from product images and textual descriptions and incorporate them into a random coefficients logit model. This approach enables researchers to estimate demand even when they lack data on product attributes or when consumers value hard-to-quantify attributes, such as visual design or functional benefits. Using data from a choice experiment, we show that our approach outperforms standard attribute-based models in counterfactual predictions of consumers' second choices. We also apply it across 40 product categories on Amazon.com and consistently find that text and image data help identify close substitutes within each category.</description>

      <title>Economic impact of biomarker-based aging interventions on healthcare costs and individual value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the economic impact of controlling the pace of aging through biomarker monitoring and targeted interventions. Using the DunedinPACE epigenetic clock as a measure of biological aging rate, we model how different intervention scenarios affect frailty trajectories and their subsequent influence on healthcare costs, lifespan, and health quality. Our model demonstrates that controlling DunedinPACE from age 50 onwards can reduce frailty prevalence, resulting in cumulative healthcare savings of up to CHF 131,608 per person over 40 years in our most optimistic scenario. From an individual perspective, the willingness to pay for such interventions reaches CHF 6.7 million when accounting for both extended lifespan and improved health quality. These findings suggest substantial economic value in technologies that can monitor and modify biological aging rates, providing evidence for both healthcare systems and consumer-focused business models in longevity medicine.</description>

      <title>The myth of declining competitive balance in the UEFA Champions League group stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19222v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degree of competitive balance is a crucial issue in the analysis of sports competitions. According to previous studies, competitive balance has significantly declined in the UEFA Champions League group stage over the recent decades. Our paper introduces six alternative indices in order to explore the robustness of these results. The ex ante measures are based on Elo ratings, while our ex post measures compare the group ranking to reasonable benchmarks. We find no evidence of any trend in the competitive balance of the UEFA Champions League group stage between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons.</description>

      <title>Critical Mathematical Economics and Progressive Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to present elements and discuss the potential of a research program at the intersection between mathematics and heterodox economics, which we call Criticial Mathematical Economics (CME). We propose to focus on the mathematical and model-theoretic foundations of controversies in economic policy, and aim at providing an entrance to the literature and an invitation to mathematicians that are potentially interested in such a project. From our point of view, mathematics has been partly misused in mainstream economics to justify `unregulated markets' before the financial crisis. We thus identify two key parts of CME, which leads to a natural structure of this article: The frst focusses on an analysis and critique of mathematical models used in mainstream economics, like e.g. the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) in Macroeconomics and the so-called "Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu"-Theorems. The aim of the second part is to improve and extend heterodox models using ingredients from modern mathematics and computer science, a method with strong relation to Complexity Economics. We exemplify this idea by describing how methods from Non-Linear Dynamics have been used in what could be called "The Dynamical Systems approach to Post-Keynesian Macroeconomics", and also discuss (Pseudo-) Goodwin cycles and possible Micro- and Mesofoundations. We conclude by discussing in which areas a collaboration between mathematicians and heterodox economists could be most promising. The focus lies on the mathematical and model-theoretic foundations of controversies in economic policy, and we discuss both existing projects in such a direction as well as areas where new models for policy advice are most needed. In an outlook, we discuss the role of (ecological) data, and the need for what we call Progressive Data Science.</description>

      <title>Bridging Retrospective and Prospective Merger Analyses: The Case of US Airline Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We begin with a retrospective analysis of three major U.S. airline mergers and document the sensitivity of the findings, particularly questioning whether market conditions evolve similarly for treated and control markets. We then develop a structural model that clarifies this and other assumptions implicit in retrospective analyses and separates efficiency gains from increases in firms' conduct. Using only pre-merger data, we propose a reduced-form approach that leverages exogenous changes in market structure to forecast merger effects. Finally, we use structural prospective merger simulations with our other estimates for a comprehensive evaluation. This bridging of approaches uncovers a fundamental tension: either efficiency gains were limited or, if they were significant, they were accompanied and offset by coordinated effects.</description>

      <title>The economics of global personality diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between personality diversity and national economic performance, introducing the Global Personality Diversity Index ({\Psi}-GPDI) as a novel metric. Leveraging a dataset of 760,242 individuals across 135 countries, we quantify within-country diversity based on the Big Five personality traits. Our findings reveal that personality diversity accounts for 19.9% of the variance in GDP per capita and provides an additional 2.8% explanatory power beyond institutional quality and immigration, underscoring its unique contribution to economic vitality. Through multi-factor analysis, we demonstrate how personality diversity complements existing economic frameworks, offering actionable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance innovation, productivity, and resilience. This research positions psychological diversity as a critical yet under explored factor in driving economic growth, bridging the fields of psychology and economics.</description>
