      <title>Height functions on singular surfaces parameterized by smooth maps $\mathcal{A}$-equivalent to $S_k$, $B_k$, $C_k$ and $F_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe singularities of height functions on singular surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ parameterized by smooth map-germs $\mathcal{A}$-equivalent to one of $S_k$, $B_k$, $C_k$ and $F_4$ singularities in terms of extended geometric language via finite succession of blowing-ups. We investigate singularities of dual surfaces of such singular surfaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Clairaut warped product Riemannian maps. To study these kind of maps, first, we find the condition of geodesic of a regular curve. Then we obtain the conditions for a warped product Riemannian map to be Clairaut warped product Riemannian map. Further, we find the curvature tensor for this map.</description>

      <title>Convex polygons and the isoperimetric problem in simply connected space forms $M_{\kappa}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that there exists a unique perimeter minimizer among all piecewise smooth simple closed curves in $M_{\kappa}^2$ enclosing area $A &gt; 0$ $(A \leq 2{\pi}$ if ${\kappa} = 1)$, and it is a circle in $M_{\kappa}^2$ of radius $AS_{\kappa} \left( \dfrac{ \sqrt{ A ( 4 {\pi} - {\kappa} A ) } }{ 2 {\pi} } \right)$, where $AS_{\kappa}(t) := t$ if ${\kappa} = 0$, arcsin$(t)$ if ${\kappa} = 1$, sinh$^{-1}(t)$ if ${\kappa} =-1$. We also prove the isoperimetric inequality for $M_{\kappa}^2$. We give an elementary geometric proof which is uniform for all three simply connected space forms.</description>

      <title>Left-invariant K\"{a}hler and semi-para-K\"{a}hler structures on some six-dimensional unsolvable Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article studies questions about the existence of left-invariant K\"{a}hler and semi-para-K\"{a}hler structures on six-dimensional unsolvable Lie groups whose Lie algebras are semidirect products. According to the classification results, there are four such Lie algebras. It is shown that one of these four Lie algebras admits left-invariant K\"{a}hler metrics, and the other three admit left-invariant semi-para-K\"{a}hler and semi-K\"{a}hler structures. The paper also shows that a six-dimensional symplectic Lie algebra must be solvable except in one case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using spinors, we show a dihedral type rigidity for polyhedral initial data sets. This rigidity connects spacetime positive mass theorem, dihedral rigidity and capillary marginally trapped surfaces. Our method is to extend the rigidity analysis of spacetime positive mass theorem due to Beig-Chrusciel to the settings of a twisted spinor bundle.</description>

      <title>Weak Almost Contact Structures: a Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak almost contact manifolds, i.e., the linear complex structure on the contact distribution is replaced by a nonsingular skew-symmetric tensor, defined by the author and R. Wolak, allowed us to take a new look at the theory of contact manifolds. The paper surveys recent results (concerning geodesic and Killing fields, rigidity and splitting theorems, Ricci-type solitons and Einstein-type metrics, etc.) in this new field of Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>CR structures, k-contact structures, and generalized Sasakian structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work (arXiv:2205.12067), we defined a notion of a generalized Sasakian structure in the context of generalized contact geometry, the odd dimensional analogue of generalized complex geometry introduced by Hitchin and Gualtieri. We show here that k-contact manifolds are generalized Sasakian if and only if they are classically Sasakian. We show also that strictly pseudo-convex CR manifolds are always generalized Sasakian.</description>

      <title>An Alternative for Constant Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M^{n+1}$ be a closed manifold of dimension $3\le n+1\le 7$ equipped with a generic Riemannian metric $g$. Let $c$ be a positive number. We show that, either there exist infinitely many distinct closed hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature equal to $c$, or there exist infinitely many distinct closed hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature less than $c$ but enclosing half the volume of $M$.</description>

      <title>Metric Lines in the Special Euclidean group on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Special Euclidean group on the plane SE(2) has the left-invariant sub- Riemannian structure. Every sub-Riemannian manifold possesses a Hamiltonian function governing the sub-Riemannian geodesic flow. Two natural questions are: What are the necessary conditions for periodic sub-Riemannian geodesics? What geodesics are the metric lines in SE(2)? We answer both questions, and our method for the second is an alternative proof using the Hamilton-Jacobi theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new families of four-dimensional Ricci solitons of cohomogeneity two with volume collapsing ends. In a local presentation of the metric conformal to a product, we reduce the soliton equation to a degenerate Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation for the conformal factor coupled with ODEs. We obtain explicit complete expanding solitons as well as abstract existence results for shrinking and steady solitons with boundary. These families of Ricci solitons specialize to classical examples of Einstein and soliton metrics.</description>

      <title>On K\"ahler manifolds with non-negative mixed curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate compact K\"ahler manifolds with non-negative or quasi-positive mixed curvature coming from a linear combination of the Ricci and holomorphic sectional curvature, which covers various notions of curvature considered in the literature. Specifically, we prove a splitting theorem, analogous to the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem, for complete K\"ahler manifolds with non-negative mixed curvature containing a line, and then establish a structure theorem for compact K\"ahler manifolds with non-negative mixed curvature. We also show that the Hodge numbers of compact K\"ahler manifolds with quasi-positive mixed curvature must vanish. Both results are based on the conformal perturbation method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of a multiplicative unimodularity for a coisotropic Poisson homogeneous space. Then, we discuss the unimodularity and the multiplicative unimodularity for these spaces and the existence of an invariant volume form for explicit Hamiltonian systems on such spaces. Several interesting examples illustrating the theoretical results are also presented.</description>

      <title>Topology-preserving Hodge Decomposition in the Eulerian Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hodge decomposition is a fundamental result in differential geometry and algebraic topology, particularly in the study of differential forms on a Riemannian manifold. Despite extensive research in the past few decades, topology-preserving Hodge decomposition of scalar and vector fields on manifolds with boundaries in the Eulerian representation remains a challenge due to the implicit incorporation of appropriate topology-preserving boundary conditions. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive 5-component topology-preserving Hodge decomposition that unifies normal and tangential components in the Cartesian representation. Implicit representations of planar and volumetric regions defined by level-set functions have been developed. Numerical experiments on various objects, including single-cell RNA velocity, validate the effectiveness of our approach, confirming the expected rigorous $L^2$-orthogonality and the accurate cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The volume spectrum of a compact Riemannian manifold is a sequence of critical values for the area functional, defined in analogy with the Laplace spectrum by Gromov. In this paper we prove that the canonical metric on the two-dimensional projective plane is determined modulo isometries by its volume spectrum. We also prove that the surface Zoll metrics on the three-dimensional sphere are characterized by the equality of the spherical area widths. These widths generalize to the surface case the Lusternik-Schnirelmann lengths of closed geodesics. We prove a new sharp area systolic inequality for metrics on the three-dimensional projective space.</description>

      <title>On the existence of balanced metrics of Hodge-Riemann type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we study the existence of balanced metrics of Hodge-Riemann type on non-K\"ahler complex manifolds. We first find some general obstructions, for instance that a Hodge-Riemann balanced manifold of complex dimension $n$ has to be $(n - 2)$-K\"ahler. Then, we focus on the case of compact quotients of Lie groups by lattices, endowed with an invariant complex structure. In particular, we prove non existence results on non-K\"ahler complex parallelizable manifolds and some classes of solvmanifolds, and we show that the only nilmanifolds admitting invariant structures of this type are tori. Finally, we construct the first non-K\"ahler example of a Hodge-Riemann balanced structure, on a non-compact complex manifold obtained as the product of the Iwasawa manifold by $\C$.</description>

      <title>Teleparallel Geometry with Spherical Symmetry: The diagonal and proper frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the proper co-frame and its corresponding (diagonal) co-frame/spin connection pair for spherically symmetric geometries which can be used as an initial ansatz in any theory of teleparallel gravity. The Lorentz transformation facilitating the move from one co-frame to the other is also presented in factored form. The factored form also illustrates the nature of the two degrees of freedom found in the spin connection. The choice of coordinates in restricting the number of arbitrary functions is also presented. Beginning with a thorough presentation of teleparallel gravity using the metric affine gauge theory approach and concentrating on f(T) teleparallel gravity, we express the field equations in the diagonal co-frame. We argue that the choice of diagonal co-frame may be more advantageous over the proper co-frame choice. Finally, assuming one additional symmetry, we restrict ourselves to the Kantowski-Sachs tele-parallel geometries, and determine some solutions.</description>

      <title>End-point estimates of the totally-geodesic Radon transform on simply connected spaces of constant curvature: A Unified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we give a unified proof of the end-point estimates of the totally-geodesic $k$-plane transform of radial functions on spaces of constant curvature. The problem of getting end-point estimates is not new and some results are available in literature. However, these results were obtained independently without much focus on the similarities between underlying geometries. We give a unified proof for the end-point estimates on spaces of constant curvature by making use of geometric ideas common to the spaces of constant curvature, and obtaining a unified formula for the $k$-plane transform of radial functions. We also give some inequalities for certain special functions as an application to one of our lemmata.</description>

      <title>Sharp Sobolev and Adams-Trudinger-Moser embeddings for symmetric functions without boundary conditions on hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding theorems for symmetric functions without zero boundary condition have been studied on flat Riemannian manifolds, such as the Euclidean space. However, these theorems have only been established on hyperbolic spaces for functions with zero boundary condition. In this work, we focus on sharp Sobolev and Adams-Trudinger-Moser embeddings for radial functions in hyperbolic spaces, considering both bounded and unbounded domains. One of the main features of our approach is that we do not assume boundary zero condition for symmetric functions on geodesic balls or the entire hyperbolic space. Our main results include Theorems 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, which establish weighted Sobolev embedding theorems, and Theorems 1.5 together with 1.6, which present Adams-Trudinger-Moser type of embedding theorems. In particular, a key result is Theorem 1.1 which is a highly nontrivial comparison result between norms of the higher order covariant derivatives and higher order derivatives of the radial functions. Higher order asymptotic behavior of radial functions on hyperbolic spaces are established to prove our main theorems. This approach includes novel radial lemmata and decay properties of higher order radial Sobolev functions defined in hyperbolic space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a non-compact hyperbolic $3$-manifold with finite volume and totally geodesic boundary components. By subdividing mixed ideal polyhedral decompositions of $M$, under some certain topological conditions, we prove that $M$ has an ideal triangulation which admits an angle structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the magnetic Hodge Laplacian, which is a generalization of the magnetic Laplacian on functions to differential forms. We consider various spectral results, which are known for the magnetic Laplacian on functions or for the Hodge Laplacian on differential forms, and discuss similarities and differences of this new ``magnetic-type'' operator.</description>

      <title>Continuum Limits of Ollivier's Ricci Curvature on data clouds: pointwise consistency and global lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ denote a low-dimensional manifold embedded in Euclidean space and let ${X}= \{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ be a collection of points uniformly sampled from it. We study the relationship between the curvature of a random geometric graph built from ${X}$ and the curvature of the manifold $M$ via continuum limits of Ollivier's discrete Ricci curvature. We prove pointwise, non-asymptotic consistency results and also show that if $M$ has Ricci curvature bounded from below by a positive constant, then the random geometric graph will inherit this global structural property with high probability. We discuss applications of the global discrete curvature bounds to contraction properties of heat kernels on graphs, as well as implications for manifold learning from data clouds. In particular, we show that our consistency results allow for estimating the intrinsic curvature of a manifold by first estimating concrete extrinsic quantities.</description>

      <title>Non-integrable distributions with simple infinite-dimensional Lie (super)algebras of symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under usual locality assumptions, we classify all non-integrable distributions with simple infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebra of symmetries over $\mathbb{C}$: we single out 15 series (containing 2 analogs of contact series and one family of deformations of their divergence-free subalgebras), and 7 exceptional Lie superalgebras. Over algebraically closed fields~$\mathbb{K}$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$, we classify the W-gradings (corresponding to a maximal subalgebra of finite codimension) of the known simple vectorial Lie (super)algebras with unconstrained shearing vector of heights of the indeterminates, distinguish W-gradings of (super)algebras preserving non-integrable distributions. For $p&gt;3$, we get analogs of the result over $\mathbb{C}$. For $p=3$, of all possible W-gradings (12 of Skryabin algebras, 3 of superized Melikyan algebras, and 4 of Bouarroudj superalgebras) most are new, together with the corresponding distributions. For $p=2$, we also get several new examples of distributions and their Lie (super)algebras of symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a real Abelian Lie supergroup $G$ acting on its complexification $M$, equipped with a $G$-invariant super K\"ahler form. We extend the scheme of classical geometric quantization to this setting and construct a unitary $G$-representation. We show that the occurrences of its irreducible subrepresentations are governed by the image of the moment map of the super K\"ahler form. As an application, we construct a Gelfand model of $G$, namely a unitary $G$-representation in which every unitary irreducible representation occurs exactly once.</description>

      <title>Localized Deformation of the Scalar Curvature and the Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a compact manifold with boundary, the map consisting of the scalar curvature in the interior and the mean curvature on the boundary is a local surjection at generic metrics. We prove that this result may be localized to compact subdomains in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold with boundary. This result is a generalization of Corvino's result about localized scalar curvature deformations; however, the existence part needs to be handled delicately since the problem is non-variational. We also briefly discuss generic conditions that guarantee localized deformations, and some related geometric properties.</description>

      <title>Infinitely Many Half-Volume Constant Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces via Min-Max Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M^{n+1},g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $3\le n+1\le 5$. We show that, if the metric $g$ is generic or if the metric $g$ has positive Ricci curvature, then $M$ contains infinitely many geometrically distinct constant mean curvature hypersurfaces, each enclosing half the volume of $M$. As an essential part of the proof, we develop an Almgren-Pitts type min-max theory for certain non-local functionals of the general form $$\Omega \mapsto \operatorname{Area}(\partial \Omega) - \int_\Omega h + f(\operatorname{Vol}(\Omega)).$$</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the index and nullity for minimal submanifolds of some complex Einstein spaces.

      <title>The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker Optimality Conditions for Multi-Objective Interval-Valued Optimization Problem on Hadamard Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KKT optimality conditions for multi-objective interval-valued optimization problem on Hadamard manifold are studied in this paper. Several concepts of Pareto optimal solutions, considered under LU and CW ordering on the class of all closed intervals in $\mathbb{R}$, are given. The KKT conditions are presented under the notions of convexity, pseudo-convexity and generalized Hukuhara difference. We show, with the help of an example, that the results done in this paper for solving multi-objective interval-valued optimization problems on Hadamard spaces are more general than the existing ones on Euclidean spaces. The main results are supported by examples.</description>

      <title>Singular extension of critical Sobolev mappings with values into complete Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triggered by a recent criterion, due to A.~Petrunin [17], to check if a complete, non-compact, Riemannian manifold admits an isometric embedding into a Euclidean space with positive reach, we extend to manifolds with such property the singular extension results of B.~Bulanyi and J.~Van~Schaftingen [5] for maps in the critical, nonlinear Sobolev space $W^{m/(m+1),m+1}\left(X^m,\mathcal{N}\right)$, where $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, $\mathcal{N}$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, and $X^m$ is either the sphere $\mathbb{S}^m = \partial \mathbb{B}^{m+1}_+$, the plane $\mathbb{R}^m$, or again $\mathbb{S}^m$ but seen as the boundary sphere of the Poincar\'{e} ball model of the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{m+1}$. As in [5], we obtain that the extended maps satisfy an exponential weak-type Sobolev-Marcinkiewicz estimate. Finally, we provide some illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Ollivier-Ricci curvature of regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the Ollivier-Ricci curvature in terms of graph parameters and an optimal assignment. Utilizing these precise expressions, we examine the relationship between the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the 0-Ollivier-Ricci curvature, resulting in an equality condition on regular graphs. This condition allows us to characterize edges that are bone idle in regular graphs of girth four and to construct a family of bone idle graphs with this girth. We then use our formulas to provide an efficient implementation of the Ollivier-Ricci curvature on regular graphs, enabling us to identify all bone idle, regular graphs with fewer than 15 vertices. Moreover, we establish a rigidity theorem for cocktail party graphs, proving that a regular graph is a cocktail party graph if and only if its Lin-Lu-Yau curvature is equal to one. We conclude this work by presenting a condition on the degree of a regular graph that guarantees positive Ricci curvature.</description>
