      <title>Hysteresis of Axionic Charge Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Catalysis is a known proposal for inducing dynamical axionic gapped phases by means of external magnetic fields from a Weyl or Dirac semimetal phase. At finite Fermi level, the phase transition is of first order type and the magnetic field needs to reach a critical value for the transition to take place. Using the theory of bubble nucleation, we predict the order parameter features a hysteretic behavior as a function of the external magnetic field. We also analyze the experimental consequences of this hysteretic behavior in several observables like magneto-conductivity, magnetic susceptibility and nonlinear optical coefficients. This hysteretic behavior might serve as a fingerprint of Magnetic Catalysis in Condensed Matter systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thermal broadening in the Shastry-Sutherland model and SrCu$_2($BO$_3)_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum magnet SrCu$_2($BO$_3)_2$ and its remarkably accurate theoretical description, the spin-$1/2$ Shastry-Sutherland model, host a variety of intriguing phenomena such as a dimer ground state with a nearly flat band of triplon excitations, a series of magnetization plateaux, and a possible pressure-induced deconfined quantum critical point. One open puzzle originating from inelastic neutron scattering and Raman experiments is the anomalous broadening of the triplon modes at relatively low temperatures compared to the triplon gap $\Delta$. We demonstrate that the experimentally observed broadening is captured by the Shastry-Sutherland model. To this end, we develop a numerical simulation method based on matrix-product states to simulate dynamical spectral functions at nonzero temperatures accurately. Perturbative calculations identify the origin of this phenomenon as a small energy scale compared to $\Delta$ between single triplon and bound triplon states at the experimentally relevant model parameters.</description>

      <title>Pristine and Pseudo-gapped Boundaries of the Deconfined Quantum Critical Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk topology and criticality can both lead to nontrivial boundary effects. Topological orders are often characterized by their robust edge states, while bulk critical points can have different boundary scalings governed by boundary conditions. The interplay between these two different boundary effects is an intriguing problem. The boundary of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) is the ideal platform for the interplay of the two boundary effects, as the DQCP is also an intrinsically gapless symmetry protected topological (igSPT) state. In this work we discuss the boundary of several analogues of the DQCP. We demonstrate that the fluctuation of the bulk order parameters and their various boundary conditions lead to a rich possibility of the edge states, including a "pseudogap" (or super power-law decay) behavior. We also discuss the quantum information perspective of our work, i.e. the implication of our results on DQCP under weak-measurement. Weak-measurement followed by post-selection can change the boundary condition at the temporal boundary in the path-integral representation of a density matrix, which will lead to different behaviors of the "strange correlator".</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and complex-time correlations using minimally entangled typical thermal states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network states have enjoyed great success at capturing aspects of strong correlation physics. However, obtaining dynamical correlators at non-zero temperatures is generically hard even using these methods. Here, we introduce a practical approach to computing such correlators using minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS). While our primary method directly computes dynamical correlators of physical operators in real time, we propose extensions where correlations are evaluated in the complex-time plane. The imaginary time component bounds the rate of entanglement growth and strongly alleviates the computational difficulty allowing the study of larger system sizes. To extract the physical correlator one must take the limit of purely real-time evolution. We present two routes to obtaining this information (i) via an analytic correlation function in complex time combined with a stochastic analytic continuation method to obtain the real-time limit and (ii) a hermitian correlation function that asymptotically captures the desired correlation function quantitatively without requiring effort of numerical analytic continuation. We show that these numerical techniques capture the finite-temperature dynamics of the Shastry-Sutherland model - a model of interacting spin one-half in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Effect of Ni substitution on the fragile magnetic system ${\text{La}_{5}\text{Co}_{2}\text {Ge}_{3}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\text{La}_{5}\text{Co}_{2}\text{Ge}_{3}$ is an itinerant ferromagnet with a Curie temperature, $T_C$, of $\sim$ 3.8 K and a remarkably small saturated moment of 0.1 $\mu_{B}/\text{Co}$. Here we present the growth and characterization of single crystals of the ${\text{La}_{5}\text{(Co}_{1-x}\text {Ni}_{x})_2\text {Ge}_{3}}$ series for 0.00 $\leq x \leq$ 0.186. We measured powder X-ray diffraction, composition as well as anisotropic temperature dependent resistivity, temperature and field dependent magnetization along with heat capacity on these single crystals. We also measured muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu \text{SR}$) for some Ni substitutions ($x$ = 0.027, 0.036, 0.074) to study the evolution of internal field with Ni substitution. Using the measured data we infer a low temperature, transition temperature-composition phase diagram for ${\text{La}_{5}\text{(Co}_{1-x}\text {Ni}_{x})_2\text {Ge}_{3}}$. We find that $T_{C}$ is suppressed for low dopings, $x \leq 0.014 $; whereas for $0.036 \leq {x} \leq 0.186 $, the samples are antiferromagnetic with a Neel temperature, $T_{N}$, that goes through a weak and shallow maximum ($T_N \sim$ 3.4 K for $ x \sim$ 0.07) and then gradually decreases to 2.4 K by $x$ = 0.186. For intermediate Ni substitutions, $0.016 \leq {x} \leq 0.027 $, two transition temperatures are inferred with $T_N &gt; T_C$. Whereas the $T-x$ phase diagram for ${\text{La}_{5}\text{(Co}_{1-x}\text {Ni}_{x})_2\text {Ge}_{3}}$ and the $T-p$ phase diagram determined for the parent $\text{La}_{5}\text{Co}_{2}\text{Ge}_{3}$ under hydrostatic pressure are grossly similar, changing from a low doping or low pressure ferromagnetic (FM) ground state to a high doped or pressure antiferromagnetic (AFM) state, perturbation by Ni substitution enabled us to identify an intermediate doping regime where both FM and AFM transitions occur.</description>

      <title>Shot noise in a metal close to Mott transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SrIrO$_3$ is a metallic complex oxide with unusual electronic and magnetic properties believed to originate from electron correlations due to its proximity to Mott metal-insulator transition. However, the nature of its electronic state and the mechanism of metallic conduction remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that shot noise produced by nanoscale SrIrO$_3$ junctions is strongly suppressed, inconsistent with diffusive quasiparticle transport. Analysis of thermal effects and scaling with the junction length reveals that conduction is mediated by collective hopping of electrons almost localized by correlations. Our results provide insight into the non-Fermi liquid state close to Mott transition, and advance shot noise measurements as a powerful technique for the studies of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Towards an exact electronic quantum many-body treatment of Kondo correlation in magnetic impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kondo effect is a prototypical quantum phenomenon arising from the interaction between localized electrons in a magnetic impurity and itinerant electrons in a metallic host. Although it has served as the testing ground for quantum many-body methods for decades, the precise description of Kondo physics with material specificity remains challenging. Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy far exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends. More broadly, we demonstrate the possibility to start from fully ab initio many-body simulations and push towards the realm of converged predictions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Phase Diagram of Rouaite, Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$NO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinon-magnon mixing was recently reported in botallackite Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Br with a uniaxially compressed triangular lattice of Cu$^{2+}$ quantum spins [Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 037204 (2020)]. Its nitrate counterpart rouaite, Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$NO$_3$, has a highly analogous structure and might be expected to exhibit similar physics. To lay a foundation for research on this material, we clarify rouaite's magnetic phase diagram and identify both low-field phases. The low-temperature magnetic state consists of alternating ferro- and antiferromagnetic chains, as in botallackite, but with additional canting, leading to net moments on all chains which rotate from one chain to another to form a 90$^\circ$ cycloidal pattern. The higher-temperature phase is a helical modulation of this order, wherein the spins rotate from one Cu plane to the next. This extends to zero temperature for fields perpendicular to the chains, leading to a set of low-temperature field-induced phase transitions. Rouaite may offer another platform for spinon-magnon mixing, while our results suggest a delicate balance of interactions and high tunability of the magnetism.</description>

      <title>Probing Short-Range Correlations in the van der Waals Magnet CrSBr by Small-Angle Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered metamagnet CrSBr offers a rich interplay between magnetic, optical and electrical properties that can be extended down to the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Despite the extensive research regarding the long-range magnetic order in magnetic van der Waals materials, short-range correlations have been loosely investigated. By using Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) we show the formation of short-range magnetic regions in CrSBr with correlation lengths that increase upon cooling up to ca. 3 nm at the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature (TN ~ 140 K). Interestingly, these ferromagnetic correlations start developing below 200 K, i.e., well above TN. Below TN, these correlations rapidly decrease and are negligible at low-temperatures. The experimental results are well-reproduced by an effective spin Hamiltonian, which pinpoints that the short-range correlations in CrSBr are intrinsic to the monolayer limit, and discard the appearance of any frustrated phase in CrSBr at low-temperatures within our experimental window between 2 and 200 nm. Overall, our results are compatible with a spin freezing scenario of the magnetic fluctuations in CrSBr and highlight SANS as a powerful technique for characterizing the rich physical phenomenology beyond the long-range order paradigm offered by van der Waals magnets.</description>

      <title>Codimension-Two Spiral Spin-Liquid in the Effective Honeycomb-Lattice Compound Cs$_3$Fe$_2$Cl$_9$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A codimension-two spiral spin-liquid is a correlated paramagnetic state with one-dimensional ground state degeneracy hosted within a three-dimensional lattice. Here, via neutron scattering experiments and numerical simulations, we establish the existence of a codimension-two spiral spin-liquid in the effective honeycomb-lattice compound Cs$_3$Fe$_2$Cl$_9$ and demonstrate the selective visibility of the spiral surface through phase tuning. In the long-range ordered regime, competing spiral and spin density wave orders emerge as a function of applied magnetic field, among which a possible order-by-disorder transition is identified.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking topological insulator-based photodetector: Photo-induced excess noise and role of barrier height inhomogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) with symmetry-protected surface states, offer exciting opportunities for next-generation photonic and optoelectronic device applications. The heterojunctions of TIs and semiconductors (e.g. Si, Ge) have been observed to excellent photo-responsive characteristics. However, the realization of high-frequency operations in these heterojunctions can be hindered by unwanted 1/f (or Flicker) noise and phase noise. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of 1/f noise figures becomes paramount for the effective utilization of such materials.Here we report optoelectronic response and 1/f noise characteristics of a p-n diode fabricated using topological insulator, Bi2Se3 and silicon for potential photo-detector. Through meticulous temperature-dependent current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements, we ascertain crucial parameters like barrier height, ideality factor, and reverse saturation current of the photodetector. The low-frequency 1/f conductance noise spectra suggest a significant presence of trap states influencing the optoelectronic transport properties. The forward noise characteristics exhibit typical 1/f features, having a uni-slope across four decades of frequency, suggesting a homogeneous distribution of barrier height. The spectral and photocurrent-dependent responses show the power law behavior of noise level on photon flux. The hybrid heterojunction demonstrates excellent photo-response and reasonably low noise level, promising signatures for the room-temperature visible photodetector applications.</description>

      <title>Signatures of a Charge Ice State in the Doped Mott Insulator Nb$_3$Cl$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between strong electronic correlations and the inherent frustration of certain lattice geometries is a common mechanism for the formation of nontrivial states of matter. In this work, we theoretically explore the collective electronic effects in the monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, a recently discovered triangular lattice Mott insulator. Our advanced many-body numerical simulations predict the emergence of a phase separation region upon doping this material. Notably, in close proximity to the phase separation, the static charge susceptibility undergoes a drastic change and reveals a distinctive bow-tie structure in momentum space. The appearance of such a signature in the context of spin degrees of freedom would indicate the formation of a spin ice state. This finding allows us to associate the observed phase separation to a charge ice state, a state with a remarkable power-law dependence of both the effective exchange interaction and correlations between electronic densities in real space.</description>

      <title>Origin of the density wave instability in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 revealed by optical and ultrafast spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we employed optical spectroscopy and ultrafast reflectivity measurements to investigate the density wave instability of trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 at ambient pressure. Our optical spectroscopy measurements indicate that La4Ni3O10 is metallic with a large plasma frequency at room temperature. As the temperature decreases, we observe the formation of an energy gap in reflectivity below TDW, signaling the charge/spin density wave transition. The Drude component was largely removed due to the gap opening in the Fermi surface. Our Drude-Lorentz analysis reveals that the energy gap in La4Ni3O10 is approximately 61 meV, which is three times larger than that obtained from ARPES measurements. The density wave gap feature is more prominent than that observed in bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7, suggesting more carriers are gapped at the Fermi surface across the density wave transition. By comparing the measured plasma frequency with the first-principles calculation, we categorize La4Ni3O10 as a moderately electronic correlation material, similar to the parent compound of iron-based superconductors, however, being weaker than the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7. Our ultrafast pump-probe experiments also show that the relaxation time diverges near the transition temperature. By analyzing the amplitude and relaxation time with the Rothwarf-Taylor model, we estimate the energy gap to be 58 meV, which agrees with the result of optical spectroscopy. The more prominent gap feature and weaker electronic correlation might be the cause of a lower superconductivity transition temperature in La4Ni3O10 under high pressure. These findings significantly contribute to understanding the origin of density wave and superconductivity in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Probing elasto-quantum materials with X-ray techniques and in situ anisotropic strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic lattice deformation plays an important role in the quantum mechanics of solid state physics. The possibility of mediating the competition and cooperation among different order parameters by applying in situ strain/stress on quantum materials has led to discoveries of a variety of elasto-quantum effects on emergent phenomena. It has become increasingly critical to have the capability of combining the in situ strain tuning with X-ray techniques, especially those based on synchrotrons, to probe the microscopic elasto-responses of the lattice, spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom. Herein, we briefly review the recent studies that embarked on utilizing elasto-X-ray characterizations on representative material systems and demonstrated the emerging opportunities enabled by this method. With that, we further discuss the promising prospect in this rising area of quantum materials research and the bright future of elasto-X-ray techniques.</description>

Abstract: The interaction of light with correlated Weyl semimetals (WSMs) provides a unique platform for exploring non-equilibrium phases and fundamental properties such as chirality. Here, we investigate the structural chirality of (TaSe4)2I, a correlated WSM, under weak optical pumping using Circular Photogalvanic Effect (CPGE) measurements and Raman spectroscopy. Surprisingly, we find that there is a loss of chirality in (TaSe4)2I above a threshold light intensity. We suggest that the loss of chirality is due to an optically driven phase transition into an achiral structure distinct from the ground state. This structural transformation is supported by fluence-dependent Raman spectra, revealing a new peak at low pump fluences that disappears above the threshold fluence. The loss of chirality even at low optical powers suggests that the system quickly transitions into a non WSM phase, and also highlights the importance of considering light-induced structural interactions in understanding the behavior of correlated systems. These studies showcase that even low excitation powers can be used to control the properties of correlated topological systems, opening up new avenues for low power optical devices.</description>

      <title>Shallow core levels, or how to determine the doping and $T_c$ of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ and Bi$_{2}$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ without cooling</title>

Abstract: Determining the doping level in high-temperature cuprate superconductors is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in these materials and for unlocking their full potential. However, accurately determining the doping level remains a significant challenge due to a complex interplay of factors and limitations in various measurement techniques. In particular, in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ and Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$, where the mobile carriers are introduced by non-stoichiometric oxygen $\delta$, the determination has been extremely problematic. Here, we study the doping dependence of the electronic structure of these materials in angle-resolved photoemission and find that both the doping level, $p$, and the superconducting transition temeprature, $T_c$ can be precisely determined from the binding energy of the Bi $5d$ core-levels. The measurements can be performed at room temperature, enabling the determination of $p$ and $T_c$ without cooling the samples. This should be very helpful for further studies of these materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a single crystal Cu NMR study of the cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ with hole doping levels between $x=2$\% and $8$\%. Measurements with short spin echo times enable us to systematically study the local properties of the electronic spin system in the region of the phase diagram where the material evolves from the insulating antiferromagnetic parent phase to the superconducting state. We find evidence for qualitative changes as the Sr concentration increases through $x=5$\% in both NMR spectra and relaxation times, which we interpret as signatures of a low-temperature transition from a state with disconnected metallic islands to a granular metal with tunneling between the grains. These results provide microscopic insight into the physics of a doped charge-transfer insulator in the presence of quenched substitutional disorder, indicate that a connectivity transition occurs, and demonstrate that complex nanoscale electronic phase separation is ubiquitous in LSCO around the doping level where superconductivity first appears in the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Encoding innumerable charge density waves of FeGe into polymorphs of LiFe6Ge6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome metals exhibit rich quantum states by the intertwining of lattice, charge, orbital and spin degrees of freedom. Recently, a novel charge density wave (CDW) ground state was discovered in kagome magnet FeGe and was revealed to be driven by lowering magnetic energy via large Ge1-dimerization. Here, based on DFT calculations, we show that such mechanism will yield infinitely many metastable CDWs in FeGe due to different ways to arrange the Ge1-dimerization in enlarged superstructures. Intriguingly, utilizing these metastable CDWs, innumerable polymorphs of kagome magnet LiFe6Ge6 can be stabilized by filling Li atoms in the voids right above/below the dimerized Ge1-sites in the CDW superstructures. Such polymorphs are very stable due to the presence of magnetic-energy-saving mechanism, in sharp contrast to the non-magnetic "166" kagome compounds. In this way, a one-to-one mapping of the metastable CDWs of FeGe to stable polymorphs of LiFe6Ge6 is established. On one hand, the fingerprints of these metastable CDWs, i.e., the induced in-plane atomic distortions and band gaps, are encoded into the corresponding stable polymorphs of LiFe6Ge6, such that further study of their properties becomes possible. On the other hand, such innumerable polymorphs of LiFe6Ge6 offer great degrees of freedom to explore the rich physics of magnetic kagome metals. We thus reveal a novel connection between the unusually abundant CDWs and structural polymorphism in magnetic kagome materials, and establish a new route to obtain structural polymorphism on top of CDW states.</description>

      <title>Exploring Frustration Effects of Strongly Interacting Bosons via the Hall Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Hall response of hardcore bosonic atoms on a triangular ladder in a magnetic field. We show that the behavior of the Hall polarization, both in its saturation value and in the short-time dynamics, correlates with the features of the underlying phase diagram. In particular, it exhibits a strong negative response at the Meissner to vortex phase transitions, while at large magnetic fluxes, after changing sign, it shows a strong positive response due to non-trivial vortex commensurability effects stemming from the interplay of interactions and geometric frustration. Thus, one can employ the Hall response as a sensitive probe of the many-body chiral quantum phases present in the system.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Representations of Higher-Dimensional Topological Orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 3D spacetime, topologically ordered phases of matter feature emergent particles called anyons, whose properties like fusion rules and braiding statistics are schematically represented by diagrams. Important consistency conditions, such as pentagon and hexagon relations, are encoded in diagrams. In 4D and higher spacetimes, topological orders support not only point-like particles but also spatially extended excitations, such as loops and membranes, allowing for diverse topological data about braiding, fusion, and shrinking processes. Recently, these topological data have been explored through the path-integral formalism of topological quantum field theory. Analogous to the counterpart in 3D, in this work, we construct diagrammatic representations of higher-dimensional (4D and 5D) topological orders. We introduce basic fusion and shrinking diagrams and treat them as vectors in corresponding spaces, then build complex diagrams by stacking these basic diagrams. Within the same vector spaces, we use $F$-, $\Delta$-, and $\Delta^2$-symbols to transform between different bases. From these transformations, we derive consistency conditions like \textit{pentagon equations} and \textit{(hierarchical) shrinking-fusion hexagon equations}, which describe the consistent coexistence of fusion and shrinking data. We conjecture that all anomaly-free higher-dimensional topological orders must satisfy these conditions, with violations indicating a quantum anomaly. This work opens several promising avenues for future research such as the exploration of diagrammatic representations of braiding processes in higher dimensions as well as implications for noninvertible symmetries and Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT).</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

Abstract: We study the response of critical Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) spin liquids to doping with longer-range singlets, and more generally of U(1)-symmetric tensor networks to non-symmetric perturbations. Using a field theory description, we find that in the RVB, doping constitutes a relevant perturbation which immediately opens up a gap, contrary to previous observations. Our analysis predicts a very large correlation length even at significant doping, which we verify using high-accuracy numerical simulations. This emphasizes the need for careful analysis, but also justifies the use of such states as a variational ansatz for critical systems. Finally, we give an example of a PEPS where non-symmetric perturbations do not open up a gap and the U(1) symmetry re-emerges.</description>

Abstract: Predicting magnetic ordering in kagome compounds offers the possibility of harnessing topological or flat-band physical properties through tuning of the magnetism. Here, we examine the magnetic interactions and phases of ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ which belongs to a family of $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$, $R=$ Sc, Y, Gd--Lu, compounds with magnetic kagome Mn layers, triangular $R$ layers, and signatures of topological properties. Using results from single-crystal neutron diffraction and mean-field analysis, we find that ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ sits close to the critical boundary separating the spiral-magnetic and ferrimagnetic ordered states typical for nonmagnetic versus magnetic $R$ layers, respectively. Finding interlayer magnetic interactions and easy-plane Mn magnetic anisotropy consistent with other members of the family, we predict the existence of a number of temperature and field dependent collinear, noncollinear, and noncoplanar magnetic phases. We show that thermal fluctuations of the Er magnetic moment, which act to weaken the Mn-Er interlayer magnetic interaction and quench the Er magnetic anisotropy, dictate magnetic phase stability. Our results provide a starting point and outline a multitude of possibilities for studying the behavior of Dirac fermions in $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ compounds with control of the Mn spin orientation and real-space spin chirality.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz Symmetry in Non-Hermitian Dirac Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentz spacetime symmetry represents a unifying feature of the fundamental forces, typically manifest at sufficiently high energies, while in quantum materials it emerges in the deep low-energy regime. However, its fate in quantum materials coupled to an environment thus far remained unexplored. We here introduce a general framework of constructing symmetry-protected Lorentz invariant non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac semimetals (DSMs), realized by invoking masslike anti-Hermitian Dirac operators to its Hermitian counterpart. Such NH DSMs feature purely real or imaginary isotropic linear band dispersion, yielding a vanishing density of states. Dynamic mass orderings in NH DSMs thus take place for strong Hubbardlike local interactions through a quantum phase transition, hosting a non-Fermi liquid, beyond which the system becomes an insulator. We show that depending on the internal Clifford algebra between the NH Dirac operator and candidate mass order-parameter, the resulting quantum-critical fluid either remains coupled with the environment or recovers full Hermiticity by decoupling from the bath, while always enjoying an emergent Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry in terms of a unique terminal velocity. We showcase the competition between such mass orderings, their hallmarks on quasiparticle spectra in the ordered phases, and the relevance of our findings for correlated designer NH Dirac materials.</description>

Abstract: In our study, we conduct magnetization and heat capacity measurements to investigate field induced magnetic phase transitions within the newly synthesized compound K2Ni2(SeO3)3, a spin-1 dimer system arranged on a triangular lattice. From our first-principles simulations, we determine that the spin system in K2Ni2(SeO3)3 can be represented as a two-dimensional triangular-lattice spin-1 dimer model, including an intra-dimer exchange of J1 = 0.32 meV, an inter-dimer exchange of J2 = 0.79 meV, and an easy-axis anisotropy of D = 0.14 meV. The presence of easy-axis magnetic anisotropy explains the distinct magnetic phase diagrams observed under c-axis directional and in-plane magnetic fields. Notably, our investigation unveils a two-step phase transition with the magnetic field aligned with the c direction. Our findings yield valuable insights into the magnetic phase transitions inherent to geometrically frustrated magnetic systems featuring dimer structures.</description>

Abstract: In condensed matter, Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) are quantum spin analogs of electronic Fractional Quantum Hall states (in the continuum) or Fractional Chern Insulators (on the lattice). As the latter, CSL are remarquable states of matter, exhibiting topological order and chiral edge modes. Preparing CSL on quantum simulators like cold atom platforms is still an open challenge. Here we propose a simple setup on a finite cluster of spin-1/2 located at the sites of a square lattice. Using a Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) non-chiral spin liquid as initial state on which fast time-modulations of strong nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings are applied, following different protocols (out-of-equilibrium quench or semi-adiabatic ramping of the drive), we show the slow emergence of such a CSL phase. An effective Floquet dynamics, obtained from a high-frequency Magnus expansion of the drive Hamiltonian, provides a very accurate and simple framework fully capturing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. An analysis of the resulting prepared states in term of Projected Entangled Pair states gives further insights on the topological nature of the chiral phase. Finally, we discuss possible applications to quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic time evolution of quantum systems is a widely used tool with applications ranging from state preparation through simplifications of computations and topological transformations to optimization and quantum computing. Adiabatic time evolution generally works well for gapped ground states, but not for thermal states in the middle of the spectrum that lack a protecting energy gap. Here we show that quantum many-body scars -- a particular type of highly excited states -- are suitable for adiabatic time evolution despite the absence of a protecting energy gap. Considering two rather different models, namely a one-dimensional model constructed from tensor networks and a two-dimensional fractional quantum Hall model with anyons, we find that the quantum scars perform similarly to gapped ground states with respect to adiabatic dynamics when the required final adiabatic fidelity is around 0.99. The maximum speed at which the scar state of the one-dimensional model can be adiabatically transformed decreases as a power law with system size, as opposed to exponentially for both generic thermal and disorder-driven localized states. At constant and very low ramp speed, we find that the deviation of the fidelity from unity scales linearly with ramp speed for scar states, but quadratically for gapped ground states. The gapped ground states hence perform better when the required adiabatic fidelities are very high, such as 0.9999 and above. We identify two mechanisms for leakage out of the scar state and use them to explain our results. While manipulating a single, isolated ground state is common in quantum applications, adiabatic evolution of scar states provides the flexibility to manipulate an entire tower of ground-state-like states simultaneously in a single system.</description>

      <title>Complexity and order in approximate quantum error-correcting codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish rigorous connections between quantum circuit complexity and approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) properties, covering both all-to-all and geometric scenarios including lattice systems. To this end, we introduce a type of code parameter that we call subsystem variance, which is closely related to the optimal AQEC precision. Our key finding is that if the subsystem variance is below an $O(k/n)$ threshold then any state in the code subspace must obey certain circuit complexity lower bounds, which identify nontrivial ``phases'' of codes. Based on our results, we propose $O(k/n)$ as a boundary between subspaces that should and should not count as AQEC codes. This theory of AQEC provides a versatile framework for understanding the quantum complexity and order of many-body quantum systems, offering new insights for wide-ranging physical scenarios, in particular topological order and critical quantum systems which are of outstanding importance in many-body and high energy physics. We observe from various different perspectives that roughly $O(1/n)$ represents a common, physically significant ``scaling threshold'' of subsystem variance for features associated with nontrivial quantum order.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable Floquet Dynamics for Conformal Field Theories in Dimensions Greater than Two</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find classes of driven conformal field theories (CFT) in d + 1 dimensions with d &gt; 1, whose quench and Floquet dynamics can be computed exactly. The setup is suitable for studying periodic drives, consisting of square pulse protocols for which Hamiltonian evolution takes place with different deformations of the original CFT Hamiltonian in successive time intervals. These deformations are realized by specific combinations of conformal generators with a deformation parameter $\beta$; the $\beta &lt; 1$ ($\beta &gt; 1$) Hamiltonians can be unitarily related to the standard (Luscher-Mack) CFT Hamiltonian. The resulting time evolution can be then calculated by conformal transformations. For $d\leq 3$ we show that the transformations can be obtained in a quaternion formalism. Evolution with such a single Hamiltonian yields qualitatively different time dependences of observables depending on the value of $\beta$, ranging from exponential decays characteristic of heating to oscillations and power law decays. This manifests in the behavior of the fidelity, unequal-time correlator, and the energy density at the end of a single cycle of a square pulse protocol with different hamiltonians in successive time intervals. When the Hamiltonians in a cycle involve generators of a single SU(1, 1) subalgebra we calculate the Floquet Hamiltonian. We show that one can get dynamical phase transitions by varying the time period of a cycle, where the system can go from a non-heating phase which is oscillatory as a function of the time period to a heating phase with an exponentially damped behavior. Our methods can be generalized to other discrete and continuous protocols. We also point out that our results are expected to hold for a broader class of QFTs that possesses an SL(2, C) symmetry with fields that transform as quasi-primaries under this. As an example, we briefly comment on celestial CFTs in this context.</description>

      <title>Interface Dynamics of Strongly interacting Binary Superfluids</title>

Abstract: Understanding the interface dynamics in non-equilibrium quantum systems remains a challenge. We study the interface dynamics of strongly coupled immiscible binary superfluids by using holographic duality. The full nonlinear evolution of the binary superfluids with a relative velocity shows rich nonlinear patterns toward quantum turbulence, which is reminiscent of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The wave number of the fast growing modes $k_0$ extracted from the interface pattern yields a non-monotonic dependence of the relative velocity, independent of the temperature and interaction. The value of $k_0$ first increases with the velocity difference and then decreases, which stands in sharp contrast to the results of mean-field theory described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and is confirmed by using the linear analyses on top of the stationary configuration. We uncover that the critical velocity associated with the maximum correspond to the case when the mean separation of vortices generated by interface instabilities becomes comparable to the vortex size, which could be a universal physical mechanism at strongly interacting superfluids and is directly testable in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Emergent (2+1)D topological orders from iterative (1+1)D gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauging introduces gauge fields in order to localize an existing global symmetry, resulting in a dual global symmetry on the gauge fields that can be gauged again. By iterating the gauging process on spin chains with Abelian group symmetries and arranging the gauge fields in a 2D lattice, the local symmetries become the stabilizer of the $XZZX$-code for any Abelian group. By twisting the gauging map we obtain new codes that explicitly confine anyons, which violate an odd number of plaquette terms and whose fusion results in mobile dipole excitations. Our construction naturally realizes any gapped boundary by taking different quantum phases of the initial (1+1)D globally symmetric system. Our method establishes a new route to obtain higher dimensional topological codes from lower ones, to identify their gapped boundaries and their tensor network representations.</description>

      <title>Anyonic statistics and slow quasiparticle dynamics in a graphene fractional quantum Hall interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyons are two dimensional particles with fractional exchange statistics that emerge as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall phases. Experimentally, anyonic statistics manifest directly in the edge-state Fabry-P\'erot interferometer geometry, where the presence of $N_{qp}$ localized anyons in the interferometer bulk contributes a phase $N_{qp} \theta_a$ to the observed interference pattern, where $\theta_a$ is twice the statistical exchange phase. Here, we report a measurement of $\theta_a$ in a monolayer graphene Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at $\nu$ = 1/3. We find a preponderance of phase slips with magnitudes $\Delta \theta \approx 2 \pi / 3$, confirming the result of past experiments in GaAs quantum wells and consistent with expectations for the tunneling of Abelian anyons into the interferometer bulk. In contrast to prior work, however, single anyon tunneling events manifest as instantaneous and irreversible phase slips, indicative of quasiparticle equilibration times exceeding 20 minutes in some cases. We use the discrepancy between the quasiparticle equilibration rate and our measurement speed to vary the interferometer area and $N_{qp}$ independently, allowing us to precisely determine the interferometer phase and monitor the entry and exit of individual anyons to the interferometer loop in the time domain. Besides providing a replication of previous interferometric measurements sensitive to $\theta_a$ in GaAs, our results bring anyon dynamics into the experimental regime and suggest that the average `topological charge' of a mesoscopic quantum Hall device can be held constant over hour long timescales.</description>

      <title>Stability of mixed-state quantum phases via finite Markov length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For quantum phases of Hamiltonian ground states, the energy gap plays a central role in ensuring the stability of the phase as long as the gap remains finite. We propose Markov length, the length scale at which the quantum conditional mutual information (CMI) decays exponentially, as an equally essential quantity characterizing mixed-state phases and transitions. For a state evolving under a local Lindbladian, we argue that if its Markov length remains finite along the evolution, then it remains in the same phase, meaning there exists another quasi-local Lindbladian evolution that can reverse the former one. We apply this diagnostic to toric code subject to decoherence and show that the Markov length is finite everywhere except at its decodability transition, at which it diverges. CMI in this case can be mapped to the free energy cost of point defects in the random bond Ising model. This implies that the mixed state phase transition coincides with the decodability transition and also suggests a quasi-local decoding channel.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>
