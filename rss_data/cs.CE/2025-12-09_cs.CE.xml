      <title>Small Language Models Can Use Nuanced Reasoning For Health Science Research Classification: A Microbial-Oncogenesis Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificially intelligent (AI) co-scientists must be able to sift through research literature cost-efficiently while applying nuanced scientific reasoning. We evaluate Small Language Models (SLMs, &lt;= 8B parameters) for classifying medical research papers. Using literature on the oncogenic potential of HMTV/MMTV-like viruses in breast cancer as a case study, we assess model performance with both zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL; few-shot prompting) strategies against frontier proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs). Llama 3 and Qwen2.5 outperform GPT-5 (API, low/high effort), Gemini 3 Pro Preview, and Meerkat in zero-shot settings, though trailing Gemini 2.5 Pro. ICL leads to improved performance on a case-by-case basis, allowing Llama 3 and Qwen2.5 to match Gemini 2.5 Pro in binary classification. Systematic lexical-ablation experiments show that SLM decisions are often grounded in valid scientific cues but can be influenced by spurious textual artifacts, underscoring need for interpretability in high-stakes pipelines. Our results reveal both promise and limitations of modern SLMs for scientific triage; pairing SLMs with simple but principled prompting strategies can approach performance of the strongest LLMs for targeted literature filtering in co-scientist pipelines.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model for Polycrystalline Material Informatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 3D polycrystal foundation model that learns a physically structured representation of voxel-based microstructures through large-scale self-supervised pretraining. The encoder is trained on a dataset of 100,000 FCC microstructures whose crystallographic orientations span the texture hull, using a masking strategy that forces the model to infer latent features from incomplete spatial information. The quality of the learned representation is evaluated through two downstream tasks with distinct physical characteristics. (i) Homogenized stiffness prediction: the pretrained encoder consistently outperforms the non-pretrained baseline across all masking ratios. (ii) Nonlinear response modeling: the encoder is coupled with an orientation-aware interaction-based deep material network (ODMN) to infer complete sets of network parameters, enabling accurate stress-strain predictions for previously unseen microstructures. In both tasks, the pretrained encoder demonstrates markedly stronger generalization capability. These results underscore the strong transferability of the proposed framework and its suitability for data-scarce scientific settings, where labeled microstructures are limited and physics-consistent generalization is essential. The foundation model provides a scalable route toward integration with experimentally derived microstructures, offering a new basis for microstructure-property reasoning in practical materials design.</description>

      <title>Crystallographic Texture-Generalizable Orientation-Aware Interaction-Based Deep Material Network for Polycrystal Modeling and Texture Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has significantly advanced materials modeling by enabling surrogate models that achieve high computational efficiency without compromising predictive accuracy. The Orientation-aware Interaction-based Deep Material Network (ODMN) is one such framework, in which a set of material nodes represents crystallographic textures, and a hierarchical interaction network enforces stress equilibrium among these nodes based on the Hill-Mandel condition. Using only linear elastic stiffness data, ODMN learns the intrinsic geometry-mechanics relationships within polycrystalline microstructures, allowing it to predict nonlinear mechanical responses and texture evolution with high fidelity. However, its applicability remains limited by the need to retrain for each distinct crystallographic texture. To address this limitation, we introduce the TACS-GNN-ODMN framework, which integrates (i) a Texture-Adaptive Clustering and Sampling (TACS) scheme for initializing texture-related parameters and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for predicting stress-equilibrium-related parameters. The proposed framework accurately predicts nonlinear responses and texture evolution across diverse textures, showing close agreement with direct numerical simulations (DNS). By eliminating the requirement for texture-specific retraining while preserving physical interpretability, TACS-GNN-ODMN substantially enhances the generalization capability of ODMN, offering a robust and efficient surrogate model for multiscale simulations and next-generation materials design.</description>

      <title>MATEX: A Multi-Agent Framework for Explaining Ethereum Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding a complicated Ethereum transaction remains challenging: multi-hop token flows, nested contract calls, and opaque execution paths routinely lead users to blind signing. Based on interviews with everyday users, developers, and auditors, we identify the need for faithful, step-wise explanations grounded in both on-chain evidence and real-world protocol semantics. To meet this need, we introduce (matex, a cognitive multi-agent framework that models transaction understanding as a collaborative investigation-combining rapid hypothesis generation, dynamic off-chain knowledge retrieval, evidence-aware synthesis, and adversarial validation to produce faithful explanations.</description>

      <title>Smooth geometry extraction from SIMP topology optimization: Signed distance function approach with volume preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel post-processing methodology for extracting high-quality geometries from density-based topology optimization results. Current post-processing approaches often struggle to simultaneously achieve smooth boundaries, preserve volume fraction, and maintain topological features. We propose a robust method based on a signed distance function (SDF) that addresses these challenges through a two-stage process: first, an SDF representation of density isocontours is constructed, which is followed by geometry refinement using radial basis functions (RBFs). The method generates smooth boundary representations that appear to originate from much finer discretizations while maintaining the computational efficiency of coarse mesh optimization. Through comprehensive validation, our approach demonstrates a 18% reduction in maximum equivalent stress values compared to conventional methods, achieved through continuous geometric transitions at boundaries. The resulting implicit boundary representation facilitates seamless export to standard manufacturing formats without intermediate reconstruction steps, providing a robust foundation for practical engineering applications where high-quality geometric representations are essential.</description>

      <title>DC-Biased Homogenized Harmonic Balance Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homogenized harmonic balance finite element (FE) method enables efficient nonlinear eddy-current simulations of 3-D devices with lamination stacks by combining the harmonic balance method with a frequency-domain-based homogenization technique. This approach avoids expensive time stepping of the eddy-current field problem and allows the use of a relatively coarse FE mesh that does not resolve the individual laminates. In this paper, we extend the method to handle excitation signals with a dc bias. To achieve this, we adapt the original homogenization technique to better account for ferromagnetic saturation. The resulting formula for the homogenized reluctivity is evaluated using a look-up table computed from a 1-D FE simulation of a lamination and containing the average magnetic flux density in the lamination and the corresponding skin depth. We compare the results of the proposed method to those from a fine-mesh transient reference simulation. The tests cover different levels of ferromagnetic saturation and frequencies between 50 Hz and 10 kHz. For moderate ferromagnetic saturation, the method gives a good approximation of the eddy-current losses and the magnetic energy, with relative errors below 10%, while reducing the required number of degrees of freedom at 10 kHz by 1.5 orders of magnitude. This results in a reduction in simulation time from 2 days on a contemporary server to 90 minutes on a standard workstation.</description>

      <title>Soft Computing Tools To Predict Varied Weight Components, Material and Tribological Properties of Al2219-B4C-Gr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft computing tools emerged as most reliable alternatives of traditional regression and statistical methods. In recent times, these tools can predict the optimum material compositions, mechanical and tribological properties of composite materials accurately without much experiment or even without experiment. In the present study, soft computing tools like fuzzy logic, Decision tree, genetic algorithms are employed to predict the reinforcement weight percentage of B4C(Boron Carbide) and Graphite(Gr) along with Aluminum (matrix material) weight percentage for Al2219 with B4C and graphite. The optimized material and tribological properties of Al2219 were also predicted using NSGA II genetic algorithms for multi-objective optimization. It is found that the predictions are at par with earlier ANN (artificial neural network) studies and experimental findings. It can be inferred that inclusion B4C has more impact on enhancement of mechanical properties as well as wear strength compared to Gr.</description>

      <title>Detrended cross-correlations and their random matrix limit: an example from the cryptocurrency market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlations in complex systems are often obscured by nonstationarity, long-range memory, and heavy-tailed fluctuations, which limit the usefulness of traditional covariance-based analyses. To address these challenges, we construct scale and fluctuation-dependent correlation matrices using the multifractal detrended cross-correlation coefficient $\rho_r$ that selectively emphasizes fluctuations of different amplitudes. We examine the spectral properties of these detrended correlation matrices and compare them to the spectral properties of the matrices calculated in the same way from synthetic Gaussian and $q$Gaussian signals. Our results show that detrending, heavy tails, and the fluctuation-order parameter $r$ jointly produce spectra, which substantially depart from the random case even under absence of cross-correlations in time series. Applying this framework to one-minute returns of 140 major cryptocurrencies from 2021-2024 reveals robust collective modes, including a dominant market factor and several sectoral components whose strength depends on the analyzed scale and fluctuation order. After filtering out the market mode, the empirical eigenvalue bulk aligns closely with the limit of random detrended cross-correlations, enabling clear identification of structurally significant outliers. Overall, the study provides a refined spectral baseline for detrended cross-correlations and offers a promising tool for distinguishing genuine interdependencies from noise in complex, nonstationary, heavy-tailed systems.</description>

      <title>Resource-Bounded Type Theory: Compositional Cost Analysis via Graded Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a compositional framework for certifying resource bounds in typed programs. Terms are typed with synthesized bounds drawn from an abstract resource lattice, enabling uniform treatment of time, memory, gas, and domain-specific costs.
  We introduce a graded feasibility modality with co-unit and monotonicity laws. Our main result is a syntactic cost soundness theorem for the recursion-free simply-typed fragment: if a closed term has synthesized bound b under a given budget, its operational cost is bounded by b. We provide a syntactic term model in the topos of presheaves over the lattice -- where resource bounds index a cost-stratified family of definable values -- with cost extraction as a natural transformation. We prove canonical forms via reification and establish initiality of the syntactic model: it embeds uniquely into all resource-bounded models.
  A case study demonstrates compositional reasoning for binary search using Lean's native recursion with separate bound proofs.</description>

      <title>Material Fingerprinting: A shortcut to material model discovery without solving optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Material Fingerprinting, a new method for the rapid discovery of mechanical material models from direct or indirect data that avoids solving potentially non-convex optimization problems. The core assumption of Material Fingerprinting is that each material exhibits a unique response when subjected to a standardized experimental setup. We can interpret this response as the material's fingerprint, essentially a unique identifier that encodes all pertinent information about the material's mechanical characteristics. Consequently, once we have established a database containing fingerprints and their corresponding mechanical models during an offline phase, we can rapidly characterize an unseen material in an online phase. This is accomplished by measuring its fingerprint and employing a pattern recognition algorithm to identify the best matching fingerprint in the database. In our study, we explore this concept in the context of hyperelastic materials, demonstrating the applicability of Material Fingerprinting across different experimental setups. Initially, we examine Material Fingerprinting through experiments involving homogeneous deformation fields, which provide direct strain-stress data pairs. We then extend this concept to experiments involving complexly shaped specimens with heterogeneous deformation fields, which provide indirect displacement and reaction force measurements. We show that, in both cases, Material Fingerprinting is an efficient tool for model discovery, bypassing the challenges of potentially non-convex optimization. We believe that Material Fingerprinting provides a powerful and generalizable framework for rapid material model identification across a wide range of experimental designs and material behaviors, paving the way for numerous future developments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.13723v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose novel scale-invariant error estimators for the Monte Carlo and multilevel Monte Carlo estimation of mean and variance. For any linear transformation of the distribution of the quantity of interest, the computation cost across fidelity levels is optimized using a normalized error estimate, which is not only fully dimensionless but also remains robust to variation in characteristics of the distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms through application to a mechanical simulation of linear elastic bone tissue, where material uncertainty incorporating both heterogeneity and random anisotropy is considered in the constitutive law.</description>

      <title>Golden Touchstone: A Comprehensive Bilingual Benchmark for Evaluating Financial Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly permeate the financial sector, there is a pressing need for a standardized method to comprehensively assess their performance. Existing financial benchmarks often suffer from limited language and task coverage, low-quality datasets, and inadequate adaptability for LLM evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce Golden Touchstone, a comprehensive bilingual benchmark for financial LLMs, encompassing eight core financial NLP tasks in both Chinese and English. Developed from extensive open-source data collection and industry-specific demands, this benchmark thoroughly assesses models' language understanding and generation capabilities. Through comparative analysis of major models such as GPT-4o, Llama3, FinGPT, and FinMA, we reveal their strengths and limitations in processing complex financial information. Additionally, we open-source Touchstone-GPT, a financial LLM trained through continual pre-training and instruction tuning, which demonstrates strong performance on the bilingual benchmark but still has limitations in specific tasks. This research provides a practical evaluation tool for financial LLMs and guides future development and optimization. The source code for Golden Touchstone and model weight of Touchstone-GPT have been made publicly available at https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/Golden-Touchstone.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Industrial Anomalies Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper comprehensively reviews anomaly synthesis methodologies. Existing surveys focus on limited techniques, missing an overall field view and understanding method interconnections. In contrast, our study offers a unified review, covering about 40 representative methods across Hand-crafted, Distribution-hypothesis-based, Generative models (GM)-based, and Vision-language models (VLM)-based synthesis. We introduce the first industrial anomaly synthesis (IAS) taxonomy. Prior works lack formal classification or use simplistic taxonomies, hampering structured comparisons and trend identification. Our taxonomy provides a fine-grained framework reflecting methodological progress and practical implications, grounding future research. Furthermore, we explore cross-modality synthesis and large-scale VLM. Previous surveys overlooked multimodal data and VLM in anomaly synthesis, limiting insights into their advantages. Our survey analyzes their integration, benefits, challenges, and prospects, offering a roadmap to boost IAS with multimodal learning.

Abstract: Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</description>

      <title>Generative Large-Scale Pre-trained Models for Automated Ad Bidding Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern advertisers. Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing scenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery platforms, leading to a 2.18% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and 10.68% increase in ROI.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal wall pressure forecast of a rectangular cylinder with physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The wall pressure is of great importance in understanding the forces and structural responses induced by fluid. Recent works have investigated the potential of deep learning techniques in predicting mean pressure coefficients and fluctuating pressure coefficients, but most of existing deep learning frameworks are limited to predicting a single snapshot using full spatial information. To forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure of flow past a rectangular cylinder, this study develops a physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural Network (DeepUFNet) deep learning model. DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure and the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control embedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance. Wind tunnel testing was performed to collect wall pressures on two-dimensional rectangular cylinders using high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for DeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found capable of forecasting spatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy on the rectangular cylinder with side ratio 1.5. The comparison between forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in statistical information and physical interpretation. It is also found that embedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient b in the DeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting spatiotemporal wall pressure information, particularly, high-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the DeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information input, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability. Last, the DeepUFNet is tested for generalization in unseen cases, rectangular cylinders with side ratio 4 and 3.75, and the model presents satisfactory generalization ability.</description>

      <title>A coupled finite element-virtual element method for thermomechanical analysis of electronic packaging structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a finite element and virtual element (FE-VE) coupled method for thermomechanical analysis in electronic packaging structures. The approach partitions computational domains strategically, employing FEM for regular geometries to maximize computational efficiency and VEM for complex shapes to enhance geometric flexibility. Interface compatibility is maintained through coincident nodal correspondence, ensuring solution continuity across domain boundaries while reducing meshing complexity and computational overhead. Validation through electronic packaging applications demonstrates reasonable agreement with reference solutions and acceptable convergence characteristics across varying mesh densities. The method effectively captures thermal distributions and stress concentrations in multi-material systems, establishing a practical computational framework for electronic packaging analysis involving complex geometries.

      <title>AI-Assisted Game Management Decisions: A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Real-Time Soccer Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.</description>
