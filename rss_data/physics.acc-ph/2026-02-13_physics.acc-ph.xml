      <title>Fermilab PIP II machine protection system digitized data noise elimination scheme and its FPGA implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Fermilab's PIP-II machine protection system, beam loss signals from various detectors are digitized at 125 MS/s. Noise from both high-frequency sources and low-frequency 60 Hz AC power equipment can contaminate the data. To suppress noise across these ranges especially 60 Hz and its harmonics, which overlap with beam loss signal frequencies advanced digital processing beyond standard filtering is required. Several real-time functional blocks were simulated and tested on an FPGA: (1) a dual time-constant discharging integrator filter, (2) a de-ripple baseline extraction and storage block, and (3) a fast-recovery discharging integrator. The nonlinear IIR integrator filter removes high-frequency noise and feeds into the baseline extractor. Upon detecting abrupt beam loss, it switches to a longer time constant to prevent baseline distortion. The de-ripple block calculates a valid baseline by averaging over multiple 60 Hz periods, storing results in a 4096-word FPGA RAM. This baseline is subtracted from raw data before integration by the fast-recovery block, which resets quickly after use. All blocks achieved expected performance.</description>

      <title>Intrabeam Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrabeam scattering refers to the effects of the Coulomb interaction acting between pairs of charged particles within a bunch in an accelerator. One of the main consequences of intrabeam scattering is a change in the emittances of a bunch: in some circumstances (in particular, in hadron storage rings operating above transition), the transverse and longitudinal emittances may grow over time without limit. This may restrict the performance of machines for which maintaining low beam emittance is an important requirement. In this note, we describe some of the models used to analyse the effects of intrabeam scattering, and present in particular the Piwinski formulae for the emittance growth rates. We compare the predicted changes in emittance with measurements in a number of machines operating in different parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Sextupole reduction via chaos suppression at the National Synchrotron Light Source II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the nonlinear lattice design approach for the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) storage ring. By suppressing chaos, we identify alternative sextupole configurations to the original design, which relied on the conventional strategy of simultaneously minimizing Resonance Driving Terms (RDT) and Amplitude-Dependent Detuning (ADD). These alternatives achieve comparable performance while requiring fewer sextupoles. A detailed comparison of two representative solutions is presented and supported by experimental validation. Our results show that the dynamic aperture correlates more strongly with global chaos than with individual RDTs, and that the importance of minimizing ADD may have been overstated in earlier design strategies.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Tests of Laser Control of Electron Beams for Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-driven Compton backscattering (CBS) has been proposed as method for controlling the intensity of colliding bunches in the FCC-ee so as to avoid the flip-flop instability caused by intensity asymmetry in colliding bunches. Laser-based collimation has also been proposed as an indestructible collimator for high-intensity electron beams. We have initiated a laboratory-based test program of these concepts with the E344 experiment at FACET-II. In this paper, we describe simulations of laser-beam interactions at FACET-II and the relevant scaling for FCC-ee. We also describe the experimental setup and diagnostics that will be used to make the measurements at FACET-II.</description>
