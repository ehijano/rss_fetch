      <title>Order Bounds for Hypergeometric and q-Hypergeometric Creative Telescoping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging a general framework adapted from symbolic integration, a unified reduction-based algorithm for computing telescopers of minimal order for hypergeometric and q-hypergeometric terms has been recently developed. In this paper, we conduct a deeper exploration and put forth a new argument for the termination of the algorithm. This not only provides an independent proof of existence of telescopers, but also allows us to derive unified upper and lower bounds on the order of telescopers for hypergeometric terms and their q-analogues. Compared with known bounds in the literature, our bounds, in the hypergeometric case, are exactly the same as the tight ones obtained in 2016; while in the q-hypergeometric case, no lower bounds were known before, and our upper bound is sometimes better and never worse than the known one.</description>

      <title>ABD: Default Exception Abduction in Finite First Order Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ABD, a benchmark for default-exception abduction over finite first-order worlds. Given a background theory with an abnormality predicate and a set of relational structures, a model must output a first-order formula that defines exceptions, restoring satisfiability while keeping exceptions sparse. We formalize three observation regimes (closed-world, existential completion, universal completion) with exact SMT verification. Evaluating ten frontier LLMs on 600 instances, the best models achieve high validity but parsimony gaps remain, and holdout evaluation reveals distinct generalization failure modes across regimes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Collaboration of Arena-Based Argumentative LLMs for Explainable and Contestable Legal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only high accuracy but also the ability to justify decisions through verifiable and contestable arguments. However, existing Large Language Model (LLM) approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), often produce unstructured explanations that lack a formal mechanism for verification or user intervention. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive Collaboration of Argumentative LLMs (ACAL), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates adaptive multi-agent collaboration with an Arena-based Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (A-QBAF). ACAL dynamically deploys expert agent teams to construct arguments, employs a clash resolution mechanism to adjudicate conflicting claims, and utilizes uncertainty-aware escalation for borderline cases. Crucially, our framework supports a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) contestability workflow, enabling users to directly audit and modify the underlying reasoning graph to influence the final judgment. Empirical evaluations on the LegalBench benchmark demonstrate that ACAL outperforms strong baselines across Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite and Gemini-2.5-Flash architectures, effectively balancing efficient predictive performance with structured transparency and contestability. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/loc110504/ACAL.</description>

      <title>A Formal Framework for Predicting Distributed System Performance under Faults (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19088v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's distributed systems operate in complex environments that inevitably involve faults and even adversarial behaviors. Predicting their performance under such environments directly from formal designs remains a longstanding challenge. We present the first formal framework that systematically enables performance prediction of distributed systems across diverse faulty scenarios. Our framework features a fault injector together with a wide range of faults, reusable as a library, and model compositions that integrate the system and the fault injector into a unified model suitable for statistical analysis of performance properties such as throughput and latency. We formalize the framework in Maude and implement it as an automated tool, PERF. Applied to representative distributed systems, PERF accurately predicts system performance under varying fault settings, with estimations from formal designs consistent with evaluations on real deployments.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Hairpins and BasePairs in RNA Secondary Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive precise asymptotic expressions for the expectations, variances, covariance, and quite a few further mixed moments for the number of hairpins and the number of basepairs in RNA secondary structures, and give convincing evidence that the central-scaled distribution of the pair of random variables (hairpins, basepairs) tends in distribution to the bi-variate normal distribution with correlation $\sqrt{5 \sqrt{5} -11}/2= 0.2123322205\dots$</description>

      <title>A Flow Extension to Coroutine Types for Deadlock Detection in Go</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coroutines, as an abstract programming construct, are a generalization of functions that can suspend execution part- way for later resumption. Coroutine Types are behavioral types to model interactions of coroutines with a single receiving operation followed by a single yielding operation. Coroutine Types have been applied to model-driven engineering, smart contracts, and test case generation. We contribute a Flow extension to Coroutine Types, so that coroutines with more than one receiving and yielding operation can be modeled. We accordingly revise the reduction rules of Coroutine Types. To show the usefulness of the Flow extension, we contribute a type system that maps expressions of the Go programming language to Coroutine Types. If the reduction result is 0, the two channel operations are paired properly and the program has no deadlocks. We choose Go because it is a popular programming language for distributed systems, but a frequent kind of bugs in Go is deadlocks due to the wrong use of concurrency features. We concentrate on the most commonly used semantics in Go: unbuffered channels with the keywords go and defer. Our Flow extension and the type system recognize 17 patterns of channels and goroutine interactions, including mismatched receivers and senders, nested goroutines, etc. We also integrate the Z3 SMT solver to take account of conditional execution and type inheritance. Other static or dynamic deadlock detectors crashed or gave wrong predictions in some patterns. Therefore, our type-based deadlock analyzer not only fills the gap in the landscape of value-based detection, but also complements existing detectors.</description>

      <title>On Exact Reznick, Hilbert-Artin and Putinar's Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.10062v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing exact sums of squares (SOS) decompositions for certain classes of non-negative multivariate polynomials, relying on semidefinite programming (SDP) solvers.
  We provide a hybrid numeric-symbolic algorithm computing exact rational SOS decompositions with rational coefficients for polynomials lying in the interior of the SOS cone. The first step of this algorithm computes an approximate SOS decomposition for a perturbation of the input polynomial with an arbitrary-precision SDP solver. Next, an exact SOS decomposition is obtained thanks to the perturbation terms and a compensation phenomenon. We prove that bit complexity estimates on output size and runtime are both singly exponential in the cardinality of the Newton polytope (or doubly exponential in the number of variables). Next, we apply this algorithm to compute exact Reznick, Hilbert-Artin's representation and Putinar's representations respectively for positive definite forms and positive polynomials over basic compact semi-algebraic sets. We also report on practical experiments done with the implementation of these algorithms and existing alternatives such as the critical point method and cylindrical algebraic decomposition.</description>

      <title>AbstRaL: Augmenting LLMs' Reasoning by Reinforcing Abstract Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially smaller ones, often lack robustness in grade school math (GSM) reasoning. In particular, they tend to experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In this work, we instead focus on the strategy of "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. Focusing on GSM, we find that this abstraction process is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method, AbstRaL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent GSM perturbation benchmarks. Besides, improving GSM robustness via AbstRaL is shown to also implicitly benefit LLMs' capabilities on OOD mathematical and general reasoning tasks, indicating that abstract thinking broadly enables better generalizability.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Simplification Bottleneck in Amortized Neural Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08885v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover interpretable analytical expressions that accurately describe observed data. Amortized SR promises to be much more efficient than the predominant genetic programming SR methods, but currently struggles to scale to realistic scientific complexity. We find that a key obstacle is the lack of a fast reduction of equivalent expressions to a concise normalized form. Amortized SR has addressed this by general-purpose Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) like SymPy, but the high computational cost severely limits training and inference speed. We propose SimpliPy, a rule-based simplification engine achieving a 100-fold speed-up over SymPy at comparable quality. This enables substantial improvements in amortized SR, including scalability to much larger training sets, more efficient use of the per-expression token budget, and systematic training set decontamination with respect to equivalent test expressions. We demonstrate these advantages in our Flash-ANSR framework, which achieves much better accuracy than amortized baselines (NeSymReS, E2E) on the FastSRB benchmark. Moreover, it performs on par with state-of-the-art direct optimization (PySR) while recovering more concise instead of more complex expressions with increasing inference budget.</description>
