      <description>arXiv:2510.21987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative algebroids provide a framework that unifies Lie algebroids with partial differential equations. In this set of notes, we explain how relative algebroids arise from geometric problems, and give an introduction to their structural theory. We also discuss their relation to and relevance for partial differential equations with symmetry.</description>

      <title>Ricci Flow on ALF manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that on ALF $n$-manifolds with $n\ge 4$ the Ricci flow preserves the ALF structure, and develop a weighted Fredholm framework adapted to ALF manifolds. Motivated by Perelman's $\lambda$-functional, we define a renormalized functional $\lambda_{\mathrm{ALF}}$ whose gradient flow is the Ricci flow. It is built from a relative mass with respect to a reference Ricci-flat metric at infinity. This yields a natural notion of variational and linear stability for Ricci-flat ALF $4$-metrics and lets us show that the conformally K\"ahler, non-hyperk\"ahler examples are dynamically unstable along Ricci flow. We finally relate the sign of $\lambda_{\mathrm{ALF}}$ to positive relative mass statements for ALF metrics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we develop, via the least squares variational method, the Lagrange-Hamilton geometry (in the sense of nonlinear connections, d-torsions and Lagrangian Yang-Mills electromagnetic-like energy) produced by a dynamical system governing the spreading of COVID-19 disease. The Jacobi stability of this dynamical system is also discussed.</description>

      <title>On Generalized Matsumoto Metrics with a Special $\pi$-form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a generalization of Matsumoto metric intrinsically. Given a Finsler manifold $(M,F)$ which admits a concurrent $\pi$-vector field $\overline{\varphi}$, we consider the change $\widehat{F}(x,y)=\frac {F^2 (x,y)} {F(x,y)-\Phi(x,y)}$, where $\Phi$ is the associated concurrent $\pi$-form with $F(x,y) &gt; \Phi(x,y)$ for all $(x,y) \in \T M$. We find the condition under which the generalized $\phi$-Matsumoto metric $\widehat{F}$ is a Finsler metric. Moreover, the relations between the associated Finslerian geometric objects of $\widehat{F}$ and $F$ are obtained, namely, the relations between angular metric tensors, metric tensors, Cartan torsions, geodesic sprays, Barthel connections (along with its curvature) and Berwald connections. Further, we prove that the Finsler metrics $F$ and $\widehat{F}$ can never be projectively related. Also, a condition for the $\pi$-vector field $\overline{\varphi}$ to be concurrent with respect to $\widehat{F}$ is acquired. Moreover, an example of a rational Finsler metric admitting a concurrent $\pi$-vector field together with the associated change $\widehat{F}$ is provided. Finally, we find the conditions that preserve the almost rationality property of a Finsler metric $F$ under the $\phi$-Matsumoto change.</description>

      <title>On the generalized $m$-Kropina metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized $m$-Kropina metrics appear naturally as a spacetime geometry compatible with Lorentz symmetry breaking, leading to useful applications in modified gravity and cosmology. We prove that a generalized $m$-Kropina metric $F$ is an almost rational Finsler metric. Thereby, we study the rationality of its Finslerian geometric objects in the directional variable $y$. For example, its geodesic spray coefficients are rational in $y$. Consequently, we prove that if $F$ is an Einstein metric with $m \notin \mathbb{Z}$, then it is Ricci-flat. Moreover, for $m \in 2 \mathbb{Z}$, if $F$ has isotropic mean Berwald curvature, or has relatively isotropic Landsberg curvature, or has almost vanishing $\mathbf{H}$-curvature, then $F$ is weakly Berwaldian, or $F$ is Landsbergian, or $\mathbf{H}=0$, respectively. We, hence, deduce under what conditions a generalized $m$-Kropina metric $F$ becomes an exact solution to either "Chen and Shen's Finslerian nonvcuum field equations"or "Pfeifer and Wohlfath's vacuum field equation". Finally, some examples of generalized $m$-Kropina metrics in dimension $4$, which has significant applications in modified gravity and cosmology, are provided.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show $L^1$-bounds of the Riemann curvature tensor on a smooth closed $n$-dimensional Ricci flow. To achieve this we introduce the notion of a neck of maximal symmetry, similar to the one in Cheeger-Jiang-Naber and Jiang-Naber and establish a decomposition result by balls with uniform curvature bounds that satisfy an appropriate $(n-2)$-content estimate.</description>

      <title>The natural reductivity in Finsler geometry in terms of geodesic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new geometrical definition of naturally reductive Finsler manifold using geodeic graph is proposed, with a possible generalization. Based on a construction from a recent paper by the authors, Finsler metrics based on naturally reductive Riemannian metrics $g_i$ are studied. Explicit examples of purely Finsler naturally reductive $\alpha_i$-type metrics are constructed. Geodesic graphs on broad classes of Finsler $\alpha_i$-type metrics $F$ which are derived from naturally reductive Riemannian metrics and which are not naturally reductive are described. The influence of one-forms $\beta_j$ to the structure of geodesics of the metric $F$ is also demonstrated and explicit construction of families of Finsler naturally reductive metrics of the $(\alpha_i,\beta_j)$-type is described.</description>

      <title>Splitting and Slow Volume Growth for Open Manifolds with Nonnegative Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{NPZ24}, Navarro-Pan-Zhu proved that the fundamental group of an open manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature and linear volume growth contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^k$ with finite index. They further asked whether the existence of a torsion-free element in the fundamental group forces the universal cover to split off an isometric $\mathbb{R}$-factor (Question 1.3 of \cite{NPZ24}).
  In this article, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Specifically, we prove that if an open manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature has linear volume growth, then its universal cover is isometric to a metric product $\mathbb{R}^k \times N$, where $N$ is an open manifold with linear volume growth and $k$ is the integer such that $\pi_1(M)$ contains a $\mathbb{Z}^k$-subgroup of finite index. As a direct consequence, if the Ricci curvature is positive at some point, then the fundamental group is finite.
  We also establish that for an open manifold $M$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature and nondegenerate quadratic volume growth, the universal cover $\tilde{M}$ splits off an $\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$-factor whenever $\tilde{M}$ has Euclidean volume growth. In particular, if $M$ has first Betti number $b_1 = n-2$ and nondegenerate quadratic volume growth, then its universal cover admits such a splitting. This result provides a partial answer to \cite[Question 1.6]{PY24}.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional flying wing Steady Ricci Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $n\geq 4$, we construct an $(n-2)$-parameter family of steady gradient Ricci solitons with non-negative curvature operator and prescribed by the eigenvalues of Ricci tensor at the unique critical point of the soliton potential. Among them lies an $(n-3)$-parameter subfamily of non-collapsed solitons. These solitons generalized the flying wings constructed by the second named author. Our approach is based on constructing continuous families of smooth Ricci flows emanating from continuous families of spherical polyhedra. This is built upon a combination of a new stability result of Ricci flows with scaling invariant estimates and the method of Gianniotis-Schulze in regularizing manifolds with singularities.</description>

      <title>Mean curvature flow into an ambient Riemannian manifold evolving by Ricci flow coupled with harmonic map heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this article is to study the mean curvature flow into an ambient compact smooth manifold M with boundary and with a Riemannian metric that evolves by a self-similar solution of the Ricci flow coupled with the harmonic map heat flow of a map from M to a Riemannian manifold N. In this context, we address a functional associated with this flow and calculate its variation along parameters that preserve the weighted volume measure. An extension of Hamilton's differential Harnack expression appears by considering the boundary of M evolving by mean curvature flow, which must vanish on the gradient steady soliton case. Next, we obtain a Huisken monotonicity-type formula for the mean curvature flow in the proposed background. We also show how to construct a family of mean curvature solitons and establish a characterization of such a family.</description>

      <title>Non-compact inaudibility of Naturally Reductive property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naturally reductive manifolds are an important class of Riemannian manifolds because they provide examples that generalize the locally symmetric ones. A property is said to be inaudible if there exists a unitary operator which intertwines the Laplace-Beltrami operator of two Riemannian manifolds such that one of them satisfies the property and the other does not.
  In this paper, we study the relation between 2-step nilpotent Lie groups and the naturally reductive property to prove that this property is inaudible, using a pair of non-compact 11-dimensional generalized Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence of cylindrical singularity in mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a rescaled mean curvature flow is a global graph over the round cylinder with small gradient and converges super-exponentially fast, then it must coincide with the cylinder itself. We also show that the result is sharp with counter-examples of local graphs at arbitrarily super-exponential convergence rate with the domain expanding arbitrarily fast.
  The first part provides the first unique continuation result in the cylindrical setting, the generic singularity model in mean curvature flow. In sharp contrast, in the second part we construct infinite-dimensional families of Tikhonov-type examples for nonlinear equations, including the rescaled mean curvature flow, showing that unique continuation fails for local graphical solutions. These examples demonstrate the essential role of global graphical assumptions in rigidity and highlight new phenomena absent in the compact case. We also construct non-product mean curvature flows that develop singular sets as prescribed lower dimensional Euclidean space at arbitrary super-exponential rates. Our construction works in great generality for a large class of non-linear equations.</description>

      <title>Lax-Kirchhoff moduli spaces and Hamiltonian 2D TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Lax-Kirchhoff moduli space associated with a finite quiver $\Gamma$ and a compact connected Lie group $G$. On each oriented edge we consider the Lax equation $\dot{A}_1 + [A_0, A_1] = 0$ and impose a Kirchhoff-type matching condition for the fields $A_1$ at interior vertices. Modulo gauge transformations trivial on the boundary, this yields a moduli space $\mathcal{M}(\Gamma)$. We prove that $\mathcal{M}(\Gamma)$ is a finite-dimensional smooth symplectic manifold carrying a Hamiltonian action of $G^{\partial\Gamma}$ whose moment map records the boundary values of $A_1$. Analytically, we construct slices for the infinite-dimensional gauge action and realize $\mathcal{M}(\Gamma)$ by Marsden-Weinstein reduction. For the quiver consisting of a single edge, we recover the classical identification $\mathcal{M} \cong T^*G$. In general, we identify $\mathcal{M}(\Gamma)$ with a symplectic reduction of $T^*G^E$ by $G^{\Gamma_{\mathrm{int}}}$, where $E$ is the set of edges and $\Gamma_{\mathrm{int}}$ is the set of interior vertices. We further show that $\mathcal{M}(\Gamma)$ is invariant under quiver homotopies, implying that it depends only on the surface with boundary obtained by thickening $\Gamma$. We then assemble these spaces into a two-dimensional topological quantum field theory valued in a category of Hamiltonian spaces.</description>

      <title>Geodesics on an arbitrary ellipsoid of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00492v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algorithms given in Karney, J. Geodesy 87, 43-55 (2013), to compute geodesics on terrestrial ellipsoids are extended to apply to ellipsoids of revolution with arbitrary eccentricity. For the direct and inverse geodesic problems, this entails implementing the formulation in terms of elliptic integrals given by Legendre and Cayley. The integral for the area of geodesic polygons is computed in terms of the discrete sine transform of the integrand. In all cases, accuracy close to full machine precision is achieved. An open-source implementation of these algorithms is available.</description>

      <title>Bergman kernels over polarized K\"ahler manifolds, Bergman logarithmic flatness, and a question of Lu-Tian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a complete K\"ahler manifold, and let $(L, h) \to M$ be a positive line bundle inducing a K\"ahler metric $g$ on $M$. We study two Bergman kernels in this setting: the Bergman kernel of the disk bundle of the dual line bundle $(L^*, h^*)$, and the Bergman kernel of the line bundle $(L^k, h^k)$, $k\geq 1$, twisted by the canonical line bundle of $(M, g)$. We first prove a localization result for the former Bergman kernel. Then we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for this Bergman kernel to have no logarithmic singularity, expressed in terms of the Tian-Yau-Zelditch-Catlin type expansion of the latter Bergman kernel. This result, in particular, answers a question posed by Lu and Tian. As an application, we show that if $(M, g)$ is compact and locally homogeneous, then the circle bundle of $(L^*, h^*)$ is necessarily Bergman logarithmically flat.</description>

Abstract: Geometric data analysis and learning has emerged as a distinct and rapidly developing research area, increasingly recognized for its effectiveness across diverse applications. At the heart of this field lies curvature, a powerful and interpretable concept that captures intrinsic geometric structure and underpins numerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide range of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data representations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and point clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient characterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in geometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their mathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical applications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete curvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a systematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis. We further examine the corresponding computational algorithms across different data representations, offering detailed comparisons and insights. Finally, we review state-of-the-art applications of curvature in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This survey provides a conceptual and practical roadmap for researchers to gain a better understanding of discrete curvature as a fundamental tool for geometric understanding and learning.</description>

      <title>Singularities of the Lagrangian mean curvature flow at the critical Lagrangian phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish interior estimates for singularities of the Lagrangian mean curvature flow when the Lagrangian phase is critical, i.e., $|\Theta|\geq (n-2)\tfrac{\pi}{2}$, and extend our results to the broader class of Lagrangian mean curvature type equations. Our gradient estimates require certain structural conditions, and we construct $C^{\alpha}$ singular viscosity solutions to show that criticality of the phase is necessary, and that these conditions cannot be removed in dimension one. We also introduce a new method for proving $C^{2,\alpha}$ estimates by exponentiating the arctangent operator into a concave one when $|\Theta|\geq (n-2)\tfrac{\pi}{2}$ and $n&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Regularity for H\"older continuous Hamiltonian Stationary Lagrangian graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish optimal regularity for H\"older continuous Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian graphs in $\mathbb{C}^n$. We prove that such a graph is smooth whenever its H\"older exponent is strictly larger than $\frac{1}{3}$ and the Lagrangian phase is supercritical, which yields semi-convexity of the potential. We establish the optimality of our result by constructing explicit singular solutions to the fourth order Hamiltonian stationary equation when the H\"older exponent of the graph is $\frac{1}{3}$. The singular solutions exist even under the strongest convexity assumption on the Lagrangian phase, namely the hypercritical phase, which enforces convexity of the potential. This presents a striking departure from the theory of special Lagrangian graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish interior Hessian and gradient estimates for the two-dimensional Lagrangian mean curvature equation when the phase changes signs, provided the gradient of the phase vanishes along its zero set. At the critical phase in two dimensions, the Jacobi inequality degenerates, preventing the use of higher-dimensional methods to obtain Hessian estimates. To address this difficulty, we introduce a modified doubling technique that applies to degenerate Jacobi inequalities and yields interior estimates.</description>

      <title>Generalized boundary rigidity and minimal surface transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalized boundary rigidity problem, which investigates whether the areas of embedded minimal surfaces can uniquely determine a Riemannian manifold with boundary. We prove that for a conformal perturbation of an analytic metric in dimension $n+1$ ($n \geq 2$), the metric is determined by these volumes under an ampleness condition. Furthermore, we establish H\"older stability for this determination. This result extends earlier works in dimension $2+1$. Instead of relying on reductions to Calder\'on type problems and complex geometrical optics solutions, we study the linearized forward operator that gives rise to the minimal surface transform, a generalization of the X-ray/Radon transform. We demonstrate that this transform fits into the framework of double fibration transforms and satisfies the Bolker condition in the sense of Guillemin. Under certain assumptions, including a foliation condition, we prove invertibility of this transform on an analytic manifold as well as recovery of the analytic wave front set. The methods developed in this paper offer new tools for addressing the generalized boundary rigidity problem and expand the scope of applications of double fibration transforms. We anticipate that these techniques will also be applicable to other geometric inverse problems. Beyond mathematics, our results have implications for the AdS/CFT correspondence in physics.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Morse index of unstable closed minimal hypersurface $\Sigma$ in a compact semi-simple Riemannian symmetric space $M=G/K$ is bounded from below by constant times the first Betti number of $\Sigma$. Our proof is based on a natural extension of the previous method and this also provides a novel approach for the index estimate.</description>

Abstract: We give an explicit description of the Fefferman metric for twistor CR manifolds in terms of Riemannian structures on the base conformal 3-manifolds. As an application, we prove that chains and null chains on twistor CR manifolds project to conformal geodesics, and that any conformal geodesic has lifts both to a chain and a null chain. By using this correspondence, we give a variational characterization of conformal geodesics in dimension three which involves the total torsion functional.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$-manifolds for some $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bauer-Furuta invariant of a family of smooth 4-manifolds is a stable cohomotopy refinement of the families Seiberg-Witten invariant and is constructed from a finite dimensional approximation of the Seiberg-Witten monopole map. We prove a general formula for the families Bauer-Furuta invariant of a fibrewise connected sum, extending Bauer's non-parameterised formula. In a subsequent paper, we will use this formula to derive a general connected sum formula for the families Seiberg-Witten invariant which incorporates both the families blow-up formula of Liu and the gluing formula of Baraglia-Konno.</description>

In the case of hyperbolic space, the statement still holds if $C$ is a Jordan curve.</description>

Abstract: Let $S$ be a complete flat surface, such as the Euclidean plane. We determine the homeomorphism class of the space of all curves on $S$ which start and end at given points in given directions and whose curvatures are constrained to lie in a given open interval, in terms of all parameters involved. Any connected component of such a space is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to an $n$-sphere, and every $n\geq 1$ is realizable. Explicit homotopy equivalences between the components and the corresponding spheres are constructed.</description>

      <title>A Miyaoka-Yau inequality for hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{CP}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{CP}^n$. We define a quadratic form $Q$ on $\mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{H}}$ that is entirely determined by the intersection poset of $\mathcal{H}$. Using the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for parabolic bundles, we show that if $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{H}}$ is such that the weighted arrangement $(\mathcal{H}, \mathbf{a})$ is stable, then $Q(\mathbf{a}) \leq 0$.
  As an application, we consider the symmetric case where all the weights are equal. The inequality $Q(a, \ldots, a) \leq 0$ gives a lower bound for the total sum of multiplicities of codimension $2$ intersection subspaces of $\mathcal{H}$. The lower bound is attained when every $H \in \mathcal{H}$ intersects all the other members of $\mathcal{H} \setminus \{H\}$ along $(1-2/(n+1))|\mathcal{H}| + 1$ codimension $2$ subspaces; extending from $n=2$ to higher dimensions a condition found by Hirzebruch for line arrangements in the complex projective plane.</description>

      <title>Generic Structural Stability for $2 \times 2$ Systems of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof of generic structural stability for Riemann solutions to $2 \times 2$ system of hyperbolic conservation laws in one spatial variable, without diffusive terms. This means that for almost every left and right state, shocks and rarefaction solutions of the same type are preserved via perturbations of the flux functions, the left state, and the right state. The main assumptions for this proof involve standard assumptions on strict hyperbolicity and genuine non-linearity, a technical assumption on directionality of rarefaction curves, and the regular manifold (submersion) assumption motivated by concepts in differential topology. We show that the structural stability of the Riemann solutions is related to the transversality of the Hugoniot loci and rarefaction curves in the state space. The regular manifold assumption is required to invoke a variant of a theorem from differential topology, Thom's parametric transversality theorem, to show the genericity of transversality of these curves. This in turn implies the genericity of structural stability. We then apply this theorem to two examples: the p-system and a $2 \times 2$ system governing the evolution of gravity-driven monodisperse particle-laden thin films. In particular, we illustrate how one can verify all the above assumptions for the former, and apply the theorem to different numerical and physical aspects of the system governing the latter.</description>

      <title>De Rham Theory in Derived Differential Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the question: What is the de Rham theory for general differentiable spaces? We identify two potential answers and study them. In the first part, we show that the de Rham cohomology calculated using (the completion of) the exterior algebra of the cotangent complex yields non-trivial local invariants for singular differentiable spaces. In particular, in some cases, it differs from the constant sheaf cohomology, which provides an obstruction for the de Rham comparison map to be an equivalence. Moreover, we provide conditions under which this local invariant trivializes, yielding a de Rham-type isomorphism. In the second part, we show that for a suitably defined de Rham stack, there is always an isomorphism between functions on it and constant sheaf cohomology of the underlying topological space. Consequently, there exists a version of the de Rham theorem for singular differentiable spaces which holds with almost no restrictions. Finally, we sketch a generalization of this result to other theories of smooth functions, such as holomorphic or analytic functions. The last part is thus related to analytic de Rham stacks of Rodriguez Camargo used by Scholze to geometrize the local Langlands correspondence.</description>

      <title>Geometric Convergence to an Extreme Limit Space with nonnegative scalar curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2014, Gromov conjectured that sequences of manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature should have subsequences which converge in some geometric sense to limit spaces with some notion of generalized nonnegative scalar curvature. In recent joint work with Changliang Wang, the authors found a sequence of warped product Riemannian metrics on $\Sph^2\times \Sph^1$ with nonnegative scalar curvature whose metric tensors converge in the $W^{1,p}$ sense for $p&lt;2$ to an extreme warped product limit space where the warping function hits infinity at two points. Here we study this extreme limit space as a metric space and as an integral current space and prove the sequence converges in the volume preserving intrinsic flat and measured Gromov-Hausdorff sense to this space. This limit space may now be used to test any proposed definitions for generalized nonnegative scalar curvature. One does not need expertise in Geometric Measure Theory or in Intrinsic Flat Convergence to read this paper.</description>
