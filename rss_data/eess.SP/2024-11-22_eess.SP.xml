      <title>Which Channel, Low-rank or Full-rank, more needs RIS?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RIS, as an efficient tool to improve receive signal-to-noise ratio, extend coverage and create more spatial diversity, is viewed as a most promising technique for the future wireless networks like 6G. As you know, IRS is very suitable for a special wireless scenario with wireless link between BS and users being completely blocked. In this paper, we extend its applications to a general scenario, i.e., rank-deficient-channel, particularly some extremely low-rank ones such as no link, and line-of-sight (LoS). Actually, there are several potential important low-rank applications of like satellite, UAV communications, marine, and deep-space communications. In such a situation, it is found that RIS may make a dramatic DoF enhancement over no RIS. By using a distributed RIS placement, the DoF of channels from BS to users may be even boosted from a low-rank like 0/1 to full-rank. This will achieve an extremely rate improvement via multiple spatial streams transmission per user. In this paper, we present a complete review of make a in-depth discussion on DoF effect of RIS.</description>

      <title>AmpliNetECG12: A lightweight SoftMax-based relativistic amplitude amplification architecture for 12 lead ECG classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urgent need to promptly detect cardiac disorders from 12-lead Electrocardiograms using limited computations is motivated by the heart's fast and complex electrical activity and restricted computational power of portable devices. Timely and precise diagnoses are crucial since delays might significantly impact patient health outcomes. This research presents a novel deep-learning architecture that aims to diagnose heart abnormalities quickly and accurately. We devised a new activation function called aSoftMax, designed to improve the visibility of ECG deflections. The proposed activation function is used with Convolutional Neural Network architecture to includes kernel weight sharing across the ECG's various leads. This innovative method thoroughly generalizes the global 12-lead ECG features and minimizes the model's complexity by decreasing the trainable parameters. aSoftMax, combined with enhanced CNN architecture yielded AmpliNetECG12, we obtain exceptional accuracy of 84% in diagnosing cardiac disorders. AmpliNetECG12 shows outstanding prediction ability when used with the CPSC2018 dataset for arrhythmia classification. The model attains an F1-score of 80.71% and a ROC-AUC score of 96.00%, with 280,000 trainable parameters which signifies the lightweight yet efficient nature of AmpliNetECG12. The stochastic characteristics of aSoftMax, a fundamental element of AmpliNetECG12, improve prediction accuracy and also increasse the model's interpretability. This feature enhances comprehension of important ECG segments in different forms of arrhythmias, establishing a new standard of explainable architecture for cardiac disorder classification.</description>

      <title>Implementation of tools for lessening the influence of artifacts in EEG signal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript describes and implementation of scripts of code aimed at reducing the influence of artifacts, specifically focused on ocular artifacts, in the measurement and processing of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This process is of importance because it benefits the analysis and study of long trial samples when the appearance of ocular artifacts cannot be avoided by simply discarding trials. The implementations provided to the reader illustrate, with slight modifications, previously proposed methods aimed at the partial or complete elimination of EEG channels or components are those that resemble the electro-oculogram (EOG) signals in which artifacts are detected. In addition to the description of each of the provided functions, examples of utilization and illustrative figures will be included to show the expected results and processing pipeline.</description>

      <title>Semi-blind Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO LEO Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes decision-directed semi-blind channel estimation for massive multiple-input multiple-output low-Earth-orbit satellite communications. Two semi-blind estimators are proposed. The first utilizes detected data symbols in addition to pilot symbols. The second, a modified semi-blind estimator, is specially designed to mitigate the channel-aging effect caused by the highly dynamic nature of low-Earth-orbit satellite communication channels -- an issue that adversely impacts the performance of pilot-based estimators. Consequently, this modified estimator outperforms an optimal pilot-based estimator in terms of normalized mean square error and achieves symbol error rate performance comparable to that of a Genie-aided (perfectly known channel) detector. The trade-offs between the proposed estimators are also examined.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Equipped UAV for Data Collection in Backscatter Sensor Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter communication (BC) becomes a promising energy-efficient solution for future wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable flexible data collection from remote backscatter devices (BDs), yet conventional UAVs rely on omni-directional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), limiting channel gain and prolonging data collection time. To address this issue, we consider equipping a UAV with a directional movable antenna (MA) with high directivity and flexibility. The MA enhances channel gain by precisely aiming its main lobe at each BD, focusing transmission power for efficient communication. Our goal is to minimize the total data collection time by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and the MA's orientation. We develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy using the azimuth angle and distance between the UAV and each BD to simplify the agent's observation space. To ensure stability during training, we adopt Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm that balances exploration with reward maximization for efficient and reliable learning. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed MA-equipped UAV with SAC outperforms both FPA-equipped UAVs and other RL methods, achieving significant reductions in both data collection time and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Universal Scanning GUI Tool for Available and Usable TV White Space (TVWS) Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this era of advanced communication technologies, many remote rural and hard-to-reach areas still lack Internet access due to technological, geographical, and economic challenges. The TV white space (TVWS) technology has proven to be effective and feasible in connecting these areas to Internet service in many parts of the world. The TVWS-based systems operate based on geolocation white space databases (WSDB) to protect the primary systems from harmful interference and thus there is a critical need to know the available and usable channels that can be used by the secondary white space devices (WSDs) in a specific geographic area. In this work, we developed a generalized and flexible graphical user interface (GUI) tool to evaluate the availability and usability of the TVWS channels and their noise levels at each geographic location within the analyzed area. The developed tool has many features and capabilities such as allowing the users to scan the TVWS spectrum for any geographic area in the world and any frequency band in the TVWS spectrum. Moreover, it allows the user to apply widely used terrain-based radio propagation models. It provides the flexibility to import the elevation terrain profile of any region with the desired spatial accuracy and resolution. In addition, various system parameters including those related to regulation rules can be modified in the tool. This tool exports to an external dataset file the output data of the available and usable TVWS channels and their noise levels and it also visualizes these data interactively.</description>

      <title>Integrated Positioning and Communication via LEO Satellites: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, as a prominent technology in the 6G non-terrestrial network, offer both positioning and communication capabilities. While these two applications have each been extensively studied and have achieved substantial progress in recent years, the potential synergistic benefits of integrating them remain an underexplored yet promising avenue. This article comprehensively analyzes the integrated positioning and communication (IPAC) systems on LEO satellites. By leveraging the distinct characteristics of LEO satellites, we examine how communication systems can enhance positioning accuracy and, conversely, how positioning information can be exploited to improve communication efficiency. In particular, we present two case studies to illustrate the potential of such integration. Finally, several key open research challenges in the LEO-based IPAC systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Fast Hyperspectral Reconstruction for Neutron Computed Tomography Using Subspace Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral neutron computed tomography enables 3D non-destructive imaging of the spectral characteristics of materials. In traditional hyperspectral reconstruction, the data for each neutron wavelength bin is reconstructed separately. This per-bin reconstruction is extremely time-consuming due to the typically large number of wavelength bins. Furthermore, these reconstructions may suffer from severe artifacts due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in each wavelength bin.
  We present a novel fast hyperspectral reconstruction algorithm for computationally efficient and accurate reconstruction of hyperspectral neutron data. Our algorithm uses a subspace extraction procedure that transforms hyperspectral data into low-dimensional data within an intermediate subspace. This step effectively reduces data dimensionality and spectral noise. High-quality reconstructions are then performed within this low-dimensional subspace. Finally, the algorithm expands the subspace reconstructions into hyperspectral reconstructions. We apply our algorithm to measured neutron data and demonstrate that it reduces computation and improves reconstruction quality compared to the conventional approach.</description>

      <title>AMSnet-KG: A Netlist Dataset for LLM-based AMS Circuit Auto-Design Using Knowledge Graph RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuits are mainly full-custom designed, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. A significant portion of the effort is experience-driven, which makes the automation of AMS circuit design a formidable challenge. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) applications, fostering advancements in the automatic design process for large-scale AMS circuits. However, the absence of high-quality datasets has led to issues such as model hallucination, which undermines the robustness of automatically generated circuit designs. To address this issue, this paper introduces AMSnet-KG, a dataset encompassing various AMS circuit schematics and netlists. We construct a knowledge graph with annotations on detailed functional and performance characteristics. Facilitated by AMSnet-KG, we propose an automated AMS circuit generation framework that utilizes the comprehensive knowledge embedded in LLMs. We first formulate a design strategy (e.g., circuit architecture using a number of circuit components) based on required specifications. Next, matched circuit components are retrieved and assembled into a complete topology, and transistor sizing is obtained through Bayesian optimization. Simulation results of the netlist are fed back to the LLM for further topology refinement, ensuring the circuit design specifications are met. We perform case studies of operational amplifier and comparator design to verify the automatic design flow from specifications to netlists with minimal human effort. The dataset used in this paper will be open-sourced upon publishing of this paper.</description>

      <title>Throughput Maximization for Movable Antenna Systems with Movement Delay Consideration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we model the minimum achievable throughput within a transmission block of restricted duration and aim to maximize it in movable antenna (MA)-enabled multiuser downlink communications. Particularly, we account for the antenna moving delay caused by mechanical movement, which has not been fully considered in previous studies, and reveal the trade-off between the delay and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at users. To this end, we first consider a single-user setup to analyze the necessity of antenna movement. By quantizing the virtual angles of arrival, we derive the requisite region size for antenna moving, design the initial MA position, and elucidate the relationship between quantization resolution and moving region size. Furthermore, an efficient algorithm is developed to optimize MA position via successive convex approximation, which is subsequently extended to the general multiuser setup. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform fixed-position antenna schemes and existing ones without consideration of movement delay. Additionally, our algorithms exhibit excellent adaptability and stability across various transmission block durations and moving region sizes, and are robust to different antenna moving speeds. This allows the hardware cost of MA-aided systems to be reduced by employing low rotational speed motors.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Nonparametric Clustering of Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data streams generated from unknown distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data streams belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I &lt; d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I &lt; d_L$ in general. Our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than $k$-medoids distribution clustering. We also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of STAR-RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with Electromagnetic Interference and Phase Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous Transmitting and Reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (STAR-RISs) are being explored for the next generation of sixth-generation (6G) networks. A promising configuration for their deployment is within cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, despite the advantages that STAR-RISs could bring, challenges such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) and phase errors may lead to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate the impact of EMI and phase errors on STAR-RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO systems and propose techniques to mitigate these effects. We introduce a novel projected gradient descent (GD) algorithm for STAR-RIS coefficient matrix design by minimizing the local channel estimation normalised mean square error. We also derive the closed-form expressions of the uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) to analyze system performance with EMI and phase errors, in which fractional power control methods are applied for performance improvement. The results reveal that the projected GD algorithm can effectively tackle EMI and phase errors to improve estimation accuracy and compensate for performance degradation with nearly $10\%\sim20\%$ SE improvement. Moreover, increasing access points (APs), antennas per AP, and STAR-RIS elements can also improve SE performance. Applying STAR-RIS in the proposed system achieves a larger $25\%$-likely SE than conventional RISs. However, the advantages of employing more STAR-RIS elements are reduced when EMI is severe.</description>

      <title>Channel Customization for Low-Complexity CSI Acquisition in Multi-RIS-Assisted MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) enhances the propagation environment by improving channel quality, but it also complicates channel estimation. Following the conventional wireless communication system design, which involves full channel state information (CSI) acquisition followed by RIS configuration, can reduce transmission efficiency due to substantial pilot overhead and computational complexity. This study introduces an innovative approach that integrates CSI acquisition and RIS configuration, leveraging the channel-altering capabilities of the RIS to reduce both the overhead and complexity of CSI acquisition. The focus is on multi-RIS-assisted systems, featuring both direct and reflected propagation paths. By applying a fast-varying reflection sequence during RIS configuration for channel training, the complex problem of channel estimation is decomposed into simpler, independent tasks. These fast-varying reflections effectively isolate transmit signals from different paths, streamlining the CSI acquisition process for both uplink and downlink communications with reduced complexity. In uplink scenarios, a positioning-based algorithm derives partial CSI, informing the adjustment of RIS parameters to create a sparse reflection channel, enabling precise reconstruction of the uplink channel. Downlink communication benefits from this strategically tailored reflection channel, allowing effective CSI acquisition with fewer pilot signals. Simulation results highlight the proposed methodology's ability to accurately reconstruct the reflection channel with minimal impact on the normalized mean square error while simultaneously enhancing spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Guided MRI Reconstruction via Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a multi-contrast imaging technique in which different contrast images share similar structural information. However, conventional diffusion models struggle to effectively leverage this structural similarity. Recently, the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB), a nonlinear extension of the diffusion model, has been proposed to establish diffusion paths between any distributions, allowing the incorporation of guided priors. This study proposes an SB-based, multi-contrast image-guided reconstruction framework that establishes a diffusion bridge between the guiding and target image distributions. By using the guiding image along with data consistency during sampling, the target image is reconstructed more accurately. To better address structural differences between images, we introduce an inversion strategy from the field of image editing, termed $\mathbf{I}^2$SB-inversion. Experiments on a paried T1 and T2-FLAIR datasets demonstrate that $\mathbf{I}^2$SB-inversion achieve a high acceleration up to 14.4 and outperforms existing methods in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and stability.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex Beyond Self-Interference: The Unlimited Sensing Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of full-stack full-duplex communication systems depends on how effectively one can achieve digital self-interference cancellation (SIC). Towards this end, in this paper, we consider unlimited sensing framework (USF) enabled full-duplex system. We show that by injecting folding non-linearities in the sensing pipeline, one can not only suppress self-interference but also recover the signal of interest (SoI). This approach leads to novel design of the receiver architecture that is complemented by a modulo-domain channel estimation method. We then demonstrate the advantages of modulo ADC by analyzing the relationship between quantization noise, quantization bits, and dynamic range. Numerical experiments show that the USF enabled receiver structure can achieve up to 40 dB digital SIC by using as few as 4-bits per sample. Our method outperforms the previous approach based on adaptive filters when it comes to SoI reconstruction, detection, and digital SIC performance.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Spot Beamfocusing: A Correlation-Aware Transfer Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D spot beamfocusing (SBF), in contrast to conventional angular-domain beamforming, concentrates radiating power within very small volume in both radial and angular domains in the near-field zone. Recently the implementation of channel-state-information (CSI)-independent machine learning (ML)-based approaches have been developed for effective SBF using extremely-largescale-programable-metasurface (ELPMs). These methods involve dividing the ELPMs into subarrays and independently training them with Deep Reinforcement Learning to jointly focus the beam at the Desired Focal Point (DFP). This paper explores near-field SBF using ELPMs, addressing challenges associated with lengthy training times resulting from independent training of subarrays. To achieve a faster CSIindependent solution, inspired by the correlation between the beamfocusing matrices of the subarrays, we leverage transfer learning techniques. First, we introduce a novel similarity criterion based on the Phase Distribution Image of subarray apertures. Then we devise a subarray policy propagation scheme that transfers the knowledge from trained to untrained subarrays. We further enhance learning by introducing Quasi-Liquid-Layers as a revised version of the adaptive policy reuse technique. We show through simulations that the proposed scheme improves the training speed about 5 times. Furthermore, for dynamic DFP management, we devised a DFP policy blending process, which augments the convergence rate up to 8-fold.</description>

      <title>Classification of Heart Sounds Using Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Network and LSTM-CNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10689v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and cost-effective method for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities with high accuracy and reliability using low-cost systems in clinics. The primary limitation of automatic diagnosing of cardiac diseases is the rarity of correct and acceptable labeled samples, which can be expensive to prepare. To address this issue, two methods are proposed in this work. The first method is a unique Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MBDCN) architecture inspired by human auditory processing, specifically designed to optimize feature extraction by employing various sizes of convolutional filters and audio signal power spectrum as input. In the second method, called as Long short-term memory-Convolutional Neural (LSCN) model, Additionally, the network architecture includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network blocks to improve feature extraction in the time domain. The innovative approach of combining multiple parallel branches consisting of the one-dimensional convolutional layers along with LSTM blocks helps in achieving superior results in audio signal processing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art techniques. The overall classification accuracy of heart sounds with the LSCN network is more than 96%. The efficiency of this network is significant compared to common feature extraction methods such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and wavelet transform. Therefore, the proposed method shows promising results in the automatic analysis of heart sounds and has potential applications in the diagnosis and early detection of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>BiT-MamSleep: Bidirectional Temporal Mamba for EEG Sleep Staging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges in automatic sleep stage classification, particularly the high computational cost, inadequate modeling of bidirectional temporal dependencies, and class imbalance issues faced by Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose BiT-MamSleep, a novel architecture that integrates the Triple-Resolution CNN (TRCNN) for efficient multi-scale feature extraction with the Bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) mechanism, which models both short- and long-term temporal dependencies through bidirectional processing of EEG data. Additionally, BiT-MamSleep incorporates an Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) module and a temporal enhancement block to dynamically refine feature importance, optimizing classification accuracy without increasing computational complexity. To further improve robustness, we apply optimization techniques such as Focal Loss and SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BiT-MamSleep significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling long EEG sequences and addressing class imbalance, leading to more accurate and scalable sleep stage classification.</description>

      <title>SPDIM: Source-Free Unsupervised Conditional and Label Shift Adaptation in EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-stationary nature of electroencephalography (EEG) introduces distribution shifts across domains (e.g., days and subjects), posing a significant challenge to EEG-based neurotechnology generalization. Without labeled calibration data for target domains, the problem is a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) problem. For scenarios with constant label distribution, Riemannian geometry-aware statistical alignment frameworks on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold are considered state-of-the-art. However, many practical scenarios, including EEG-based sleep staging, exhibit label shifts. Here, we propose a geometric deep learning framework for SFUDA problems under specific distribution shifts, including label shifts. We introduce a novel, realistic generative model and show that prior Riemannian statistical alignment methods on the SPD manifold can compensate for specific marginal and conditional distribution shifts but hurt generalization under label shifts. As a remedy, we propose a parameter-efficient manifold optimization strategy termed SPDIM. SPDIM uses the information maximization principle to learn a single SPD-manifold-constrained parameter per target domain. In simulations, we demonstrate that SPDIM can compensate for the shifts under our generative model. Moreover, using public EEG-based brain-computer interface and sleep staging datasets, we show that SPDIM outperforms prior approaches.</description>

      <title>Full Duplex Joint Communications and Sensing for 6G: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paradigm of joint communications and sensing (JCAS) envisions a revolutionary integration of communication and radar functionalities within a unified hardware platform. This novel concept not only opens up unprecedented interoperability opportunities, but also exhibits unique design challenges. To this end, the success of JCAS is highly dependent on efficient full-duplex (FD) operation, which has the potential to enable simultaneous transmission and reception within the same frequency band. While JCAS research is lately expanding, there still exist relevant directions of investigation that hold tremendous potential to profoundly transform the sixth generation (6G), and beyond, cellular networks. This article presents new opportunities and challenges brought up by FD-enabled JCAS, taking into account the key technical peculiarities of FD systems. Unlike simplified JCAS scenarios, we delve into the most comprehensive configuration, encompassing uplink and downlink users, as well as monostatic and bistatic radars, all harmoniously coexisting to jointly push the boundaries of both communications and sensing. The performance improvements resulting from this advancement bring forth numerous new challenges, each meticulously examined and expounded upon.</description>

      <title>Proximal Gradient Dynamics: Monotonicity, Exponential Convergence, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter we study the proximal gradient dynamics. This recently-proposed continuous-time dynamics solves optimization problems whose cost functions are separable into a nonsmooth convex and a smooth component. First, we show that the cost function decreases monotonically along the trajectories of the proximal gradient dynamics. We then introduce a new condition that guarantees exponential convergence of the cost function to its optimal value, and show that this condition implies the proximal Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition. We also show that the proximal Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition guarantees exponential convergence of the cost function. Moreover, we extend these results to time-varying optimization problems, providing bounds for equilibrium tracking. Finally, we discuss applications of these findings, including the LASSO problem, certain matrix based problems and a numerical experiment on a feed-forward neural network.</description>

      <title>Towards Generative Ray Path Sampling for Faster Point-to-Point Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio propagation modeling is essential in telecommunication research, as radio channels result from complex interactions with environmental objects. Recently, Machine Learning has been attracting attention as a potential alternative to computationally demanding tools, like Ray Tracing, which can model these interactions in detail. However, existing Machine Learning approaches often attempt to learn directly specific channel characteristics, such as the coverage map, making them highly specific to the frequency and material properties and unable to fully capture the underlying propagation mechanisms. Hence, Ray Tracing, particularly the Point-to-Point variant, remains popular to accurately identify all possible paths between transmitter and receiver nodes. Still, path identification is computationally intensive because the number of paths to be tested grows exponentially while only a small fraction is valid. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-aided Ray Tracing approach to efficiently sample potential ray paths, significantly reducing the computational load while maintaining high accuracy. Our model dynamically learns to prioritize potentially valid paths among all possible paths and scales linearly with scene complexity. Unlike recent alternatives, our approach is invariant with translation, scaling, or rotation of the geometry, and avoids dependency on specific environment characteristics.</description>
