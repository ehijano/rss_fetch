      <title>On total domination subdivision numbers of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $S$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a total dominating set of $G$ if every vertex is adjacent to a vertex in $S$. The total domination number $\gamma_t(G)$ is the minimum cardinality of a total dominating set of $G$. The total domination subdivision number $\mbox{sd}_{\gamma_t}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of edges that must be subdivided (where each edge in $G$ can be subdivided at most once) in order to increase the total domination number. Haynes et al. (Discrete Math. 286 (2004) 195--202) have given a constructive characterization of trees whose total domination subdivision number is~$3$. In this paper, we give new characterizations of trees whose total domination subdivision number is 3.</description>

      <title>An Overpartition Companion of Andrews and Keith's 2-colored $q$-series Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andrews and Keith recently produced a general Schmidt type partition theorem using a novel interpretation of Stockhofe's bijection, which they used to find new $q$-series identities. This includes an identity for a trivariate 2-colored partition generating function. In this paper, their Schmidt type theorem is further generalized akin to how Franklin classically extended Glaisher's theorem. As a consequence, we obtain a companion to Andrews and Keith's 2-colored identity for overpartitions. These identities appear to be special cases of a much more general result.</description>

      <title>Vertex Ranking of Degenerate Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $\ell$-vertex-ranking of a graph $G$ is a colouring of the vertices of $G$ with integer colours so that in any connected subgraph $H$ of $G$ with diameter at most $\ell$, there is a vertex in $H$ whose colour is larger than that of every other vertex in $H$. The $\ell$-vertex-ranking number, $\chi_{\ell-\mathrm{vr}}(G)$, of $G$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ has an $\ell$-vertex-ranking using $k$ colours. We prove that, for any fixed $d$ and $\ell$, every $d$-degenerate $n$-vertex graph $G$ satisfies $\chi_{\ell-\mathrm{vr}}(G)= O(n^{1-2/(\ell+1)}\log n)$ if $\ell$ is even and $\chi_{\ell-\mathrm{vr}}(G)= O(n^{1-2/\ell}\log n)$ if $\ell$ is odd. The case $\ell=2$ resolves (up to the $\log n$ factor) an open problem posed by \citet{karpas.neiman.ea:on} and the cases $\ell\in\{2,3\}$ are asymptotically optimal (up to the $\log n$ factor).</description>

      <title>Links and the Diaconis-Graham Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1977 Diaconis and Graham proved two inequalities relating different measures of disarray in permutations, and asked for a characterization of those permutations for which equality holds in one of these inequalities. Such a characterization was first given in 2013. Recently, another characterization was given by Woo, using a topological link in $\mathbb R^3$ that can be associated to the cycle diagram of a permutation. We show that Woo's characterization extends much further: for any permutation, the discrepancy in Diaconis and Graham's inequality is directly related to the Euler characteristic of the associated link. This connection provides a new proof of the original result of Diaconis and Graham. We also characterize permutations with a fixed discrepancy in terms of their associated links and find that the stabilized-interval-free permutations are precisely those whose associated links are nonsplit.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic spectrum distance, graph limits, and the Shannon capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the Shannon capacity of graphs is a long-standing open problem in information theory, graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Over decades, a wide range of upper and lower bound methods have been developed to analyze this problem. However, despite tremendous effort, even small instances of the problem have remained open.
  In recent years, a new dual characterization of the Shannon capacity of graphs, asymptotic spectrum duality, has unified and extended known upper bound methods and structural theorems. In this paper, building on asymptotic spectrum duality, we develop a new theory of graph distance, that we call asymptotic spectrum distance, and corresponding limits (reminiscent of, but different from, the celebrated theory of cut-norm, graphons and flag algebras). We propose a graph limit approach to the Shannon capacity problem: to determine the Shannon capacity of a graph, construct a sequence of easier to analyse graphs converging to it.
  (1) We give a very general construction of non-trivial converging sequences of graphs (in a family of circulant graphs).
  (2) We construct Cauchy sequences of finite graphs that do not converge to any finite graph, but do converge to an infinite graph. We establish strong connections between convergence questions of finite graphs and the asymptotic properties of Borsuk-like infinite graphs on the circle.
  (3) We observe that all best-known lower bound constructions for Shannon capacity of small odd cycles can be obtained from a "finite" version of the graph limit approach. We develop computational and theoretical aspects of this approach and use these to obtain a new Shannon capacity lower bound for the fifteen-cycle.
  The theory of asymptotic spectrum distance applies not only to Shannon capacity of graphs; indeed, we will develop it for a general class of mathematical objects and their asymptotic properties.</description>

      <title>On the universal Drinfeld-Yetter algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universal Drinfeld-Yetter algebra is an associative algebra whose co-Hochschild cohomology controls the existence of quantization functors of Lie bialgebras, such as the renowned one due to Etingof and Kazhdan. It was initially introduced by Enriquez and later re-interpreted by Appel and Toledano Laredo as an algebra of endomorphisms in the colored PROP of a Drinfeld-Yetter module over a Lie bialgebra. In this paper, we provide an explicit formula for its structure constants in terms of certain diagrams, which we term Drinfeld-Yetter looms.</description>

      <title>Extreme points of general transportation polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transportation matrices are $m\times n$ non-negative matrices whose row sums and row columns are equal to, or dominated above with given integral vectors $R$ and $C$. Those matrices belong to a convex polytope whose extreme points have been previously characterized. In this article, a more general set of non-negative transportation matrices is considered, whose row sums are bounded by two integral non-negative vectors $R_{min}$ and $R_{max}$ and column sums are bounded by two integral non-negative vectors $C_{min}$ and $C_{max}$. It is shown that this set is also a convex polytope whose extreme points are then fully characterized.</description>

      <title>Cluster Monomials in Graph Laurent Phenomenon Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laurent Phenomenon algebras, first introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy, are a generalization of cluster algebras that still possess many salient features of cluster algebras. Linear Laurent Phenomenon algebras, defined by Lam and Pylyavskyy, are a subclass of Laurent Phenomenon algebras whose structure is given by the data of a directed graph. The main result of this paper is that the cluster monomials of a linear Laurent Phenomenon algebra form a linear basis, conjectured by Lam and Pylyavskyy and analogous to a result for cluster algebras by Caldero and Keller.</description>

      <title>When does a bent concatenation not belong to the completed Maiorana-McFarland class?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every Boolean bent function $f$ can be written either as a concatenation $f=f_1||f_2$ of two complementary semi-bent functions $f_1,f_2$; or as a concatenation $f=f_1||f_2||f_3||f_4$ of four Boolean functions $f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4$, all of which are simultaneously bent, semi-bent, or 5-valued spectra-functions. In this context, it is essential to ask: When does a bent concatenation $f$ (not) belong to the completed Maiorana-McFarland class $\mathcal{M}^\#$? In this article, we answer this question completely by providing a full characterization of the structure of $\mathcal{M}$-subspaces for the concatenation of the form $f=f_1||f_2$ and $f=f_1||f_2||f_3||f_4$, which allows us to specify the necessary and sufficient conditions so that $f$ is outside $\mathcal{M}^\#$. Based on these conditions, we propose several explicit design methods of specifying bent functions outside $\mathcal{M}^\#$ in the special case when $f=g||h||g||(h+1)$, where $g$ and $h$ are bent functions.</description>

Abstract: Osburn, Sahu and Straub introduced the numbers: \begin{align*} A_n^{(r,s,t)}=\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}^r{n+k\choose k}^s{2k\choose n}^t, \end{align*} for non-negative integers $n,r,s,t$ with $r\ge 2$, which includes two kinds of Ap\'ery numbers and four kinds of Ap\'ery-like numbers as special cases, and showed that the numbers $\{A_n^{(r,s,t)}\}_{n\ge 0}$ satisfy the Gauss congruences of order $3$. We establish an extension of Osburn--Sahu--Straub congruence through Bernoulli numbers, which is one step deep congruence of the Gauss congruence for $A_n^{(r,s,t)}$.</description>

      <title>Subadditivity of shifts, Eilenberg-Zilber shuffle products and homology of lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the maximal shifts in the minimal free resolution of the quotients of a polynomial ring by a monomial ideal are subadditive as a function of the homological degree. This answers a question that has received some attention in recent years. To do so, we define and study a new model for the homology of posets, given by the so called synor complex. We also introduce an Eilenberg-Zilber type shuffle product on the simplicial chain complex of lattices.
  Combining these concepts we prove that the existence of a non-zero homology class for a lattice forces certain non-zero homology classes in lower intervals. This result then translates into properties of the minimal free resolution. In particular, it implies a generalization of the original question.</description>

      <title>Two-state transfer: a generalization of pair and plus state transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of quantum state transfer, one is interested in being able to transmit a quantum state with high fidelity within a quantum spin network. In most of the literature, the state of interest is taken to be associated with a standard basis vector; however, more general states have recently been considered. Here, we consider a general linear combination of two vertex states, which encompasses the definitions of pair states and plus states in connected weighted graphs. A two-state in a graph $X$ is a quantum state of the form $\mathbf{e}_u+s\mathbf{e}_v$, where $u$ and $v$ are two vertices in $X$ and $s$ is a non-zero real number. If $s=-1$ or $s=1$, then such a state is called a pair state or a plus state, respectively.
  In this paper, we investigate quantum state transfer between two-states, where the Hamiltonian is taken to be the adjacency, Laplacian or signless Laplacian matrix of the graph. By analyzing the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, we characterize strongly cospectral two-states built from strongly cospectral vertices. This allows us to characterize perfect state transfer (PST) between two-states in complete graphs, cycles and hypercubes. We also produce infinite families of graphs that admit strong cospectrality and PST between two-states that are neither pair nor plus states. Using singular values and singular vectors, we show that vertex PST in the line graph of $X$ implies PST between the plus states formed by corresponding edges in $X$. Furthermore, we provide conditions such that the converse of the previous statement holds. As an application, we characterize strong cospectrality and PST between vertices in line graphs of trees, unicyclic graphs and Cartesian products.</description>

      <title>Computing Hamiltonian Paths with Partial Order Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When solving the Hamiltonian path problem it seems natural to be given additional precedence constraints for the order in which the vertices are visited. For example one could decide whether a Hamiltonian path exists for a fixed starting point, or that some vertices are visited before another vertex. We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path that observes all precedence constraints given in a partial order on the vertex set. We show that this problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete even if restricted to complete bipartite graphs and posets of height 2. In contrast, for posets of width $k$ there is an $\mathcal{O}(k^2 n^k)$ algorithm for arbitrary graphs with $n$ vertices. We show that it is unlikely that the running time of this algorithm can be improved significantly, i.e., there is no $f(k) n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis. Furthermore, for the class of outerplanar graphs, we give an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ algorithm for arbitrary posets.</description>

      <title>Kernelization Dichotomies for Hitting Subgraphs under Structural Parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a fixed graph $H$, the $H$-SUBGRAPH HITTING problem consists in deleting the minimum number of vertices from an input graph to obtain a graph without any occurrence of $H$ as a subgraph. This problem can be seen as a generalization of VERTEX COVER, which corresponds to the case $H = K_2$. We initiate a study of $H$-SUBGRAPH HITTING from the point of view of characterizing structural parameterizations that allow for polynomial kernels, within the recently active framework of taking as the parameter the number of vertex deletions to obtain a graph in a "simple" class $C$. Our main contribution is to identify graph parameters that, when $H$-SUBGRAPH HITTING is parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance to a class $C$ where any of these parameters is bounded, and assuming standard complexity assumptions and that $H$ is biconnected, allow us to prove the following sharp dichotomy: the problem admits a polynomial kernel if and only if $H$ is a clique. These new graph parameters are inspired by the notion of $C$-elimination distance introduced by Bulian and Dawar [Algorithmica 2016], and generalize it in two directions. Our results also apply to the version of the problem where one wants to hit $H$ as an induced subgraph, and imply in particular, that the problems of hitting minors and hitting (induced) subgraphs have a substantially different behavior with respect to the existence of polynomial kernels under structural parameterizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the Young lattice is the Bratelli diagram of the symmetric groups expressing how irreducible representations restrict from $S_N$ to $S_{N-1}$. In 1988, Stanley discovered a similar lattice called the Young-Fibonacci lattice which was realized as the Bratelli diagram of a family of algebras by Okada in 1994. In this paper, we realize the Okada algebra and its associated monoid using a labeled version of Temperley-Lieb arc-diagrams. We prove in full generality that the dimension of the Okada algebra is $n!$. In particular, we interpret a natural bijection between permutations and labeled arc-diagrams as an instance of Fomin's Robinson-Schensted correspondence for the Young-Fibonacci lattice. We prove that the Okada monoid is aperiodic and describe its Green relations. Lifting those results to the algebra allows us to construct a cellular basis of the Okada algebra. }</description>

      <title>Zero-sum partitions of Abelian groups and their applications to magic-type labelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The following problem has been known since the 80s. Let $\Gamma$ be an Abelian group of order $m$ (denoted $|\Gamma|=m$), and let $t$ and $\{m_i\}_{i=1}^{t}$, be positive integers such that $\sum_{i=1}^t m_i=m-1$. Determine when $\Gamma^*=\Gamma\setminus\{0\}$, the set of non-zero elements of $\Gamma$, can be partitioned into disjoint subsets $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^{t}$ such that $|S_i|=m_i$ and $\sum_{s\in S_i}s=0$ for every $1 \leq i \leq t$. Such a subset partition is called a \textit{zero-sum partition}.
  $|I(\Gamma)|\neq 1$, where $I(\Gamma)$ is the set of involutions in $\Gamma$, is a necessary condition for the existence of zero-sum partitions. In this paper, we show that the additional condition of $m_i\geq 4$ for every $1 \leq i \leq t$, is sufficient. Moreover, we present some applications of zero-sum partitions to magic-type labelings of graphs.</description>

      <title>Orientation of convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel definition of orientation on the triples of a family of pairwise intersecting planar convex sets and study its properties. In particular, we compare it to other systems of orientations on triples that satisfy a so-called interiority condition: $\circlearrowleft(ABD)=~\circlearrowleft(BCD)=~\circlearrowleft(CAD)=1$ imply $\circlearrowleft(ABC)=1$ for any $A,B,C,D$. We call such an orientation a P3O (partial 3-order), a natural generalization of a poset, that has several interesting special cases. For example, the order type of a planar point set (that can have collinear triples) is a P3O; we denote a P3O realizable by points as p-P3O.
  If we do not allow $\circlearrowleft(ABC)=0$, we obtain a T3O (total 3-order). Contrary to linear orders, a T3O can have a rich structure. A T3O realizable by points, a p-T3O, is the order type of a point set in general position. Despite these similarities to order types, P3O and p-T3O that can arise from the orientation of pairwise intersecting convex sets, denoted by C-P3O and C-T3O, turn out to be quite different from order types: there is no containment relation among the family of all C-P3O's and the family of all p-P3O's, or among the families of C-T3O's and p-T3O's.
  Finally, we study properties of these orientations if we also require that the family of underlying convex sets satisfies the (4,3) property.</description>

      <title>Bounds for DP color function and canonical labelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06000v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DP-coloring is a generalization of the list coloring, introduced by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle. Let $\mathcal{H}=(L,H)$ be a cover of a graph $G$ and $P_{DP}(G,\mathcal{H})$ be the number of $\mathcal{H}$-colorings of $G$. The DP color function $P_{DP}(G,m)$ of $G$, introduced by Kaul and Mudrock, is the minimum value of $P_{DP}(G,\mathcal{H})$ where the minimum is taken over all possible $m$-fold covers $\mathcal{H}$ of $G$. For the family of $n$-vertex connected graphs, one can deduce that trees maximize the DP color function, from two results of Kaul and Mudrock. In this paper we obtain tight upper bounds for the DP color function of $n$-vertex $2$-connected graphs. Another concern in this paper is the canonical labeling in a cover. It is well known that if an $m$-fold cover $\mathcal{H}$ of a graph $G$ has a canonical labeling, then $P_{DP}(G,\mathcal{H})=P(G,m)$ in which $P(G,m)$ is the chromatic polynomial of $G$. However the converse statement of this conclusion is not always true. We give examples that for some $m$ and $G$, there exists an $m$-fold cover $\mathcal{H}$ of $G$ such that $P_{DP}(G,\mathcal{H})=P(G,m)$, but $\mathcal{H}$ has no canonical labelings. We also prove that when $G$ is a unicyclic graph or a theta graph, for each $m\geq 3$, if $P_{DP}(G,\mathcal{H})=P(G,m)$, then $\mathcal{H}$ has a canonical labeling.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the collapsibility number of a simplicial complex and non-cover complexes of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collapsibility number of simplicial complexes was introduced by Wegner in order to understand the intersection patterns of convex sets. This number also plays an important role in a variety of Helly type results. We show that the non-cover complex of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is $|V(\mathcal{H)}|- \gamma_i(\mathcal{H})-1$-collapsible, where $\gamma_i(\mathcal{H})$ is the generalization of independence domination number of a graph to hypergraph. This extends the result of Choi, Kim and Park from graphs to hypergraphs. Moreover, the upper bound in terms of strong independence domination number given by Kim and Kim for the Leray number of the non-cover complex of a hypergraph can be obtained as a special case of our result.
  In general, there can be a large gap between the collapsibility number of a complex and its well-known upper bounds.
  In this article, we construct a sequence of upper bounds $\mathcal{M}_k(X)$ for the collapsibility number of a simplicial complex $X$, which lie in this gap. We also show that the bound given by $\mathcal{M}_k$ is tight if the underlying complex is $k$-vertex decomposable.</description>

      <title>Coloring and density theorems for configurations of a given volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a treatise on finite point configurations spanning a fixed volume to be found in a single color-class of an arbitrary finite (measurable) coloring of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, or in a single large measurable subset $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. More specifically, we study vertex-sets of simplices, rectangular boxes, and parallelotopes, attempting to make progress on several open problems posed in the 1970s and the 1980s. As one of the highlights, we give the negative answer to a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham, by coloring the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ in $25$ colors without creating monochromatic rectangles of unit area. More generally, we construct a finite coloring of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that no color-class contains the $2^m$ vertices of any (possibly rotated) $m$-dimensional rectangular box of volume $1$. A positive result is still possible if rectangular boxes of merely sufficiently large volumes are sought in a single color-class of a finite measurable coloring of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and we establish it under an additional assumption $n\geq m+1$. Also, motivated by a question of Graham on reasonable bounds in his result on monochromatic axes-aligned right-angled $m$-dimensional simplices, we establish its measurable coloring and density variants with polylogarithmic bounds, again in dimensions $n\geq m+1$. Next, we generalize a result of Erd\H{o}s and Mauldin, by constructing an infinite measure set $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every $n$-parallelotope with vertices in $A$ has volume strictly smaller than $1$. Finally, some results complementing the literature on isometric embeddings of hypercube graphs and on the hyperbolic analogue of the Hadwiger--Nelson problem also follow as byproducts of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Low-rank matrices, tournaments, and symmetric designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{a} = (a_{i})_{i \geq 1}$ be a sequence in a field $\mathbb{F}$, and $f \colon \mathbb{F} \times \mathbb{F} \to \mathbb{F}$ be a function such that $f(a_{i},a_{i}) \neq 0$ for all $i \geq 1$. For any tournament $T$ over $[n]$, consider the $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $M_{T}$ with zero diagonal whose $(i,j)$th entry (for $i &lt; j$) is $f(a_{i},a_{j})$ if $i \to j$ in $T$, and $f(a_{j},a_{i})$ if $j \to i$ in $T$. It is known (cf. Balachandran et al., Linear Algebra Appl. 658 (2023), 310-318) that if $T$ is a uniformly random tournament over $[n]$, then $\operatorname{rank}(M_{T}) \geq (\frac{1}{2}-o(1))n$ with high probability when $\operatorname{char}(\mathbb{F}) \neq 2$ and $f$ is a linear function.
  In this paper, we investigate the other extremal question: how low can the ranks of such matrices be? We work with sequences $\mathbf{a}$ that take only two distinct values, so the rank of any such $n \times n$ matrix is at least $n/2$. First, we show that the rank of any such matrix depends on whether an associated bipartite graph has certain eigenvalues of high multiplicity. Using this, we show that if $f$ is linear, then there are real matrices $M_{T}(f;\mathbf{a})$ of rank at most $\frac{n}{2} + O(1)$. For rational matrices, we show that for each $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ we can find a sequence $\mathbf{a}(\varepsilon)$ for which there are matrices $M_{T}(f;\mathbf{a})$ of rank at most $(\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon)n + O(1)$. These matrices are constructed from symmetric designs, and we also use them to produce bisection-closed families of size greater than $\lfloor 3n/2 \rfloor - 2$ for $n \leq 15$, which improves the previously best known bound (cf. Balachandran et al., Electron J. Combin. 26 (2019), #P2.40).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new rotation-invariant web basis for a family of Specht modules $S^{(d^3, 1^{n-3d})}$, indexed by normal plabic graphs satisfying a degree condition and resembling $A_2$ webs. We show that the $\mathfrak{S}_n$ action on our basis can be understood combinatorially via a set of skein relations. From this basis, we obtain a cyclic sieving result for a $q$-analog of the hook length formula for $\lambda$. Our construction extends the jellyfish invariants of Fraser, Patrias, Pechenik, and Striker and is closely related to the weblike subgraphs of Lam.</description>

      <title>The inversion number of dijoins and blow-up digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an oriented graph $D$, the $inversion$ of $X \subseteq V(D)$ in $D$ is the digraph obtained from $D$ by reversing the direction of all arcs with both ends in $X$. The inversion number of $D$, denoted by $inv(D)$, is the minimum number of inversions needed to transform $D$ into an acyclic digraph. In this paper, we first show that $inv (\overrightarrow{C_3} \Rightarrow D)= inv(D) +1$ for any oriented graph $\textit{D}$ with even inversion number $inv(D)$, where the dijoin $\overrightarrow{C_3} \Rightarrow D$ is the oriented graph obtained from the disjoint union of $\overrightarrow{C_3}$ and $D$ by adding all arcs from $\overrightarrow{C_3}$ to $D$. Thus we disprove the conjecture of Aubian el at. \cite{2212.09188} and the conjecture of Alon el at. \cite{2212.11969}. We also study the blow-up graph which is an oriented graph obtained from a tournament by replacing all vertices into oriented graphs. We construct a tournament $T$ with order $n$ and $inv(T)=\frac{n}{3}+1$ using blow-up graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.07760v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Kazhdan-Lusztig variety is the intersection of a locally-closed Schubert cell with an opposite Schubert variety in a flag variety. We present a linear parametrization of the Schubert cells in the affine type A flag variety via Bott-Samelson maps, and give explicit equations that generate the Kazhdan-Lusztig ideals in these coordinates. Furthermore, our equations form a Gr\"obner basis for the Kazhdan-Lusztig ideals. Our result generalizes a result of Woo-Yong that gave a Gr\"obner basis for Kazhdan-Lusztig ideals in the type A flag variety.</description>

      <title>Indistinguishable asymptotic pairs and multidimensional Sturmian configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two asymptotic configurations on a full $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shift are indistinguishable if for every finite pattern the associated sets of occurrences in each configuration coincide up to a finitely supported permutation of $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We prove that indistinguishable asymptotic pairs satisfying a "flip condition" are characterized by their pattern complexity on finite connected supports. Furthermore, we prove that uniformly recurrent indistinguishable asymptotic pairs satisfying the flip condition are described by codimension-one (dimension of the internal space) cut and project schemes, which symbolically correspond to multidimensional Sturmian configurations. Together the two results provide a generalization to $\mathbb{Z}^d$ of the characterization of Sturmian sequences by their factor complexity $n+1$. Many open questions are raised by the current work and are listed in the introduction.</description>

      <title>Computing Tree Decompositions with Small Independence Number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The independence number of a tree decomposition is the maximum of the independence numbers of the subgraphs induced by its bags. The tree-independence number of a graph is the minimum independence number of a tree decomposition of it. Several NP-hard graph problems, like maximum weight independent set, can be solved in time n^{O(k)} if the input n-vertex graph is given together with a tree decomposition of independence number k. Yolov, in [SODA 2018], gave an algorithm that, given an n-vertex graph G and an integer k, in time n^{O(k^3)} either constructs a tree decomposition of G whose independence number is O(k^3) or correctly reports that the tree-independence number of G is larger than k.
  In this paper, we first give an algorithm for computing the tree-independence number with a better approximation ratio and running time and then prove that our algorithm is, in some sense, the best one can hope for. More precisely, our algorithm runs in time 2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)} and either outputs a tree decomposition of G with independence number at most $8k$, or determines that the tree-independence number of G is larger than k. This implies 2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)}-time algorithms for various problems, like maximum weight independent set, parameterized by the tree-independence number k without needing the decomposition as an input. Assuming Gap-ETH, an n^{\Omega(k)} factor in the running time is unavoidable for any approximation algorithm for the tree-independence number.
  Our second result is that the exact computation of the tree-independence number is para-NP-hard: We show that for every constant k \ge 4 it is NP-hard to decide if a given graph has the tree-independence number at most k.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the $(3k+4)$-dimensional Weisfeiler--Leman algorithm can identify graphs of treewidth $k$ in $O(\log n)$ rounds. This improves the result of Grohe &amp; Verbitsky (ICALP 2006), who previously established the analogous result for $(4k+3)$-dimensional Weisfeiler--Leman. In light of the equivalence between Weisfeiler--Leman and the logic $\textsf{FO} + \textsf{C}$ (Cai, F\"urer, &amp; Immerman, Combinatorica 1992), we obtain an improvement in the descriptive complexity for graphs of treewidth $k$. Precisely, if $G$ is a graph of treewidth $k$, then there exists a $(3k+5)$-variable formula $\varphi$ in $\textsf{FO} + \textsf{C}$ with quantifier depth $O(\log n)$ that identifies $G$ up to isomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08971v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytopes of graphs with respect to the Lov\'asz-Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$. In particular, we focus on a search for relatively small graphs with high $\text{LS}_+$-rank (i.e., the least number of iterations of the $\text{LS}_+$ operator on the fractional stable set polytope to compute the stable set polytope). We provide families of graphs whose $\text{LS}_+$-rank is asymptotically a linear function of its number of vertices, which is the best possible up to improvements in the constant factor. This improves upon the previous best result in this direction from 1999, which yielded graphs whose $\text{LS}_+$-rank only grew with the square root of the number of vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the notion of operad that we call a contractad, whose set of operations is indexed by connected graphs and whose composition rules are numbered by contractions of connected subgraphs. We show that many classical operads, such as the operad of commutative algebras, Lie algebras, associative algebras, pre-Lie algebras, the little disks operad, and the operad of moduli spaces of stable curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$ admit generalizations to contractads. We explain that standard tools like Koszul duality and the machinery of Gr\"obner bases can be easily generalized to contractads. We verify the Koszul property of the commutative, Lie, associative, and Gerstenhaber contractads.</description>

      <title>Canonizing Graphs of Bounded Rank-Width in Parallel via Weisfeiler--Leman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that computing canonical labelings of graphs of bounded rank-width is in $\textsf{TC}^{2}$. Our approach builds on the framework of K\"obler &amp; Verbitsky (CSR 2008), who established the analogous result for graphs of bounded treewidth. Here, we use the framework of Grohe &amp; Neuen (ACM Trans. Comput. Log., 2023) to enumerate separators via split-pairs and flip functions. In order to control the depth of our circuit, we leverage the fact that any graph of rank-width $k$ admits a rank decomposition of width $\leq 2k$ and height $O(\log n)$ (Courcelle &amp; Kant\'e, WG 2007). This allows us to utilize an idea from Wagner (CSR 2011) of tracking the depth of the recursion in our computation.
  Furthermore, after splitting the graph into connected components, it is necessary to decide isomorphism of said components in $\textsf{TC}^{1}$. To this end, we extend the work of Grohe &amp; Neuen (ibid.) to show that the $(6k+3)$-dimensional Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) algorithm can identify graphs of rank-width $k$ using only $O(\log n)$ rounds. As a consequence, we obtain that graphs of bounded rank-width are identified by $\textsf{FO} + \textsf{C}$ formulas with $6k+4$ variables and quantifier depth $O(\log n)$.
  Prior to this paper, isomorphism testing for graphs of bounded rank-width was not known to be in $\textsf{NC}$.</description>
