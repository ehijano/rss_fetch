      <title>Nonreciprocal Response of Electrically Biased Graphene-Coated Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we theoretically investigate the nonreciprocal response of an electrically biased graphene-coated dielectric fiber. By electrically biasing the graphene coating along the fiber axis, the dynamic conductivity of graphene exhibits a nonsymmetric response with respect to the longitudinal component of guided-mode wave vectors. Consequently, the guided waves propagating in two opposite directions may encounter distinct propagation features. In this work, the electromagnetic properties, such as modal dispersion and some field distributions are presented, and the strength of nonreciprocity is discussed for different parameters of graphene, such as its chemical potential and material loss. Furthermore, the influence of the radius of the fiber on the nonreciprocal response is investigated. We envision that such nonreciprocal optical fibers may find various potential applications in THz, microwave, and optical technologies.</description>

      <title>Technologies for Modulation of Visible and Near-UV Light and their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control over the amplitude, phase, and spatial distribution of visible-spectrum light underlies many technologies, but commercial solutions remain bulky and require high control power. Recent materials and fabrication advances have spurred interest in visible-light integrated photonics. In this review, we discuss three application spaces which rely on control of visible light - quantum control and measurement of neutral atom and trapped-ion atomic systems, augmented-reality displays, and measurement and control of biological systems. We then review the commercial dynamic surfaces and bulk systems which currently provide visible-light modulation before discussing the current state-of-the-art integrated solutions. Throughout the review we focus on speed, control power, size, optical bandwidth, and technological maturity when comparing technologies.</description>

      <title>Extending the spectral operation of silicon power splitters through subwavelength nanotechnology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power splitters play a crucial role in virtually all photonic circuits, enabling precise control of on-chip signal distribution. However, state-of-the-art solutions typically present trade-offs in terms of loss, bandwidth, and fabrication robustness, especially when targeting multimode operation. Here, we present a novel multimode 3-dB power splitter based on a symmetric Y-junction assisted by subwavelength grating metamaterials. The inclusion of the metamaterial structure circumvents the practical limitations of conventional Y-junction tips and realizes smooth modal transitions. Simulations for a standard 220-nm-thick silicon-on-insulator platform predict minimal excess loss (&lt; 0.2 dB) for the fundamental and the first-order transverse-electric modes over an ultra-broad 700 nm bandwidth (1300-2000 nm). For the fundamental transverse-magnetic mode, losses are less than 0.3 dB in the 1300-1800 nm range. Experimental measurements validate these predictions in the 1430-1630 nm wavelength range, demonstrating losses &lt; 0.4 dB for all three modes, even in the presence of fabrication deviations of up to \pm 10 nm. We believe that this device is suitable for the implementation of advanced photonic systems requiring high-performance distribution of optical signals.</description>

      <title>Toward Optimum Coupling between Free Electrons and Confined Optical Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free electrons are unique tools to probe and manipulate nanoscale optical fields with emerging applications in ultrafast spectromicroscopy and quantum metrology. However, advances in this field are hindered by the small probability associated with the excitation of single optical modes by individual free electrons. Here, we theoretically investigate the scaling properties of the electron-driven excitation probability for a wide variety of optical modes including plasmons in metallic nanostructures and Mie resonances in dielectric cavities, spanning a broad spectral range that extends from the ultraviolet to the infrared. The highest probabilities for the direct generation of three-dimensionally confined modes are observed at low electron and mode energies in small structures, with order-unity ($\sim100$\%) coupling demanding the use of $&lt;100$~eV electrons interacting with $&lt;1$~eV polaritons confined down to tens of nm. Electronic transitions in artificial atoms also emerge as practical systems to realize strong coupling to few-eV free electrons. In contrast, conventional dielectric cavities reach a maximum probability in the few-percent range. In addition, we show that waveguide modes can be generated with higher-than-unity efficiency by phase-matched interaction with grazing electrons, suggesting an efficient method to create multiple excitations of a localized optical mode by an individual electron through funneling the so-generated propagating photons into a confining cavity -- an alternative approach to direct electron-cavity interaction. Our work provides a roadmap to optimize electron-photon coupling with potential applications in electron spectromicroscopy as well as nonlinear and quantum optics at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Intersubband polaritonic metasurfaces for high-contrast ultra-fast power limiting and optical switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear intersubband polaritonic metasurfaces support one of the strongest known ultrafast nonlinear responses in the mid-infrared frequency range across all condensed matter systems. Beyond harmonic generation and frequency mixing, these nonlinearities can be leveraged for ultrafast optical switching and power limiting, based on tailored transitions from strong to weak polaritonic coupling. Here, we demonstrate synergistic optimization of materials and photonic nanostructures to achieve large reflection contrast in ultrafast polaritonic metasurface limiters. The devices are based on optimized semiconductor heterostructure materials that minimize the intersubband transition linewidth and reduce absorption in optically saturated nanoresonators, achieving a record-high reflection contrast of 54% experimentally. We also discuss opportunities to further boost the metrics of performance of this class of ultrafast limiters, showing that reflection contrast as high as 94% may be realistically achieved using all-dielectric intersubband polaritonic metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Nanoimprinted Exciton-Polaritons Metasurfaces: Cost-Effective, Large-Scale, High Homogeneity, and Room Temperature Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons represent a promising platform that combines the strengths of both photonic and electronic systems for future optoelectronic devices. However, their application is currently limited to laboratory research due to the high cost and complexity of fabrication methods, which are not compatible with the mature CMOS technology developed for microelectronics. In this work, we develop an innovative, low-cost, and CMOS-compatible method for fabricating large surface polaritonic devices. This is achieved by direct patterning of a halide-perovskite thin film via thermal nanoimprint. As a result, we observe highly homogeneous polaritonic modes of quality factor $Q\approx 300$ at room temperature across a centimetric scale. Impressively, the process provides high reproducibility and fidelity, as the same mold can be reused more than 10 times to imprint the perovskite layer on different types of substrates. Our results could pave the way for the production of low-cost integrated polaritonic devices operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Geometric-phase signature of a structurally chiral dielectric slab with a central phase defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A slab made of a dielectric structurally chiral medium (DSCM) strongly reflects the co-handed circularly polarized plane wave, but not the cross-handed circularly polarized plane wave, in a spectral regime called the circular Bragg regime. The effect of inserting a central phase defect in a DSCM slab with a modest number of structural periods is a spectral reflection hole in the circular Bragg regime, for co-handed incidence only. However, if the incident plane wave is left-circularly polarized, the geometric phase of the transmitted plane wave contains evidence of both the circular Bragg regime and the spectral reflection hole, regardless of the structural handedness of the DSCM. This evidence is indicative of the type of phase defect. The effect of inserting a central phase defect in a DSCM slab with a large number of structural periods is a spectral transmission hole in the circular Bragg regime, for cross-handed incidence only. The spectral transmission hole may be difficult to observe experimentally because of absorption inside the DSCM slab, but it will still be evident in the geometric phase of the transmitted plane wave, if the incident plane wave is left-circularly polarized.</description>

      <title>What are the quantum commutation relations for the total angular momentum of light?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total angular momentum of light has received attention for its application in a variety of phenomena such as optical communication, optical forces and sensing. However, the quantum behavior including the commutation relations have been relatively less explored. Here, we derive the correct commutation relation for the total angular momentum of light using both relativistic and non-relativistic approaches. An important outcome of our work is the proof that the widely-assumed quantum commutation relation for the total observable angular momentum of light is fundamentally incorrect. Our work will motivate experiments and leads to new insight on the quantum behavior of the angular momentum of light.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Out-of-Plane first-order Displacement Derivatives in Orthogonal shear directions Using Dichroic Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposed a novel and temporal phase-shift digital shearography system for simultaneous measurement of first order displacement derivative in orthogonal shear directions. Dual lasers with wavelengths of 532nm and 637nm, three splitter prism structure, two dichroic mirrors with different response wavelength, and the color CMOS are used in the system. Two dichroic mirrors can be used as shear mirrors to realize shear in orthogonal directions at the same time. The system realizes the measurement of the first-order displacement derivative information in the orthogonal direction of the round metal aluminum plate of diameter 250mm. The experimental results show that the overall displacement integral PV error in the x and y directions is 2.7%-14.8%, which verified the reliability of the system.</description>

      <title>Generation of $\gamma$-photons and pairs with transverse orbital angular momentum via spatiotemporal optical vortex pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the generation of well-collimated $\gamma$-photons and pairs with extrinsic transverse orbital angular momentum (TOAM) through the head-on collision of an intense spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulse carrying intrinsic TOAM with a high-energy electron beam. It is found that the TOAM of STOV pulse remains almost unchanged, and the TOAM is conserved in the center-of-mass frame (CMF). Moreover, there exhibits duality for particles TOAM in the CMF and laboratory frame (LF) when the initial location of high-energy electron beam is different. Furthermore, the TOAM of $\gamma$-photons in the CMF increases while that of positrons decreases as the topological charge of STOV pulse increases, whereas in the LF, the TOAM of both $\gamma$-photons and positrons decreases. And the result under the same pulse intensity is better than that under the same pulse energy. The increase in the initial energy of high-energy electrons leads to an enhancement of the TOAM for both $\gamma$-photons and positrons in both frames. $\gamma$-photons and electrons/positrons with TOAM as a new degree of freedom maybe have an extensive applications in optical communication, astrophysics and nanomaterials and so on.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Recognition of Vortex Beams Modes Through Random Diffusive at the Speed of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical vortex beam with orbital angular momentum (OAM) has great potential to increase the capacity of optical communication and information processing in classical and quantum regimes. Nevertheless, important challenges that influence the optical data transmission in free space is the existence of diffusers along the optical path, which causes inevitable information loss during the wave propagation. Numerous algorithms have been proposed successively for identifying the modes of vortex beams propagating through scattering media. However, these methods all require completion on a computer, which is energyintensive and energy consuming. Here, we propose an all-optical regime for identifying the modes of vortex light fields propagating through scattering media. After training by deep learning, our model can recognize the mode of vortex beam through unknown phase diffusers, demonstrating generalization to new random diffusers that have never been encountered before. Once physically deployed, the entire setup will rapidly identify the modes of vortex light propagating through scattering media at the speed of light, and the entire inference process will consume zero energy except for illumination source. Our research represents a significant step towards highly accurate recognition of vortex light modes propagating through complex scattering media, providing significant guidance for the application of optical communication in complex environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires have been demonstrated as an efficient platform for fluorescence-based biosensors. Here, we study theoretically how GaP nanowires (i) enhance the excitation intensity at the position of fluorophores attached to the nanowire sidewall, (ii) enhance the probability to collect photons emitted from the fluorophores by directing them preferentially into the numerical aperture of collection objective, and (iii) through the Purcell effect increase the quantum yield of fluorophores. We find that the optimum diameter depends strongly on the fluorophore emission wavelength. In addition to an overall signal-detection scheme, we model imaging-based detection of the fluorescence.</description>

      <title>Broadband and fabrication-tolerant 3-dB couplers with topological valley edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3-dB couplers, which are commonly used in photonic integrated circuits for on-chip information processing, precision measurement, and quantum computing, face challenges in achieving robust performance due to their limited 3-dB bandwidths and sensitivity to fabrication errors. To address this, we introduce topological physics to nanophotonics, developing a framework for topological 3-dB couplers. These couplers exhibit broad working wavelength range and robustness against fabrication dimensional errors. By leveraging valley-Hall topology and mirror symmetry, the photonic-crystal-slab couplers achieve ideal 3-dB splitting characterized by a wavelength-insensitive scattering matrix. Tolerance analysis confirms the superiority on broad bandwidth of 48 nm and robust splitting against dimensional errors of 20 nm. We further propose a topological interferometer for on-chip distance measurement, which also exhibits robustness against dimensional errors. This extension of topological principles to the fields of interferometers, may open up new possibilities for constructing robust wavelength division multiplexing, temperature-drift-insensitive sensing, and optical coherence tomography applications.</description>

      <title>Radiation damping of a Rayleigh scatterer illuminated by a plane wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the radiation damping experienced by a dielectric spherical particle when it is illuminated by an electromagnetic plane wave within the Rayleigh regime. We derive the equivalent electric dipole of the moving particle and subsequently calculate the electromagnetic force acting on it from two different approaches. In the first approach, we calculate the force from the integration of stress tensor and field momentum. In the second one, we calculate the force directly from the integration of the force density. Our derivations reveal that the damping coefficient is equal to $6P_{scat}/mc^2$ along the propagation direction, whereas it is $P_{scat}/mc^2$ along perpendicular directions. Here, $P_{scat}$ denotes the power scattered by the particle, and $mc^2$ represents the particle's mass energy. The radiation damping derived in this study sets upper limits on the quality factor of optically levitated objects and ensures the existence of a steady-state solution of the particle's dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations and measurements on selective laser etching of display glasses are reported. By means of a holographic 3D beam splitter, ultrashort laser pulses are focused inside the volume of a glass sample creating type III modifications along a specific trajectory like pearls on a string. Superimposed by a feed of the glass sample a full 3D area of modifications is achieved building the cornerstone for subsequent etch processes. Based on KOH the modifications are selectively etched at a much higher rate compared to unmodified regions resulting in a separation of the glass along the trajectory of modifications. For gaining further insight into the etch process, we perform simulations on this wet chemical process and compare it to our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Hyperpixels: Pixel Filter Arrays of Multivariate Optical Elements for Optimized Spectral Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of `hyperpixels' in which each element of a pixel filter array (suitable for CMOS image sensor integration) has a spectral transmission tailored to a target spectral component expected in application-specific scenes. These are analogous to arrays of multivariate optical elements that could be used for sensing specific analytes. Spectral tailoring is achieved by engineering the heights of multiple sub-pixel Fabry-Perot resonators that cover each pixel area. We first present a design approach for hyperpixels, based on a matched filter concept and, as an exemplar, design a set of 4 hyperpixels tailored to optimally discriminate between 4 spectral reflectance targets. Next, we fabricate repeating 2x2 pixel filter arrays of these designs, alongside repeating 2x2 arrays of an optimal bandpass filters, perform both spectral and imaging characterization. Experimentally measured hyperpixel transmission spectra show a 2.4x reduction in unmixing matrix condition number (p=0.031) compared to the optimal band-pass set. Imaging experiments using the filter arrays with a monochrome sensor achieve a 3.47x reduction in unmixing matrix condition number (p=0.020) compared to the optimal band-pass set. This demonstrates the utility of the hyperpixel approach and shows its superiority even over the optimal bandpass case. We expect that with further improvements in design and fabrication processes increased performance may be obtained. Because the hyperpixels are straightforward to customize, fabricate and can be placed atop monochrome sensors, this approach is highly versatile and could be adapted to a wide range of real-time imaging applications which are limited by low SNR including micro-endoscopy, capsule endoscopy, industrial inspection and machine vision.</description>

      <title>Multi-Convergence-Angle Ptychography with Simultaneous Strong Contrast and High Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in bioimaging methods and hardware facilities have revolutionised the determination of numerous biological structures at atomic or near-atomic resolution. Among these developments, electron ptychography has recently attracted considerable attention because of its superior resolution, remarkable sensitivity to light elements, and high electron dose efficiency. Here, we introduce an innovative approach called multi-convergence-angle (MCA) ptychography, which can simultaneously enhance both contrast and resolution with continuous information transfer across a wide spectrum of spatial frequency. Our work provides feasibility of future applications of MCA-ptychography in providing high-quality two-dimensional images as input to three-dimensional reconstruction methods, thereby facilitating more accurate determination of biological structures.</description>

      <title>Achieving Optical Refractive Index of 10-Plus by Colloidal Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the developments of self-assembled optical metasurfaces to overcome inherent limitations in polarization density (P) within natural materials, which hinder achieving high refractive indices (n) at optical frequencies. The Maxwellian macroscopic description establishes a link between P and n, revealing a static limit in natural materials, restricting n to approximately 4.0 at optical frequencies. Optical metasurfaces, utilizing metallic colloids on a deep-subwavelength scale, offer a solution by unnaturally enhancing n through electric dipolar (ED) resonances. Self-assembly enables the creation of nanometer-scale metallic gaps between metallic nanoparticles (NPs), paving the way for achieving exceptionally high n at optical frequencies. This study focuses on assembling polyhedral gold (Au) NPs into a closely packed monolayer by rationally designing the polymeric ligand to balance attractive and repulsive forces, in that polymeric brush-mediated self-assembly of the close-packed Au NP monolayer is robustly achieved over a large-area. The resulting monolayer of Au nanospheres (NSs), nanooctahedras (NOs), and nanocubes (NCs) exhibits high macroscopic integrity and crystallinity, sufficiently enough for pushing n to record-high regimes. The study underlies the significance of capacitive coupling in achieving an unnaturally high n and explores fine-tuning Au NC size to optimize this coupling. The achieved n of 10.12 at optical frequencies stands as a benchmark, highlighting the potential of polyhedral Au NPs in advancing optical metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Application of Principal Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks for the Prediction of QoS in FSO Links over South Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Communication in Free Space (FSO) bids more radio bandwidth, operates under a gratis license, and has a lower startup cost as compared to Radio Frequency (RF). Nonetheless, its vulnerability to variations in atmospheric meteorological circumstances is a concern. Ultimately, the purpose of this study is to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to design a QoS prediction model for a terrestrial FSO communication connection. To accomplish the specified goal, meteorological data such as visibility, wind speed, and altitude were collected from the Weather Services in South Africa (SAWS) archive during a ten-year duration at five different locations: George, Johannesburg, Kimberly, Bloemfontein, and Polokwane. The eigenvalues of the first Principal Component (PC1) and the second Principal Component (PC2) in the PCA across the stations Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, Kimberly, George, and Polokwane are 7.624 and 1.020, 7.234, and 0.984, 6.204 and 1.723, 7.354 and 0.876, and 7.104 and 0.865, respectively, demonstrating that, they are kept as QoS variables to train the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model as they provide the most compelling interpretation of the original variable data. The RMSE values of every proposed model across all the study locations are 0.1437, 0.2131, 0.2329, 0.1101, and 0.1977, respectively. Based on the RMSE, the proposed performed better over George. A realistic and accurate predictive model is developed for each of the study locations. Thus, the developed model will serve as a valuable tool for maintaining good QoS in FSO network services and improving telecom businesses in South Africa.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a secure optical communication protocol that harnesses quantum correlation within entangled photon pairs. A message written by acting on one of the photons can be read by exclusive measurements of the other photon of the pair. In this scheme a bright, meaningless optical beam hides the message rendering it inaccessible to potential eavesdroppers. Unlike traditional methods our approach only affects unauthorized users, fundamentally limiting their access to the communication channel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol by achieving secure communication through both amplitude and phase modulation. We successfully employ this technique for the secure transfer of an image. We demonstrate data exchange speed of up to 8 bits per second, along with the corresponding eye diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A study about the reflection and transmission of an electromagnetic pulse through a slab doped with four-level atomic system has been presented. The doped atoms are considered to be in N-configuration with a pump field and a weak probe field. An additional control field is also applied to manipulate the Raman gain of the atomic medium. The propagation of transmitted and reflected pulses at different control field strengths and different slab thickness has been studied. It is found that the transmitted and reflected pulses can be simultaneously subluminal or superluminal. These pulses can be controlled from subluminal to superluminal by adjusting the strength of the control field</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long range interactions between dark vectorial temporal cavity solitons are induced though the spontaneous symmetry breaking of orthogonally polarized fields in ring resonators. Turing patterns of alternating polarizations form between adjacent solitons, pushing them apart so that a random distribution of solitons along the cavity length reaches equal equilibrium distances. Enhancement of the frequency comb is achieved through the spontaneous formation of regularly spaced soliton crystals, 'self-crystallization', with greater power and spacing of the spectral lines for increasing soliton numbers.</description>

      <title>Vector Ising Spin Annealer for Minimizing Ising Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Vector Ising Spin Annealer (VISA), a framework in gain-based computing that harnesses light-matter interactions to solve complex optimization problems encoded in spin Hamiltonians. Traditional driven-dissipative systems often select excited states due to limitations in spin movement. VISA transcends these constraints by enabling spins to operate in a three-dimensional space, offering a robust solution to minimize Ising Hamiltonians effectively. Our comparative analysis reveals VISA's superior performance over conventional single-dimension spin optimizers, demonstrating its ability to bridge substantial energy barriers in complex landscapes. Through detailed studies on cyclic and random graphs, we show VISA's proficiency in dynamically evolving the energy landscape with time-dependent gain and penalty annealing, illustrating its potential to redefine optimization in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Optimization Method of WDM Visible Light Communication System for Indoor Broadcasting Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to optimize energy efficiency in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems designed for indoor broadcasting networks. A physics-based LED model is integrated into system energy efficiency optimization, enabling quantitative analysis of the critical issue of VLC energy efficiency: the nonlinear interplay between illumination and communication performance. The optimization jointly incorporates constraints on communication quality of each channel, and illumination performance, standardized by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). The formulated nonlinear optimization problem is solved by the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm in an experiment-based simulation. An integrated Red-Green-Blue-Yellow Light Emitting Diode (RGBY-LED) is measured for model calibration and three different scenarios are simulated to evaluate the generality of the proposed method. Results demonstrate a double enhancement in performance and a high versatility in accommodating various scenarios. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of balancing communication and illumination imperatives in VLC systems, challenging conventional perceptions focused solely on minimizing power consumption.</description>

      <title>Multimodal operando microscopy reveals that interfacial chemistry and nanoscale performance disorder dictate perovskite solar cell stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation low-cost semiconductors such as halide perovskites exhibit optoelectronic properties dominated by nanoscale variations in their structure, composition and photophysics. While microscopy provides a proxy for ultimate device function, past works have focused on neat thin-films on insulating substrates, missing crucial information about charge extraction losses and recombination losses introduced by transport layers. Here we use a multimodal operando microscopy toolkit to measure nanoscale current-voltage curves, recombination losses and chemical composition in an array of state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells before and after extended operational stress. We apply this toolkit to the same scan areas before and after extended operation to reveal that devices with the highest performance have the lowest initial performance spatial heterogeneity - a crucial link that is missed in conventional microscopy. We find that subtle compositional engineering of the perovskite has surprising effects on local disorder and resilience to operational stress. Minimising variations in local efficiency, rather than compositional disorder, is predictive of improved performance and stability. Modulating the interfaces with different contact layers or passivation treatments can increase initial performance but can also lead to dramatic nanoscale, interface-dominated degradation even in the presence of local performance homogeneity, inducing spatially varying transport, recombination, and electrical losses. These operando measurements of full devices act as screenable diagnostic tools, uniquely unveiling the microscopic mechanistic origins of device performance losses and degradation in an array of halide perovskite devices and treatments. This information in turn reveals guidelines for future improvements to both performance and stability.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate the formation of a super bound state in a continuum (BIC) on a photonic crystal flat band. This unique state simultaneously exhibits an enhanced quality factor and near-zero group velocity across an extended region of the Brillouin zone. It is achieved at the topological transition when a symmetry-protected BIC pinned at $k=0$ merges with two Friedrich-Wintgen quasi-BICs, which arise from destructive interference between lossy photonic modes of opposite symmetries. As a proof-of-concept, we employ the super flat BIC to demonstrate three-dimensional optical trapping of individual particles. Our findings present a novel approach to engineering both the real and imaginary components of photonic states on a subwavelength scale for innovative optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Transmission anomalies in 2D photonic crystals from the checkerboard family: From broken to hidden symmetries and plasmon "spoofing"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a field representation, the main symmetry of the electromagnetic response of complementary metal film structures is described by the Babinet principle, expected to be obeyed by structures in vanishingly thin films of a perfect electric conductor. A softer transmittance Babinet principle (TBP) is not so restrictive. The goal of this work is to study how severely this broken symmetry affects the optical response of such structures. We consider two geometrically distinct series of planar complementary structures from the checkerboard family: regular and bowtie. The self-complementary structure of these series is very singular and breaks even the rigorous Babinet principle. We study complete simulated transmittance spectral maps (T-Maps) that accumulate the whole spectral response of an entire series of structures in a single plot. The ab initio T-Maps of these 2D photonic crystals were simulated for linearly polarized waves propagating perpendicular to the planar structures, made in a vanishingly thin film of a perfect electric conductor. While confirming the expected long wavelength validity of the TBP, we show that in the frequency range where diffraction effects dominate, the standard derivation of the TBP no longer applies, and with the help of our T-Maps, we demonstrate a total collapse of the TBP in the structures considered. This broken symmetry practically eliminates all but one transmission band on the hole side of the T-Maps, the remaining strong band being a "spoof" plasmon, free of multiple frequency replicas, an important feature for filter applications. By symmetry arguments and simulations, we discovered that the T-Maps for bowtie and doubled-period regular structures are identical. We discuss how this hidden symmetry can benefit applications by providing a convenient scaling, whereby simplified structures can deliver a tailored response.</description>

Abstract: Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM) allows printing of mesoscopic objects within seconds or minutes. Tomographic patterns are illuminated onto a rotating glass vial which contains a photosensitive resin. Current pattern optimization is based on a ray optical assumption which ultimately leads to limited resolution around $20\mu\textrm{m}$ and varying throughout the volume of the 3D object. In this work, we introduce a rigorous wave-based optical amplitude optimization scheme for TVAM which shows that high-resolution printing is theoretically possible over the full volume. The wave optical optimization approach is based on an efficient angular spectrum method of plane waves with custom written memory efficient gradients and allows for optimization of realistic volumes for TVAM such as $(100\mu\textrm{m})^3$ or $(10\textrm{mm})^3$ with $550^3$ voxels and 600 angles. Our simulations show that ray-optics start to produce artifacts when the desired features are $20\mu\textrm{m}$ and below and more importantly, the amplitude modulated TVAM can reach micrometer features when optimizing the patterns using a full wave model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal Optical Vortices (STOVs) are structured electromagnetic fields propagating in free space with phase singularities in the space-time domain. Depending on the tilt of the helical phase front, STOVs can carry both longitudinal and transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). Although STOVs have gained significant interest in the recent years, the current understanding is limited to the semi-classical picture. Here, we develop a quantum theory for STOVs with an arbitrary tilt, extending beyond the paraxial limit. We demonstrate that quantum STOV states, such as Fock and coherent twisted photon pulses, display non-vanishing longitudinal OAM fluctuations that are absent in conventional monochromatic twisted pulses. We show that these quantum fluctuations exhibit a unique texture, i.e. a spatial distribution which can be used to experimentally isolate these quantum effects. Our findings represent a step towards the exploitation of quantum effects of structured light for various applications such as OAM-based encoding protocols and platforms to explore novel light-matter interaction in 2D material systems.</description>

Abstract: These notes appeared as a summary during the initial acquaintance with the structure and properties of spatio-temporal optical vortices (STOV), as these are presented in the current literature. The general approach to the STOV description and characterization is based on the model of scalar paraxial Gaussian wave packet. On this ground, the STOV structures of arbitrary orders are considered as superpositions of spatio-temporal Hermite-Gaussian modes. This representation enables the direct and physically meaningful characterization of the STOV amplitude and phase distributions, their evolution upon free propagation and in optical systems, internal energy flows and the orbital angular momentum. The topologically determined asymmetry and the difference between the "energy center" and "probability center" [Phys. Rev. A 107, L031501 (2023)] is discussed and qualitatively interpreted. Methods for the STOV generation and diagnostics are outlined, and the main properties of non-Gaussian (Bessel-type) STOVs are briefly described. The notes may be useful as initial introduction to the STOV-associated ideas and their extraordinary properties.</description>

Abstract: To harness the potential of radially polarized single photons in applications such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) and quantum communication, we demonstrate an on-chip, room-temperature device, which generates highly directional radially polarized photons at very high rates. The photons are emitted from a giant CdSe/CdS colloidal quantum dot (gQD) accurately positioned at the tip of a metal nanocone centered inside a hybrid metal-dielectric bullseye antenna. We show that due to the large and selective Purcell enhancement specifically for the out-of-plane optical dipole of the gQD, the emitted photons can have a very high degree of radial polarization (&gt;93%), based on a quantitative metric. Our study emphasizes the importance of accurate gQD positioning for optimal radial polarization purity through extensive experiments and simulations, which contribute to the fundamental understanding of radial polarization in nanostructured devices and pave the way for implementation of such systems in practical applications using structured quantum light.</description>

      <title>Generative deep learning-enabled ultra-large field-of-view lens-free imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in high-throughput biomedical applications necessitate real-time, large field-of-view (FOV) imaging capabilities. Conventional lens-free imaging (LFI) systems, while addressing the limitations of physical lenses, have been constrained by dynamic, hard-to-model optical fields, resulting in a limited one-shot FOV of approximately 20 $mm^2$. This restriction has been a major bottleneck in applications like live-cell imaging and automation of microfluidic systems for biomedical research. Here, we present a deep-learning(DL)-based imaging framework - GenLFI - leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) for holographic image reconstruction. We demonstrate that GenLFI can achieve a real-time FOV over 550 $mm^2$, surpassing the current LFI system by more than 20-fold, and even larger than the world's largest confocal microscope by 1.76 times. The resolution is at the sub-pixel level of 5.52 $\mu m$, without the need for a shifting light source. The unsupervised learning-based reconstruction does not require optical field modeling, making imaging dynamic 3D samples (e.g., droplet-based microfluidics and 3D cell models) in complex optical fields possible. This GenLFI framework unlocks the potential of LFI systems, offering a robust tool to tackle new frontiers in high-throughput biomedical applications such as drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Radiation Produced with Slow-Wave Fundamental Mode and Generalized Fundamental mode in Periodic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study suggests an idea that radiation in a periodic leaky-wave antenna (PLWA) should be considered to be produced with the fundamental mode, regardless of whether it is fast-wave or slow-wave. The idea is different from the conventional PLWA theory, which considers it a fact that a PLWA produces radiation with its fast-wave space harmonic when the fundamental mode is slow-wave. To elaborate the idea, it is proved that there is not an eigen-equation like Pythagorean theorem for the fundamental mode in PLWAs. Then a non-uniform structure antenna is designed to show that slow-wave modes can produce leaky-wave radiation. Again it is proved that the difference of the phase constants between a slow-wave fundamental mode and its fast-wave space harmonics has not any effect on the radiation pattern of a PLWA. Moreover, it is clarified that the fundamental mode has a more definite physical significance than space harmonics. Finally, a concept of generalized fundamental modes is proposed without using Fourier expansion. The generalized fundamental modes have the same phase and attenuation constants as any space harmonics, and have physical significance as the conventional fundamental mode. Therefore, it could replace the roles that the space harmonics used to play.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Theory of Temporally Mismatched Homodyne Measurements with Applications to Optical Frequency Comb Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fields of precision timekeeping and spectroscopy increasingly rely on optical frequency comb interferometry. However, comb-based measurements are not described by existing quantum theory because they exhibit both large mode mismatch and finite strength local oscillators. To establish this quantum theory, we derive measurement operators for homodyne detection with arbitrary mode overlap. These operators are a combination of quadrature and intensity-like measurements, which inform a filter that maximizes the quadrature measurement signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, these operators establish a foundation to extend frequency-comb interferometry to a wide range of scenarios, including metrology with nonclassical states of light.</description>

      <title>Analysis of two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with differing texture structure, perovskite carrier lifetime and tunneling junction quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Presented here is the optimization of a planar two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with a texture structure. The developed simulation model is fitted to published experimental results, and the importance of current matching in the two-terminal structure is discussed. With the texture structure optimized and considering current matching, the optimal texture structure improves $J_{sc}$ from 17.9~mA/cm$^2$ to 20.87~mA/cm$^2$ compared to the planar structure, as well as improving the power conversion efficiency from 25.8% to 35.9%. Furthermore, if the quality of the perovskite thin film and tunneling junction efficiency with a smaller voltage penalty can be improved, then the efficiency can be further improved to 38.13%. This indicates that this tandem solar cell still has much room for improvement.</description>

      <title>Hot electrons and dark excitons modulate strong-coupling conditions in metal-organic optical microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polaritons are promising for important applications including organic solar cells, optical logic gates, and qubits. In low-Q microcavities, polaritonic signatures of strongly hybridized photons and Frenkel excitons were previously found to decay together with dark excitons. There remain unresolved questions regarding whether dark excitons affect the strength of exciton-photon coupling. Additionally, the contributions of dark excitons in organic layers and hot electrons in metal films to the polaritonic response are not fully understood. Here, we identified that due to delocalization of polaritons over organic and metal layers, they are sensitive to both dark excitons and hot electrons. Dark excitons modulate exciton-photon coupling strength, whereas hot-electrons imprint two-temperature dynamics onto the polaritonic response. Both organic and metal films contribute to transient Fano-like gain-loss spectra of exciton-polaritons. These and other mechanistic insights into the strong-coupling dynamics were supported by the theory of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian mechanics, axially-resolved optical simulations, global analysis of pump-probe spectra, and statistical correlation analysis. The developed methodology can be applied to other microcavity structures. Our findings are important for disentangling pure polaritonic effects from other excitations in organic and metal layers, with the ultimate aim of achieving photonic control over photophysical and photochemical processes.</description>

      <title>High-resolution MHz time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy based on a tunable vacuum ultraviolet source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) allows direct mapping of the electronic band structure and its dynamic response on femtosecond timescales. Here, we present a new ARPES system, powered by a new fiber-based femtosecond light source in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) range, accessing the complete first Brillouin zone for most materials. We present trARPES data on Au(111), polycrystalline Au, Bi2Se3 and TaTe2, demonstrating an energy resolution of 21 meV with a time resolution of &lt;360 fs, at a high repetition rate of 1 MHz. The system is integrated with an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) high harmonic generation (HHG) beamline, enabling excellent tunability of the time-bandwidth resolution.</description>

      <title>Topology reconstruction for asymmetric systems by isomorphic mapping or perturbation approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The systems without symmetries, e.g. the spatial and chiral symmetries, are generally thought to be improper for topological study and no conventional integral topological invariant can be well defined. In this work, with multi-band asymmetric Rice-Mele-like systems as examples, for the first time we show that the topology of all gaps can be reconstructed by two general methods and topological origin of many phenomena are revealed. A new integral topological invariant, i.e. the renormalized real-space winding number, can properly characterize the topology and bulk-edge correspondence of such systems. For the first method, an isomorphic mapping relationship between a Rice-Mele-like system and its chiral counterpart is set up, which accounts for the topology reconstruction in the half-filling gaps. For the second method, the Hilbert space of asymmetric systems could be reduced into degenerate subspaces by perturbation approximation, so that the topology in subspaces accounts for the topology reconstruction in the fractional-filling gaps. Surprisingly, the topology reconstructed by perturbation approximation exhibits extraordinary robustness since the topological edge states even exist far beyond the weak perturbation limit. We also show that both methods can be widely used for other asymmetric systems, e.g. the two-dimensional (2D) Rice-Mele systems and the superconductor systems. At last, for the asymmetric photonic systems, we predict different topological edge states by our topology-reconstruction theory and experimentally observe them in the laboratory, which agrees with each other very well. Our findings open a door for investigating new topological phenomena in asymmetric systems by various topological reconstruction methods which should greatly expand the category of topology study.</description>
