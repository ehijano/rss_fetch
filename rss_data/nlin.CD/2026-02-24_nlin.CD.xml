      <title>A Criterion for Safe Overshoot in Coupled Tipping Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abrupt transitions are a central concern in climate and ecological research, and may arise when critical thresholds known as tipping points are crossed. However, previous work has shown that finite-time overshoots of tipping points can be safe, and that such behavior is captured by an inverse-square-law criterion when overshoots are sufficiently small and slow. So far studied in isolated systems with external drivers, (un)safe overshoots may also emerge from interactions between subsystems. Here, we investigate safe-overshoot phenomena in unidirectionally coupled slow-fast systems featuring both nonlinear interactions and coupling through time-derivatives. Specifically, we derive a criterion for the occurrence of safe overshoots analogous to the inverse-square law for isolated systems, but adapted to interactive settings, and expressed explicitly in terms of the timescale separation and coupling strength between subsystems. We illustrate these results using two conceptual models in which the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation interacts with either the Amazon rainforest or the Greenland Ice Sheet.</description>

      <title>Functorial invariants for chaos topology from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The templex is a recently introduced topological object bridging homologies and templates for chaotic attractors: its cell complex encodes the directionless properties of the attractor's branched manifold in phase space, and its directed graph captures the flow-compatible paths starting and ending in joining loci. Algebraic topology is deeply connected to category theory because it studies spaces by translating them into algebraic objects through structure-preserving mappings. The homology functor translates structural properties into a set of layered invariants called homology groups. The templex is shown here to play the same role for directed spaces that cell complexes play for spaces. The directed properties of a templex are found therewith to admit a functorial formulation. This formulation provides a rigorous foundation for a theory of chaos topology developed so far algorithmically, and establishes operationally a topological criterion for finite-time chaos. A climatic simulation and an experimental speech signal are analyzed as illustrative applications.</description>

      <title>Transformers for dynamical systems learn transfer operators in-context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for scientific machine learning adapt to physical settings unseen during training, such as zero-shot transfer between turbulent scales. This phenomenon, in-context learning, challenges conventional understanding of learning and adaptation in physical systems. Here, we study in-context learning of dynamical systems in a minimal setting: we train a small two-layer, single-head transformer to forecast one dynamical system, and then evaluate its ability to forecast a different dynamical system without retraining. We discover an early tradeoff in training between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, which manifests as a secondary double descent phenomenon. We discover that attention-based models apply a transfer-operator forecasting strategy in-context. They (1) lift low-dimensional time series using delay embedding, to detect the system's higher-dimensional dynamical manifold, and (2) identify and forecast long-lived invariant sets that characterize the global flow on this manifold. Our results clarify the mechanism enabling large pretrained models to forecast unseen physical systems at test without retraining, and they illustrate the unique ability of attention-based models to leverage global attractor information in service of short-term forecasts.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning based Ensemble Flame Regime Classification for Mesoscale Combustors based on Insights from Linear and Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaining insights into flame behaviour at small scales can lead to improvements in the efficiency of micro-reactors, compact power generation systems, fire safety technologies, and various other applications where combustion is confined to micro or mesoscales. Flame regimes observed in mesoscale combustors, namely Stable flame, Flames with repetitive extinction and ignition, and Propagating flame, exhibit unique dynamic characteristics that differentiate them from one another. In this study, we systematically examine the various flame regimes observed in mesoscale combustors from both dynamical and statistical standpoints. Our experimental methodology involves stabilizing a flame inside a quartz tube (an optically accessible mesoscale combustor) with an inner diameter of 5 mm. A premixed methane-air mixture is used as fuel, with its equivalence ratio and Reynolds number being the input parameters. Instantaneous OH* chemiluminescence and Acoustic pressure signals, along with high-speed flame imaging, were acquired for combustion dynamics characterization. The objective of this study is to analyze the distinct dynamical signatures associated with these observed flame regimes. For this purpose, Recurrence Quantification Analysis, followed by a Statistical-Spectral analysis, has been performed based on the experimentally acquired OH* Chemiluminescence and Acoustic pressure time-series signals. Subsequently, a stacking ensemble-based machine learning framework has been implemented for mesoscale flame regime classification based on the features extracted from the two aforementioned analyses. In addition, Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) scalograms and three-dimensional phase plots have been graphed to visually elucidate the evolution of system dynamics and the complex interaction of competing time scales in these flame regimes.</description>

      <title>On the importance of stochasticity in closures of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic closures for coarse-grained turbulence models help reproduce mean statistics, but often fail to capture the finite-time growth of uncertainty. Using the framework of shell models as a quantitative multi-scale testbed, we compare fully resolved simulations with large-eddy simulations using either stochastic or deterministic subgrid closures. While in the fully resolved system a single microscopic perturbation is rapidly amplified by strongly chaotic dynamics, truncation produces a strong delay and suppression of variance growth when uncertainty is introduced through initial condition perturbations only. We show that a data-driven Langevin-type stochastic closure restores the correct timing and magnitude of variance growth across scales, demonstrating that sustained stochasticity is essential for predictability in reduced turbulent dynamics.</description>

      <title>A posteriori closure of turbulence models: are symmetries preserved?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence modeling remains a longstanding challenge in fluid dynamics. Recent advances in data-driven methods have led to a surge of novel approaches aimed at addressing this problem. This work builds upon our recent work [Phys. Rev. Fluids 10, 044602 (2025)], where we introduced a new closure for a shell model of turbulence using an a posteriori (or solver-in-the-loop) approach. Unlike most deep learning-based models, our method explicitly incorporates physical equations into the neural network framework, ensuring that the closure remains constrained by the underlying physics benefiting from enhanced stability and generalizability. In this paper, we further analyze the learned closure, probing its capabilities and limitations. In particular, we look at joint probability density functions between resolved and unresolved variables, as well as the scale invariance of multipliers (ratios between adjacent shells) within the inertial range. Although our model excels in reproducing high-order statistical moments, it breaks this known symmetry near the cutoff, indicating a fundamental limitation. We discuss the implications of these findings for subgrid-scale modeling in 3D turbulence and outline directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Effective synchronization amid noise-induced chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two remote agents with synchronized clocks may use them to act in concert and communicate. This necessitates some means of creating and maintaining synchrony. One method, not requiring any direct interaction between the agents, is to expose them to a common, environmental, stochastic forcing. This "noise-induced synchronization" only occurs under sufficiently mild forcing; stronger forcing disrupts synchronization. We investigate the regime of strong noise, where the clocks' relative phases evolve chaotically. Using a simple realization of disruptive noise, we demonstrate effective synchronization. First, although the relative phases of the two clocks varied erratically, we confirm that they became statistically independent of initial conditions and hence equivalent after a well-defined timescale. Second, we show that an agent can estimate an effective phase that closely agrees with the other's phase. Thus, synchronization is practically attainable beyond the regime of conventional noise-induced synchronization. We finally discuss how it might be used in living systems.</description>
