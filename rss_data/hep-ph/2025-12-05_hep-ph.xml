      <title>How large can lepton mixing be?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, contrary to common expectations, the observed charged leptons can have a substantial mixing with new heavier fermions, at the level of 20$\%$. This can happen, in the language of effective theories, when the effect of mixing with heavier fermions vanishes at tree level in operators of mass-dimension 6 (or it is suppressed by the small charged lepton masses), a cancellation that can be naturally ensured by symmetries. Using a model that realizes this scenario we consider all current direct and indirect constraints and show that experimental constraints on the mixing are so mild that, given the current direct limit on the mass of the heavy fermions, theoretical considerations become the leading current constraints on the mixing. We also estimate the sensitivity to the mixing at future experiments, including the high-luminosity phase of the LHC and, most notably, the FCC-ee, and FCC-hh. We find a pattern in which the reach of direct searches in hadron machines makes theoretical considerations lead the limits while the precision of lepton machines can beat these theoretical considerations. We find that the FCC can finally reach per mille precision in the mixing squared of the charged leptons</description>

      <title>Enhancing next token prediction based pre-training for jet foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next token prediction is an attractive pre-training task for jet foundation models, in that it is simulation free and enables excellent generative capabilities that can transfer across datasets. Here we study multiple improvements to next token prediction, building on the initial work of OmniJet-$\alpha$. Instead of tokenizing particles and subsequently only using the token-ID as the model input for both the generative and the classification task, we adopt a hybrid setup, which allows us to use continuous feature vectors as model input while only using token-IDs in the next token prediction target. Secondly, we explore a combined pre-training strategy that combines masked particle modeling and generative learning objectives. Taken together, these changes greatly improve the performance in downstream classification tasks without any loss in generative performance.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Predictions for Dark Photon and Millicharged Particle Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate signal predictions are essential for interpreting and optimizing fixed-target searches for new physics. Even in minimal models such as the dark photon ($A'$) or millicharged particles (mCPs), theoretical uncertainties in hadronic production can be substantial. We introduce a data-driven framework that predicts both the rate and kinematic distributions of $A'$ and mCP production directly from measured dilepton events, without relying on specific theoretical production models. This method uses the close correspondence between amplitudes for emission of $A'$ or mCPs, and for off-shell Standard Model photon production, the latter being experimentally measurable in full differential form. We demonstrate that normalizing flow models can learn these distributions from data and serve as a fast, realistic Monte Carlo generator for dark sector signal simulations.</description>

      <title>A new connection between WIMP dark matter and the hierarchy problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a direct link between the hierarchy problem and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): we suggest that the small mass of the Higgs boson arises from being dynamically driven to the scale of the WIMP. Such a special electroweak vacuum is singled out by lying close to the critical boundary of a phase transition, as recently explored in a new class of cosmological solutions to the hierarchy problem. They generically predict the Higgs potential to be destabilised just above the weak scale. Intriguingly, the requirement for new physics to achieve this coincides with two independently well-motivated expectations: a split spectrum of light fermions and heavy bosons, as anticipated from naturalness, and the so-called "WIMP miracle". A WIMP with mass around the weak scale not only happens to have the correct thermal relic abundance to be the dark matter (DM), it can also give rise to the necessary critical boundary at the TeV scale through its Yukawa couplings to the Higgs. We use a higgsino-like singlet-doublet model to illustrate our Higgs-DM criticality scenario and show that if this WIMP DM mass is observed to be greater than ~1.2 TeV then it necessarily implies a strong bound on the Higgs mass and an upper bound on the scale of heavy new physics that restores vacuum stability. It can be thoroughly probed in direct detection experiments, astrophysical signals and future collider searches, further motivating a comprehensive exploration of the remaining heavy WIMP parameter space.</description>

      <title>Minimal Flavor Protection for TeV-scale New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine how much TeV-scale new physics can deviate from flavor universality, $U(3)^5$, while respecting stringent bounds on flavor-changing neutral currents. The minimal continuous subgroup that must be approximately preserved is identified as $SU(2)_{q} \times U(1)_{X}$. With only a few symmetry-breaking spurions of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$, all observed fermion hierarchies may be reproduced, offering a new perspective on the SM flavor puzzle. Remarkably, this framework provides structural flavor protection for generic TeV-scale new physics within the SMEFT, enlarging the space of collider-accessible scenarios beyond MFV and $U(2)^5$ and allowing for richer patterns of flavor violation.</description>

      <title>Resummed Distribution Functions: Making Perturbation Theory Positive and Normalized</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed-order perturbative calculations for differential cross sections can suffer from non-physical artifacts: they can be non-positive, non-normalizable, and non-finite, none of which occur in experimental measurements. We propose a framework, the Resummed Distribution Function (RDF), that, given a perturbative calculation for an observable to some finite order in $\alpha_s$, will ``resum'' the expression in a way that is guaranteed to match the original expression order-by-order and be positive, normalized, and finite. Moreover, our ansatz parameterizes all possible finite, positive, and normalized completions consistent with the original fixed-order expression, which can include N$^n$LL resummed expressions. The RDF also enables a more direct notion of perturbative uncertainties, as we can directly vary higher-order parameters and treat them as nuisance parameters. We demonstrate the power of the RDF ansatz by matching to thrust to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ and extracting $\alpha_s$ with perturbative uncertainties from fitting the RDF to ALEPH data.</description>

      <title>Electroweak phase transition in SMEFT: Gravitational wave and collider complementarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electroweak first-order electroweak phase transition (FO-EWPT) within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework induced by dimension-6 operators. Such phenomena can be probed independently via \textit{di}-Higgs production at the collider experiments as well as via the detection of gravitational waves (GW). There are three dimension-6 SMEFT operators that simultaneously modify the Higgs potential at tree level and contribute to the \textit{di}-Higgs production at the hadron colliders. With \textit{di}-Higgs production being suppressed at current LHC runs, we aim to probe this production at high luminosity (HL) and high energy (HE) runs of the LHC to achieve better sensitivity of dimension-6 SMEFT operators. The correlations among these operators are analyzed in the context of probing FO-EWPT, emphasizing the complementarity between future GW observations and upgraded LHC searches.</description>

      <title>Detecting light axions from supernovae in nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to nucleons can be efficiently produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and then, if they couple to photons, convert into gamma rays in cosmic magnetic fields, generating short gamma-ray bursts. Though ALPs from a Galactic SN would induce an intense and easily detectable gamma-ray signal, such events are exceedingly rare. In contrast, a few SNe per year are expected in nearby galaxies within $\mathcal{O}(10)$ Mpc, where strong magnetic fields can enable more efficient ALP-photon conversions than in the Milky Way, offering a promising extragalactic target. This circumstance motivates full-sky gamma-ray monitoring, ideally combined with deci-hertz gravitational-wave detectors to enable time-triggered searches from nearby galaxies. We show that, under realistic conditions, a decade of coverage could reach sensitivities to ALP-photon coupling $g_{a \gamma} \gtrsim 10^{-16} \rm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-9} $ eV and assuming an ALP-nucleon coupling close to SN 1987A cooling bound. This sensitivity would allow one to probe a large, currently-unexplored region of the parameter space below the longstanding SN 1987A bound.</description>

      <title>Z' portal dark matter from post-inflationary reheating: WIMPs, FIMPs, and UFOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production of dark matter (DM) via a heavy $Z'$ mediator during the post-inflationary reheating epoch. In particular, we study production from three mechanisms which are smoothly connected to one another: WIMP-like freeze-out, FIMP-like freeze-in, and ultra-relativistic freeze-out (UFO). This is the first systematic study of $Z'$ portal DM which includes UFO. We find that much of the available parameter space for keV to TeV DM lies in the UFO regime for $ 1 \text{ TeV}\lesssim M_{Z'} \lesssim 1 \text{ PeV}$. When the mediator mass $M_{Z'}$ is greater than both the DM mass and the reheating temperature, UFO is a robust mechanism for producing cold DM. Although UFO DM is initially "hot" after freeze-out, it can easily become cold before structure formation if freeze-out occurs during post-inflationary reheating. Compared to standard freeze-in, UFO can accommodate significantly stronger interaction strengths (stronger couplings and/or smaller mediator masses).</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations of Spectator Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mechanism for gravitational wave (GW) production from isocurvature perturbations in spectator scalar fields during inflation. These energetically subdominant fields develop blue-tilted power spectra through inflationary dynamics, generating second-order scalar perturbations that source a stochastic GW background. The mechanism naturally satisfies CMB constraints at large scales while producing enhanced signals at smaller scales across a broad frequency range $10^{-20} - 1$ Hz. We perform comprehensive numerical and analytical calculations of the complete isocurvature spectrum evolution, including gravitational particle production, reheating dynamics, and scalar-induced GW generation. For spectator fields with effective masses $0.5 \lesssim m_{\chi,\mathrm{eff}}/H_I$, the resulting GW energy density reaches $\Omega_{\text{GW}} h^2 \sim 10^{-20}$-$10^{-12}$, accessible to pulsar timing arrays, space-based interferometers, and next-generation CMB experiments. Our analysis reveals that GW-induced constraints exceed current isocurvature bounds. We examine both unstable (curvaton-like) and stable (dark matter) spectator fields, demonstrating strong sensitivity to reheating temperature, inflaton-spectator coupling, and decay dynamics. This framework establishes isocurvature-sourced GWs as a powerful probe of early universe physics, enabling simultaneous constraints on inflationary dynamics, dark matter production, and reheating through coordinated multi-frequency GW observations.</description>

Abstract: We determine the minimum value of thrust for a number of N-particle configurations. For N=5 in three dimensions an exact result is found for the first time. For larger N we obtain numerical results through optimisation. When a definite value cannot be reliably identified, the results are analysed in the context of Extreme Value Theory, using a Maximum Likelihood Estimate and a Bayesian analysis. Results are given for three spatial dimensions, two dimensions, and selected cases in d dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of models where the masses of the light Standard Model fermions are due to an Effective Field Theory operator that appears beyond dimension-4 in the power counting expansion, resulting in a `Powerful Yukawa'. The effective Yukawa coupling structure is UV-completed using a collective symmetry breaking pattern in the flavour sector, which we dub `Sprouted Symmetry Breaking.' The irreducible signature is an enhanced Higgs coupling to the light Standard Model fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that hadron colliders have an excellent reach for positivity tests on a class of diphoton operators. Due to the helicity selection rules, the relevant dimension-6 operators either do not contribute or are highly constrained by other experimental observables. We show, for the first time, that the LHC can probe the positivity of the dimension-8 operators involving colored particles. The kinematic differential distributions of the diphoton final states are exploited to perform the $\chi^2$ analysis. Through a global fit, the effective scale for these operators can be inclusively probed up to around 2 TeV at HL-LHC and over 5 TeV at future 100 TeV FCC-hh at 95% C.L., providing a powerful test of the positivity bounds up to multi-TeV scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second excitation of the nucleon, the Roper, has properties differentiated from other low-lying nucleon resonances. Their properties challenge our understanding of the structure of the baryons in terms of the degrees of freedom from QCD. In the present work we discuss the properties of the Roper resonance and the nucleon to Roper electromagnetic transition, based on the quark degrees of freedom, that are expected to dominate for large square momentum transfer $Q^2$. We also discuss the analytic structure of the transition amplitudes in the low-$Q^2$ region, and how the contributions of baryon-meson states can help to describe the low and intermediate $Q^2$ data, and the nature of the Roper.</description>

      <title>Probing Hard Scattering Processes via Multiple Weak Gauge Boson Production at the Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the possible ways to detect the new physics phenomena particles is to investigate the weak gauge boson production as a result of hadron-hadron scattering. This study comprises the production of multiple weak gauge bosons as a result of hard scattering between the proton-proton beams at multi-TeV energies and integrated luminosity $\mathcal L =$ 3000 $fb ^{-1}$. The effective production cross-sections for pair, triple, and quartic scattering mechanisms have been computed as a function of $\sqrt s$. The center of mass energy has been varied from 8 TeV to 100 TeV to encompass the future collider capabilities. Out of all the studied processes, the triple scattering process $W^+W^-W^+$ has been chosen as the signal process based on the dominant cross-section. The background channels ZZZ, ZZZZ, $W^-ZZ$, $W^+ZZ$, $W^+W^-Z$, $W^+W^-ZZ$, $W^+W^-W^+W^-$, having comparatively lower cross-sections, have been selected from possible scattering mechanisms to investigate the effect of higher luminosity on the low production cross-section processes. We have investigated the different decay modes. For both lepton and hadron-specific decays of W and Z, the cumulative efficiencies for each signal and background process have been computed. In this study, we have successfully demonstrated an effective methodology for background suppression by systematically optimizing the signal-to-background ratio. The results indicate that, despite lower cross-sections for higher-order scattering, the distinct kinematic features enable effective signal isolation at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and the Higgs Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs sector of the standard model of particle physics plays a central role in the generation of all the masses of elementary particles known so far. Here we give a pedagogical introduction to all the elements leading ot the Higgs mechanism and the Higgs boson, starting with the spontaneous symmetry breaking of global symmetries and the Goldstone theorem. We then consider the case of gauge symmetries, i.e. the Higgs mechanism, and its application to the electroweak sector of the standard model. We close with a reflection on the possible open questions that the very introduction of the Higgs sector in the standard model posses.</description>

      <title>The next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to $e^+e^-\to \eta_c/\chi_{cJ}+\gamma$ at B factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the processes $e^+e^-\to \eta_c+\gamma$ and $e^+e^-\to \chi_{cJ}+\gamma$ at B factories within the NRQCD factorization framework, computing the corresponding helicity amplitudes through $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$. The short-distance coefficients are obtained as series expansions in $r=\frac{4m_c^2}{s}$ around $r=0, 1/3, 2/3, 1$, using the method of differential equations. By combining the expansions from all four points, we construct composite asymptotic expressions that reproduce the exact results accurately over the full range $0 \leq r\leq 1$, with relative errors below $0.1\%$ over most of the domain and remaining under $1\%$ elsewhere. Analytic expressions for the leading and next-to-leading logarithmic terms are extracted in the limit $r\to 0$. Using these results, we compute the unpolarized cross sections and observe that the perturbative corrections are small for $\chi_{c0}+\gamma$, moderate for $\chi_{c1}+\gamma$, and substantial for $\eta_c+\gamma$ and $\chi_{c2}+\gamma$. Theoretical prediction for $\chi_{c1}+\gamma$ is consistent with the {\tt Belle} measurement within $2\sigma$, showing good agreement between theory and experiment. We also predict the angular distribution parameters $\alpha^H_\theta$, which are insensitive to NRQCD matrix elements and exhibit small theoretical uncertainties. These parameters further display good stability across different perturbative orders. With the high luminosity anticipated at {\tt Belle 2}, future experimental measurements will thus provide a clear test of NRQCD factorization.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport Event Representation for Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce optimal transport (OT) as a physics-based intermediate event representation for weakly supervised anomaly detection. With only $0.5\%$ injection of resonant signals in the LHC Olympics benchmark datasets, the OT-augmented feature set achieves nearly twice the significance improvement of standard high-level observables, while end-to-end deep learning on low-level four-momenta struggles in the low-signal regime. The gains persist across signal types and classifiers, underscoring the value of structured representations in machine learning for anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Pion physics with dressed quark-gluon vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a theoretical framework was set up in [1], which allows for the symmetry-preserving inclusion of full quark-gluon vertices in the description of the meson dynamics. In the present work, we develop a special truncation within this approach, which leads to a tractable set of functional equations that satisfy the fundamental chiral Ward-Takahashi identities. Specifically, the truncation allows us to simplify considerably the quark-gluon Schwinger-Dyson equation, without significant loss of quantitative accuracy. Importantly, this implies a substantial reduction of complexity of the renormalized Bethe-Salpeter equation: it is composed by a pair of one-loop diagrams that contain the full quark-gluon vertex, and a single two-loop diagram that is instrumental for the masslessness of the pion in the chiral limit. A detailed numerical analysis reveals that the incorporation of the aforementioned two-loop diagram is instrumental for the corresponding eigenvalue to reach unity. The key relation between the quark mass function and the pion wave function is shown to be satisfied to within the numerical precision of the loop integrals, which is at the level of about one percent or better. The field-theoretic ingredients required for the extension of this analysis beyond the chiral limit are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Towards a Fully Automated Differential $\text{NNLO}_\text{EW}$ Generator for Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future proposed lepton collider experiments will reach unprecedented levels of accuracy. To ensure the success of these experiments, and to fully exploit their wealth of data, the precision of theory calculations must reach comparable or even better levels. One bottleneck in achieving this precision target lies in the systematic, process-independent inclusion of higher-order corrections at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order in the electroweak coupling $\text{NNLO}_\text{EW}$ while ensuring the correct matching with modern all-orders resummation techniques. Here, we present a solution to this problem, based on the Yennie-Frautschi-Suura theorem, which employs a local infrared (IR) subtraction to remove divergences and its matching to an all-order resummation of the soft and soft-collinear logarithms.</description>

      <title>Isolating chirality-breaking SMEFT operators with Drell-Yan angular analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive strategy to isolate the effect of a class of chirality-breaking interactions in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) by exploiting Drell-Yan angular analysis and the violation of the Lam-Tung relation. Unlike most SMEFT interpretation of Drell-Yan measurements, dominated by growing-with-energy effects generated by the interference of SMEFT-induced and SM amplitudes, this method isolates operators that contribute only quadratically in the Wilson coefficients, allowing for an independent probe of non-interfering operators. Denoting with $v$ the electroweak vev, with $\sqrt{s}$ the center-of-mass energy, and with $\Lambda$ the scale of new physics, the non-interfering contributions to the amplitude generated by the chirality-breaking operators can be proportional to $v\sqrt{s}/\Lambda^{2}$ or $s/\Lambda^{2}$. We argue that these two classes can be further distinguished by analyzing the angular observables of the lepton pair in the transverse momentum and in the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pair. We therefore present an analysis of the lepton-pair angular observables in both these distributions. Based on a precise estimate of the Standard Model contribution to the relevant observables for the $pp\to l^{+}l^{-}+X$ process up to $O(\alpha_{S}^{2})$, we present realistic projections for the sensitivity of the LHC with $300$ fb$^{-1}$ and for the HL-LHC with $3$ ab$^{-1}$ to chirality-breaking interactions, demonstrating that angular observables provide an independent and clean handle on SMEFT effects, especially in regions where the Standard Model contribution is naturally suppressed thanks to the Lam-Tung relation. This analysis becomes crucial to go beyond single parameter global fits, since it helps breaking degeneracies with chirality preserving operators and to disentangle overlapping directions in the EFT parameter space.</description>

      <title>L\'evy sources in UrQMD in Ar+Sc collisions at SPS energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, progress in femtoscopy has been driven by the interplay between experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. Measurements provide data for the theory to understand it, while theoretical predictions guide new measurements. In the recent decade, several experiments have confirmed that the two-particle pion emitting source is well described by L\'evy alpha-stable distributions. To enable theoretical interpretation, phenomenological simulations have been done at RHIC and LHC energies, using various available heavy-ion collision models. In this paper, we investigate three-dimensional two-pion pair source distributions from $^{40}$Ar+$^{45}$Sc central collisions at SPS energies, generated with the Ultra-Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics Monte-Carlo event generator. We fit the pair source with L\'evy-stable distributions, and discuss the extracted L\'evy parameters describing the spatial scale, shape and strength of the source.</description>

Abstract: While Transformer-based and standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be the best performers in classifying different types of jets, they require substantial computational power. We explore the scope of using a lightweight and scalable version of the EfficientNet architecture, along with global features of the jet. The end product is computationally inexpensive but is capable of competitive performance. We showcase the efficacy of our network for tagging top-quark jets in a sea of other light-quark and gluon jets.</description>

      <title>Exploring asymmetries in three-body cLFV lepton decays: probing CP violation in HNL extensions of the SM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Standard Model extensions via Majorana sterile fermions, the presence of additional CP violating phases (Dirac and Majorana) has been shown to be at source of important effects in charged lepton flavour violating (cLFV) transitions and decays. Here we will consider further angular observables that can be studied for polarised $\tau$ and $\mu$ cLFV decays. These include, among others, parity asymmetries and time-reversal asymmetries for generic cLFV 3-body decays, $\ell_\alpha^+ \to \ell_\beta^+ \ell_\gamma^+ \ell_\delta^-$. We address relevant correlations between the different classes of observables, and show that one can have sizeable asymmetries, which can be used to further probe this interesting class of SM extensions. Our study leads to the prediction of particular patterns of angular observables, which would allow to potentially falsify the model, should a cLFV signal be observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study, for the first time, the evolution of a scalar cloud bound to an evaporating black hole. Our simulations of the associated Schr\"odinger-Poisson system for non-relativistic and spherically symmetric clouds reveal that a scalar cloud may (partially) survive as a self-gravitating boson star if the black hole evaporates adiabatically until its mass becomes less than one half of the cloud's mass. This yields a novel mechanism for boson star formation and shows that, as previously conjectured, bosonic dark matter production by light primordial black holes may result in micro-boson stars with very large occupation numbers, greatly enhancing their potential detectability even for very weakly interacting dark matter particles.</description>

      <title>The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Dark Matter Speed Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct detection experiments require information about the local dark matter speed distribution to produce constraints on dark matter candidates, or infer their properties in the event of a discovery. In this paper, we analyze how the uncertainty in the dark matter speed distribution near the Sun is affected by baryonic feedback, halo-to-halo variance, and halo mass. To do so, we harness the statistical power of the new DREAMS Cold Dark Matter simulation suite, which is comprised of 1024 zoom-in Milky Way-mass halos with varied initial conditions as well as cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Applying a normalizing flows emulator to these simulations, we find that the uncertainty in the local DM speed distribution is dominated by halo-to-halo variance and, to a lesser extent, uncertainty in host halo mass. Uncertainties in supernova and black hole feedback (from the IllustrisTNG model in this case) are negligible in comparison. Using the DREAMS suite, we present a state-of-the-art prediction for the DM speed distribution in the Milky Way. Although the Standard Halo Model is contained within the uncertainty of this prediction, individual galaxies may have distributions that differ from it. Lastly, we apply our DREAMS results to the XENON1T experiment and demonstrate that the astrophysical uncertainties are comparable to the experimental ones, solidifying previous results in the literature obtained with a smaller sample of simulated Milky Way-mass halos.</description>

      <title>Inflation with a Growing Fifth Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation generally assumes a field with nonzero potential that leads to inflationary expansion happening at arbitrarily early times. We demonstrate potentially observable consequences of inflation with a finite initial time in a model in five-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space, with both a UV and an IR brane present during inflation. Considering an inflaton with an approximately flat potential localized on the UV brane, we derive the resulting brane motion in the bulk and the 4D effective action describing the dynamics. A concrete model allows us to evaluate possible consequences of a starting point of inflation. The background evolution is driven by the fast roll of the radion at early times and the slow roll of the inflaton at late times. We find that the action has the form of a two-field hyperbolic inflation model, the two fields being the radion and the inflaton, both of which have a time-dependent background solution. This setup is holographically dual to an inflaton coupled to a strongly coupled confined sector in which the confinement scale is larger than the Hubble scale, and a confinement scale whose ratio to the 4D Planck scale evolves cosmologically. Focusing on the period when the equation of state becomes that of inflation, we find that the presence of the IR brane leads to deviations from the approximate de Sitter background in addition to those from the slow-roll parameters of the inflaton potential. We quantify the effect of the presence of the IR brane on the two point function of the adiabatic scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations. The dominant deviations occur at large scales: the adiabatic power spectrum has a blue tilt, while the tensor power spectrum shows oscillatory features. We present numerical fits to the shape of the adiabatic power spectrum, and discuss the implications for cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Inflation with a Spectator Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How is the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in single-field models of inflation impacted by the presence of additional scalar fields? We consider the effect of a spectator field - a free scalar field with sub-Hubble mass, no direct coupling to the inflaton, and which makes a subdominant contribution to the total energy density - in the context of single-field models of inflation featuring a transient phase of ultra-slow roll (USR) evolution. Despite the modest title, a spectator field can have a dramatic impact: the slow-roll evolution of the spectator prevents the combined inflaton-and-spectator system from entering into USR, which naively might be expected to preclude the production of PBHs. However, we demonstrate that the growth of perturbations is maintained or enhanced by the spectator, through the rich interplay of curvature and isocurvature perturbations. We show in a model-independent way that the single-field phase of ultra-slow-roll is replaced by two turns in field space encompassing a phase of tachyonic instability for the isocurvature perturbations and a transfer of power from isocurvature to curvature modes. Furthermore, we highlight a degeneracy between the fine-tuning of the feature in the inflaton potential and the parameters of the spectator, leading to an overall resilience of model predictions to parameter variations. This makes it easier for the underlying PBH model to accommodate both high-precision CMB constraints and production of PBHs in the asteroid-mass range.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 3. Constraints on Inflation from Galaxy Power Spectra &amp; Bispectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of cosmic inflation generically predict a weak but potentially detectable amount of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), which can be used to obtain insights into the degrees of freedom during inflation and their interactions. The simplest types of PNG are the local and non-local (equilateral and orthogonal) shapes of the primordial three-point correlators, which are predicted by models with multiple light fields and derivative interactions in single-field inflation, respectively. In this paper we place constraints on local, equilateral, and orthogonal non-Gaussianities using the power spectrum and bispectrum extracted from first public release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis makes use of higher-order clustering information through a consistent effective field theory (EFT) model for both the power spectrum and bispectrum at one-loop order. Using robust scale cuts where the EFT description is valid, we find the following constraints on PNG amplitudes: $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}=-0.1\pm 7.4$, $f^{\rm equil}_{\rm NL}=719\pm 390$, $f^{\rm orth}_{\rm NL}=-200\pm 100$ (at $68\%$ CL). Non-local PNG constraints can be further improved by combining high-redshift DESI with legacy BOSS data and using simulation-based priors on bias parameters, yielding the strongest large-scale structure constraints to date $f^{\rm equil}_{\rm NL}=200\pm 230$, $f^{\rm orth}_{\rm NL}=-24\pm 86$. Our constraint on $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}$ is competitive with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) limit; the combination gives $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}=-0.0\pm 4.1$, $18\%$ stronger than the CMB only result, which represents the strongest bound on multi-field inflation yet obtained.</description>

      <title>Exploring the QCD phase diagram through correlations and fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram is a central goal of relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. This review focuses on the role of fluctuations and correlations as sensitive probes of the phase structure. We discuss theoretical advancements and experimental methodologies employed to map the QCD phase diagram, highlighting constraints derived from both lattice QCD calculations and existing experimental data. Key observables such as cumulants and factorial cumulants of conserved charges (e.g., net-proton, net-charge) are explored as promising signatures of phase transitions and the QCD critical point. We discuss how these quantities are measured experimentally and compared with theoretical predictions, addressing challenges and best practices for meaningful comparisons. Special attention is given to predictions and current experimental results at high baryon density, including recent findings from the STAR collaboration at RHIC. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions for fluctuation and correlation studies at lower collision energies, relevant for future measurements, for example by the CBM experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working in an arbitrary gauge, we derive the source term for scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW) valid during a general reheating epoch. Specifically, the dominant energy component is allowed to transition smoothly from an inflaton field to a radiation fluid, possibly via a period of matter domination. Gauge invariance is verified up to second order.</description>

      <title>A Quarkyonic Quark-Meson Coupling Model for Nuclear and Neutron Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unite the dual quarkyonic model with the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model to construct a novel nuclear model based on the quark degrees of freedom, which can cover a wide range of nuclear density from low density to the crossover region. In the model, the relativistic, gaussian quark wavefunction is used to describe the nucleon structure. We first evaluate the energy density, chemical potential, pressure and sound velocity within the ideal Fermi gas picture. In this case, those physical quantities are discontinuous or divergent at the quark saturation density, where quarkyonic phase emerges. To remove such singular behavior, we next introduce an infrared regulator, and combine the dual quarkyonic model and the QMC model to include the nuclear interaction -- we call it the quarkyonic quark-meson coupling (QQMC) model. We then find that the quark saturation density depends strongly on the nucleon size. For example, when $r_p = 0.6\, (0.8)$ fm, where $r_p$ is the root-mean-square radius of proton, the quark saturation density is about $3.6\,(1.5) \times \rho_0$ in symmetric nuclear matter, where $\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. It is notable that the nuclear interaction is quite important to consider physical quantities quantitatively. In fact, the QQMC model can produce the sound velocity which is consistent with that inferred from the observed data of several neutron stars. Furthermore, pressure in symmetric or pure neutron matter deduced from the experiments of heavy-ion collisions at high energy can be explained by the QQMC model as well. We discuss in detail the formulation for the QQMC model and the physical quantities calculated by the model.</description>

      <title>Constraining regular primordial black holes with isocurvature gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find the constraint on the population of ultra-light regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) by using isocurvature gravitational waves (GW). If ultra-light RPBHs dominated the early Universe, the initial isocurvature perturbation is converted into curvature perturbation that induce second-order GW background upon evaporation of RPBHs. The upper limit of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, which could be inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis or Cosmic Microwave Background observations, places a constraint on the maximum energy density of GW, which in turn can be used to constrain the RPBH population. As RPBHs have different lifetime from their singular counterparts, the constraint must be modified accordingly. While the formalism that we provide is generic, we work out explicitly the case of Simpson-Visser metric for demonstration. The RPBHs associated with this metric have lower Hawking temperature and smaller horizon size, leading to a longer lifetime than the singular Schwarzschild black holes. This implies a stronger constraint on RPBH population as they dominate the Universe for a longer period of time and generate stronger GW.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and Transport properties of hot asymmetric nuclear matter within a chiral SU(3) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and transport properties in hot nuclear matter accounting for the medium modifications of the nucleons within a chiral SU(3) model including effects from isospin asymmetry. Using the relaxation time approximation, the transport coefficients of the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity are studied. The shear viscosity, $\eta$, calculated within the chiral SU(3) model is observed to be smaller than the values calculated for free nucleon gas, whereas the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ is appreciably larger as compared to the free nucleon gas. The shear viscosity coefficient to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, drops with increasing baryon density which becomes more pronounced at higher temperatures in the chiral SU(3) model as compared to the case of a free nucleon gas. The effect due to isospin asymmetry on the coefficient of shear viscosity turns out to be marginal. However, in the chiral SU(3) model, in presence of isospin asymmetry, the coefficient of thermal conductivity has an appreciably higher value as compared to the one for symmetric nuclear matter. The present study of the thermodynamic as well as transport properties in hot nuclear matter is of relevance for relativistic heavy-ion collisions with different initial isospin asymmetry, in particular for the compressed baryonic matter (CBM) experiment at the FAIR facility at GSI.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Genesis Cosmology from the Smeared Null Energy Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) is essential for constructing nonsingular cosmological scenarios, such as Genesis cosmology, which avoids the initial singularity by initiating cosmic evolution from an asymptotically Minkowski state. To address theoretical concerns regarding the accumulation of negative energy, the smeared null energy condition (SNEC) has been proposed as a quantum-motivated, semi-local bound on NEC violation. In this work, we examine the implications of the SNEC conjecture for Genesis models, typically constructed within generalized Galileon theories. Our results demonstrate that SNEC imposes nontrivial restrictions on the viability of Genesis models, highlighting the SNEC conjecture as a powerful tool for constraining nonsingular cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Amortized Inference of Multi-Modal Posteriors using Likelihood-Weighted Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for amortized posterior estimation using Normalizing Flows trained with likelihood-weighted importance sampling. This approach allows for the efficient inference of theoretical parameters in high-dimensional inverse problems without the need for posterior training samples. We implement the method on multi-modal benchmark tasks in 2D and 3D to check for the efficacy. A critical observation of our study is the impact of the topology of the base distributions on the modelled posteriors. We find that standard unimodal base distributions fail to capture disconnected support, resulting in spurious probability bridges between modes. We demonstrate that initializing the flow with a Gaussian Mixture Model that matches the cardinality of the target modes significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, as measured by some distance and divergence metrics.</description>

      <title>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau, focusing on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild Black Hole Turbulence: Scalar Probe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole can redistribute energy among scalar modes and seed turbulent like cascades. We make use of the van der Pol-Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging method and derive coupled mode equations that describe near-resonant interactions between neighbouring multipoles. We compare two routes to instability, namely the difference-frequency mixing between adjacent modes and the diagonal (Mathieu) self-modulation channel. We show that, at high multipole number (eikonal limit), the difference-frequency route dominates and drives a one-way cascade from higher to lower frequencies. We chart the corresponding instability regions ("tongues") and quantify their detuning dependence. The framework provides a simple, quantitative mechanism for energy transfer in black hole ringdowns and clarifies when and how turbulent signatures can arise within linear probes on a weakly perturbed background.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Hongmeng 21cm experiment on scattering dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering between dark matter and baryon can cool intergalactic medium temperature and deepen the 21cm signal. Such interactions have been proposed to explain the unusually deep 21cm absorption signal reported by EDGES in 2018. This paper explores the potential to detect dark matter - baryon scattering with the Hongmeng project, an upcoming lunar orbiting satellite experiment dedicated to measuring global 21cm signal between redshifts $11-46$. We self-consistently forward-model the simulated sky temperature data, jointly varying both the astrophysical and foreground models. We show that even with a very conservative observational strategy in which the experiment only takes data when both the Earth and the Sun are shielded by the Moon, Hongmeng can tighten the current constraints on dark matter - baryon scattering cross-section $\sigma_0$ by a factor of 21 after the full mission which lasts for five years. The prospective upper limit on $\sigma_0$ can reach $4 \times 10^{-43} {\rm cm^2}$ for dark matter masses between 0.1 MeV and 0.4 GeV. Even after only one month of observation, a factor of 3 improvement relative to current $\sigma_0$ limits can be expected.</description>

Abstract: Exclusive semi-leptonic decay stands as a pivotal channel in the exploration of heavy flavor physics, primarily due to its straightforward experimental measurability. In this work, we delve into the hadron matrix element and hadron tensor within the context of exclusive semi-leptonic decays. We challenge the conventional exclusive decay theory by introducing a fresh perspective, revealing that while the baryon sector is consistent, the meson sector warrants revision. Employing a novel form factor derived from the Taylor series expansion in our differential width calculations, we demonstrate that fitting experimental data necessitates a more streamlined and minimal parameter set compared to the standard Light Cone Sun Rul(LCSR) form factors. Furthermore, we propose that our hypothesis can be empirically validated or refuted through the precise measurement of the double differential decay width, offering a tangible path forward for experimental validation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-detection of dark matter may be attributed to the dark matter residing in a darker hidden sector. We explore the possibility that a hidden sector produced through the freeze-in mechanism, can further generate an even more hidden sector via an additional freeze-in process. Such a two-step freeze-in process produces dark matter coupled weaker-than-ultraweakly to the standard model particles, and is thus referred to as the "darker matter". To illustrate the two-step freeze-in process, we study a model featuring two $U(1)$ hidden sectors. The first $U(1)$ sector is directly coupled to the standard model with feeble interactions, while the second $U(1)$ sector is directly coupled to the first $U(1)$ sector and thus only indirectly to the standard model, rendering it darker. Remarkably, darker matter candidates residing in the second darker $U(1)$ sector, generated from the two-step freeze-in process, can account for almost the entire observed dark matter relic density. The darker matter, interacted with standard model particles through ultraweak couplings, can exhibit velocity-dependent self-interacting cross-sections, which potentially provides an explanation for addressing problems associated with cosmic small-scale structures. Additionally, the dark photon darker matter residing in the darker hidden sector can be responsible for the galactic 511 keV photon signal, consistent with various dark matter density profiles.</description>

      <title>Self Consistent Thermal Resummation: A Case Study of the Phase Transition in 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate description of the scalar potential at finite temperature is crucial for studying cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPT) in the early Universe. At finite temperatures, a precise treatment of thermal resummations is essential, as bosonic fields encounter significant infrared issues that can compromise standard perturbative approaches. The Partial Dressing (or the tadpole resummation) method provides a self consistent resummation of higher order corrections, allowing the computation of thermal masses and the effective potential including the proper Boltzmann suppression factors and without relying on any high-temperature approximation. We systematically compare the Partial dressing resummation scheme results with the Parwani and Arnold Espinosa (AE) ones to investigate the thermal phase transition dynamics in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). Our findings reveal that different resummation prescriptions can significantly alter the nature of the phase transition within the same region of parameter space, confirming the differences that have already been noticed between the Parwani and AE schemes. Notably, the more refined resummation prescription, the Partial Dressing scheme, does not support symmetry non-restoration in 2HDM at high temperatures observed using the AE prescription. Furthermore, we quantify the uncertainties in the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from an FOPT due to variations in resummation methods, illustrating their role in shaping theoretical predictions for upcoming GW experiments. Finally, we discuss the capability of the High-Luminosity LHC and proposed GW experiments to probe the FOEWPT-favored region of the parameter space.</description>

Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics effectively explains most observed phenomena, though some anomalies, especially in the neutrino sector, suggest the need for extensions. In this Letter, we perform the first global fit of elastic neutrino-nucleus and neutrino-electron scattering data to further test the SM within a consistent framework. Our results on the neutrino charge radius, the only nonzero electromagnetic property of neutrinos in the SM, show no significant deviation, indicating no large beyond the SM flavor-dependent effects for electron and muon neutrinos. By incorporating solar neutrino data from dark matter direct detection experiments, we also place the most stringent constraints on the tau neutrino charge radius obtained from neutrino scattering experiments. Additionally, we determine updated constraints on the vector and axial-vector neutrino-electron neutral current couplings, adjusting for flavor-dependent effects and for the different experimental momentum transfers. The global analysis reveals two allowed solutions: one close to the SM prediction, and a degenerate solution that is favored. We show that future dark matter detectors could achieve sufficient precision to resolve the degeneracy. As we move toward the precision era, this Letter demonstrates the crucial need to properly account for flavor- and momentum-dependent effects to avoid misinterpretations of the data.</description>

Abstract: In the audible axion mechanism, axion-like particles source primordial gravitational waves via their coupling to a dark Abelian gauge field. The original setup, however, relies on a large axion decay constant and coupling to produce sizable signals. In this article, we show that delaying the onset of axion oscillations opens up the testable parameter space and reduces the required coupling to $\alpha \gtrsim 1$. Furthermore, we investigate the emission of gravitational waves via the axion coupling to the Standard Model photon in the presence of Schwinger pair production, generating a strong signal in the $\mu$Hz or ultra-high frequency range. Cosmological constraints and gravitational wave projections are provided for both scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion-like particle (ALP) is a well-motivated extension of the Standard Model. In this work, we revisit the sensitivity of forward accelerator experiments to light long-lived ALPs, and analyze flavor constraints. Our analysis incorporates recent measurements of the rare decays $B\to K + X$ and $K\to \pi +X$, which place stringent bounds on quark flavor violation of a light ALP. We consider the complete list of hadronic modes in the calculation of the ALP decay rate and exclusive production channels based on recent improvements. The analysis includes the discussion of tree-level quark flavor-violating couplings in addition to a universal flavor-conserving ALP coupling to fermions and the electroweak ALP couplings. Our results demonstrate the complementarity of heavy meson decays and forward accelerator facilities in probing light ALPs. The interplay between two ALP couplings is also investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the range of validity of the semiclassical approximation of a quantum master equation designed to describe the $c\bar{c}$ dynamics in a quark gluon plasma at various temperatures, in the quantum Brownian regime. We perform a comparative study of various properties, e.g. the charmonia yield, of the Wigner density obtained with the Lindblad equation and with the associated semiclassical Fokker-Planck equation. The semiclassical description is found to reproduce with a remarkable accuracy the results obtained through the full quantum description. We show that, to a large extent, this can be attributed to the non-unitary components of the dynamics that result from the contact of the $c\bar{c}$ subsystem with the thermal bath, leading to a rapid classicalization of the subsystem.</description>

Abstract: We construct a flavour guided model that realises the distinctive Echo 12-23 Texture in the neutrino mass matrix through a non-trivial interplay of symmetries. While the model accounts for charged lepton mass hierarchy, the texture offers interesting insights specifically into neutrino mass ordering and flavour dynamics. With clear imprints on low energy observables, the framework provides a minimal yet testable path toward understanding the origin of neutrino properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a simple Higgs portal dark matter (DM) model, where the Standard Model is extended with a complex singlet scalar. The imaginary part of the scalar becomes a massive and stable pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, serving as the DM candidate, while the real part gives rise to a second (dark) Higgs boson. We focus on the freeze-in production of the DM, paying particular attention to low-reheating temperature scenarios, where the dark Higgs can be a long-lived particle (LLP). We also explore the phenomenology of this dark Higgs at the LHC and the Future Circular Collider in hadron-hadron mode, discussing its discovery prospects in regions of parameter space consistent with current DM constraints. Our results emphasize the impact of the cosmic reheating dynamics on the DM freeze-in production and their critical role in interpreting collider signatures. Furthermore, our findings suggest that LLP searches may provide insights into the fundamental dynamics of reheating.</description>

      <title>A critical appraisal of tests of locality and of entanglement versus non-entanglement at colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been argued more than 30 years ago that it is not possible to test locality at colliders, due to the inability to directly measure non-commutating observables such as spin components in current collider experiments. Recently, there has been a lot of phenomenological and experimental activity around testing locality via Bell-type experiments or entanglement versus non-entanglement in a collider environment. These results seem to evade the earlier no-go theorem by indirectly measuring spin correlations via their relation to angular correlations between momenta. We perform a careful study of the feasibility of such an approach. We scrutinize the relationship between spin and angular correlations in both quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories. Our conclusion is that it is currently not possible to perform a logically coherent set of experimental measurements at colliders that would allow one to test locality or entanglement versus non-entanglement. This reaffirms the earlier no-go theorem. We stress that the no-go theorem does not apply to measurements of observables inspired from entanglement and Quantum Information Theory to test the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>From Capture to Collapse: Revisiting Black Hole formation by Fermionic Asymmetric Dark Matter in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can be captured in neutron stars (NSs) via scatterings with the star constituents. The absence of dark matter annihilation due to its asymmetric nature leads to ADM accumulation in the NS core, potentially reaching densities sufficient to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit and trigger its gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH), eventually consuming the NS from within. Therefore, the existence and observation of old neutron stars provide a means to constrain the properties of ADM. We revisit previous constraints on the mass and scattering cross section off neutrons of fermionic ADM across a class of models. We critically examine common simplifying approximations used in the literature to derive these limits. Our analysis includes improved treatments of dark matter capture, thermalization, BH formation, accretion, and evaporation. We find that previous results can be relaxed by a few orders of magnitude once these effects are properly accounted for.</description>

      <title>Angular Coefficients from Interpretable Machine Learning with Symbolic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the use of symbolic regression to derive compact analytical expressions for angular observables relevant to electroweak boson production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Focusing on the angular coefficients that govern the decay distributions of $W$ and $Z$ bosons, we investigate whether symbolic models can well approximate these quantities, typically computed via computationally costly numerical procedures, with high fidelity and interpretability. Using the PySR package, we first validate the approach in controlled settings, namely in angular distributions in lepton-lepton collisions in QED and in leading-order Drell-Yan production at the LHC. We then apply symbolic regression to extract closed-form expressions for the angular coefficients $A_i$ as functions of transverse momentum, rapidity, and invariant mass, using next-to-leading order simulations of $pp \to \ell^+\ell^-$ events. Our results demonstrate that symbolic regression can produce accurate and generalisable expressions that match Monte Carlo predictions within uncertainties, while preserving interpretability and providing insight into the kinematic dependence of angular observables.</description>

Abstract: In this article, the electroweak transition form factors of $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_c$ and $\Xi_b\to\Xi_c$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. In phenomenological side, all possible couplings of interpolating current to hadronic states are considered. In QCD side, the perturbative part and the contributions of vacuum condensates up to dimension 8 are also included. With the estimated form factors, we study the decay widths and branching ratios of semileptonic decays $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ and $\Xi_b\to\Xi_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ ($l=e,\mu$ and $\tau$). Our results for the branching ratios of $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ are comparable with experimental data and the results from other collaborations. In addition, our prediction for the branching ratio of $\Xi_b\to\Xi_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ can provide a valuable reference for future experimental measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We posit an elegant modular $A_4$ framework for Dirac neutrinos that does not rely on the seesaw mechanism in a non SUSY setting. Our construction ensures purely Dirac neutrinos with a minimal scalar sector, naturally generating neutrino masses without requiring unnaturally tiny couplings. The model demonstrates its predictive power by simultaneously reproducing the charged lepton mass hierarchy and predicting neutrino mixing angles and mass squared differences consistent with their global best fit values. It further predicts a sum of neutrino masses consistent with the current cosmological bound, while predicting maximal Dirac CP violation. This construction establishes an alternative paradigm for the origin of lepton masses and mixing, setting it apart from conventional discrete flavour symmetry and seesaw based approaches.</description>

      <title>The (3+1)-dimensional scalar field model analysis of beam spin asymmetry in the electroproduction of a scalar meson off a scalar target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore exclusive scalar meson electroproduction off a scalar target in the (3+1)-dimensional scalar field model. This model analysis is a straightforward extension of the previous (1+1)-dimensional model analysis presented in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{105}, 096014 (2022). In contrast to the (1+1)-dimensional model, the (3+1)-dimensional model allows us to compute the beam spin asymmetry (BSA), which is proportional to the imaginary part of the product of the two Compton form factors (CFFs) that appear in the hadronic current of the present scalar meson electroproduction process. We compute both real and imaginary parts of the CFFs and note that the BSA is detectable for $-t/Q^2 \gtrsim 0.1$ although it gets quite small in the kinematic region $-t/Q^2 \ll 0.1$ where the factorization of the generalized parton distribution (GPD) is attainable. We find the analytic forms of the leading twist GPD for the DGLAP and ERBL regions in the (3+1)-dimensional scalar field model, confirming its uniqueness independent of the hadronic current component. While we verify that the GPD sum rule for the total result of summing the DGLAP and ERBL regions holds for all components of the hadronic current, we note that the respective correspondence of the DGLAP and ERBL regions to the valence and non-valence parts of the electromagnetic form factor holds only for the light-front plus component of the hadronic current but not for any other components of the hadronic current. We discuss the polynomiality of the GPD up to the second moments and remark on accessible ranges of kinematics to measure the BSA and CFFs with respect to the future experimental efforts of extracting the leading-twist GPDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, the vector, axial vector and tensor form factors of $B_c$ to $D$-wave charmonia $\psi_J$ ($J=1,2,3$) and $\eta_{c2}$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. With the estimated vector and axial vector form factors, we study the decay widths and branching ratios of semileptonic decays $B_c\to\psi_Jl\bar{\nu_l}$ and $B_c\to\eta_{c2}l\bar{\nu_l}$. Our results indicate that the semileptonic decay branching ratios of $B_c$ to $D$-wave charmonia decreases as the total angler momentum of the final state $D$-wave charmonia increases. For decay processes $B_c\to \psi_1l\bar{\nu}_l$, $B_c\to \psi_2[\eta_{c2}]l\bar{\nu}_l$ and $B_c\to \psi_3l\bar{\nu}_l$, the branching ratios can reach the order $10^{-3}$, $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-5}$, respectively, which can provide a valuable reference for future experimental measurements for $B_c$ meson by LHCb collaboration. Furthermore, these results also can provide useful information to study the properties of $B_c$ meson and $D$-wave charmonia.</description>

      <title>An anomaly-free leptophilic $U(1)'_{\ell}$ completion of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a minimal and fully anomaly-free realization of a universal leptophilic $U(1)'_{\ell}$ gauge symmetry, under which all Standard-Model leptons carry a common charge while quarks remain neutral. Gauge consistency is restored by introducing one vectorlike lepton family and singlet scalars whose vacuum expectation values both break $U(1)'_{\ell}$ and generate masses for the new gauge boson $Z_{\ell}$ and the heavy leptons.
  We derive compact anomaly-cancellation conditions, closed-form $Z_{\ell}$ couplings and decay widths, and the structure of gauge--kinetic mixing, including the trace condition $\mathrm{Tr}(YQ')=0$ that suppresses radiative mixing. The setup naturally embeds a type-I seesaw for neutrino masses and provides a stable singlet field as a minimal dark-matter candidate. Collider and precision constraints are expressed analytically over the full parameter space, covering pure leptophilic production, small-mixing hadron colliders, and the contact-interaction limit $M_{Z_{\ell}}\!\gg\!\sqrt{s}$.
  The model therefore provides a single, internally consistent benchmark that unifies gauge, scalar, Yukawa, neutrino, and dark-matter sectors, and is directly suited for global data recasts and targeted searches at future lepton and hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>The color force acting on a quark in the pion and nucleon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) of hard scattering amplitudes, the twist-3 operators describe local colored Lorentz forces acting on a quark, thereby providing a measure of the strength of the gluon fields. Its value is directly accessible from the nucleon twist-3 polarized $g_2$-parton distribution function. In the semiclassical (instanton-based) QCD vacuum models, the leading non-perturbative contribution stems from correlated instanton-anti-instanton pairs, or molecules. We analyze the magnitude of the color force on a 'struck' quark in light hadrons (pion and nucleon), in the context of the instanton liquid model (ILM). We derive explicitly the pertinent form factors associated to the color Lorenz force, and show that they are intimately related to the pertinent hadronic gravitational and transversity form factors. Using the ILM enhanced by molecules, we detail the ensuing colored force distribution in the transverse plane for luminal pions and nucleons. The results for the nucleons are in good agreement with those reported recently from a lattice collaboration.</description>

      <title>Tomography of high-twist proton structure through $ep$ elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first high-twist study of the proton form factors $F_{1,2}(Q^2)$ in $ep$ elastic scattering based on the perturbative QCD $k_T$ factorization, $Q^2$ being momentum transfer squared. It is motivated by unexpectedly large higher-power contributions from subleading-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), which are attributed to the enhancement in endpoint regions of parton momentum fractions. We highlight that the endpoint enhancement, tamed by the $k_T$ resummation effect, is crucial for accommodating the approximate scaling behavior of the $Q^4F_1(Q^2)$ data at intermediate $Q^2\sim {\cal O}(10)$ GeV$^2$. The proton LCDAs up to twist 6 are then extracted, and verified by the charge-parity asymmetries observed in hadronic heavy baryon decays. Our work provides new insights into the proton three-dimensional structure and manifests the precision requirement for reliable perturbative analyses of baryonic exclusive processes.</description>

      <title>Resonant neutrino self-interactions and the $H_0$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the previously unexplored resonant region of neutrino self-interactions. Current disagreement on late and early time observations of the Universe expansion could be solved with new physics acting before the recombination era. Nonstandard neutrino self-interactions are among the most appealing candidates to solve this issue since they could be testable in the near (or midterm) future. We use linear cosmological datasets to test neutrino self-interactions for a sample of fixed scalar mediator masses in the range $10^{-2}$ eV $\leq m_{\varphi}\leq 10^{2}$ eV. The resonant behavior produces observable effects at lower couplings than those reported in the literature for heavy and light mediators. We observe that in the best case scenario, using the Planck + BAO dataset, the tension with local measurements of $H_0$ eases from 4.9$\sigma$ (for $\Lambda$CDM) down to 2.8$\sigma$. Albeit, this is driven mainly by the addition of extra radiation, with $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\sim 0.5$. The joint dataset which includes Planck, BAO, and $H_0$ prefers a nonzero interaction from 2.3$\sigma$ to 3.9$\sigma$ significance in the range $0.5$ eV $\leq m_{\varphi}\leq 10$ eV. Although, this last result is obtained with data that are still in tension. These results add the last piece in the parameter space of neutrino self-interactions at the linear perturbation regime.</description>

      <title>Mapping Dark Matter in the Milky Way using Normalizing Flows and Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, data-driven analysis of Galactic dynamics, using unsupervised machine learning -- in the form of density estimation with normalizing flows -- to learn the underlying phase space distribution of 6 million nearby stars from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Solving the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation, we calculate -- for the first time ever -- a model-free, unbinned estimate of the local acceleration and mass density fields within a 3 kpc sphere around the Sun. As our approach makes no assumptions about symmetries, we can test for signs of disequilibrium in our results. We find our results are consistent with equilibrium at the 10% level, limited by the current precision of the normalizing flows. After subtracting the known contribution of stars and gas from the calculated mass density, we find clear evidence for dark matter throughout the analyzed volume. Assuming spherical symmetry and averaging mass density measurements, we find a local dark matter density of $0.47\pm 0.05$ GeV/cm$^3$. We compute the dark matter density at four radii in the stellar halo and fit to a generalized NFW profile. Although the uncertainties are large, we find a profile broadly consistent with recent analyses.</description>

      <title>Investigating the competition between the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in light of the multimessenger observations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the parity doublet model for hadronic matter and study the possible presence of quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Considering the uncertainties of the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint, we aim to explore the competition between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition systematically, regulated by the vacuum pressure $-B$ in the NJL model. Employing a Maxwell construction, a sharp first-order deconfinement phase transition is implemented combining the parity doublet model for the hadronic phase and the NJL model for the high-energy quark phase. The position of the chiral phase transition is obtained from the NJL model self-consistently. We find stable neutron stars with a quark core within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. The observations suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600$ MeV in the parity doublet model and a larger split between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions while assuming the first-order deconfinement phase transition. The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Precise study of triply charmed baryons $\Omega_{ccc}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the most precise results for the ground state mass of the triply-charmed spin-$3/2$ baryon using lattice quantum chromodynamics. The calculations are performed on six $N_f=2+1+1$ Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) lattice ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration. Two different lattice setups are employed: in the first one, a fully dynamical calculation with HISQ action is performed, while in the second calculation, an overlap action is utilized for the valence charm quark dynamics. Following the continuum extrapolation of our results, obtained at five different lattice spacings, two different volumes, and two different actions, our prediction for the mass of the lowest triply charmed spin-3/2 baryon, $\Omega_{ccc} (3/2^{+})$, is $4793 (5) \left(^{+11}_{-8}\right)$ MeV. This is the most precise determination to date, fully addressing the systematic uncertainties. We also predict the $\Omega_{ccc} (3/2^{-})$ mass to be $5094 (12) \left(^{+19}_{-17}\right)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Sweeping the Dust Away - Correcting the Phase Space Density of the Milky Way with Unsupervised Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation relates the equilibrium phase space distribution of stars in the Milky Way to the Galaxy's gravitational potential. However, observations of stellar populations are biased by extinction from foreground dust, which complicates measurements of the potential in the disk and towards the Galactic center. Using the kinematics of Red Clump and Red Branch stars in Gaia DR3, we use machine learning to simultaneously estimate both the unbiased stellar phase space density and the gravitational potential. The unbiased phase space density is obtained through a learned "dust efficiency factor" -- an observational selection function that accounts for dust extinction. The potential and the dust efficiency are parameterized by fully connected neural networks and are completely data driven. We validate the dust efficiency using a recent three-dimensional dust map in this work, and examine the potential in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Calculations of the Carbon and Oxygen Isotopes: Energies, Correlations, and Superfluid Pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform \textit{ab initio} nuclear lattice calculations of the neutron-rich carbon and oxygen isotopes using high-fidelity chiral interactions. We find good agreement with the observed binding energies and compute correlations associated with each two-nucleon interaction channel. For the isospin $T=1$ channels, we show that the dependence on $T_z$ provides a measure of the correlations among the extra neutrons in the neutron-rich nuclei. For the spin-singlet S-wave channel, we observe that any paired neutron interacts with the nuclear core as well as its neutron pair partner, while any unpaired neutron interacts primarily with only the nuclear core. For the other partial waves, the correlations among the extra neutrons grow more slowly and smoothly with the number of neutrons. These general patterns are observed in both the carbon and oxygen isotopes and may be universal features that appear in many neutron-rich nuclei.</description>

      <title>Progenitor Dependence of Neutrino-driven Supernova Explosions with the Aid of Heavy Axion-like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform spherically symmetric simulations of core-collapse supernovae with the aid of heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) which interact with photons and redistribute energy within supernova matter. We explore a wide ALP parameter space that includes MeV-scale ALP mass $m_{\,a}$ and the ALP-photon coupling constant $g_{\,a \gamma} \sim 10^{\,-10} \, \rm{GeV}^{\,-1}$ , employing three progenitor models with zero-age main-sequence mass of $11.2\,M_\odot$, $20.0\,M_\odot$, and $25.0\,M_\odot$. We find a general trend that, given $m_{\,a}\lesssim 300\,$MeV, heavier ALPs are favorable for the shock wave to be successfully revived, aiding the onset of the neutrino-driven explosion. However, if ALPs are heavier than $\sim 400\,$MeV, the explosion is failed or weaker than that for the models with smaller $m_{\,a}$, because of an insufficient temperature inside the supernova core to produce heavy ALPs. The maximum temperature in the core depends on the initial progenitor structure. Our simulations indicate that the high-temperature environment in the collapsing core of massive progenitors leads to a significant impact of ALPs on the explodability.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Coma Cluster Structure: From the Core to the Hubble Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Coma cluster, embedded in a cosmic filament, is a complex and dynamically active structure in the local Universe. Applying a density-based member selection (\texttt{dbscan}) to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify its virialised core and zero-velocity boundary. Cross-correlating with the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalogue enables a velocity-distance analysis, incorporating radial infall models and redshift-independent distance estimators. This reveals, for the first time, the Hubble flow surrounding Coma, a first step to investigate the entanglement between Coma's dark matter halo and the dark energy driving the expansion of the surroundings. The distance to the Coma centre is determined as $(69.959 \pm 0.012) \, h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$. From \texttt{dbscan}, we infer a virial radius of $r_{\rm vir} = \left(1.95 \pm 0.12\right)\,h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$ and a turnaround of $r_{\rm ta} \geq 4.87~{h}^{-1}~\mbox{Mpc}$. Combining the SDSS redshifts with the CF4 distances, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = (73.10 \pm 0.92)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}/\mbox{Mpc}$, which varies between $[72, 80]$~km/s/Mpc with different calibrations for the distance moduli. Mass estimates via caustics, the virial theorem and the Hubble-flow method yield $M = [0.77, 2.0] \times 10^{15}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$, consistent with prior mass estimates. However, our mass estimates are based on fewer model assumptions in the member selection and require fewer members to attain the same precision. Our systematic approach maps the structure of Coma into the local Hubble flow and shows the degeneracies between dynamical parameters such as the Hubble constant, the virial radius, and the total mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates resonant neutrino self-interactions in cosmology by employing, for the first time, the effective field theory of large-scale structure to model their impact on the matter distribution up to mildly nonlinear scales. We explore a broad range of mediator masses in two main analyses: one combining BOSS Full Shape (FS) galaxy clustering with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and another combining FS with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Our results place the strongest cosmological constraints to date on the resonant self interactions when using FS+Planck data, reaching up to $g_\nu&lt; 10.8 \times 10^{-14}$ at $95\%$ confidence for the 1 eV mediator. Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator independently of CMB data, yielding $g_\nu &lt; 7.33 \times 10^{-12}$ at $95\%$ confidence. Our results suggest that resonant neutrino self-interactions are unlikely to resolve existing cosmological tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Galaxy Bispectrum: Consistent Theory, Efficient Analysis with COBRA, and Implications for Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and accurate pipeline for the analysis of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum multipoles at one-loop order in effective field theory (EFT). We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\omega_\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\omega_{\text{cdm}}$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$ shrinking by 41\%, 25\%, and 19\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.</description>

      <title>PSR J0614-3329: A NICER case for Strange Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of neutron star masses and radii by the NICER mission impose important constraints on the nuclear equation of state. The most recent NICER measurement of PSR J0614-3329 reported an equatorial radius of $R_{eq} = 10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}$ km for a mass of $M = 1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} M_{\odot}$. Considering all the NICER measurements to date, we find substantial evidence using Bayesian hypothesis ranking for strange quark stars over physically motivated models of neutron stars compatible with this low radius. This provides a strong case for quark matter in neutron stars and also for the possible existence of strange quark stars, a consequence of the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis, suggesting that they could be considered among the population of compact stars during analyses of astrophysical data. Using a wide sample of equations of state, we report the nucleonic equations of state that best fit current observations and rule out one model of strange quark matter.</description>

      <title>Testing new-physics scenarios with the combined LHAASO and Carpet-3 fluence spectrum of GRB 221009A: axion-like particles and Lorentz-invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, very high-energy photons were detected: &gt;10 TeV with LHAASO and &gt;100 TeV with Carpet-3. Such energetic photons are expected to be absorbed via electron-positron pair production on their way to the Earth. Their observation might be explained by new physics, including Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon mixing with axion-like particles (ALPs). Here, we construct a joint fluence spectrum by combining flux measurements from both experiments, and fit it under these hypotheses. While LIV can account for the Carpet-3 observation, it provides only a modest improvement over standard physics in the overall fit and requires parameters excluded by other constraints. ALP mixing improves the description of both LHAASO and Carpet-3 data, yielding a substantial enhancement in fit quality for a specific region of the ALP parameter space.</description>

      <title>A family of three maximally symmetric boost-invariant flows in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I discuss the constructions of boost-invariant dissipative conformal hydrodynamic flows by elaborating on the geometric procedure by Gubser and Yarom, which starts from a static, maximally symmetric flow on dS$_3\times\mathbb{R}$. Three foliations of dS$_3$ preserve three-dimensional non-Abelian isometry groups, namely, the flat ISO(2)-invariant, the spherical (closed) SO(3)-invariant, and the hyperbolic (open) SO(2,1)-invariant slicings. I show that the fluids that preserve these symmetries, after they have been Weyl transformed to flat spacetime, give rise to three physically distinct and boost-invariant solutions of the relativistic dissipative Navier-Stokes equations: the well-known and widely studied Bjorken and Gubser flows, and a seemingly thus far unexplored solution that arises from the hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3$. The new solution combines the radial expansion characteristic of the Gubser flow with the late-proper-time applicability of Bjorken's solution, and features a finite, radially bounded droplet whose expanding edge resembles a free-streaming shockwave.</description>

      <title>Natural inflation in Palatini $F(R)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $F(R)$ Palatini gravity provides a robust framework for constructing viable inflationary potentials. In this study, we examine natural inflation and show that its consistency with observational data can be restored when the model is embedded within $F(R)$ Palatini gravity, specifically for $F(R) = R + \alpha R^n$ with $7/4 \lesssim n \leq 2$. For completeness, we also demonstrate that models with $n &gt; 2$ do not yield comparable improvements, achieving partial agreement with the data only in the limit $n \rightarrow 2$.</description>
