      <title>Double hysteresis loop in synchronization transitions of multiplex networks: the role of frequency arrangements and frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamics of two-layer multiplex networks, focusing on how frequency distributions among mirror nodes influence phase transitions and synchronization across layers. We present a Regular frequency assignment model for duplex networks, where the layers are fully connected and share identical sets of natural frequencies. By adjusting the sizes of sections where nodes exhibit positive, zero, or negative frequency differences relative to their mirrored equivalents in another layer, we can effectively control the average frequency discrepancy between the layers. We compared the dynamics of this structured model to those with randomly distributed frequencies, keeping a constant average frequency difference between the layers and introducing a phase lag in the interlayer interaction terms. This comparison highlighted distinct behaviors, including double hysteresis loops in the synchronization phase transition and standing waves for intralayer coupling at the locations of the hysteresis loops, where the waves are composed of different interacting frequencies.</description>

      <title>Non-local transitions and ground state switching in the self-organization of vascular networks</title>

Abstract: The model by Hu and Cai [Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 111(13) (2013)] describes the self-organization of vascular networks for transport of fluids from source to sinks. Diameters, and thereby conductances, of vessel segments evolve so as to minimize a cost functional E. The cost is the trade-off between the power required for pumping the fluid and the energy consumption for vessel maintenance. The model has been used to show emergence of cyclic structures in the presence of locally fluctuating demand, i.e. non-constant net flow at sink nodes. Under rapid and sufficiently large fluctuations, the dynamics exhibits bistability of tree-like and cyclic network structures. We compare these solutions in terms of the cost functional E. Close to the saddle-node bifurcation giving rise to the cyclic solutions, we find a parameter regime where the tree-like solution rather than the cyclic solution is cost-optimal. Thus we discover an additional, non-local transition where tree-like and cyclic solutions exchange their roles as minimum-cost (or ground) states. The findings hold both in a small system of one source and a few sinks and in an empirical vascular network with hundreds of sinks. In the small system, we further analyze the case of slower fluctuations, i.e., on the same time scale as network adaptation. We find that the noisy dynamics settles around the cyclic structures even when these structures are not cost-optimal.</description>

      <title>Studying power-grid synchronization with incremental refinement of model heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling power-grid systems has got a major importance in present days as transformation to renewable energy sources requires the complete re-design of energy transmission. Renewable energy sources can be located quite far from their consumption points because urban and industrial structures do not follow physical constraints and capabilities. Important examples are the sea coast vs inland divisions in the case of wind power. Ill-constructed high-voltage (HV) power grids can cause catastrophic damages to economies as it was demonstrated in recent history via the emergence of large blackout events. The probability distributions of such events was found to be fat-tailed, exhibiting power-law (PL) tails very often. To understand them, self-organized critical direct current (DC) models have been constructed~\cite{car2} and have been shown to describe well the PL exponents of empirical values. However, many details could not be understood as power-grids work with alternating currents (AC) in which phase differences are the primary causes of the power-flows.</description>
