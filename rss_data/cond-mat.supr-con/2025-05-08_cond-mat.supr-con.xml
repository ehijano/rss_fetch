      <title>Direct evidence of light-induced phase-fluctuations in cuprates via time-resolved ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase fluctuations are widely accepted to play a primary role in the quench of the long-range superconducting order in cuprates. However, an experimental probe capable of unambiguously assessing their impact on the superconducting order parameter with momentum and time resolutions is still lacking. Here, we performed a high-resolution time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ and demonstrated a new experimental strategy to directly probe light-induced changes in the order parameter's phase with momentum resolution. To do this, we tracked the ultrafast response of a phase-sensitive hybridization gap that appears at the crossing between two bands with opposite superconducting gap signs. Supported by theoretical modeling, we established phase fluctuations as the dominant factor defining the non-thermal response of the unconventional superconducting phase in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Large critical current density Josephson $\pi$ junctions with PdNi barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report large critical current densities in $\text{Nb} / \text{Pd}_{89}\text{Ni}_{11} / \text{Nb}$ Josephson junctions at thicknesses of $\text{Pd}_{89}\text{Ni}_{11}$ close to where the first $\pi$-state is expected. We observe possible oscillations in the critical current density with the thickness of the $\text{Pd}_{89}\text{Ni}_{11}$ layer that are consistent with a $0-\pi$ transition. From temperature-dependent measurements, we find a large critical current density through our $\text{Pd}_{89}\text{Ni}_{11}$ barriers, exceeding 550 $\text{kA/cm}^2$ at 2 K in zero applied magnetic field, for a barrier thickness of 9.4 nm. From measurements of magnetization on sheet film samples, we confirm that the $\text{Pd}_{89}\text{Ni}_{11}$ layer exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Both the large critical current density and the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are beneficial for proposed applications of $\pi$-junctions in superconducting digital logic and qubits.</description>

      <title>Scalable Asynchronous Single Flux Quantum Up-Down Counter using Josephson Trapping Lines and {\alpha}-Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable, clockless up-down counter architecture implemented using single-flux quantum (SFQ) logic to enable efficient state management in superconductor digital systems. The proposed design eliminates the reliance on clocked storage elements by introducing the Josephson Trapping Line (JTrL). This bidirectional pulse-trapping structure enables persistent, non-volatile state storage without clocking. The counter integrates $\upalpha$-cells with a splitter (SPL) element to make bidirectional data propagation possible and support multi-fanout connectivity. The design supports increment, decrement, and read operations and includes a control unit that guarantees correct output behavior across all valid state transitions. Circuit-level simulations based on SPICE models demonstrate robust bidirectional functionality across a 3-bit state range [-4 to +4] at an operating frequency of 4 GHz. The proposed counter offers a modular and scalable solution suitable for integration into larger superconducting systems targeting quantum computing, neuromorphic processing, and cryogenic sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Crossover of Superconductivity across the end point of antiferromagnetic phase in FeSe$_{\rm 1-x}$S$_{\rm x}$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature-pressure ($T$-$P$) phase diagrams of FeSe$_{\rm 1-x}$S$_{\rm x}$ were investigated by the measurements of dc magnetization ($M$) and electrical resistivity ($\rho$) under pressure, using single crystal specimens with $x$=0.04, 0.08 and 0.13. We observed a crossover of the superconductivity with increasing $P$ near the end point of antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, where two superconducting phases coexist within a pressure width of $\Delta$$P$$\sim$1 GPa, having different $T_{\rm c}$s. These results suggest that the superconducting phases inside and outside the AFM phase have different origins.</description>

      <title>Complete suppression of flux instabilities in ramped superconducting magnets with synchronous temperature-modulated Jc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear multifield coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities.For currentramped high field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resourceintensive magnet training process.In this study, we propose a paradigm shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density Jc.Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires exposed to a time varying magnetic field at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane.The simulated results are in good agreement with experimental measurements, which demonstrates the synchronized ramped down temperature can indeed fully eliminate flux jumps.We reveal the underlying physical mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized ramped-down temperature can continuously tune both Jc and its slope.Furthermore, we carry out numerical simulations for the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm with home-made codes. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained.It indicates that the ramped-down temperature can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields.Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable solution.The findings offer a robust method to stabilize diverse superconducting magnet systems (including 2nd-gen coated tape HTS magnets), and propose a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.</description>

      <title>Realizing high-temperature superconductivity in compressed molecular-hydrogen through Li doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore lithium-doped stable molecular hydrogen structures by performing first-principles crystal structure searches across varying compositions in the Li-H system under high pressure. Our search reveals a cubic phase of LiH12, which shows promise as a high-temperature superconductor. Our Bader charge analysis suggests that electron transfer from Li to H atoms tunes the intra- and inter-molecular H-H distances, which are critical for the metallization of molecular hydrogen. This modulation alters the interaction between bonding and anti-bonding 1s states of hydrogen molecules. Furthermore, Li ions serve as stabilizers for the distorted H2 molecular network through ionic interactions. Numerical solutions to the fully anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations reveals that this phase could exhibit superconductivity above 300 K at a pressure of 250 GPa, a pressure value that is typically achievable using a diamond anvil cell. Detailed analysis of species-specific phonons and the Eliashberg function shows that low- and intermediate-energy phonons are crucial in promoting strong electron-phonon coupling. Thus, our study establishes lithium doping as a promising approach to induce high-temperature superconductivity in compressed molecular hydrogen without causing molecular dissociation.</description>

      <title>Charged Vortex in Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the charged spinless vortices in the effective field theory of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a gapless neutral scalar field of acoustic phonon. We show that regular static vortex solutions are obtained only for the nonzero critical cubic Yukawa type coupling between neutral and complex scalar fields. Since the Coulombic electric field is exactly cancelled by the phonon, the obtained charged vortices have finite energy. When the quartic self-interaction coupling of complex scalar field has the critical value, the BPS (Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield) bound is saturated for multiple charged vortices of arbitrary separations and hence the borderline of type I and II superconductors is achieved in nonperturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Ratchet Hall Effect in Fluctuating Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting ratchet-induced Hall effect (RHE), characterized by the emergence of a unidirectional, rectified flux of fluctuating Cooper pairs in a two-dimensional thin film exposed to an external electromagnetic field. The RHE is a second-order response with respect to the electromagnetic field amplitude. It consists of a nonzero photocurrent due to the breaking of the system's inversion symmetry driven by the combined action of the in-plane time-dependent electric field and a spatial modulation of the critical temperature. We explore a means to control the electric current by the polarization of the external field accompanied by a non-linear Hall effect of fluctuating Cooper pairs caused by circularly polarized irradiation. Moreover, the nonlinear conductivity tensor exhibits a higher-power dependence on the reduced temperature compared to that of the conventional Aslamazov-Larkin correction (or other fluctuating second-order nonlinear responses). It results in a dramatic enhancement of the non-linear Hall response of fluctuating Cooper pairs in the vicinity of the superconducting criticality.</description>

      <title>Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier with Passive Reverse Isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have attracted much attention for their broadband amplification and near-quantum-limited noise performance. TWPAs are non-reciprocal by nature providing gain for forward-propagating signals and transmission line losses for backward traveling waves. This intrinsic non-reciprocity is insufficient to protect sensitive quantum devices from back-action due to noise from warmer amplification stages in practical systems, and thus necessitates the need for bulky cryogenic isolators. We present a multi-stage Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier (mTWPA) that addresses this limitation by achieving passive in-band reverse isolation alongside near-quantum-limited noise performance. The multi-stage architecture consists of two, mode conversion stages and a reflectionless high-pass filter which provides the passive isolation. Experimental measurements of a prototype mTWPA demonstrated 20 dB of forward gain across a 1.6 GHz bandwidth and greater than 35 dB of reverse isolation. Noise measurements indicate performance at 1.7 times the quantum limit. This demonstrates that the increased complexity of a multi-stage TWPA design does not lead to significant added noise. The designed distribution of gain across the stages is engineered to minimize internal amplifier noise at the input, and we propose further optimization strategies in redistribution of the gain between the stages. This level of isolation effectively mitigates noise from warmer amplification stages, matching the performance of conventional isolators. The mTWPA approach offers a scalable path forward for more efficient and compact quantum circuit readout systems.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion-vortex hybrid and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a novel topological structure -- namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a N\'eel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Two characteristic contributions to the superconducting state of 2$H$-NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiband superconductivity arises when multiple electronic bands contribute to the formation of the superconducting state, allowing distinct pairing interactions and gap structures. Here, we present field- and temperature-dependent data on the vortex lattice structure in 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ as a contribution to the ongoing debate on the nature of the superconductivity in this material. The field-dependent data clearly show that there are two distinct superconducting bands, and the contribution of one of them to the vortex lattice signal is completely suppressed for magnetic fields above $\sim$ 0.8 T, well below $B\mathrm{_{c2}}$. By combining the temperature and field scans, we can deduce that there is a moderate degree of interband coupling. From the observed temperature dependences, we find that at low field and zero temperature, the two gaps in temperature units are 13.1 $\pm$ 0.2 and 6.5 $\pm$ 0.3 K ($\Delta_{0}$ = 1.88 and 0.94 $k\mathrm{_{B}} T\mathrm{_{c}} $); the band with the larger gap gives just under two-thirds of the superfluid density. The penetration depth extrapolated to zero field and zero temperature is 160 $\pm$ 2 nm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A field theory of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of gapless acoustic phonon is proposed for superconductivity of s-waves. Presence of the gapless neutral scalar field is justified as low energy residual acoustic phonon degrees in the context of effective field theory. The critical coupling of quartic self-interaction of complex scalar field is computed from a 1-loop level interaction balance between the repulsion mediated by massive degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by massive Higgs degree, in the static limit. The obtained net attraction or repulsion in perturbative regime matches the type I or II superconductivity, respectively. We find the new critical coupling of cubic Yukawa type interaction between the neutral and complex scalar fields from another tree level interaction balance between the Coulomb repulsion mediated by massless degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by the gapless neutral scalar field, in the static limit. Superconducting phase is realized at or in the vicinity of this critical coupling. A huge discrepancy between the propagation speeds of photon and phonon gives a plausible explanation on low critical temperatures in conventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram from Nonlinear Interaction between Superconducting Order and Density: Toward Data-Based Holographic Superconductor</title>

Abstract: We address an inverse problem in modeling holographic superconductors. We focus our research on the critical temperature behavior depicted by experiments. We use a physics-informed neural network method to find a mass function $M(F^2)$, which is necessary to understand phase transition behavior. This mass function describes a nonlinear interaction between superconducting order and charge carrier density. We introduce positional embedding layers to improve the learning process in our algorithm, and the Adam optimization is used to predict the critical temperature data via holographic calculation with appropriate accuracy. Consideration of the positional embedding layers is motivated by the transformer model of natural-language processing in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. We obtain holographic models that reproduce borderlines of the normal and superconducting phases provided by actual data. Our work is the first holographic attempt to match phase transition data quantitatively obtained from experiments. Also, the present work offers a new methodology for data-based holographic models.</description>
