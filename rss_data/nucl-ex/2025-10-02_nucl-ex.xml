      <title>NA61/SHINE results on multiplicity and net-charge fluctuations at CERN SPS energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution presents final results on the energy dependence of multiplicity and net-electric charge fluctuations in Ar+Sc interactions collected by the NA61/SHINE experiment. Fluctuations were analyzed using higher-order cumulant ratios in Ar+Sc most central collisions and compared to p+p interactions. The results consider detector bias and centrality selection in the case of Ar+Sc. The results are compared across different energies and against model predictions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present the thermal neutron counter from the ELI Gamma Above Neutron Threshold setup recently implemented at the Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics. The main goals of the detector array are presented, as well as the mechanical design, electronics, and the performance of the detectors. In addition, we have performed Geant4 and MCNP simulations monoenergetic neutrons and measurements with typical neutron sources. Finally, we show the performance of the array as a whole and outline the analysis procedure for experimental measurements by reproducing the ${}^{13}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\mathrm{n}_{0}){}^{16}\mathrm{O}$ cross-section branching ratios.</description>

      <title>The SWEET project: probing sugar crystals for direct dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several experiments searching for direct dark matter interactions aim to achieve unprecedented sensitivity to sub-GeV/c$^2$ dark matter masses through elastic scattering with nuclei in various target crystals at cryogenic temperatures. Hydrogen-rich materials, such as organic compounds, are promising candidates for the detection of sub-GeV/c$^2$ dark matter due to favourable kinematics.
  In this paper, we present for the first time results obtained with a sugar-based phonon detector employing sucrose crystals ($\mathbf{C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}}$), capable of particle detection with associated scintillation light.</description>

      <title>Physical Thickness Characterization of the FRIB Production Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FRIB heavy-ion accelerator, commissioned in 2022, is a leading facility
  for producing rare isotope beams (RIBs) and exploring nuclei beyond the limits of stability.
  These RIBs are produced via reactions between stable primary beams and a graphite target.
  Approximately 20-40 \% of the primary beam power is deposited in the target,
  requiring efficient thermal dissipation.
  Currently, FRIB operates with a primary beam power of up to 20 kW. To enhance thermal dissipation efficiency,
  a single-slice rotating graphite target with a diameter of approximately 30 cm is employed.
  The effective target region is a 1 cm-wide outer rim of the graphite disc.
  To achieve high RIB production rates, the areal thickness variation must be constrained within 2 \%.
  This paper presents physical thickness characterizations of FRIB production targets with various nominal thicknesses,
  measured using a custom-built non-contact thickness measurement apparatus.</description>

      <title>Observation of $\Lambda$ hyperon local polarization in pPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarization of the $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ hyperons along the beam direction has been measured in proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 8.16 TeV. The data were obtained with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 186.0 $\pm$ 6.5 nb$^{-1}$. A significant azimuthal dependence of the hyperon polarization, characterized by the second-order Fourier sine coefficient $P_{z,s2}$, is observed. The $P_{z,s2}$ values decrease as a function of charged particle multiplicity, but increase with transverse momentum. A hydrodynamic model that describes the observed $P_{z,s2}$ values in nucleus-nucleus collisions by introducing vorticity effects does not reproduce either the sign or the magnitude of the pPb results. These observations pose a challenge to the current theoretical implementation of spin polarization in heavy ion collisions and offer new insights into the origin of spin polarization in hadronic collisions at LHC energies.</description>

      <title>Potential absence of observed $\pi^2$ linear-chain structures in $^{14}$O via $^{10}$C($\alpha,\alpha$) resonant scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: The preference for light nuclear systems to coagulate into $\alpha$-particle clusters has been well-studied. The possibility of a linear chain configuration of $\alpha$-particles would allow for a new way to study this phenomenon. Purpose: A rotational band of states in $^{14}$C has been claimed showing a $\pi^2$ linear chain structure. The mirror system, $^{14}$O, has been studied here to examine how this linear chain structure is affected by replacing the valence neutrons with protons. Method: A beam of $^{10}$C was incident into a chamber filled with He:CO$_2$ gas with the tracks recorded inside the TexAT Time Projection Chamber and the recoil $\alpha$-particles detected by a silicon detector array to measure the $^{10}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\alpha)$ cross section. Results: The experimental cross section was compared with previous studies and fit using R-Matrix theory with the previously-observed $^{14}$O states being transformed to the $^{14}$C using mirror symmetry. The measured cross section does not replicate the claimed states, with the predicted cross section exceeding that observed at several energies and angles. Conclusion: A series of possibilities are highlighted with the most likely being that the originally-seen $^{14}$C states did not constitute a $\pi^2$ rotational band with a potentially incorrect spin assignment due to the limitations of the angular correlation method with non-zero spin particles. The work highlights the difficulties in measuring broad resonances corresponding to a linear chain state in a high level density.</description>

      <title>Deuteron-induced reactions on natural Zr from threshold to 50 MeV: production of $^{86}$Y</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two stacks of thin Zr foils were irradiated with 30 and 50 MeV deuterons, respectively, using the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory $88$-Inch Cyclotron, to investigate this production pathway for the promising PET tracer $^{86}$Y. Nineteen excitation functions for $^{\text{nat}}$Zr($d$,$x$) reactions were measured over a beam energy range of $6.3$--$47.64$ MeV, where the independent cross sections for $^{\text{nat}}$Zr($d$,$x$)$^{88}$Nb and $^\text{{nat}}$Zr($d$,$x$)$^{86\text{m, g}}$Y were measured for the first time. The well-characterized $^{\text{nat}}$Fe($d$,$x$)$^{56}$Co, $^{\text{nat}}$Ni($d$,$x$)$^{56}$Co, $^{\text{nat}}$Ni($d$,$x$)$^{58}$Co, $^{\text{nat}}$Ni($d$,$x$)$^{61}$Cu, $^{\text{nat}}$Ti($d$,$x$)$^{46}$Sc and $^{\text{nat}}$Ti($d$,$x$)$^{48}$V monitor reactions were used to determine the deuteron beam current throughout the stacks. All cross sections were determined using High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy. A variance minimization technique was employed to simultaneously constrain the deuteron beam currents with multiple monitor reactions, thus reducing systematic uncertainties. An additional $16$ channels are reported for reactions on the nickel, titanium, and iron monitor foils, leading to a total of $35$ excitation functions, with $7$ reaction channels reported for the first time in this work. The measured excitation functions are compared to calculations provided by the reaction modeling codes $\textsc{TALYS}-2.0$, $\textsc{ALICE}-2020$, $\textsc{CoH}-3.5.3$ and $\textsc{EMPIRE}-3.2.3$, as well as the $\textsc{TENDL}-2023$ data library. The degree of agreement between theory and experiments is discussed. The physical yields for $^{\text{nat}}$Zr($d$,$x$)$^{86}$Y and other yttrium isotopes produced are calculated and compared to other production pathways.</description>

      <title>Search for spontaneous fission of plutonium and americium nuclides using gamma spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous fission in americium and plutonium isotopes was investigated using high-resolution gamma spectrometry. This process was investigated through analysis of a certified PuO2 sample spectrum obtained from the IAEA database of reference spectra. Measurements were carried out with a HPGe detector, and detection efficiency calibration was performed by Monte Carlo simulations using GEANT4. There are no peaks observed that can be ascribed to beta decay of expected spontaneous-fission daughters. Thus, lower experimental limits on the partial half-lives for some spontaneous fission channels in 238-242Pu and 241Am were established. In many cases these limits have exceeded current theoretical predictions for cold fission done by S.B. Duarte et al., indicating the need to refine current models for the description of this process.</description>

      <title>Precision measurement and modelling of the threshold-free 210Pb {\beta} spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beta decay is a fundamental process that governs nuclear stability and serves as a sensitive probe of the weak interaction and possible physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. However, precise measurements of complete $\beta$ decay spectra, particularly at low energies, remain experimentally and theoretically challenging. Here we report a high-precision, threshold-free measurement of the full $\beta$ decay spectrum of 210Pb to excited states of 210Bi, using a transition-edge sensor (TES)-based micro-calorimeter. This approach enables the detection of $\beta$ particle energies from 0 keV up to their endpoint by coincidence summing with subsequent de-excitation energy, thereby eliminating reconstruction artifacts near zero energy that have traditionally limited low-energy spectral accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first complete, high-precision $\beta$ decay spectrum from 0 keV. The data resolve theoretical uncertainties associated with the atomic quantum exchange (AQE) effect. An accompanying ab initio theoretical framework, incorporating atomic, leptonic, and nuclear components, predicts a statistically significant (7.2 {$\sigma$}) enhancement in $\beta$ emission probability near zero energy, in agreement with the measurement and in contrast to models that omit AQE corrections. These results provide a new benchmark for $\beta$ decay theory at low energies, deepen our understanding of the weak interaction, and establish a critical foundation for searches for new physics, including dark matter interactions and precision studies of neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Alpha-Particle Monopole Form Factors with Ab Initio No-Core Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear many-body approaches with modern nuclear forces are challenged by the recent experimental measurement of the monopole form factor of the $0^+_1\rightarrow 0^+_2$ transition in the $\alpha$ particle [Kegel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 152502 (2023)]. We investigate the elastic and inelastic $0^+_1\rightarrow 0^+_2$ transition form factors using the ab initio no-core shell model (NCSM). We observe a good convergence of both form factors with respect to the basis size employing the Daejeon16 nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interaction. Our NCSM results are very close to the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonic calculations using $NN$ plus three-nucleon interactions based on the chiral effective field theory which take into account the continuum effects via the Lorentz integral transform. The significant difference between the ab initio results with various modern nuclear interactions and of some of them with the recent experimental data provides motivations for deeper investigation of this observable.</description>
