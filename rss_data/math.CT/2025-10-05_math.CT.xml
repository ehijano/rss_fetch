      <title>Homotopy Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attach to each weak model category $\mathcal{M}$ a class of first order formulas about the fibrant objects of $\mathcal{M}$ whose validity is invariant under homotopies and weak equivalences. This is a generalization of the classical Blanc-Freyd Language of categories -- which involves formula avoiding equality on objects and which are invariant under isomorphism and equivalences of categories. In particular, we obtain similar homotopy invariant languages for $2$-categories, bicategories, chain complexes, Kan complexes, quasi-categories, Segal spaces, and so on...</description>

      <title>Simplicial Perspectives on (Pseudo) Effect Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of Frobenius algebras in the category $\mathbf{Rel}$ via their nerve functor into simplicial sets has been introduced recently. In this article, we focus on the particular case of effect algebras and pseudo effect algebras and investigate these using tools from combinatorial topology. To each (pseudo) effect algebra $E$, we associate a simplicial set with edge marking $N(E)$, called an $\epsilon$-simplicial set, and analyze its structural properties. In particular, we provide certain characterizations of effect algebras, orthoalgebras, and orthomodular posets among Frobenius algebras in $\mathbf{Rel}$. We show that the universal group $\mathrm{Gr}(E)$ of an effect algebra $E$ coincides with the first homology group of $N(E)$. For a pair of effect algebras $E,F$, we study the mapping space $[N(E),N(F)]$ and prove that the category of effect algebras can be enriched over the category of Frobenius algebras in $\mathbf{Rel}$. We extend this result to the category of pseudo effect algebras. Given pseudo effect algebras $E,F$, for the initial pseudo effect algebra $\underline{1}$, we show that the unique morphism $\underline{1}\to E$ induces a Kan fibration \( [N(E),N(F)] \;\longrightarrow\; [N(\underline{1}),N(F)]. \) We discuss how this result captures several structural features of conjugations in the theory of pseudo effect algebras.</description>

      <title>Abstract Cluster Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a framework for encoding cluster combinatorics using categorical methods. We give a definition of an abstract cluster structure, which captures the essence of cluster mutation at a tropical level and show that cluster algebras, cluster varieties, cluster categories and surface models all have associated abstract cluster structures. For the first two classes, we also show that they can be constructed from abstract cluster structures.
  By defining a suitable notion of morphism of abstract cluster structures, we introduce a category of these and show that it has several desirable properties, such as initial and terminal objects and finite products and coproducts. We also prove that rooted cluster morphisms of cluster algebras give rise to morphisms of the associated abstract cluster structures, so that our framework includes a version of the extant category of cluster algebras.
  We can do more, however, because we can relate different types of representation of abstract cluster structures (cluster algebra, varieties, categories) directly via morphisms of their associated abstract cluster structures, even though no direct map from e.g. a cluster category to the associated cluster algebra is possible.
  In fact, we do much of the above in the setting of abstract quantum cluster structures, with some analysis of the difference between the category of these and that of the unquantized version. In order to show the relationship between abstract quantum cluster structures and quantum cluster algebras, we reformulate the usual construction of the latter in a way that is more amenable to our purposes and which we expect will be of independent interest and use.</description>

      <title>Pseudolimits for Tangent Categories with Applications to Equivariant Algebraic and Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that if $\mathscr{C}$ is a category and if $F\colon\mathscr{C}^{\operatorname{op}} \to \mathfrak{Cat}$ is a pseudofunctor such that for each object $X$ of $\mathscr{C}$ the category $F(X)$ is a tangent category and for each morphism $f$ of $\mathscr{C}$ the functor $F(f)$ is part of a strong tangent morphism $(F(f),{}_{f}{\alpha})$ and that furthermore the natural transformations ${}_{f}{\alpha}$ vary pseudonaturally in $\mathscr{C}^{\operatorname{op}}$, then there is a tangent structure on the pseudolimit $\mathbf{PC}(F)$ which is induced by the tangent structures on the categories $F(X)$ together with how they vary through the functors $F(f)$. We use this observation to show that the forgetful $2$-functor $\operatorname{Forget}:\mathfrak{Tan} \to \mathfrak{Cat}$ creates and preserves pseudolimits indexed by $1$-categories. As an application, this allows us to describe how equivariant descent interacts with the tangent structures on the category of smooth (real) manifolds and on various categories of (algebraic) varieties over a field.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Giry algebras on standard Borel spaces using $\mathbb{R}_{\infty}$-generalized points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14861v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Giry monad on the category of measurable spaces restricts to the full subcategory of standard Borel spaces, $\mathbf{Std}$, which we show is amenable to analysis. $\mathbf{Std}$ contains the space $\mathbb{R}_{\infty}$ which is the one-point compactification of the real numbers. By viewing probability measures $P \in \mathcal{G}(A)$ as functionals operating on measurable functions $A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\infty}$, and taking the restriction of those functionals to operate on affine measurable functions we show that $A \cong Hom_{\mathbb{R}_{\infty}^{\mathbb{R}_{\infty}}}(\mathbb{R}_{\infty}^A|,\mathbb{R}_{\infty})$ for all object $A$ lying in the subcategory $\mathbf{Std}_{Cvx}$ of $\mathbf{Std}$. The objects of $\mathbf{Std}_{Cvx}$ are standard spaces with a convex space structure which satisfies the generic ``fullness property''. The morphisms of the category $\mathbf{Std}_{Cvx}$ are affine measurable functions.
  The isomorphism is equivalent to the statement that the full subcategory of $\mathbf{Std}_{Cvx}$ consisting of the single object $\mathbb{R}_{\infty}$ is codense in $\mathbf{Std}_{Cvx}$ which allows us to easily construct the $\mathcal{G}$-algebras of objects in $\mathbf{Std}_{Cvx}$. This permits an adjoint factorization of the Giry monad as the composite of $\mathbf{Std} \xrightarrow{\hat{\mathcal{G}}} \mathbf{Std}_{Cvx}$, which is the Giry monad functor viewed as a functor into $\mathbf{Std}_{Cvx}$, and the partial forgetful functor $\mathbf{Std}_{Cvx} \xrightarrow{\mathcal{U}_{Cvx}} \mathbf{Std}$ which forgets the convex space structure. We prove that the category $\mathbf{Std}_{Cvx}$ is the category of algebras of the $\mathcal{G}$-monad.</description>

      <title>Note on the linearisation of finite abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $K$ is a field with enough roots of unity and $V$ an abelian group, the $K$-algebra $K[V]$ of the group $V$ is split semisimple, so that the canonical morphism $K[V]\to K^{V^\sharp}$, where $V^\sharp$ denotes the dual group of $V$ (which may be seen as Hom$(V,K^\times)$), is an isomorphism of $K$-algebras. If one removes the assumption that $K$ has enough roots of unity, one can easily deduce from it (by using a base change and Krull-Schmidt) that it remains a $K$-linear isomorphism $K[V]\xrightarrow{\simeq} K^{V^\sharp}$ natural in the group $V$ if one restricts to finite groups $V$ canceled by a fixed nonzero integer. The question of whether such an isomorphism, natural in the abelian group $V$, still exists without any other restriction than $V$ is finite and its order is invertible in $K$, is less obvious; we solve it positively, in a somewhat more general setting ($K$ being any commutative ring), by using Gauss sums. We also explore some related functorial questions.</description>

      <title>The six operations in topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the six functor formalism for sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff topological spaces, as developed for example in Kashiwara and Schapira's book Sheaves on Manifolds, can be extended to sheaves with values in any closed symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category which is stable and bicomplete. Notice that, since we do not assume that our coefficients are presentable or restrict to hypercomplete sheaves, our arguments are not obvious and are substantially different from the ones explained by Kashiwara and Schapira. Along the way we also study locally contractible geometric morphisms and prove that, if $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous map which induces a locally contractible geometric morphism, then the exceptional pullback functor $f^!$ preserves colimits and can be related to the pullback $f^*$. At the end of our paper we also show how one can express Atiyah duality by means of the six functor formalism.</description>

      <title>Comparing dg category models for path spaces via $A_\infty$-functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a many-object dual version of Chen's iterated integral map. For any topological space X, the construction takes the form of an A-infinity functor between two dg categories whose objects are the points of X: the domain has as morphisms the singular (cubical) chains on the space of (Moore) paths in X and the codomain has morphisms arising by totalizing a cosimplicial chain complex determined by the dg coalgebra of singular (simplicial) chains in X. When X is simply connected, we show this construction defines a homotopy inverse to a classical map of Adams, which sends ordered sequences of singular simplices in X linked by shared vertices to cubes of paths in X. When X is not necessarily simply connected, following an idea of Irie, we incorporate the fundamental groupoid of X into the construction and deduce analogous results. Along the way, we provide an elementary and new proof of the fact that the (direct-sum) cobar construction of the chains in X, suitably interpreted, models the dg category of paths in X, an extension of Adams's cobar theorem established by Rivera-Zeinalian using different methods.</description>
