      <title>Nanoparticles of NbC produced by laser ablation in liquid: a study of structural, magnetic and superconductivity properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niobium carbide (NbC) is a high-field Type II superconductor with a critical temperature ($T_C$) of 11.1 K, just above that of pure Nb ($T_C = 9$ K). Downsizing NbC to the nanoparticle scale introduces significant alterations in its critical field and/or the superconducting temperature. Here we report on superconducting NbC nanoparticles with $T_C \approx$ 10 K synthesized by laser ablation in acetone, using the lens-target distance (laser fluence) and centrifugation as control parameters of the particle size. X-ray diffraction analyses certified the cubic NbC phase and electron microscopy images revealed spherical particles with average size near 8 nm, with no apparent size dependence on fluence. Besides, magnetization curves exhibited magnetic loops featuring a saturation magnetization around $10^{-3} \mu_B$/molecule along with a small and typical superconducting loop for all investigated samples. We also observed a suppression of the diamagnetic behavior below $T_C$ upon decreasing laser fluence. Moreover, all samples exhibited a weak electron spin resonance (ESR) Curie-like signal at $g\approx2.0$ probably associated with localized defects in the particle's surface. The intriguing coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in nanoparticles has recently garnered significant research attention. This complex scenario and unique properties are due to the substantial increase of surface-to-volume ratio in these superconducting NbC nanoparticles and further investigation would be crucial to unveil novel material properties and shed new light on our understanding of the superconducting phenomenon in this new morphology.</description>

      <title>Evidence for conventional superconductivity in Bi$_2$PdPt and prediction of topological superconductivity in disorder-free $\gamma$-BiPd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present comprehensive investigations into the structural, superconducting, and topological properties of Bi$_2$PdPt. Magnetization and heat capacity measurements performed on polycrystalline Bi$_2$PdPt demonstrate a superconducting transition at $\approx$ 0.8 K. Moreover, muon spin relaxation/rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements present evidence for a time reversal symmetry preserving, isotropically gapped superconducting state in Bi$_2$PdPt. We have also performed density-functional theory (DFT) calculations on Bi$_2$PdPt alongside the more general isostructural systems, BiPd$_{x}$Pt$_{1-x}$, of which Bi$_2$PdPt and $\gamma$-BiPd are special cases for $x=0.5$ and $x=1$ respectively. We have calculated the $Z_2$ topological index from our DFT calculations for a range of substitution fractions, $x$, between $x=0$ and $x=1$ characterizing the topology of the band structure. We find a non-trivial topological state when $x&gt;0.75$ and a trivial topological state when $x&lt;0.75$. Therefore our results indicate that BiPd$_{x}$Pt$_{1-x}$ could be a topological superconductor for $x&gt;0.75$.</description>

      <title>Band engineering and study of disorder using topology in compact high kinetic inductance cavity arrays</title>

Abstract: Superconducting microwave metamaterials offer enormous potential for quantum optics and information science, enabling the development of advanced quantum technologies for sensing and amplification. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, such metamaterials can be implemented as coupled cavity arrays (CCAs). In the continuous effort to miniaturize quantum devices for increasing scalability, minimizing the footprint of CCAs while preserving low disorder becomes paramount. In this work, we present a compact CCA architecture leveraging superconducting NbN thin films presenting high kinetic inductance, which enables high-impedance CCA ($\sim1.5$ k$\Omega$), while reducing the resonator footprint. We demonstrate its versatility and scalability by engineering one-dimensional CCAs with up to 100 resonators and exhibiting multiple bandgaps. Additionally, we quantitatively investigate disorder in the CCAs using symmetry-protected topological SSH modes, from which we extract a resonator frequency scattering of $0.22^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\%$. Our platform opens up exciting new prospects for analog quantum simulations of many-body physics with ultrastrongly coupled emitters.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations in competing phases in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting (SC), charge-density wave (CDW), and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases in the extended Hubbard model at zero temperature and half-filling. We employ the iterated equations of motion approach to compute the two-particle Green's functions and their spectral densities. This renders a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of collective excitations possible as the model's parameters are tuned across phase transitions. We identify the well-known amplitude (Higgs) and phase (Anderson-Bogoliubov) modes within the superconducting phase and observe a similar excitation (cooperon) in the CDW phase which shifts towards zero energy as the system approaches the phase transition to the SC phase. In the CDW phase, close to the phase transition to the AFM phase, we find a collective mode, an exciton, that does not change significantly and another mode, a longitudinal magnon, that emerges from the two-particle continuum as the system approaches the phase transition to the AFM phase. It becomes identical with the former at the transition. In the AFM phase, their roles are reversed. Additionally, we find a transversal Goldstone magnon located at zero energy.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity induced by spin-orbit coupling, perpendicular magnetic field and superlattice potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological superconductors support Majorana modes, which are quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles and which obey non-Abelian statistics in which successive exchanges of particles do not always commute. Here we investigate whether a two-dimensional superconductor with ordinary s-wave pairing can be rendered topological by the application of a strong magnetic field. To address this, we obtain the self-consistent solutions to the mean field Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which are a large set of nonlinearly coupled equations, for electrons moving on a lattice. We find that the topological "quantum Hall superconductivity" is facilitated by a combination of spin-orbit coupling, which locks an electron's spin to its momentum as it moves through a material, and a coupling to an external periodic potential which gives a dispersion to the Landau levels and also distorts the Abrikosov lattice. We find that, for a range of parameters, the Landau levels broadened by the external periodic potential support topological superconductivity, which is typically accompanied by a lattice of "giant" $h/e$ vortices as opposed to the familiar lattice of $h/2e$ Abrikosov vortices. In the presence of a periodic potential, we find it necessary to use an ansatz for the pairing potential of the form $\Delta(\vec{r})e^{i2\vec{Q}\cdot\vec{r}}$ where $\Delta(\vec{r})$ has a periodicity commensurate with the periodic potential. However, despite this form of the pairing potential, the current in the ground state is zero. In the region of ordinary superconductivity, we typically find a lattice of dimers of $h/2e$ vortices. Our work suggests a realistic proposal for achieving topological superconductivity, as well as a helical order parameter and unusual Abrikosov lattices.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure and Vibrational Stability of Copper-substituted Lead Apatite (LK-99)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01135v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two recent preprints in the physics archive (arXiv) have called attention as they claim experimental evidence that a Cu-substituted apatite material (dubbed LK-99) exhibits superconductivity at room temperature and pressure. If this proves to be true, LK-99 will be a ``holy grail" of superconductors. In this work, we used Density Functional Theory (DFT+U) calculations to elucidate some key features of the electronic structure of LK-99. We find two different phases of this material: (i) a hexagonal lattice featuring metallic half-filled and spin-split bands, a nesting of the Fermi surface, a remarkably large electron-phonon coupling, but this lattice is vibrationally unstable. (ii) a triclinic lattice, with the Cu and surrounding O distorted. This lattice is vibrationally stable and its bands correspond to an insulator. In a crystal, the Cu atoms should oscillate between equivalent triclinic positions, with an average close to the hexagonal positions. We discuss the electronic structure expected from these fluctuations and if it is compatible with superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in a layered cobalt oxychalcogenide Na$_{2}$CoSe$_{2}$O with a triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity in bulk materials under ambient pressure is extremely rare among the 3d transition metal compounds outside the layered cuprates and iron-based family. It is predominantly linked to highly anisotropic electronic properties and quasi-two-dimensional (2D) Fermi surfaces. To date, the only known example of a Co-based exotic superconductor is the hydrated layered cobaltate, Na$_{x}$CoO$_{2}\cdot$ yH$_{2}$O, and its superconductivity is realized in the vicinity of a spin-1/2 Mott state. However, the nature of the superconductivity in these materials is still a subject of intense debate, and therefore, finding a new class of superconductors will help unravel the mysteries of their unconventional superconductivity. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity at $\sim$ 6.3 K in our newly synthesized layered compound Na$_{2}$CoSe$_{2}$O, in which the edge-shared CoSe$_{6}$ octahedra form [CoSe$_{2}$] layers with a perfect triangular lattice of Co ions. It is the first 3d transition metal oxychalcogenide superconductor with distinct structural and chemical characteristics. Despite its relatively low $T_{c}$, this material exhibits very high superconducting upper critical fields, $\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)$, which far exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit by a factor of 3 - 4. First-principles calculations show that Na$_{2}$CoSe$_{2}$O is a rare example of a negative charge transfer superconductor. This cobalt oxychalcogenide with a geometrical frustration among Co spins shows great potential as a highly appealing candidate for the realization of unconventional and/or high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity beyond the well-established Cu- and Fe-based superconductor families and opens a new field in the physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topology of non-Hermitian systems is fundamentally changed by the non-Hermitian skin effect, which leads to the generalized bulk-boundary correspondence. Based on the non-Bloch band theory, we get insight into the interplay between the non-Hermiticity and the second-order topological superconductors in two spatial dimensions. We investigate that the non-Hermiticity drives both the bulk states and topological edge modes to accumulate toward opposite corners of the system depending on the particle and hole degrees of freedom protected by the particle-hole symmetry. Furthermore, the degeneracy of the Majorana corner modes can be broken in terms of both the eigenenergies and the eigenstates. Through an edge theory analysis, we elucidate the impact of non-Hermiticity and enable the extension of higher-order topological superconductors to the realm of non-Hermitian systems. We show that $Z_2$ skin effect and $Z_2$ skin-topological modes reveal the universal characteristics of non-Hermitian second-order topological superconductors and the generalized bulk-boundary correspondence is further enriched by the particle-hole symmetry.</description>

      <title>Role of the Berry curvature on BCS-type superconductivity in two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate how the Berry curvature, which arises in multi-band structures when the electrons can be described by an effective single-band Hamiltonian, affects the superconducting properties of two-dimensional electronic systems. Generically the Berry curvature is coupled to electric fields beyond those created by the periodic crystal potential. A potential source of such electric fields, which vary slowly on the lattice scale, is the mutual interaction between the electrons. We show that the Berry curvature provides additional terms in the Hamiltonian describing interacting electrons within a single band. When these terms are taken into account in the framework of the usual BCS weak-coupling treatment of a generic attractive interaction that allows for the formation of Cooper pairs, the coupling constant is modified. In pure singlet and triplet superconductors, we find that the Berry curvature generally lowers the coupling constant and thus the superconducting gap and the critical temperature as a function of doping. From an experimental point of view, a measured deviation from the expected BCS critical temperature upon doping, e.g. in doped two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides, may unveil the strength of the Berry curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parafermion zero modes can arise in hybrid structures composed of $\nu=1/m$ fractional quantum Hall edges proximitized with an s-wave superconductor. Here we consider parafermion and Cooper pair tunneling, and backscattering in a junction formed in such hybrid structures. We find that the $4\pi m$ periodicity due to parafermion-only tunneling reduces, in the presence of backscattering, to $4\pi$-periodic at zero temperature and $2\pi$-periodic at finite temperature unless the fermion parity is fixed. Nevertheless, a clear signature of parafermion tunneling remains in the shape of the current-phase relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological bandstructures interfering with moir\'e superstructures give rise to a plethora of emergent phenomena, which are pivotal for correlated insulating and superconducting states of twisttronics materials. While quasiperiodicity was up to now a notion mostly reserved for solid-state materials and cold atoms, we here demonstrate the capacity of conventional superconducting circuits to emulate moir\'e physics in charge space. With two examples, we show that Hofstadter's butterfly and the magic-angle effect, are directly visible in spectroscopic transport measurements. Importantly, these features survive in the presence of harmonic trapping potentials due to parasitic linear capacitances. Our proposed platform benefits from unprecedented tuning capabilities, and opens the door to probe incommensurate physics in virtually any spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Mechanism of Pair-, Charge- and Spin-Density-Wave Instabilities in Interacting D-Dimensional Fermi Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytic theory unraveling the microscopic mechanism of instabilities within interacting $D$-dimensional Fermi liquid. Our model consists of a $D$-dimensional electron gas subject to an instantaneous electron-electron interaction of a finite range exceeding the average inter-particle distance. Pair, charge and spin susceptibilities are evaluated via the one-loop renormalization group theory and via the bosonization approach, giving identical results. In case of a repulsive interaction, we identify an intrinsic Fermi liquid instability towards insulating spin/charge density wave order when the interaction coupling strength reaches a universal critical value. If both electron and hole pockets of the same size are present, the ground state is an excitonic insulator at arbitrarily small repulsive interaction. If the interaction is attractive, the ground state is a singlet non-BCS superconductor with a uniform condensate. In case if both electron and hole Fermi surfaces are present, we predict an instability towards the inter-pocket pair-density-wave ordering at the critical coupling. This prediction lends strong theoretical support to the pair-density-wave scenario of superconductivity in cuprate materials. Due to its simple and universal nature, presented microscopic mechanism of intrinsic instabilities of interacting $D$-dimensional Fermi liquids constitutes a solid theoretical ground for understanding quantum phase transitions in a variety of quantum materials, from ultraclean semiconductor quantum wells to high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Electronic instability, layer selectivity and Fermi arcs in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using advanced dynamical mean-field theory on a realistic level we study the normal-state correlated electronic structure of the high-pressure superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and compare the features of the conventional bilayer (2222) Ruddelsden-Popper crystal structure with those of a newly-identified monolayer-trilayer (1313) alternation. Both structural cases display Ni-$d_{z^2}$ flat-band character at low-energy, which drives an electronic instability with a wave vector ${\bf q_{\rm I}}=(0.25,0.25,q_z)$ at ambient pressure, in line with recent experimental findings. The 1313 electronic structure exhibits significant layer selectivity, rendering especially the monolayer part to be Mott-critical. At high pressure, this layer selectivity weakens and the 1313 fermiology displays arcs reminiscent to those of high-$T_c$ cuprates. In contrast to dominant inter-site self-energy effects in the latter systems, here the Fermi arcs are the result of the multiorbital and multilayer interplay within a correlated flat-band scenario.</description>
