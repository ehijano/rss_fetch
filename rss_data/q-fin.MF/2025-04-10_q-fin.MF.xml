      <title>Local signature-based expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local (in time) expansion of a continuous-time process and its conditional moments, including the process' characteristic function. The expansions are conducted by using the properties of the (time-extended) Ito signature, a tractable basis composed of iterated integrals of the driving deterministic and stochastic signals: time, multiple correlated Brownian motions and multiple correlated compound Poisson processes. We show that these properties are conducive to automated expansions to any order with explicit coefficients and, therefore, to stochastic representations in which asymptotics can be conducted for a shrinking time (t to 0), as in the extant continuous-time econometrics literature, but, also, for a fixed time (such that t smaller than 1) with a diverging expansion order. The latter design opens up novel opportunities for identifying deep characteristics of the assumed process.</description>

      <title>Density Approximation of Affine Jump Diffusions via Closed-Form Moment Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a recursive approach for deriving closed-form solutions to both conditional and unconditional moments of affine jump diffusions with state-independent jump intensities. Using these moment solutions, we construct closed-form density approximations (up to a normalization constant) via moment matching for both conditional and unconditional distributions. Our framework enables important financial applications, including efficient option pricing and exact simulation for affine jump diffusions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's superior computational efficiency compared to existing simulation techniques, while preserving numerical precision.</description>

      <title>QubitSwap: The Informational Edge in Decentralised Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralised exchanges (DEXs) have transformed trading by enabling trustless, permissionless transactions, yet they face significant challenges such as impermanent loss and slippage, which undermine profitability for liquidity providers and traders. In this paper, we introduce QubitSwap, an innovative DEX model designed to tackle these issues through a hybrid approach that integrates an external oracle price with internal pool dynamics. This is achieved via a parameter $z$, which governs the balance between these price sources, creating a flexible and adaptive pricing mechanism. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we derive a novel reserve function and pricing model that substantially reduces impermanent loss and slippage compared to traditional DEX frameworks. Notably, our results show that as $z$ approaches 1, slippage approaches zero, enhancing trading stability. QubitSwap marks a novel approach in DEX design, delivering a more efficient and resilient platform. This work not only advances the theoretical foundations of decentralised finance but also provides actionable solutions for the broader DeFi ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Jointly Exchangeable Collective Risk Models: Interaction, Structure, and Limit Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for systemic risk modeling in insurance portfolios using jointly exchangeable arrays, extending classical collective risk models to account for interactions. We establish central limit theorems that asymptotically characterize total portfolio losses, providing a theoretical foundation for approximations in large portfolios and over long time horizons. These approximations are validated through simulation-based numerical experiments. Additionally, we analyze the impact of dependence on portfolio loss distributions, with a particular focus on tail behavior.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Factor Models: Generating High-Dimensional Returns with Factor Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial scenario simulation is essential for risk management and portfolio optimization, yet it remains challenging especially in high-dimensional and small data settings common in finance. We propose a diffusion factor model that integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes, bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4} n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable for markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior performance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical analysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in constructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work presents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion models, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial simulation with limited data.</description>

      <title>Volatility models in practice: Rough, Path-dependent or Markovian?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an empirical study examining several claims related to option prices in rough volatility literature using SPX options data. Our results show that rough volatility models with the parameter $H \in (0,1/2)$ are inconsistent with the global shape of SPX smiles. In particular, the at-the-money SPX skew is incompatible with the power-law shape generated by these models, which increases too fast for short maturities and decays too slowly for longer maturities. For maturities between one week and three months, rough volatility models underperform one-factor Markovian models with the same number of parameters. When extended to longer maturities, rough volatility models do not consistently outperform one-factor Markovian models. Our study identifies a non-rough path-dependent model and a two-factor Markovian model that outperform their rough counterparts in capturing SPX smiles between one week and three years, with only 3 to 4 parameters.</description>

      <title>Rough Heston model as the scaling limit of bivariate cumulative heavy-tailed INAR($\infty$) processes and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a novel link between nearly unstable cumulative heavy-tailed integer-valued autoregressive (INAR($\infty$)) processes and the rough Heston model via discrete scaling limits. We prove that a sequence of bivariate cumulative INAR($\infty$) processes converge in law to the rough Heston model under appropriate scaling conditions, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding how microstructural order flow drives macroscopic prices following rough volatility dynamics. Our theoretical framework extends the scaling limit techniques from Hawkes processes to the INAR($\infty$) setting. Hence we can carry out efficient Monte Carlo simulation of the rough Heston model through simulating the corresponding approximating INAR($\infty$) processes, which provides an alternative discrete-time simulation method to the Euler-Maruyama method. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the improved accuracy and efficiency of the proposed simulation scheme as compared to the literature, in the valuation of European options, and also path-dependent options such as arithmetic Asian options, lookback options and barrier options.</description>
