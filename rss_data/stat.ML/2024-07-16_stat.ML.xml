      <title>Granger Causality in Extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a rigorous mathematical framework for Granger causality in extremes, designed to identify causal links from extreme events in time series. Granger causality plays a pivotal role in uncovering directional relationships among time-varying variables. While this notion gains heightened importance during extreme and highly volatile periods, state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on causality within the body of the distribution, often overlooking causal mechanisms that manifest only during extreme events. Our framework is designed to infer causality mainly from extreme events by leveraging the causal tail coefficient. We establish equivalences between causality in extremes and other causal concepts, including (classical) Granger causality, Sims causality, and structural causality. We prove other key properties of Granger causality in extremes and show that the framework is especially helpful under the presence of hidden confounders. We also propose a novel inference method for detecting the presence of Granger causality in extremes from data. Our method is model-free, can handle non-linear and high-dimensional time series, outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in all considered setups, both in performance and speed, and was found to uncover coherent effects when applied to financial and extreme weather observations.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding epoch-wise double descent in two-layer linear neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epoch-wise double descent is the phenomenon where generalisation performance improves beyond the point of overfitting, resulting in a generalisation curve exhibiting two descents under the course of learning. Understanding the mechanisms driving this behaviour is crucial not only for understanding the generalisation behaviour of machine learning models in general, but also for employing conventional selection methods, such as the use of early stopping to mitigate overfitting. While we ultimately want to draw conclusions of more complex models, such as deep neural networks, a majority of theoretical conclusions regarding the underlying cause of epoch-wise double descent are based on simple models, such as standard linear regression. To start bridging this gap, we study epoch-wise double descent in two-layer linear neural networks. First, we derive a gradient flow for the linear two-layer model, that bridges the learning dynamics of the standard linear regression model, and the linear two-layer diagonal network with quadratic weights. Second, we identify additional factors of epoch-wise double descent emerging with the extra model layer, by deriving necessary conditions for the generalisation error to follow a double descent pattern. While epoch-wise double descent in linear regression has been attributed to differences in input variance, in the two-layer model, also the singular values of the input-output covariance matrix play an important role. This opens up for further questions regarding unidentified factors of epoch-wise double descent for truly deep models.</description>

      <title>Weighted Aggregation of Conformity Scores for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful framework for constructing prediction sets with valid coverage guarantees in multi-class classification. However, existing methods often rely on a single score function, which can limit their efficiency and informativeness. We propose a novel approach that combines multiple score functions to improve the performance of conformal predictors by identifying optimal weights that minimize prediction set size. Our theoretical analysis establishes a connection between the weighted score functions and subgraph classes of functions studied in Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory, providing a rigorous mathematical basis for understanding the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms single-score conformal predictors while maintaining valid coverage, offering a principled and data-driven way to enhance the efficiency and practicality of conformal prediction in classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation for Generalized Low-Rank Matrix Sensing by Learning on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove convergence guarantees for generalized low-rank matrix sensing -- i.e., where matrix sensing where the observations may be passed through some nonlinear link function. We focus on local convergence of the optimal estimator, ignoring questions of optimization. In particular, assuming the minimizer of the empirical loss $\theta^0$ is in a constant size ball around the true parameters $\theta^*$, we prove that $d(\theta^0,\theta^*)=\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dk^2/n})$. Our analysis relies on tools from Riemannian geometry to handle the rotational symmetry in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Augmented prediction of a true class for Positive Unlabeled data under selection bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new observational setting for Positive Unlabeled (PU) data where the observations at prediction time are also labeled. This occurs commonly in practice -- we argue that the additional information is important for prediction, and call this task "augmented PU prediction". We allow for labeling to be feature dependent. In such scenario, Bayes classifier and its risk is established and compared with a risk of a classifier which for unlabeled data is based only on predictors. We introduce several variants of the empirical Bayes rule in such scenario and investigate their performance. We emphasise dangers (and ease) of applying classical classification rule in the augmented PU scenario -- due to no preexisting studies, an unaware researcher is prone to skewing the obtained predictions. We conclude that the variant based on recently proposed variational autoencoder designed for PU scenario works on par or better than other considered variants and yields advantage over feature-only based methods in terms of accuracy for unlabeled samples.</description>

      <title>Proper losses regret at least 1/2-order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in machine learning is the choice of a loss as it characterizes our learning task, is minimized in the training phase, and serves as an evaluation criterion for estimators. Proper losses are commonly chosen, ensuring minimizers of the full risk match the true probability vector. Estimators induced from a proper loss are widely used to construct forecasters for downstream tasks such as classification and ranking. In this procedure, how does the forecaster based on the obtained estimator perform well under a given downstream task? This question is substantially relevant to the behavior of the $p$-norm between the estimated and true probability vectors when the estimator is updated. In the proper loss framework, the suboptimality of the estimated probability vector from the true probability vector is measured by a surrogate regret. First, we analyze a surrogate regret and show that the strict properness of a loss is necessary and sufficient to establish a non-vacuous surrogate regret bound. Second, we solve an important open question that the order of convergence in p-norm cannot be faster than the $1/2$-order of surrogate regrets for a broad class of strictly proper losses. This implies that strongly proper losses entail the optimal convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Flow Perturbation to Accelerate Unbiased Sampling of Boltzmann distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models have been employed for sampling the Boltzmann distribution, but their application to high-dimensional systems is hindered by the significant computational cost of obtaining the Jacobian of the flow. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the flow perturbation method, which incorporates optimized stochastic perturbations into the flow. By reweighting trajectories generated by the perturbed flow, our method achieves unbiased sampling of the Boltzmann distribution with orders of magnitude speedup compared to both brute force Jacobian calculations and the Hutchinson estimator. Notably, it accurately sampled the Chignolin protein with all atomic Cartesian coordinates explicitly represented, which, to our best knowledge, is the largest molecule ever Boltzmann sampled in such detail using generative models.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Flow Map Learning of PDEs from Incomplete, Limited, and Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational technique for modeling the evolution of dynamical systems in a reduced basis, with a focus on the challenging problem of modeling partially-observed partial differential equations (PDEs) on high-dimensional non-uniform grids. We address limitations of previous work on data-driven flow map learning in the sense that we focus on noisy and limited data to move toward data collection scenarios in real-world applications. Leveraging recent work on modeling PDEs in modal and nodal spaces, we present a neural network structure that is suitable for PDE modeling with noisy and limited data available only on a subset of the state variables or computational domain. In particular, spatial grid-point measurements are reduced using a learned linear transformation, after which the dynamics are learned in this reduced basis before being transformed back out to the nodal space. This approach yields a drastically reduced parameterization of the neural network compared with previous flow map models for nodal space learning. This primarily allows for smaller training data sets, but also enables reduced training times.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Stochastic Optimization for Statistical Efficiency Using ROOT-SGD with Diminishing Stepsize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10955v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit \textsf{ROOT-SGD}, an innovative method for stochastic optimization to bridge the gap between stochastic optimization and statistical efficiency. The proposed method enhances the performance and reliability of \textsf{ROOT-SGD} by integrating a carefully designed \emph{diminishing stepsize strategy}. This approach addresses key challenges in optimization, providing robust theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Our analysis demonstrates that \textsf{ROOT-SGD} with diminishing achieves optimal convergence rates while maintaining computational efficiency. By dynamically adjusting the learning rate, \textsf{ROOT-SGD} ensures improved stability and precision throughout the optimization process. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for developing advanced optimization algorithms that are both efficient and statistically robust.</description>

      <title>Self-Consuming Generative Models with Curated Data Provably Optimize Human Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress in generative models has resulted in impressive leaps in generation quality, blurring the lines between synthetic and real data. Web-scale datasets are now prone to the inevitable contamination by synthetic data, directly impacting the training of future generated models. Already, some theoretical results on self-consuming generative models (a.k.a., iterative retraining) have emerged in the literature, showcasing that either model collapse or stability could be possible depending on the fraction of generated data used at each retraining step. However, in practice, synthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users before being used and uploaded online. For instance, many interfaces of popular text-to-image generative models, such as Stable Diffusion or Midjourney, produce several variations of an image for a given query which can eventually be curated by the users. In this paper, we theoretically study the impact of data curation on iterated retraining of generative models and show that it can be seen as an \emph{implicit preference optimization mechanism}. However, unlike standard preference optimization, the generative model does not have access to the reward function or negative samples needed for pairwise comparisons. Moreover, our study doesn't require access to the density function, only to samples. We prove that, if the data is curated according to a reward model, then the expected reward of the iterative retraining procedure is maximized. We further provide theoretical results on the stability of the retraining loop when using a positive fraction of real data at each step. Finally, we conduct illustrative experiments on both synthetic datasets and on CIFAR10 showing that such a procedure amplifies biases of the reward model.</description>

      <title>UQE: A Query Engine for Unstructured Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytics on structured data is a mature field with many successful methods. However, most real world data exists in unstructured form, such as images and conversations. We investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable unstructured data analytics. In particular, we propose a new Universal Query Engine (UQE) that directly interrogates and draws insights from unstructured data collections. This engine accepts queries in a Universal Query Language (UQL), a dialect of SQL that provides full natural language flexibility in specifying conditions and operators. The new engine leverages the ability of LLMs to conduct analysis of unstructured data, while also allowing us to exploit advances in sampling and optimization techniques to achieve efficient and accurate query execution. In addition, we borrow techniques from classical compiler theory to better orchestrate the workflow between sampling methods and foundation model calls. We demonstrate the efficiency of UQE on data analytics across different modalities, including images, dialogs and reviews, across a range of useful query types, including conditional aggregation, semantic retrieval and abstraction aggregation.</description>

      <title>Positive and Unlabeled Data: Model, Estimation, Inference, and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new approach to addressing positive and unlabeled (PU) data through the double exponential tilting model (DETM). Traditional methods often fall short because they only apply to selected completely at random (SCAR) PU data, where the labeled positive and unlabeled positive data are assumed to be from the same distribution. In contrast, our DETM's dual structure effectively accommodates the more complex and underexplored selected at random PU data, where the labeled and unlabeled positive data can be from different distributions. We rigorously establish the theoretical foundations of DETM, including identifiability, parameter estimation, and asymptotic properties. Additionally, we move forward to statistical inference by developing a goodness-of-fit test for the SCAR condition and constructing confidence intervals for the proportion of positive instances in the target domain. We leverage an approximated Bayes classifier for classification tasks, demonstrating DETM's robust performance in prediction. Through theoretical insights and practical applications, this study highlights DETM as a comprehensive framework for addressing the challenges of PU data.</description>

      <title>Sparse Asymptotic PCA: Identifying Sparse Latent Factors Across Time Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for sparse latent factor modeling using a new sparse asymptotic Principal Component Analysis (APCA). This approach analyzes the co-movements of large-dimensional panel data systems over time horizons within a general approximate factor model framework. Unlike existing sparse factor modeling approaches based on sparse PCA, which assume sparse loading matrices, our sparse APCA assumes that factor processes are sparse over the time horizon, while the corresponding loading matrices are not necessarily sparse. This development is motivated by the observation that the assumption of sparse loadings may not be appropriate for financial returns, where exposure to market factors is generally universal and non-sparse. We propose a truncated power method to estimate the first sparse factor process and a sequential deflation method for multi-factor cases. Additionally, we develop a data-driven approach to identify the sparsity of risk factors over the time horizon using a novel cross-sectional cross-validation method. Theoretically, we establish that our estimators are consistent under mild conditions. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in finite samples. Empirically, we analyze daily stock returns for a balanced panel of S&amp;P 500 stocks from January 2004 to December 2016. Through textual analysis, we examine specific events associated with the identified sparse factors that systematically influence the stock market. Our approach offers a new pathway for economists to study and understand the systematic risks of economic and financial systems over time.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Derivative-Based Global Sensitivity Analysis with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of active learning for global sensitivity analysis of expensive black-box functions. Our aim is to efficiently learn the importance of different input variables, e.g., in vehicle safety experimentation, we study the impact of the thickness of various components on safety objectives. Since function evaluations are expensive, we use active learning to prioritize experimental resources where they yield the most value. We propose novel active learning acquisition functions that directly target key quantities of derivative-based global sensitivity measures (DGSMs) under Gaussian process surrogate models. We showcase the first application of active learning directly to DGSMs, and develop tractable uncertainty reduction and information gain acquisition functions for these measures. Through comprehensive evaluation on synthetic and real-world problems, our study demonstrates how these active learning acquisition strategies substantially enhance the sample efficiency of DGSM estimation, particularly with limited evaluation budgets. Our work paves the way for more efficient and accurate sensitivity analysis in various scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient algorithm for gradient-based linear dimension reduction and high-dimensional regression. The algorithm initially computes a Mondrian forest and uses this estimator to identify a relevant feature subspace of the inputs from an estimate of the expected gradient outer product (EGOP) of the regression function. In addition, we introduce an iterative approach known as Transformed Iterative Mondrian (TrIM) forest to improve the Mondrian forest estimator by using the EGOP estimate to update the set of features and weights used by the Mondrian partitioning mechanism. We obtain consistency guarantees and convergence rates for the estimation of the EGOP matrix and the random forest estimator obtained from one iteration of the TrIM algorithm. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm for learning the relevant feature subspace across a variety of settings with both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>On Characterizing and Mitigating Imbalances in Multi-Instance Partial Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Instance Partial Label Learning (MI-PLL) is a weakly-supervised learning setting encompassing partial label learning, latent structural learning, and neurosymbolic learning. Differently from supervised learning, in MI-PLL, the inputs to the classifiers at training-time are tuples of instances $\textbf{x}$, while the supervision signal is generated by a function $\sigma$ over the gold labels of $\textbf{x}$. The gold labels are hidden during training. In this paper, we focus on characterizing and mitigating learning imbalances, i.e., differences in the errors occurring when classifying instances of different classes (aka class-specific risks), under MI-PLL. The phenomenon of learning imbalances has been extensively studied in the context of long-tail learning; however, the nature of MI-PLL introduces new challenges. Our contributions are as follows. From a theoretical perspective, we characterize the learning imbalances by deriving class-specific risk bounds that depend upon the function $\sigma$. Our theory reveals that learning imbalances exist in MI-PLL even when the hidden labels are uniformly distributed. On the practical side, we introduce a technique for estimating the marginal of the hidden labels using only MI-PLL data. Then, we introduce algorithms that mitigate imbalances at training- and testing-time, by treating the marginal of the hidden labels as a constraint. The first algorithm relies on a novel linear programming formulation of MI-PLL for pseudo-labeling. The second one adjusts a model's scores based on robust optimal transport. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques using strong neurosymbolic and long-tail learning baselines, discussing also open challenges.</description>

      <title>Identification of Average Causal Effects in Confounded Additive Noise Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additive noise models (ANMs) are an important setting studied in causal inference. Most of the existing works on ANMs assume causal sufficiency, i.e., there are no unobserved confounders. This paper focuses on confounded ANMs, where a set of treatment variables and a target variable are affected by an unobserved confounder that follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We introduce a novel approach for estimating the average causal effects (ACEs) of any subset of the treatment variables on the outcome and demonstrate that a small set of interventional distributions is sufficient to estimate all of them. In addition, we propose a randomized algorithm that further reduces the number of required interventions to poly-logarithmic in the number of nodes. Finally, we demonstrate that these interventions are also sufficient to recover the causal structure between the observed variables. This establishes that a poly-logarithmic number of interventions is sufficient to infer the causal effects of any subset of treatments on the outcome in confounded ANMs with high probability, even when the causal structure between treatments is unknown. The simulation results indicate that our method can accurately estimate all ACEs in the finite-sample regime. We also demonstrate the practical significance of our algorithm by evaluating it on semi-synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Have ASkotch: Fast Methods for Large-scale, Memory-constrained Kernel Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a fundamental computational tool, appearing in problems that range from computational chemistry to health analytics, with a particular interest due to its starring role in Gaussian process regression. However, it is challenging to scale KRR solvers to large datasets: with $n$ training points, a direct solver (i.e., Cholesky decomposition) uses $O(n^2)$ storage and $O(n^3)$ flops. Iterative methods for KRR, such as preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG), avoid the cubic scaling of direct solvers and often use low-rank preconditioners; a rank $r$ preconditioner uses $O(rn)$ storage and each iteration requires $O(n^2)$ flops. To reduce the storage and iteration complexity of iterative solvers for KRR, we propose ASkotch ($\textbf{A}$ccelerated $\textbf{s}$calable $\textbf{k}$ernel $\textbf{o}$p$\textbf{t}$imization using block $\textbf{c}$oordinate descent with $\textbf{H}$essian preconditioning). For a given block size $|b| &lt;&lt; n$, each iteration of ASkotch uses $O(r|b| + n)$ storage and $O(n|b|)$ flops, so ASkotch scales better than Cholesky decomposition and PCG. We prove that ASkotch obtains linear convergence to the optimum, with the convergence rate depending on the square roots of the $\textit{preconditioned}$ block condition numbers. Furthermore, we solve KRR problems that were considered to be impossibly large while using limited computational resources: we show that ASkotch outperforms PCG methods with respect to generalization error on large-scale KRR (up to $n = 10^8$) and KRR classification tasks (up to $n = 10^7$) while running each of our experiments on $\textit{a single 12 GB Titan V GPU}$. Our work opens up the possibility of as-yet-unimagined applications of KRR across a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Learning to Steer Markovian Agents under Model Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing incentives for an adapting population is a ubiquitous problem in a wide array of economic applications and beyond. In this work, we study how to design additional rewards to steer multi-agent systems towards desired policies \emph{without} prior knowledge of the agents' underlying learning dynamics. We introduce a model-based non-episodic Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation for our steering problem. Importantly, we focus on learning a \emph{history-dependent} steering strategy to handle the inherent model uncertainty about the agents' learning dynamics. We introduce a novel objective function to encode the desiderata of achieving a good steering outcome with reasonable cost. Theoretically, we identify conditions for the existence of steering strategies to guide agents to the desired policies. Complementing our theoretical contributions, we provide empirical algorithms to approximately solve our objective, which effectively tackles the challenge in learning history-dependent strategies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical evaluations.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Neural Network for Vegetation Phenotyping with Visualization of Trait-Based Spectral Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plant phenotyping is the assessment of a plant's traits and plant identification is the process of determining the category such as genus and species. In this paper we present an interpretable neural network trained on the UPWINS spectral library which contains spectra with rich metadata across variation in species, health, growth stage, annual variation, and environmental conditions for 13 selected indicator species and natural common background species. We show that the neurons in the network learn spectral indicators for chemical and physiological traits through visualization of the network weights, and we show how these traits are combined by the network for species identification with an accuracy around 90% on a test set. While neural networks are often perceived as `black box' classifiers, our work shows that they can be in fact more explainable and informative than other machine learning methods. We show that the neurons learn fundamental traits about the vegetation, for example the composition of different types of chlorophyll present which indicates species as well as response to illumination conditions. There is clear excess training capacity in our network, and we expect that as the UPWINS spectral library continues to grow the approach in this paper will provide further foundational insights in understanding plant traits. This provides a methodology for designing and interpreting neural networks on spectral data in general, and provides a framework for using neural networks with hyperspectral imagery for understanding vegetation that is extendable to other domains.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated perspective on robustness in regression. Specifically, we examine the relationship between traditional outlier-resistant robust estimation and robust optimization, which focuses on parameter estimation resistant to imaginary dataset-perturbations. While both are commonly regarded as robust methods, these concepts demonstrate a bias-variance trade-off, indicating that they follow roughly converse strategies.</description>

      <title>Inference at the data's edge: Gaussian processes for modeling and inference under model-dependency, poor overlap, and extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaussian Process (GP) is a highly flexible non-linear regression approach that provides a principled approach to handling our uncertainty over predicted (counterfactual) values. It does so by computing a posterior distribution over predicted point as a function of a chosen model space and the observed data, in contrast to conventional approaches that effectively compute uncertainty estimates conditionally on placing full faith in a fitted model. This is especially valuable under conditions of extrapolation or weak overlap, where model dependency poses a severe threat. We first offer an accessible explanation of GPs, and provide an implementation suitable to social science inference problems. In doing so we reduce the number of user-chosen hyperparameters from three to zero. We then illustrate the settings in which GPs can be most valuable: those where conventional approaches have poor properties due to model-dependency/extrapolation in data-sparse regions. Specifically, we apply it to (i) comparisons in which treated and control groups have poor covariate overlap; (ii) interrupted time-series designs, where models are fitted prior to an event by extrapolated after it; and (iii) regression discontinuity, which depends on model estimates taken at or just beyond the edge of their supporting data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation where hidden confounders are present, with a focus on two settings: instrumental variable regression with additional observed confounders, and proxy causal learning. Our approach uses a singular value decomposition of a conditional expectation operator, followed by a saddle-point optimization problem, which, in the context of IV regression, can be thought of as a neural net generalization of the seminal approach due to Darolles et al. [2011]. Saddle-point formulations have gathered considerable attention recently, as they can avoid double sampling bias and are amenable to modern function approximation methods. We provide experimental validation in various settings, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods on common benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Robust Elliptical Slice Sampling Implementation for Linearly Truncated Multivariate Normal Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elliptical slice sampling, when adapted to linearly truncated multivariate normal distributions, is a rejection-free Markov chain Monte Carlo method. At its core, it requires analytically constructing an ellipse-polytope intersection. The main novelty of this paper is an algorithm that computes this intersection in $\mathcal{O}(m \log m)$ time, where $m$ is the number of linear inequality constraints representing the polytope. We show that an implementation based on this algorithm enhances numerical stability, speeds up running time, and is easy to parallelize for launching multiple Markov chains.</description>

      <title>AdapTable: Test-Time Adaptation for Tabular Data via Shift-Aware Uncertainty Calibrator and Label Distribution Handler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, tabular data often suffer from distribution shifts due to their widespread and abundant nature, leading to erroneous predictions of pre-trained machine learning models. However, addressing such distribution shifts in the tabular domain has been relatively underexplored due to unique challenges such as varying attributes and dataset sizes, as well as the limited representation learning capabilities of deep learning models for tabular data. Particularly, with the recent promising paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA), where we adapt the off-the-shelf model to the unlabeled target domain during the inference phase without accessing the source domain, we observe that directly adopting commonly used TTA methods from other domains often leads to model collapse. We systematically explore challenges in tabular data test-time adaptation, including skewed entropy, complex latent space decision boundaries, confidence calibration issues with both overconfident and under-confident, and model bias towards source label distributions along with class imbalances. Based on these insights, we introduce AdapTable, a novel tabular test-time adaptation method that directly modifies output probabilities by estimating target label distributions and adjusting initial probabilities based on calibrated uncertainty. Extensive experiments on both natural distribution shifts and synthetic corruptions demonstrate the adaptation efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>SLIP: Securing LLMs IP Using Weights Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently seen widespread adoption, in both academia and industry. As these models grow, they become valuable intellectual property (IP), reflecting enormous investments by their owners. Moreover, the high cost of cloud-based deployment has driven interest towards deployment to edge devices, yet this risks exposing valuable parameters to theft and unauthorized use. Current methods to protect models' IP on the edge have limitations in terms of practicality, loss in accuracy, or suitability to requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid inference algorithm, named SLIP, designed to protect edge-deployed models from theft. SLIP is the first hybrid protocol that is both practical for real-world applications and provably secure, while having zero accuracy degradation and minimal impact on latency. It involves partitioning the model between two computing resources, one secure but expensive, and another cost-effective but vulnerable. This is achieved through matrix decomposition, ensuring that the secure resource retains a maximally sensitive portion of the model's IP while performing a minimal amount of computations, and vice versa for the vulnerable resource. Importantly, the protocol includes security guarantees that prevent attackers from exploiting the partition to infer the secured information. Finally, we present experimental results that show the robustness and effectiveness of our method, positioning it as a compelling solution for protecting LLMs.</description>

      <title>A unified theory and statistical learning approach for traffic conflict detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a unified theory and statistical learning approach for traffic conflict detection, addressing the long-existing call for a consistent and comprehensive methodology to evaluate the collision risk emerged in road user interactions. The proposed theory assumes a context-dependent probabilistic collision risk and frames conflict detection as estimating the risk by statistical learning from observed proximities and contextual variables. Three primary tasks are integrated: representing interaction context from selected observables, inferring proximity distributions in different contexts, and applying extreme value theory to relate conflict intensity with conflict probability. As a result, this methodology is adaptable to various road users and interaction scenarios, enhancing its applicability without the need for pre-labelled conflict data. Demonstration experiments are executed using real-world trajectory data, with the unified metric trained on lane-changing interactions on German highways and applied to near-crash events from the 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study in the U.S. The experiments demonstrate the methodology's ability to provide effective collision warnings, generalise across different datasets and traffic environments, cover a broad range of conflicts, and deliver a long-tailed distribution of conflict intensity. This study contributes to traffic safety by offering a consistent and explainable methodology for conflict detection applicable across various scenarios. Its societal implications include enhanced safety evaluations of traffic infrastructures, more effective collision warning systems for autonomous and driving assistance systems, and a deeper understanding of road user behaviour in different traffic conditions, contributing to a potential reduction in accident rates and improving overall traffic safety.</description>

      <title>Scientific Inference With Interpretable Machine Learning: Analyzing Models to Learn About Real-World Phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To learn about real world phenomena, scientists have traditionally used models with clearly interpretable elements. However, modern machine learning (ML) models, while powerful predictors, lack this direct elementwise interpretability (e.g. neural network weights). Interpretable machine learning (IML) offers a solution by analyzing models holistically to derive interpretations. Yet, current IML research is focused on auditing ML models rather than leveraging them for scientific inference. Our work bridges this gap, presenting a framework for designing IML methods-termed 'property descriptors' -- that illuminate not just the model, but also the phenomenon it represents. We demonstrate that property descriptors, grounded in statistical learning theory, can effectively reveal relevant properties of the joint probability distribution of the observational data. We identify existing IML methods suited for scientific inference and provide a guide for developing new descriptors with quantified epistemic uncertainty. Our framework empowers scientists to harness ML models for inference, and provides directions for future IML research to support scientific understanding.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Generative Models for Time-Varying Treatments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15742v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the counterfactual outcome of treatment is essential for decision-making in public health and clinical science, among others. Often, treatments are administered in a sequential, time-varying manner, leading to an exponentially increased number of possible counterfactual outcomes. Furthermore, in modern applications, the outcomes are high-dimensional and conventional average treatment effect estimation fails to capture disparities in individuals. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel conditional generative framework capable of producing counterfactual samples under time-varying treatment, without the need for explicit density estimation. Our method carefully addresses the distribution mismatch between the observed and counterfactual distributions via a loss function based on inverse probability re-weighting, and supports integration with state-of-the-art conditional generative models such as the guided diffusion and conditional variational autoencoder. We present a thorough evaluation of our method using both synthetic and real-world data. Our results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating high-quality counterfactual samples and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Low-Precision Sampling via Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-precision training has emerged as a promising low-cost technique to enhance the training efficiency of deep neural networks without sacrificing much accuracy. Its Bayesian counterpart can further provide uncertainty quantification and improved generalization accuracy. This paper investigates low-precision sampling via Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) with low-precision and full-precision gradient accumulators for both strongly log-concave and non-log-concave distributions. Theoretically, our results show that, to achieve $\epsilon$-error in the 2-Wasserstein distance for non-log-concave distributions, low-precision SGHMC achieves quadratic improvement ($\widetilde{\mathbf{O}}\left({\epsilon^{-2}{\mu^*}^{-2}\log^2\left({\epsilon^{-1}}\right)}\right)$) compared to the state-of-the-art low-precision sampler, Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) ($\widetilde{\mathbf{O}}\left({{\epsilon}^{-4}{\lambda^{*}}^{-1}\log^5\left({\epsilon^{-1}}\right)}\right)$). Moreover, we prove that low-precision SGHMC is more robust to the quantization error compared to low-precision SGLD due to the robustness of the momentum-based update w.r.t. gradient noise. Empirically, we conduct experiments on synthetic data, and {MNIST, CIFAR-10 \&amp; CIFAR-100} datasets, which validate our theoretical findings. Our study highlights the potential of low-precision SGHMC as an efficient and accurate sampling method for large-scale and resource-limited machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Recently, numerous tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD)-based tensor recovery methods have shown promise in processing visual data, such as color images and videos. However, these methods often suffer from severe performance degradation when confronted with tensor data exhibiting non-smooth changes. It has been commonly observed in real-world scenarios but ignored by the traditional t-SVD-based methods. In this work, we introduce a novel tensor recovery model with a learnable tensor nuclear norm to address such a challenge. We develop a new optimization algorithm named the Alternating Proximal Multiplier Method (APMM) to iteratively solve the proposed tensor completion model. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the convergence of the proposed APMM to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the optimization problem. In addition, we propose a multi-objective tensor recovery framework based on APMM to efficiently explore the correlations of tensor data across its various dimensions, providing a new perspective on extending the t-SVD-based method to higher-order tensor cases. Numerical experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in tensor completion.</description>

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) is a class of machine learning models that approximate the time derivative of hidden states using a neural network. They are powerful tools for modeling continuous-time dynamical systems, enabling the analysis and prediction of complex temporal behaviors. However, how to improve the model's stability and physical interpretability remains a challenge. This paper introduces new conservation relations in Neural ODEs using Lie symmetries in both the hidden state dynamics and the back propagation dynamics. These conservation laws are then incorporated into the loss function as additional regularization terms, potentially enhancing the physical interpretability and generalizability of the model. To illustrate this method, the paper derives Lie symmetries and conservation laws in a simple Neural ODE designed to monitor charged particles in a sinusoidal electric field. New loss functions are constructed from these conservation relations, demonstrating the applicability symmetry-regularized Neural ODE in typical modeling tasks, such as data-driven discovery of dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) stands out as a robust framework for uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability of predictions. However, common CP methods heavily rely on data exchangeability, a condition often violated in practice. Existing approaches for tackling non-exchangeability lead to methods that are not computable beyond the simplest examples. This work introduces a new efficient approach to CP that produces provably valid confidence sets for fairly general non-exchangeable data distributions. We illustrate the general theory with applications to the challenging setting of federated learning under data heterogeneity between agents. Our method allows constructing provably valid personalized prediction sets for agents in a fully federated way. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in a series of experiments on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Stable generative modeling using Schr\"odinger bridges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from an unknown distribution for which only a sufficiently large number of training samples are available. Such settings have recently drawn considerable interest in the context of generative modelling and Bayesian inference. In this paper, we propose a generative model combining Schr\"odinger bridges and Langevin dynamics. Schr\"odinger bridges over an appropriate reversible reference process are used to approximate the conditional transition probability from the available training samples, which is then implemented in a discrete-time reversible Langevin sampler to generate new samples. By setting the kernel bandwidth in the reference process to match the time step size used in the unadjusted Langevin algorithm, our method effectively circumvents any stability issues typically associated with the time-stepping of stiff stochastic differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a novel split-step scheme, ensuring that the generated samples remain within the convex hull of the training samples. Our framework can be naturally extended to generate conditional samples and to Bayesian inference problems. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme through experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing dimensions and on a stochastic subgrid-scale parametrization conditional sampling problem.</description>

Abstract: Contrasts with existing works which all consider nodes as functions and use edges to represent the relationships between different functions. We target at network modeling whose edges are functional data and transform the adjacency matrix into a functional adjacency tensor, introducing an additional dimension dedicated to function representation. Tucker functional decomposition is used for the functional adjacency tensor, and to further consider the community between nodes, we regularize the basis matrices to be symmetrical. Furthermore, to deal with irregular observations of the functional edges, we conduct model inference to solve a tensor completion problem. It is optimized by a Riemann conjugate gradient descent method. Besides these, we also derive several theorems to show the desirable properties of the functional edged network model. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of our proposed model using simulation data and real metro system data from Hong Kong and Singapore.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling by Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper approaches the unsupervised learning problem by minimizing the second-order Wasserstein loss (the $W_2$ loss) through a distribution-dependent ordinary differential equation (ODE), whose dynamics involves the Kantorovich potential associated with the true data distribution and a current estimate of it. A main result shows that the time-marginal laws of the ODE form a gradient flow for the $W_2$ loss, which converges exponentially to the true data distribution. An Euler scheme for the ODE is proposed and it is shown to recover the gradient flow for the $W_2$ loss in the limit. An algorithm is designed by following the scheme and applying persistent training, which naturally fits our gradient-flow approach. In both low- and high-dimensional experiments, our algorithm outperforms Wasserstein generative adversarial networks by increasing the level of persistent training appropriately.</description>

      <title>Density Estimation via Binless Multidimensional Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Binless Multidimensional Thermodynamic Integration (BMTI) method for nonparametric, robust, and data-efficient density estimation. BMTI estimates the logarithm of the density by initially computing log-density differences between neighbouring data points. Subsequently, such differences are integrated, weighted by their associated uncertainties, using a maximum-likelihood formulation. This procedure can be seen as an extension to a multidimensional setting of the thermodynamic integration, a technique developed in statistical physics. The method leverages the manifold hypothesis, estimating quantities within the intrinsic data manifold without defining an explicit coordinate map. It does not rely on any binning or space partitioning, but rather on the construction of a neighbourhood graph based on an adaptive bandwidth selection procedure. BMTI mitigates the limitations commonly associated with traditional nonparametric density estimators, effectively reconstructing smooth profiles even in high-dimensional embedding spaces. The method is tested on a variety of complex synthetic high-dimensional datasets, where it is shown to outperform traditional estimators, and is benchmarked on realistic datasets from the chemical physics literature.</description>

      <title>Factorized Fusion Shrinkage for Dynamic Relational Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern data science applications often involve complex relational data with dynamic structures. An abrupt change in such dynamic relational data is typically observed in systems that undergo regime changes due to interventions. In such a case, we consider a factorized fusion shrinkage model in which all decomposed factors are dynamically shrunk towards group-wise fusion structures, where the shrinkage is obtained by applying global-local shrinkage priors to the successive differences of the row vectors of the factorized matrices. The proposed priors enjoy many favorable properties in comparison and clustering of the estimated dynamic latent factors. Comparing estimated latent factors involves both adjacent and long-term comparisons, with the time range of comparison considered as a variable. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the posterior distribution attains the minimax optimal rate up to logarithmic factors. In terms of computation, we present a structured mean-field variational inference framework that balances optimal posterior inference with computational scalability, exploiting both the dependence among components and across time. The framework can accommodate a wide variety of models, including dynamic matrix factorization, latent space models for networks and low-rank tensors. The effectiveness of our methodology is demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world data analysis.</description>

      <title>Lightning Fast Video Anomaly Detection via Adversarial Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a very fast frame-level model for anomaly detection in video, which learns to detect anomalies by distilling knowledge from multiple highly accurate object-level teacher models. To improve the fidelity of our student, we distill the low-resolution anomaly maps of the teachers by jointly applying standard and adversarial distillation, introducing an adversarial discriminator for each teacher to distinguish between target and generated anomaly maps. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks (Avenue, ShanghaiTech, UCSD Ped2), showing that our method is over 7 times faster than the fastest competing method, and between 28 and 62 times faster than object-centric models, while obtaining comparable results to recent methods. Our evaluation also indicates that our model achieves the best trade-off between speed and accuracy, due to its previously unheard-of speed of 1480 FPS. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive ablation study to justify our architectural design choices. Our code is freely available at: https://github.com/ristea/fast-aed.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Uncertainty Quantification Methods for Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in making accurate predictions for computer vision, natural language processing, as well as science and engineering domains. However, it is also well-recognized that DNNs sometimes make unexpected, incorrect, but overconfident predictions. This can cause serious consequences in high-stake applications, such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and disaster response. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) aims to estimate the confidence of DNN predictions beyond prediction accuracy. In recent years, many UQ methods have been developed for DNNs. It is of great practical value to systematically categorize these UQ methods and compare their advantages and disadvantages. However, existing surveys mostly focus on categorizing UQ methodologies from a neural network architecture perspective or a Bayesian perspective and ignore the source of uncertainty that each methodology can incorporate, making it difficult to select an appropriate UQ method in practice. To fill the gap, this paper presents a systematic taxonomy of UQ methods for DNNs based on the types of uncertainty sources (data uncertainty versus model uncertainty). We summarize the advantages and disadvantages of methods in each category. We show how our taxonomy of UQ methodologies can potentially help guide the choice of UQ method in different machine learning problems (e.g., active learning, robustness, and reinforcement learning). We also identify current research gaps and propose several future research directions.</description>

      <title>On Learning Latent Models with Multi-Instance Weak Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a weakly supervised learning scenario where the supervision signal is generated by a transition function $\sigma$ of labels associated with multiple input instances. We formulate this problem as \emph{multi-instance Partial Label Learning (multi-instance PLL)}, which is an extension to the standard PLL problem. Our problem is met in different fields, including latent structural learning and neuro-symbolic integration. Despite the existence of many learning techniques, limited theoretical analysis has been dedicated to this problem. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical study of multi-instance PLL with possibly an unknown transition $\sigma$. Our main contributions are as follows. Firstly, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition for the learnability of the problem. This condition non-trivially generalizes and relaxes the existing small ambiguity degree in the PLL literature, since we allow the transition to be deterministic. Secondly, we derive Rademacher-style error bounds based on a top-$k$ surrogate loss that is widely used in the neuro-symbolic literature. Furthermore, we conclude with empirical experiments for learning under unknown transitions. The empirical results align with our theoretical findings; however, they also expose the issue of scalability in the weak supervision literature.</description>

      <title>UTOPIA: Universally Trainable Optimal Prediction Intervals Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in prediction presents a compelling challenge with vast applications across various domains, including biomedical science, economics, and weather forecasting. There exists a wide array of methods for constructing prediction intervals, such as quantile regression and conformal prediction. However, practitioners often face the challenge of selecting the most suitable method for a specific real-world data problem. In response to this dilemma, we introduce a novel and universally applicable strategy called Universally Trainable Optimal Predictive Intervals Aggregation (UTOPIA). This technique excels in efficiently aggregating multiple prediction intervals while maintaining a small average width of the prediction band and ensuring coverage. UTOPIA is grounded in linear or convex programming, making it straightforward to train and implement. In the specific case where the prediction methods are elementary basis functions, as in kernel and spline bases, our method becomes the construction of a prediction band. Our proposed methodologies are supported by theoretical guarantees on the coverage probability and the average width of the aggregated prediction interval, which are detailed in this paper. The practicality and effectiveness of UTOPIA are further validated through its application to synthetic data and two real-world datasets in finance and macroeconomics.</description>

      <title>21cmEMU: an emulator of 21cmFAST summary observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). These have enabled high-dimensional inference of galaxy and intergalactic medium (IGM) properties during the first billion years of our Universe. However, even using efficient, semi-numerical simulations, traditional inference approaches that compute 3D lightcones on-the-fly can take $10^5$ core hours. Here we present 21cmEMU: an emulator of several summary observables from the popular 21cmFAST simulation code. 21cmEMU takes as input nine parameters characterizing EoR galaxies, and outputs the following summary statistics: (i) the IGM mean neutral fraction; (ii) the 21-cm power spectrum; (iii) the mean 21-cm spin temperature; (iv) the sky-averaged (global) 21-cm signal; (v) the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LFs); and (vi) the Thomson scattering optical depth to the cosmic microwave background (CMB). All observables are predicted with sub-percent median accuracy, with a reduction of the computational cost by a factor of over 10$^4$. After validating inference results, we showcase a few applications, including: (i) quantifying the relative constraining power of different observational datasets; (ii) seeing how recent claims of a late EoR impact previous inferences; and (iii) forecasting upcoming constraints from the sixth observing season of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope. 21cmEMU is publicly-available, and is included as an alternative simulator in the public 21CMMC sampler.</description>

      <title>Quantifying predictive uncertainty of aphasia severity in stroke patients with sparse heteroscedastic Bayesian high-dimensional regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08783v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse linear regression methods for high-dimensional data commonly assume that residuals have constant variance, which can be violated in practice. For example, Aphasia Quotient (AQ) is a critical measure of language impairment and informs treatment decisions, but it is challenging to measure in stroke patients. It is of interest to use high-resolution T2 neuroimages of brain damage to predict AQ. However, sparse regression models show marked evidence of heteroscedastic error even after transformations are applied. This violation of the homoscedasticity assumption can lead to bias in estimated coefficients, prediction intervals (PI) with improper length, and increased type I errors. Bayesian heteroscedastic linear regression models relax the homoscedastic error assumption but can enforce restrictive prior assumptions on parameters, and many are computationally infeasible in the high-dimensional setting. This paper proposes estimating high-dimensional heteroscedastic linear regression models using a heteroscedastic partitioned empirical Bayes Expectation Conditional Maximization (H-PROBE) algorithm. H-PROBE is a computationally efficient maximum a posteriori estimation approach that requires minimal prior assumptions and can incorporate covariates hypothesized to impact heterogeneity. We apply this method by using high-dimensional neuroimages to predict and provide PIs for AQ that accurately quantify predictive uncertainty. Our analysis demonstrates that H-PROBE can provide narrower PI widths than standard methods without sacrificing coverage. Narrower PIs are clinically important for determining the risk of moderate to severe aphasia. Additionally, through extensive simulation studies, we exhibit that H-PROBE results in superior prediction, variable selection, and predictive inference compared to alternative methods.</description>

Abstract: We present a method of parameter estimation for large class of nonlinear systems, namely those in which the state consists of output derivatives and the flow is linear in the parameter. The method, which solves for the unknown parameter by directly inverting the dynamics using regularized linear regression, is based on new design and analysis ideas for differentiation filtering and regularized least squares. Combined in series, they yield a novel finite-sample bound on mean absolute error of estimation.</description>

      <title>Learning Distributions on Manifolds with Free-form Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Manifold Free-Form Flows (M-FFF), a simple new generative model for data on manifolds. The existing approaches to learning a distribution on arbitrary manifolds are expensive at inference time, since sampling requires solving a differential equation. Our method overcomes this limitation by sampling in a single function evaluation. The key innovation is to optimize a neural network via maximum likelihood on the manifold, possible by adapting the free-form flow framework to Riemannian manifolds. M-FFF is straightforwardly adapted to any manifold with a known projection. It consistently matches or outperforms previous single-step methods specialized to specific manifolds, and is competitive with multi-step methods with typically two orders of magnitude faster inference speed. We make our code public at https://github.com/vislearn/FFF.</description>

Abstract: Off-dynamics Reinforcement Learning (ODRL) seeks to transfer a policy from a source environment to a target environment characterized by distinct yet similar dynamics. In this context, traditional RL agents depend excessively on the dynamics of the source environment, resulting in the discovery of policies that excel in this environment but fail to provide reasonable performance in the target one. In the few-shot framework, a limited number of transitions from the target environment are introduced to facilitate a more effective transfer. Addressing this challenge, we propose an innovative approach inspired by recent advancements in Imitation Learning and conservative RL algorithms. The proposed method introduces a penalty to regulate the trajectories generated by the source-trained policy. We evaluate our method across various environments representing diverse off-dynamics conditions, where access to the target environment is extremely limited. These experiments include high-dimensional systems relevant to real-world applications. Across most tested scenarios, our proposed method demonstrates performance improvements compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>BiSHop: Bi-Directional Cellular Learning for Tabular Data with Generalized Sparse Modern Hopfield Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the \textbf{B}i-Directional \textbf{S}parse \textbf{Hop}field Network (\textbf{BiSHop}), a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning. BiSHop handles the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the recent established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms. Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules. Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with adaptable sparsity. Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each scale. Empirically, through experiments on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.</description>

      <title>All-in-one simulation-based inference</title>

Abstract: Amortized Bayesian inference trains neural networks to solve stochastic inference problems using model simulations, thereby making it possible to rapidly perform Bayesian inference for any newly observed data. However, current simulation-based amortized inference methods are simulation-hungry and inflexible: They require the specification of a fixed parametric prior, simulator, and inference tasks ahead of time. Here, we present a new amortized inference method -- the Simformer -- which overcomes these limitations. By training a probabilistic diffusion model with transformer architectures, the Simformer outperforms current state-of-the-art amortized inference approaches on benchmark tasks and is substantially more flexible: It can be applied to models with function-valued parameters, it can handle inference scenarios with missing or unstructured data, and it can sample arbitrary conditionals of the joint distribution of parameters and data, including both posterior and likelihood. We showcase the performance and flexibility of the Simformer on simulators from ecology, epidemiology, and neuroscience, and demonstrate that it opens up new possibilities and application domains for amortized Bayesian inference on simulation-based models.</description>

      <title>Towards noise contrastive estimation with soft targets for conditional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft targets combined with the cross-entropy loss have shown to improve generalization performance of deep neural networks on supervised classification tasks. The standard cross-entropy loss however assumes data to be categorically distributed, which may often not be the case in practice. In contrast, InfoNCE does not rely on such an explicit assumption but instead implicitly estimates the true conditional through negative sampling. Unfortunately, it cannot be combined with soft targets in its standard formulation, hindering its use in combination with sophisticated training strategies. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a loss function that is compatible with probabilistic targets. Our new soft target InfoNCE loss is conceptually simple, efficient to compute, and can be motivated through the framework of noise contrastive estimation. Using a toy example, we demonstrate shortcomings of the categorical distribution assumption of cross-entropy, and discuss implications of sampling from soft distributions. We observe that soft target InfoNCE performs on par with strong soft target cross-entropy baselines and outperforms hard target NLL and InfoNCE losses on popular benchmarks, including ImageNet. Finally, we provide a simple implementation of our loss, geared towards supervised classification and fully compatible with deep classification models trained with cross-entropy.</description>

      <title>GIST: Gibbs self-tuning for locally adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel and flexible framework for localized tuning of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samplers by Gibbs sampling the algorithm's tuning parameters conditionally based on the position and momentum at each step. For adaptively sampling path lengths, the framework encompasses randomized HMC, multinomial HMC, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), and the Apogee-to-Apogee Path Sampler as special cases. The Gibbs self-tuning (GIST) framework is illustrated with an alternative to NUTS for locally adapting path lengths, evaluated with an exact Hamiltonian for an ill-conditioned normal and with the leapfrog algorithm for a test suite of diverse models.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable model for emergence and scaling laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models can exhibit what appears to be a sudden ability to solve a new problem as training time, training data, or model size increases, a phenomenon known as emergence. In this paper, we present a framework where each new ability (a skill) is represented as a basis function. We solve a simple multi-linear model in this skill-basis, finding analytic expressions for the emergence of new skills, as well as for scaling laws of the loss with training time, data size, model size, and optimal compute ($C$). We compare our detailed calculations to direct simulations of a two-layer neural network trained on multitask sparse parity, where the tasks in the dataset are distributed according to a power-law. Our simple model captures, using a single fit parameter, the sigmoidal emergence of multiple new skills as training time, data size or model size increases in the neural network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We leverage the framework of hyperplane arrangements to analyze potential regions of (stable) fixed points. We provide an upper bound on the number of fixed points for multi-layer neural networks equipped with piecewise linear (PWL) activation functions with arbitrary many linear pieces. The theoretical optimality of the exponential growth in the number of layers of the latter bound is shown. Specifically, we also derive a sharper upper bound on the number of stable fixed points for one-hidden-layer networks with hard tanh activation.</description>

      <title>Scalarisation-based risk concepts for robust multi-objective optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust optimisation is a well-established framework for optimising functions in the presence of uncertainty. The inherent goal of this problem is to identify a collection of inputs whose outputs are both desirable for the decision maker, whilst also being robust to the underlying uncertainties in the problem. In this work, we study the multi-objective case of this problem. We identify that the majority of all robust multi-objective algorithms rely on two key operations: robustification and scalarisation. Robustification refers to the strategy that is used to account for the uncertainty in the problem. Scalarisation refers to the procedure that is used to encode the relative importance of each objective to a scalar-valued reward. As these operations are not necessarily commutative, the order that they are performed in has an impact on the resulting solutions that are identified and the final decisions that are made. The purpose of this work is to give a thorough exposition on the effects of these different orderings and in particular highlight when one should opt for one ordering over the other. As part of our analysis, we showcase how many existing risk concepts can be integrated into the specification and solution of a robust multi-objective optimisation problem. Besides this, we also demonstrate how one can principally define the notion of a robust Pareto front and a robust performance metric based on our ``robustify and scalarise'' methodology. To illustrate the efficacy of these new ideas, we present two insightful case studies which are based on real-world data sets.</description>

      <title>Group Projected Subspace Pursuit for Block Sparse Signal Reconstruction: Convergence Analysis and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a convergence analysis of the Group Projected Subspace Pursuit (GPSP) algorithm proposed by He et al. [HKL+23] (Group Projected subspace pursuit for IDENTification of variable coefficient differential equations (GP-IDENT), Journal of Computational Physics, 494, 112526) and extend its application to general tasks of block sparse signal recovery. We prove that when the sampling matrix satisfies the Block Restricted Isometry Property (BRIP) with a sufficiently small Block Restricted Isometry Constant (BRIC), GPSP exactly recovers the true block sparse signals. When the observations are noisy, this convergence property of GPSP remains valid if the magnitude of true signal is sufficiently large. GPSP selects the features by subspace projection criterion (SPC) for candidate inclusion and response magnitude criterion (RMC) for candidate exclusion. We compare these criteria with counterparts of other state-of-the-art greedy algorithms. Our theoretical analysis and numerical ablation studies reveal that SPC is critical to the superior performances of GPSP, and that RMC can enhance the robustness of feature identification when observations contain noises. We test and compare GPSP with other methods in diverse settings, including heterogeneous random block matrices, inexact observations, face recognition, and PDE identification. We find that GPSP outperforms the other algorithms in most cases for various levels of block sparsity and block sizes, justifying its effectiveness for general applications.</description>
