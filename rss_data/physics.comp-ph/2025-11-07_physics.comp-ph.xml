      <title>Robust Subgroup Method Using DE Algorithm for Resonance Self-Shielding Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced version of the subgroup method for resonance self-shielding treatment, termed the robust subgroup method, which integrates Robust Estimation (RE) with a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. The RE approach is employed to handle model misspecification and data contamination, while the DE algorithm serves as an optimization tool within the RE framework to obtain constrained solutions. Numerical validation against experimental benchmarks shows that the proposed method removes a systematic absorption bias in conventional subgroup fits that would otherwise depress reactivity. This bias appears only in benchmarks sensitive to U-238. Mechanistically, it reflects a threshold-like conditioning failure: strong self-shielding leverage dominates the loss and is magnified by dilution-induced multicollinearity. This adverse conditioning appears to be seeded by a narrow, sparse resonance structure at low energies in fertile even-even nuclides, thereby causing rapid self-shielding response saturation and a weak Doppler broadening. By bounding influence and enforcing feasibility within an RE-DE framework, the inferred subgroup parameters track the underlying physics more faithfully, improving the predictive fidelity of subsequent transport simulations.</description>

      <title>Novel Numerical Methods for Accurate Space Thermal Analysis: Enforcing View Factors and Modeling Diffuse Reflectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate thermal analysis is crucial for modern spacecraft, driving demand for reliable modeling tools. This research advances space thermal modeling by improving the simulation accuracy and efficiency of radiative heat transfer, the dominant mode of heat exchange in space. To this end, we incorporate diffuse reflectivity using the Gebhart method, which computes radiative exchange factors (REFs) from geometric view factors. The view factors, obtained via Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT), require post-processing to mitigate statistical errors. Critically, existing correction schemes cannot simultaneously enforce closure and reciprocity for open systems. This research addresses this gap by proposing two novel enforcement methods: (i) a least-squares optimization with non-negativity rectification (NNR) and small positive value avoidance (SPVA), and (ii) an iterative enforcement algorithm. To ensure consistency across different discretization levels, this work also introduces the multi-node surface model relations to formalize the connection between sub-face, face, and node representations of view factors and REFs. A simple case study demonstrates a substantial reduction in mean absolute error (MAE): the least-squares method achieves an 81% MAE reduction, while the iterative method offers the best balance of accuracy (56% MAE reduction) and computational efficiency. A second case study shows that including diffuse reflections decreases the steady-state temperature of a plate by $4^{\circ}C$, reinforcing that reflected radiation reduces net absorption. This work introduces and validates computationally efficient methods for integrating diffuse reflectivity into space thermal analyses and for consistently coupling multi-node surface radiative models. The results enable more accurate and robust thermal predictions for spacecraft systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Adsorption and Electronic Interactions of Drugs on 2D Graphsene: Insights from DFT and Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient identification of promising drug candidates for nanomaterial-based delivery systems is essential for advancing next-generation therapeutics. In this work, we present a synergistic framework combining density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) to explore the adsorption behavior and electronic interactions of drugs on a novel 2D graphene allotrope, termed Graphsene (GrS). Graphsene, characterized by its porous ring topology and large surface area, offers an excellent platform for efficient adsorption and strong electronic coupling with drug molecules. A dataset comprising 67 drugs adsorbed on various 2D substrates was employed to train the ML model, which was subsequently applied to predict suitable drug candidates for GrS based on molecular size and adsorption energy criteria (database link provided in a later section). The ML model exhibited robust predictive accuracy, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.075 eV upon DFT validation, though its sensitivity to initialization highlighted the need for larger and more diverse datasets. DFT-based analyses, including adsorption energetics, projected density of states (PDOS), and Bader charge calculations, revealed pronounced charge transfer and electronic coupling between the drug molecules and the GrS surface, elucidating the fundamental nature of drug-substrate interactions. The study reveals that the integrated DFT-ML strategy offers a rapid, cost-efficient approach for screening and understanding drug-nanomaterial interactions, paving the way for data-driven design of advanced nanomaterial-enabled drug delivery systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Domain-decomposed Monte Carlo Neutral Transport for Nuclear Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EIRENE [1] is a Monte Carlo neutral transport solver heavily used in the fusion community. EIRENE does not implement domain decomposition, making it impossible to use for simulations where the grid data does not fit on one compute node (see e.g. [2]). This paper presents a domain-decomposed Monte Carlo (DDMC) algorithm implemented in a new open source Monte Carlo code, Eiron. Two parallel algorithms currently used in EIRENE are also implemented in Eiron, and the three algorithms are compared by running strong scaling tests, with DDMC performing better than the other two algorithms in nearly all cases. On the supercomputer Mahti [3], DDMC strong scaling is superlinear for grids that do not fit into an L3 cache slice (4 MiB). The DDMC algorithm is also scaled up to 16384 cores in weak scaling tests, with a weak scaling efficiency of 45% in a high-collisional (heavier compute load) case, and 26% in a low-collisional (lighter compute load) case. We conclude that implementing this domain decomposition algorithm in EIRENE would improve performance and enable simulations that are currently impossible due to memory constraints.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in Physics-informed Inverse Problems: The Hidden Risk in Scientific AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates partial differential equations (PDEs) into machine learning models to solve inverse problems, such as estimating coefficient functions (e.g., the Hamiltonian function) that characterize physical systems. This framework enables data-driven understanding and prediction of complex physical phenomena. While coefficient functions in PIML are typically estimated on the basis of predictive performance, physics as a discipline does not rely solely on prediction accuracy to evaluate models. For example, Kepler's heliocentric model was favored owing to small discrepancies in planetary motion, despite its similar predictive accuracy to the geocentric model. This highlights the inherent uncertainties in data-driven model inference and the scientific importance of selecting physically meaningful solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework to quantify and analyze such uncertainties in the estimation of coefficient functions in PIML. We apply our framework to reduced model of magnetohydrodynamics and our framework shows that there are uncertainties, and unique identification is possible with geometric constraints. Finally, we confirm that we can estimate the reduced model uniquely by incorporating these constraints.</description>

      <title>Combining Harmonic Sampling with the Worm Algorithm to Improve the Efficiency of Path Integral Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an improved Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) algorithm called Harmonic PIMC (H-PIMC) and its generalization, Mixed PIMC (M-PIMC). PIMC is a powerful tool for studying quantum condensed phases. However, it often suffers from a low acceptance ratio for solids and dense confined liquids. We develop two sampling schemes especially suited for such problems by dividing the potential into its harmonic and anharmonic contributions. In H-PIMC, we generate the imaginary time paths for the harmonic part of the potential exactly and accept or reject it based on the anharmonic part. In M-PIMC, we restrict the harmonic sampling to the vicinity of local minimum and use standard PIMC otherwise, to optimize efficiency. We benchmark H-PIMC on systems with increasing anharmonicity, improving the acceptance ratio and lowering the auto-correlation time. For weakly to moderately anharmonic systems, at $\beta \hbar \omega=16$, H-PIMC improves the acceptance ratio by a factor of 6-16 and reduces the autocorrelation time by a factor of 7-30. We also find that the method requires a smaller number of imaginary time slices for convergence, which leads to another two- to four-fold acceleration. For strongly anharmonic systems, M-PIMC converges with a similar number of imaginary time slices as standard PIMC, but allows the optimization of the auto-correlation time. We extend M-PIMC to periodic systems and apply it to a sinusoidal potential. Finally, we combine H- and M-PIMC with the worm algorithm, allowing us to obtain similar efficiency gains for systems of indistinguishable particles.</description>

      <title>Friction on Demand: A Generative Framework for the Inverse Design of Metainterfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing frictional interfaces to exhibit prescribed macroscopic behavior is a challenging inverse problem, made difficult by the non-uniqueness of solutions and the computational cost of contact simulations. Traditional approaches rely on heuristic search over low-dimensional parameterizations, which limits their applicability to more complex or nonlinear friction laws. We introduce a generative modeling framework using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to infer surface topographies from target friction laws. Trained on a synthetic dataset composed of 200 million samples constructed from a parameterized contact mechanics model, the proposed method enables efficient, simulation-free generation of candidate topographies. We examine the potential and limitations of generative modeling for this inverse design task, focusing on balancing accuracy, throughput, and diversity in the generated solutions. Our results highlight trade-offs and outline practical considerations when balancing these objectives. This approach paves the way for near-real-time control of frictional behavior through tailored surface topographies.</description>

      <title>N-Mode Quantized Anharmonic Vibronic Hamiltonians for Matrix Product State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions of photochemical processes are essential for interpreting and understanding spectral features. Reliable quantum dynamics calculations of vibronic systems require precise modeling of anharmonic effects in the potential energy surfaces and off-diagonal nonadiabatic coupling terms. In this work, we present the n-mode quantization of all vibronic Hamiltonian terms comprised of general high-dimensional model representations. This results in a second-quantized framework for accurate vibronic calculations employing the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of this approach by calculating the excited state quantum dynamics of maleimide. We analyze convergence and the choice of parameters of the underlying time-dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm for the n-mode vibronic Hamiltonian, demonstrating that it enables accurate calculations of complex photochemical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Super amplification of lunar response to gravitational waves driven by thick crust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moon has been long regarded as a natural resonator of gravitational waves (GWs) since 1960, showing great potential to fill the frequency gap left behind GW detections by ground- or space-based laser interferometry. However, the spatial variation of this amplification capacity on the Moon remains unclear. Here, we numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs by fully considering the fluctuant topography and laterally heterogeneous interior structures. Our results show that most regions on the Moon can amplify GWs with a ratio over 2, a finding significantly higher than previous estimations. Particularly, the amplification ratio can even reach factors of tens at the resonant frequency of ~0.015 Hz on the highlands surrounding the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, where the regional crust is the thickest. Our findings establish the thick-crust regions as critical zones of GW amplification, which is essential for future landing site selection and instrumental setting for GW detection on the Moon.</description>

      <title>Energy transport and chaos in a one-dimensional disordered nonlinear stub lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate energy propagation in a one-dimensional stub lattice in the presence of both disorder and nonlinearity. In the periodic case, the stub lattice hosts two dispersive bands separated by a flat band; however, we show that sufficiently strong disorder fills all intermediate band gaps. By mapping the two-dimensional parameter space of disorder and nonlinearity, we identify three distinct dynamical regimes (weak chaos, strong chaos, and self-trapping) through numerical simulations of initially localized wave packets. When disorder is strong enough to close the frequency gaps, the results closely resemble those obtained in the one-dimensional disordered discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation and Klein-Gordon lattice model. In particular, subdiffusive spreading is observed in both the weak and strong chaos regimes, with the second moment $m_2$ of the norm distribution scaling as $m_2 \propto t^{0.33}$ and $m_2 \propto t^{0.5}$, respectively. The system's chaotic behavior follows a similar trend, with the finite-time maximum Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda$ decaying as $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.25}$ and $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.3}$. For moderate disorder strengths, i.e., near the point of gap closing, we find that the presence of small frequency gaps does not exert any noticeable influence on the spreading behavior. Our findings extend the characterization of nonlinear disordered lattices in both weak and strong chaos regimes to other network geometries, such as the stub lattice, which serves as a representative flat-band system.</description>

      <title>Mixed-State Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions in Imaginary-Time Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits, MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay gives rise to a new class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional dimerized Heisenberg model. Furthermore, we provide a diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional Hamiltonians. Our results highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-driven elasticity prediction in advanced inorganic materials via convolutional neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inorganic crystal materials have broad application potential due to excellent physical and chemical properties, with elastic properties (shear modulus, bulk modulus) crucial for predicting materials' electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and mechanical properties. Traditional experimental measurement suffers from high cost and low efficiency, while theoretical simulation and graph neural network-based machine learning methods--especially crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNNs)--have become effective alternatives, achieving remarkable results in predicting material elastic properties. This study trained two CGCNN models using shear modulus and bulk modulus data of 10987 materials from the Matbench v0.1 dataset, which exhibit high accuracy (mean absolute error &lt;13, coefficient of determination R-squared close to 1) and good generalization ability. Materials were screened to retain those with band gaps between 0.1-3.0 eV and exclude radioactive element-containing compounds. The final predicted dataset comprises two parts: 54359 crystal structures from the Materials Project database and 26305 crystal structures discovered by Merchant et al. (2023 Nature 624 80). Ultimately, this study completed the prediction of shear modulus and bulk modulus for 80664 inorganic crystals. This work enriches existing material elastic data resources and provides robust support for material design, with all data openly available at https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.j00213.00104.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure. Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.</description>

This paper presents machine-learning-driven reduced models for Electron Temperature Gradient (ETG) turbulence in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator. Each model predicts the ETG heat flux as a function of three plasma parameters: the normalized electron temperature radial gradient ($\omega_{T_e}$), the ratio of normalized electron temperature and density radial gradients ($\eta_e$), and the electron-to-ion temperature ratio ($\tau$). We first construct models across seven radial locations using regression and an active machine-learning-based procedure. This process initializes models using low-cardinality sparse-grid training data and then iteratively refines their training sets by selecting the most informative points from a pre-existing simulation database. We evaluate the prediction capabilities of our models using out-of-sample datasets with over $393$ points per location, and $95\%$ prediction intervals are estimated via bootstrapping to assess prediction uncertainty. We then investigate the construction of generalized reduced models, including a generic, position-independent model, and assess their heat flux prediction capabilities at three additional locations. Our models demonstrate robust performance and predictive accuracy comparable to the original reference simulations, even when applied beyond the training domain.</description>

      <title>Computational Modeling and Learning-Based Adaptive Control of Solid-Fuel Ramjets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-fuel ramjets offer a compact, energy-dense propulsion option for long-range, high-speed flight but pose significant challenges for thrust regulation due to strong nonlinearities, limited actuation authority, and complex multi-physics coupling between fuel regression, combustion, and compressible flow. This paper presents a computational and control framework that combines a computational fluid dynamics model of an SFRJ with a learning-based adaptive control approach. A CFD model incorporating heat addition was developed to characterize thrust response, establish the operational envelope, and identify the onset of inlet unstart. An adaptive proportional-integral controller, updated online using the retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC) algorithm, was then applied to regulate thrust. Closed-loop simulations demonstrate that the RCAC-based controller achieves accurate thrust regulation under both static and dynamic operating conditions, while remaining robust to variations in commands, hyperparameters, and inlet states. The results highlight the suitability of RCAC for SFRJ control, where accurate reduced-order models are challenging to obtain, and underscore the potential of learning-based adaptive control to enable robust and reliable operation of SFRJs in future air-breathing propulsion applications.</description>

      <title>The phase-field model of fracture incorporating Mohr-Coulomb, Mogi-Coulomb, and Hoek-Brown strength surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical phase-field theories of brittle fracture capture toughness-controlled crack propagation but do not account for the material's strength surface, which governs fracture nucleation in the absence of cracks. The phase-field formulation of Kumar et al. (2020) proposed a blueprint for incorporating the strength surface while preserving toughness-controlled propagation by introducing a nucleation driving force and presented results for the Drucker--Prager surface. Following this blueprint, Chockalingam (2025) recently derived a general driving-force expression that incorporates arbitrary strength surfaces. The present work implements this driving force within a finite-element framework and incorporates representative strength surfaces that span diverse mathematical and physical characteristics -- the Mohr--Coulomb, 3D Hoek--Brown, and Mogi--Coulomb surfaces. Through simulations of canonical fracture problems, the formulation is comprehensively validated across fracture regimes, capturing (i) nucleation under uniform stress, (ii) crack growth from large pre-existing flaws, and (iii) fracture governed jointly by strength and toughness. While the strength surfaces examined here already encompass a broad range of brittle materials, the results demonstrate the generality and robustness of the proposed driving-force construction for materials governed by arbitrary strength surfaces.</description>

      <title>Twist and higher modes of a complex scalar field at the threshold of collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the threshold of collapse of a massless complex scalar field in axisymmetric spacetimes under the ansatz of Choptuik et al. 2004, in which a symmetry depending on the azimuthal parameter $m$ is imposed on the scalar field. This allows for both non-vanishing twist and angular momentum. We extend earlier work to include higher angular modes. Using the pseudospectral code bamps with a new adapted symmetry reduction method, which we call $m$-cartoon, and a generalized twist-compatible apparent horizon finder, we evolve near-critical initial data to the verge of black hole formation for the lowest nontrivial modes, $m=1$ and $m=2$. For $m=1$ we recover discrete self-similarity with echoing period $\Delta\simeq0.42$ and power-law scaling with exponent $\gamma\simeq0.11$, consistent with earlier work. For $m=2$ we find that universality is maintained within this nonzero fixed-$m$ symmetry class but with smaller period and critical exponents, $\Delta\simeq0.09$ and $\gamma\simeq0.035$, establishing an explicit dependence of the critical solution on the angular mode. Analysis of the relation between the angular momentum and the mass of apparent horizons at the instant of formation, $J_{\mathrm{AH}}{-}M_{\mathrm{AH}}$, shows that the effect of angular momentum is minimal at the threshold, with $\chi_{\mathrm{AH}}=J_{\mathrm{AH}}/M_{\mathrm{AH}}^2\to0$, and, therefore, excludes extremal black holes for the families under consideration. Our results demonstrate that while universality and DSS hold within each $m$-sector, the critical universal values vary with $m$, and neither extremality nor bifurcation occur in the complex scalar field model within the families considered here.</description>

      <title>KGB-evolution: a relativistic $N$-body code for kinetic gravity braiding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present KGB-evolution, a relativistic $N$-body simulation code that extends the $k$-evolution code by incorporating an effective field theory parameterization of kinetic gravity braiding, while also including the $k$-essence model as a limiting case. As a first step, we implement the linearized dark energy stress-energy tensor and scalar field equations, providing the groundwork for a future full Horndeski theory extension. We validate KGB-evolution by comparing its power spectra against linear predictions from hi$\_$class, finding excellent agreement on large scales at low redshifts and over all scales at high redshifts. We demonstrate that nonlinear growth of matter and metric perturbations on small scales drives the linearized dark energy field into a nonlinear clustering regime, which in turn feeds back on the growth of cosmic structure. In contrast to the $k$-essence limit, a nonzero braiding considerably amplifies this backreaction, producing a significantly stronger alteration of structure formation in the kinetic gravity braiding model.</description>

      <title>BIGSTICK: A flexible configuration-interaction shell-model code (updated)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present BIGSTICK, a flexible configuration-interaction open-source shell-model code for the many-fermion problem. Written mostly in Fortran 90 with some later extensions, BIGSTICK utilizes a factorized on-the-fly algorithm for computing many-body matrix elements, and has both MPI (distributed memory) and OpenMP (shared memory) parallelization, and can run on platforms ranging from laptops to the largest parallel supercomputers. It uses a flexible yet efficient many-body truncation scheme, and reads input files in multiple formats, allowing one to tackle both phenomenological (major valence shell space) and ab initio (the so-called no-core shell model) calculations. BIGSTICK can generate energy spectra, static and transition one-body densities, and expectation values of scalar operators. Using the built-in Lanczos algorithm one can compute transition probability distributions and decompose wave functions into components defined by group theory.
  This manual provides a general guide to compiling and running BIGSTICK, which comes with numerous sample input files, as well as some of the basic theory underlying the code. Updated November 2025 to version 8.0.0</description>

      <title>Boron Nitride Nanotubes as Efficient Surface Absorbers for Air Pollutant Gas Molecules: Insights from Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates into the adsorption sensing capabilities of single-walled (5,5) boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) towards environmental pollutant gas molecules, including CH2, SO2, NH3, H2Se, CO2 and CS2. Employing a linear combination of atomic orbital density functional theory (DFT) and spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the investigation reveals the nanotube's robust adsorption behavior without compromising its structural integrity. Thermodynamic and chemical parameters, such as adsorption energy, HOMO-LUMO gap, vertical ionization energy, and vertical electron affinity, highlight the (5,5) BNNTs' potential as efficient absorbents for pollutant molecules. Infrared spectroscopy confirms the formation of distinct BNNT-gas complexes. These findings underscore the promising application of BN nanotubes as absorbents for common gaseous pollutants, essential for developing sensors to enhance indoor air quality.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18148v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Neural Galerkin Method for Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a loss function that enforces the Schr\"odinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics and enables bounding the error with the exact evolution via the global loss function. We showcase the method by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D, uncovering signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, our method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches, while unlocking previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Implementation of integral surface tension formulations in a volume of fluid framework and their applications to Marangoni flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate numerical modeling of surface tension has been a challenging aspect of multiphase flow simulations. The integral formulation for modeling surface tension forces is known to be consistent and conservative, and to be a natural choice for the simulation of flows driven by surface tension gradients along the interface. This formulation was introduced by Popinet and Zaleski [1] for a front-tracking method and was later extended to level set methods by Al-Saud et al. [2]. In this work, we extend the integral formulation to a volume of fluid (VOF) method for capturing the interface. In fact, we propose three different schemes distinguished by the way we calculate the geometric properties of the interface, namely curvature, tangent vector and surface fraction from VOF representation. We propose a coupled level set volume of fluid (CLSVOF) method in which we use a signed distance function coupled with VOF, a height function (HF) method in which we use the height functions calculated from VOF, and a height function to distance (HF2D) method in which we use a sign-distance function calculated from height functions. For validation, these methods are rigorously tested for several problems with constant as well as varying surface tension. It is found that from an accuracy standpoint, CLSVOF has the least numerical oscillations followed by HF2D and then HF. However, from a computational speed point of view, HF method is the fastest followed by HF2D and then CLSVOF. Therefore, the HF2D method is a good compromise between speed and accuracy for obtaining faster and correct results.

      <title>Above room temperature multiferroic tunnel junction with the altermagnetic metal CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13850v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets with nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, nonferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308%, TER of 707%, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. The transport performance is robust under bias voltage. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic sensing, and quantum logic nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Learning-at-Criticality in Large Language Models for Quantum Field Theory and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Lithium and Vanadium Intercalation into Bilayer V2Se2O: Ferrimagnetic-Ferroelastic Multiferroics and Anomalous and Spin Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin splitting in emerging altermagnets is non-relativistic and momentum-dependent, yet energy-independent, and localized in momentum space, posing challenges for practical applications. Here, we propose an intercalation-driven paradigm for altermagnets to attain ameliorative electronic structures, multiferroic characteristics, and anomalous and spin transport functionalities. As a representative system, we investigate electrochemistry- and self-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers, building on the recently reported room-temperature K- and Rb-intercalated V2Se2O family [Nat. Phys. 2025, 21, 754; Nat. Phys. 2025, 21, 760], utilizing density functional theory, Wannier function analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, and non-equilibrium Green function methods. Intercalation induces room-temperature intralayer ferrimagnetic and interlayer ferromagnetic order (358 K for Li-intercalation and 773 K for V-intercalation), ferroelasticity (~1 % signal intensity), in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and metallization, while also modifying the anomalous Hall effect. Notably, Li- and V-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers exhibit enhanced spin splitting and half-metallic behavior, respectively, yielding near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Intercalation substantially enhances spin transport in V2Se2O-based devices, enabling giant magnetoresistance (877 %), ultra-high thermal tunneling magnetoresistance (~12000 %), and observable spin Seebeck and temperature negative differential resistance effects. This intercalation-driven paradigm expands altermagnetic functionalities through multifunctional integration, offering promising avenues for advanced, miniaturized, room-temperature exploitation of anomalous, electron, and spin transport properties.</description>

Abstract: Atomistic simulation methods have evolved through successive computational levels, each building upon more fundamental approaches: from quantum mechanics to density functional theory (DFT), and subsequently, to machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While universal MLIPs (u-MLIPs) offer broad transferability, their computational overhead limits large-scale applications. Task-specific MLIPs (ts-MLIPs) achieve superior efficiency but require prohibitively expensive DFT data generation for each material system. In this paper, we propose LightPFP, a data-efficient knowledge distillation framework. Instead of using costly DFT calculations, LightPFP generates a distilled ts-MLIP by leveraging u-MLIP to generate high-quality training data tailored for specific materials and utilizing a pre-trained light-weight MLIP to further enhance data efficiency. Across a broad spectrum of materials, including solid-state electrolytes, high-entropy alloys, and reactive ionic systems, LightPFP delivers three orders of magnitude faster model development than conventional DFT-based methods, while maintaining accuracy on par with first-principles predictions. Moreover, the distilled ts-MLIPs further sustain the computational efficiency essential for large-scale molecular dynamics, achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude faster inference than u-MLIPs. The framework further enables efficient precision transfer learning, where systematic errors from the u-MLIP can be corrected using as few as 10 high-accuracy DFT data points, as demonstrated for MgO melting point prediction. This u-MLIP-driven distillation approach enables rapid development of high-fidelity, efficient MLIPs for materials science applications.</description>

      <title>Elastic and Strain--Tunable Electronic and Optical Properties of La2AlGaO6 Hybrid Perovskite: A First-Principles Study</title>

Abstract: Perovskite materials, known for their structural versatility and multifunctional properties, continue to draw interest for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications. In this study, we investigate the elastic and strain--engineered mechanical, electronic properties and optical properties of the orthorhombic La2AlGaO6 (LAGO) hybrid perovskite using first--principles quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Structural optimizations were performed using both the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The mechanical stability of LAGO was confirmed through the Born--Huang criteria, and key elastic constants (C11, C12, C33, C44, and C66) were evaluated. These constants were further used to derive mechanical parameters such as Young's modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, Cauchy's pressure, and anisotropic factor, offering insights into the material's ductility, hardness, and elastic anisotropy. Crucially, we explored the influence of biaxial strain on the electronic band structure, DOS/PDOS, and Fermi energy, revealing significant band gap modulation under compressive and tensile strain, and hence, varying the optical properties. The coupling between elastic response and electronic structure highlights LAGO's potential for tunable device applications, where mechanical stimuli can be employed to tailor its electronic functionality.</description>
