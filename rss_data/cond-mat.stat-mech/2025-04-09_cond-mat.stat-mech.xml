      <title>First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. Two exactly solvable cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the first-passage properties of a jump process with a constant drift, focusing on two key observables: the first-passage time $\tau$ and the number of jumps $n$ before the first-passage event. By mapping the problem onto an effective discrete-time random walk, we derive an exact expression for the Laplace transform of the joint distribution of $\tau$ and $n$ using the generalized Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. This result is then used to analyze the first-passage properties for two exactly solvable cases: (i) both the inter-jump intervals and jump amplitudes are exponentially distributed, and (ii) the inter-jump intervals are exponentially distributed while all jumps have the same fixed amplitude. We show the existence of two distinct regimes governed by the strength of the drift: (i) a survival regime, where the process remains positive indefinitely with finite probability; (ii) an absorption regime, where the first-passage eventually occurs; and (iii) a critical point at the boundary between these two phases. We characterize the asymptotic behavior of survival probabilities in each regime: they decay exponentially to a constant in the survival regime, vanish exponentially fast in the absorption regime, and exhibit power-law decay at the critical point. Furthermore, in the absorption regime, we derive large deviation forms for the marginal distributions of $\tau$ and n. The analytical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Work statistics and thermal phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics in quantum many-body systems underscores the importance of quantum work, which differs from its classical counterpart due to its statistical nature. Recent studies have shown that quantum work can serve as an effective indicator of quantum phase transitions in systems subjected to sudden quenches. However, the potential of quantum work to identify thermal phase transitions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine several types of thermal phase transitions in a sudden-quench hard-core boson model, including Ising, three-state Potts, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Through finite-size scaling analysis, we conclude that work statistics can also characterize the critical behaviors of thermal phase transitions in generic many-body systems. Our investigation paves the way for applying work statistics to characterize critical behavior in many-body systems, with implications that may extend to broader contexts.</description>

      <title>Work probability distribution of weakly driven process in overdamped dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical work probability distributions for open classical systems are scarce; they can only be calculated in a few examples. In this work, I present a new method to derive such quantities for weakly driven processes in the overdamped regime for any switching time. The white noise Brownian motion in a harmonic linear stiffening trap illustrates the result. The work probability distribution is non-tabulated, with positive, semi-finite support, diverging at the minimal value, and non-Gaussian. An analysis of the range of validity of linear response is made by using the self-consistent criterion of the fluctuation-dissipation relation. The first, second, third, and fourth moments are correctly calculated for small perturbations.</description>

      <title>Exact results for spin glass criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years scale invariant scattering theory provided the first exact access to the magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional statistical systems with quenched disorder. We show how the theory extends to the overlap variables entering the characterization of spin glass properties. The resulting exact fixed point equations yield both the magnetic and, for the first time, the spin glass renormalization group fixed points. For the case of the random bond Ising model, on which we focus, the spin glass subspace of solutions is found to contain a line of fixed points. We discuss the implications of the results for Ising spin glass criticality and compare with the available numerical results.</description>

      <title>Learning strategies for optimised fitness in a model of cyclic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major problem in evolutionary biology is how species learn and adapt under the constraint of environmental conditions and competition of other species. Models of cyclic dominance provide simplified settings in which such questions can be addressed using methods from theoretical physics. We investigate how a privileged ("smart") species optimises its population by adopting advantageous strategies in one such model. We use a reinforcement learning algorithm, which successfully identifies optimal strategies based on a survival-of-the-weakest effect, including directional incentives to avoid predators. We also characterise the steady-state behaviour of the system in the presence of the smart species and compare with the symmetric case where all species are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Langevin dynamics with generalized time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When analyzing the equilibrium properties of a stochastic process, identifying the parity of the variables under time-reversal is imperative. This initial step is required to assess the presence of detailed balance, and to compute the entropy production rate, which is, otherwise, ambiguously defined. In this work we deal with stochastic processes whose underlying time-reversal symmetry cannot be reduced to the usual parity rules (namely, flip of the momentum sign). We provide a systematic method to build equilibrium Langevin dynamics starting from their reversible deterministic counterparts: this strategy can be applied, in particular, to all stable one-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, exploiting the time-reversal symmetry unveiled in the action-angle framework. The case of the Lotka-Volterra model is discussed as an example. We also show that other stochastic versions of this system violate time-reversal symmetry and are, therefore, intrinsically out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Timescales for thermalization, quantum chaos, and self-averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter discusses the conditions and timescales under which isolated many-body quantum systems, initially far from equilibrium, ultimately reach thermal equilibrium. We also examine quantities that, during the relaxation process, exhibit dynamical manifestations of spectral correlations as in random matrix theory and investigate how these manifestations affect their equilibration times. We refer to systems presenting these spectral correlations as chaotic quantum systems, although the correct term to be employed, whether chaotic or ergodic quantum systems, is debatable and both have limitations.</description>

      <title>The distinction between Ice phases VII, VIII and X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice phases VII, VIII and X are all based on a body-centered cubic arrangement of molecules, the differences coming from molecular orientation. There is some debate as to whether these should even be considered distinct phases. The standard definition of a transition between distinct phases involves a discontinuity in any derivative of the free energy. This can be hard to prove experimentally, and most previous theoretical works have been based on models which either have continuously differentiable free energies, or no straightforward way to determine the free energy. Here we build a free energy model based on the common definitions of the phases ; ordered ice-VIII, orientationally disordered ice VII and proton-disordered ice X. All transitions in this model might or might not be associated with a discontinuity in the specific heat, depending on paramaterization. By comparing with data, we find that a VII-X transition line exists, but it ends in a critical point hidden within the stability field of phase VIII. If the model is correct, there is a discontinuity between VII and X, so they are separate phases. We propose that the hidden phase boundary might be demonstrated experimentally by compression of supercooled ice VII.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization of light and matter in cavity-coupled Rydberg arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, employing nonequilibrium diagrammatic techniques to capture nonlinearities and fluctuations beyond mean-field theory. We discover a novel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range Rydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics, including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel quantum protocol called Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation (TQET), designed for transporting quantum energy across space-time. This protocol uses temporal and spatial quantum correlations between agents separated by space and time. The energy supplier injects energy into the system by measuring the ground state of a many-body system that evolves over time, while the distant recipient performs a conditional operation using feedback from the supplier. When both supplier and recipient operate within the same time frame, this is called Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET). A proof-of-concept was performed for the Ising model, utilizing quantum simulations. TQET increases energy efficiency from approximately 3% to around 40%, representing over a 13-fold improvement compared to QET. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between entanglement in time and TQET, validating the role of temporal correlations in energy activation between agents across space-time.</description>

      <title>Subexponential decay of local correlations from diffusion-limited dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Fast and direct preparation of a genuine lattice BEC via the quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for dissipatively preparing a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) directly on a lattice, avoiding the need for a two-staged preparation procedure currently used in ultracold atom platforms. Our protocol is based on driving the lattice-subsystem into a non-equilibrium steady state, which we show to exhibit a lattice analog of a true BEC, where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. Furthermore, exploiting a symmetry-based Mpemba effect, we analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics, quantitatively assessing the speedups yielded by our protocol, as well as the fidelities of the prepared BEC.</description>

      <title>Elongation-Induced Segregation in Periodically Textured Microfluidic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the motion of elongated microparticles in microfluidic channels at low Reynolds numbers. In channels with smooth walls, asymmetric initial conditions -- including particle orientation and lateral position -- lead to continuous variations in particle trajectories, potentially exhibiting repeated behavior depending on the channel geometry and initial conditions. However, we find that introducing periodically textured walls induces alignment of the particle with the channel centerline within a specific range of texture wavelengths. This occurs as the textured pattern disrupts the uniformity of the flow, creating localized high-velocity nodes that repeatedly guide the particle toward the centerline as it moves downstream. Notably, the characteristic length scale over which this alignment forms reduces with increasing particle elongation and diverges with increasing Reynolds number. Our findings reveal that elongation-induced alignment can be leveraged for microfluidic filtering applications, enabling the efficient separation of microparticles based on their geometric properties. This work opens new avenues for designing microfluidic devices tailored for high-precision particle sorting, with broad implications for biomedical and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>The complete trans-series for conserved charges in the Lieb-Liniger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the complete trans-series solution for the (non-relativistic) moments of the rapidity density in the Lieb-Liniger model. The trans-series is written explicitly in terms of a perturbative basis, which can be obtained from the already known perturbative expansion of the density by solving several ordinary differential equations. Unknown integration constants are fixed from Volin's method. We have checked that our solution satisfies the analytical consistency requirements including the newly derived resurgence relations and agrees with the high precision numerical solution. Our results also provides the full analytic trans-series for the capacitance of the coaxial circular plate capacitor.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking in chaotic many-body quantum systems at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the entanglement of finite-temperature eigenstates in chaotic quantum many-body local Hamiltonians can be accurately described by an ensemble of random states with an internal $U(1)$ symmetry. We build upon this result to investigate the universal symmetry-breaking properties of such eigenstates. As a probe of symmetry breaking, we employ the entanglement asymmetry, a quantum information observable that quantifies the extent to which symmetry is broken in a subsystem. This measure enables us to explore the finer structure of finite-temperature eigenstates in terms of the $U(1)$-symmetric random state ensemble; in particular, the relation between the Hamiltonian and the effective conserved charge in the ensemble. Our analysis is supported by analytical calculations for the symmetric random states, as well as exact numerical results for the Mixed-Field Ising spin-$1/2$ chain, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaoticity.</description>

      <title>The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning, biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed, complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy. This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in active learning systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A decade ago, a universal stabilization mechanism driven by quantum fluctuations was discovered in ultracold Bose gases of highly magnetic atoms. This mechanism prevents these systems from collapsing and instead allows exotic states of matter to arise, including ultradilute quantum droplets, crystallized quantum states, and specifically supersolids. We review the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these quantum-stabilized states, their emergence, and intriguing properties.</description>

      <title>Continuum Limit of Dendritic Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01173v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum models are commonly used to study dendritic deposition in fields ranging from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to battery research. However, the continuum approximation underlying these models is poorly understood, even in the simplified case of Brownian particles depositing onto a small, reactive cluster. Specifically, this system transitions from a compact to a dendritic morphology at a critical radius that depends on the particle size. But in simulations of the continuum (small-particle) limit, the critical radius does not reproduce the scaling predicted by a purely continuum analysis. This discrepancy suggests that continuum models may not be able to capture the microscopic physics of dendrite formation, raising doubts about their experimental relevance. To clarify the continuum limit of dendritic deposition, here, we reexamine the critical radius scaling of the Brownian particle system using Brownian dynamics simulations. Compared to past studies, we probe larger system sizes, up to hundreds of millions of particles in some cases, and adopt an improved paradigm for the surface reaction. This paradigm allows us to converge our simulations and to work with well-defined physical parameters. Our results show that the critical radius scaling is, in fact, consistent with the continuum analysis, validating the continuum approach to modeling dendritic deposition. Nonetheless, the Brownian particle system converges to its continuum limit slowly. As a result, when applying continuum models to more complex deposition processes, the continuum approximation itself may be a significant source of error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for engineering active quantum matter that involves mimicking the role of self-propulsion through an external trapping potential that is moving along imposed trajectories traced by classical active dynamics. This approach in the presence of dissipation, not only recovers essential dynamical behavior of classical activity, including the ballistic to diffusive cross-over of its mean-square displacement, but also reveals additional features of activity that are of quantum origin. These quantum-active features are revealed in non-dissipative systems, and manifest as novel exponents of the mean-square displacement at short timescales.</description>

      <title>Exploiting bias in optimal finite-time copying protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a finite-time cyclic copy protocol that creates persisting correlations between a memory and a data bit. The average work to copy the two states of the data bit consists of the mutual information created between the memory and data bit after copying, a cost due to the difference between the initial and final states of the memory bit, and a finite-time cost. At low copy speeds, the optimal initial distribution of the memory bit matches the bias in the expected outcome, set by the bias in the data bit and the copying accuracies. However, if both states of the data are copied with the same accuracy, then in the high-speed regime copying the unlikely data bit state becomes prohibitively costly with a biased memory; the optimal initial distribution is then pushed towards 50:50. Copying with unequal accuracies, at fixed copy-generated mutual information, yields an opposite yet more effective strategy. Here, the initial memory distribution becomes increasingly biased as the copy speed increases, drastically lowering the work and raising the maximum speed. This strategy is so effective that it induces a symmetry breaking transition for an unbiased data bit.</description>

      <title>Entropy estimation for partially accessible Markov networks based on imperfect observations: Role of finite resolution and finite statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating entropy production from real observation data can be difficult due to finite resolution in both space and time and finite measurement statistics. We characterize the statistical error introduced by finite sample size and compare the performance of three different entropy estimators under these limitations for two different paradigmatic systems, a four-state Markov network and an augmented Michaelis-Menten reaction scheme. We consider the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, a waiting-time based estimator for resolved transitions and a waiting-time based estimator for blurred transitions in imperfect observation scenarios. For perfect measurement statistics and finite temporal resolution, the estimator based on resolved transitions performs best in all considered scenarios. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation gives a better estimate than the estimator based on blurred transitions at low driving affinities, whereas the latter performs better at high driving affinities. Furthermore, we find that a higher temporal and spatial resolution leads to slower convergence of measurement statistics, implying that for short measurement times, a lower resolution may be beneficial. Additionally, we identify a self-averaging effect for the waiting-time based entropy estimators that can reduce their variance for observations with finite statistics.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic resetting has been a subject of considerable interest within statistical physics, both as means of improving completion times of complex processes such as searches and as a paradigm for generating nonequilibrium stationary states. In these lecture notes we give a self-contained introduction to the toy model of diffusion with stochastic resetting. We also discuss large deviation properties of additive functionals of the process such as the cost of resetting. Finally, we consider the generalisation from Poissonian resetting, where the resetting process occurs with a constant rate, to non-Poissonian resetting.</description>

      <title>Rare Events and Single Big Jump Effects in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even in a simple stochastic process, the study of the full distribution of time integrated observables can be a difficult task. This is the case of a much-studied process such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process where, recently, anomalous dynamical scaling of large deviations of time integrated functionals has been highlighted. Using the mapping of a continuous stochastic process to a continuous time random walk via the "excursions technique'', we introduce a comprehensive formalism that enables the calculation of the complete distribution of the time-integrated observable $A = \int_0^T v^n(t) dt$, where $n$ is a positive integer and $v(t)$ is the random velocity of a particle following Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics. We reveal an interesting connection between the anomalous rate function associated with the observable $A$ and the statistics of the area under the first-passage functional during an excursion. The rate function of the latter, analyzed here for the first time, exhibits anomalous scaling behavior and a dynamical phase transition, both of which are explored in detail. The case of the anomalous scaling of large deviations, originally associated to the presence of an instantonic solution in the weak noise regime of a path integral approach, is here produced by a so called "big jump effect'', in which the contribution to rare events is dominated by the largest excursion. Our approach, which is quite general for continuous stochastic processes, allows to associate a physical meaning to the anomalous scaling of large deviations, through the big jump principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that discontinuous shear thickening (DST) can occur even in moderately dense, inertial suspensions of hydrodynamically interacting, frictionless soft particles. Using the Lubrication-Friction Discrete Element Method, our simulations reveal that DST can emerge at lower particle densities, provided that both the inertia of the suspended particles and their softness are sufficiently pronounced. Furthermore, we show that, under these conditions, the DST behavior obtained from the simulation qualitatively agrees with that predicted by kinetic theory, even without accounting for hydrodynamic interactions. These findings expand the understanding of DST in soft particle systems and highlight the importance of particle inertia and softness in controlling rheological behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An intriguing phenomenon in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics is the asymmetry of thermal processes. Relaxation to thermal equilibrium is the most important dissipative process, being a key concept for the design of heat engines and refrigerators, contributing to the study of foundational questions of thermodynamics, and being relevant for quantum computing through the process of algorithmic cooling. Despite their importance, the dynamics of these processes are far from being understood. We show that the free relaxation to thermal equilibrium follows intrinsically different paths depending on whether it involves the temperature of the system to increase or to decrease. Our theory is exemplified using the recently developed thermal kinematics based on information geometry theory, utilizing three prototypical examples: a two-level system, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and a trapped quantum Brownian particle, in all cases showing faster heating than cooling under the appropriate conditions. A general understanding is obtained based on the spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian and the spectral gap of reciprocal processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Landauer's principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer's principle can be generalised to characterise irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relationship between the entropy change of the system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in relative entropies of the environment. Here we experimentally probe Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a massive to massless Klein-Gordon model and analyse the thermodynamic and information-theoretic contributions to a generalised entropy production for various system-environment partitions of the composite system. Our results verify the quantum field theoretical calculations, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the ability of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Local quantum channels giving rise to quasi-local Gibbs states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the steady-state properties of quantum channels with local Kraus operators. We consider a large family that consists of general ergodic 1-local (non-interacting) terms and general 2-local (interacting) terms. Physically, a repeated application of these channels can be seen as a simple model for the thermalization process of a many-body system. We study its steady state perturbatively, by interpolating between the 1-local and 2-local channels with a perturbation parameter $\epsilon$. We prove that under very general conditions, these states are Gibbs states of a quasi-local Hamiltonian. Expanding this Hamiltonian as a series in $\epsilon$, we show that the $k$'th order term corresponds to a $(k+1)$-local interaction term in the Hamiltonian, which follows the same interaction graph as the Kraus channel. We also prove a complementary result suggesting the existence of an interaction strength threshold, under which the total weight of the high-order terms in the Hamiltonian decays exponentially fast. For sufficiently small $\epsilon$, this implies both exponential decay of local correlation functions and a classical algorithm for computing expectation value of local observables in such steady states. Finally, we present numerical simulations of various channels that support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Energy Landscapes and Temperature paths: Dynamic Transition Rates in locally Ultrametric Complex Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of complex systems with time-dependent transition rates, focusing on $p$-adic analysis in modeling such systems. Starting from the master equation that governs the stochastic dynamics of a system with a large number of interacting components, we generalize it by $p$-adically parametrizing the metabasins to account for states that are organized in a fractal and hierarchical manner within the energy landscape. This leads to a not necessarily time homogeneous Markov process described by a time-dependent operator acting on an ultrametric space. We prove well-posedness of the initial value problem and analyze the stochastic nature of the master equation with time-dependent transition-operator. We demonstrate how ultrametricity simplifies the description of intra-metabasin dynamics without increasing computational complexity. We apply our theoretical framework to two scenarios: glass relaxation under rapid cooling and protein folding dynamics influenced by temperature variations. In the glass relaxation model, we observe anomalous relaxation behavior where the dynamics slow down during cooling, with lasting effects depending on how drastic the temperature drop is. In the protein folding model, we incorporate temperature-dependent transition rates to simulate folding and unfolding processes across the melting temperature. Our results capture a "whiplash" effect: from an unfolded state, the system folds and then returns to an unfolded state (which may differ from the initial one) in response to temperature changes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of $p$-adic parametrization and ultrametric analysis in modeling complex systems with dynamic transition rate, providing analytical solutions that improve our understanding of relaxation processes in material and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Dual-Space Invariance as a Definitive Signature of Critical States in Anderson Localization</title>

Abstract: Critical states represent a fundamental and fascinating research frontier in Anderson localization physics, known for their non-ergodic properties, including multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge up to now. In this work, we establish a universal mechanism demonstrating that critical states must maintain dual-space invariance in both position and momentum representations, leading to delocalized dynamics in both spaces. Therefore, our discovery soundly answers this long-standing unsolved puzzle regarding the definition of the critical state and its rigorous characterization. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we prove rigorously that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces as expected. Subsequent numerical simulations provide the smoking gun for the correctness of the dual-space invariance, thereby not only highlighting the universality of the rigorous mechanism, but also establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstates of a chaotic system can be enhanced along underlying unstable periodic orbits in so-called quantum scars, making it more likely for a particle launched along one such orbits to be found still there at long times. Unstable periodic orbits are, however, a negligible part of the phase space, and a question arises regarding the structure of the wave function elsewhere. Here, we address this question and show that a weakly-dispersing dynamics of a localized wave packet in phase space leaves a "quantum trail" on the eigenstates, that is, makes them vary slowly when moving along trajectories in phase space, even if not periodic. The quantum trails underpin a remarkable dynamical effect: for a system initialized in a localized wave packet, the long-time phase-space distribution is enhanced along the short-time trajectory, which can result in ergodicity breaking. We provide the general intuition for these effects and prove them in the stadium billiard, for which an unwarping procedure allows us to visualize the phase space on the two-dimensional space of the page.</description>

Abstract: We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th R\'enyi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.</description>
