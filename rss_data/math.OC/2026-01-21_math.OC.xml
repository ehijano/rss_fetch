      <title>Robustness of the Frank-Wolfe Method under Inexact Oracles and the Cost of Linear Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of the Frank-Wolfe method when gradients are computed inexactly and examine the relative computational cost of the linear minimization oracle (LMO) versus projection. For smooth nonconvex functions, we establish a convergence guarantee of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k}+\delta)$ for Frank-Wolfe with a $\delta$--oracle. Our results strengthen previous analyses for convex objectives and show that the oracle errors do not accumulate asymptotically. We further prove that approximate projections cannot be computationally cheaper than accurate LMOs, thus extending to the case of inexact projections. These findings reinforce the robustness and efficiency of the Frank-Wolfe framework.</description>

      <title>Minimal Perimeter Triangle in Nonconvex Quadrilateral:Generalized Fagnano Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1775, Fagnano introduced the following geometric optimization problem: inscribe a triangle of minimal perimeter in a given acute-angled triangle. A widely accessible solution is provided by the Hungarian mathematician L. Fejer in 1900. This paper presents a specific generalization of the classical Fagnano problem, which states that given a nonconvex quadrilateral (having one reflex angle and others are acute angles), find a triangle of minimal perimeter with exactly one vertex on each of the sides that do not form reflex angle, and the third vertex lies on either of the sides forming the reflex angle. We provide its geometric solution. Additionally, we establish an upper bound for the classic Fagnano problem, demonstrating that the minimal perimeter of the triangle inscribed in a given acute-angled triangle cannot exceed twice the length of any of its sides.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Waist Problem: Optimality Condition and Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many years ago John Tyrell a lecturer at King's college London challenged his Ph.D. students with the following puzzle: show that there is a unique triangle of minimal perimeter with exactly one vertex to lie on one of three given lines, pairwise disjoint and not all parallel in the space. The problem in literature is known as the waist problem, and only convexity rescued in this case. Motivated by this we generalize it by replacing lines with a number of convex sets in the Euclidean space and ask to minimize the sum of distances connecting the sets by means of closed polygonal curve. This generalized problem significantly broadens its geometric and practical scope in view of modern convex analysis. We establish the existence of solutions and prove its uniqueness under the condition that at least one of the convex sets is strictly convex and all are in general position: each set can be separated by convex hull of others. A complete set of necessary and sufficient optimality conditions is derived, and their geometric interpretations are explored to link these conditions with classical principles such as the reflection law of light. To address this problem computationally, we develop a projected subgradient descent method and prove its convergence. Our algorithm is supported by detailed numerical experiments, particularly in cases involving discs and spheres. Additionally, we present a real-world analogy of the problem in the form of inter-island connectivity, illustrating its practical relevance. This work not only advances the theory of geometric optimization but also contributes effective methods and insights applicable to facility location, network design, robotics., computational geometry, and spatial planning.</description>

      <title>A Generalized $(k,m)$ Heron Problem:Optimality Conditions and Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new extension of the classical Heron problem, termed the generalized $(k,m)$-Heron problem, which seeks an optimal configuration among $k$ feasible and $m$ target non-empty closed convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The problem is formulated as finding a point in each set that minimizes the pairwise distances from the points in the $k$-feasible sets to the points in the $m$-target sets. This formulation leads to a convex optimization framework that generalizes several well-known geometric distance problems. Using tools from convex analysis, we establish fundamental results on existence, uniqueness, and first-order optimality conditions through subdifferential calculus and normal cone theory. Building on these insights, a Projected Subgradient Algorithm (PSA) is proposed for numerical solution, and its convergence is rigorously proved under a diminishing step-size rule. Numerical experiments in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$ illustrate the algorithm's stability, geometric accuracy, and computational efficiency. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive analytical and algorithmic framework for multi-set geometric optimization with promising implications for location science, robotics, and computational geometry.</description>

      <title>Integrated Optimization of Scheduling and Flexible Charging in Mixed Electric-Diesel Urban Transit Bus Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition of transit fleets to alternative powertrains offers a potential pathway to reducing the cost of mobility. However, the limited range and long charging durations of battery electric buses (BEBs) introduce significant operational complexities, necessitating innovative scheduling and charging strategies. This study proposes an integrated mixed-integer linear programming model to optimize vehicle scheduling and charging strategies for mixed fleets of BEBs and diesel buses. Unlike existing models, which often assume a fixed BEB fleet size or restrict charging to a single charger type, our approach simultaneously determines the optimal fleet composition, scheduling, and flexible partial charging strategy incorporating both slow and fast chargers at garages and terminal stations. The model minimizes combined fleet purchase and operational costs. A queuing strategy is introduced, departing from traditional first-come, first-served methods by dynamically allocating waiting and charging times based on operational priorities and resource availability, improving overall scheduling efficiency. To overcome computational complexities arising from numerous variables, a column generation framework is developed, facilitating scalable solutions for large-scale transit networks. Numerical experiments using real-world transit data from the Chicago Transit Authority and the Pace suburban bus systems demonstrate the model's effectiveness. Results indicate that while a full transition to alternative powertrains results in a modest cost increase, optimal mixed-fleet configurations can actually reduce total system costs. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses reveal that restricting charging to garages significantly increases fleet size and operational costs, underscoring the potential of distributed opportunistic charging.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Integer Reaggregated Hull Reformulation of Special Structured Generalized Linear Disjunctive Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) provides a powerful framework for combining algebraic constraints with logical disjunctions. To solve these problems, mixed-integer reformulations are required, but traditional reformulation schemes, such as Big-M and Hull, either yield a weak continuous relaxation or result in a bloated model size. Castro and Grossmann showed that scheduling problems can be formulated as GDP by modeling task orderings as disjunctions with algebraic timing constraints. Moreover, in their work, a particular representation of the single-unit scheduling problem, namely using a time-slot concept, can be reformulated as a tight yet compact mixed-integer linear program with notable computational performance. Based on that observation, and focusing on the case where the constraints in disjunctions are linear and share the same coefficients, we connect the characterization of the convex hull of these disjunctive sets by Jeroslow and Blair with Castro and Grossmann's time-slot reaggregation strategy to derive a unified reformulation methodology. We test this reformulation in two problems, single-unit scheduling and two-dimensional strip-packing. We derive new formulations of the general precedence concept of single-unit scheduling and symmetry-breaking formulations of the strip-packing problem, yielding mixed-integer programs with strong theoretical guarantees, particularly compact formulations in terms of continuous variables, and efficient computational performance when solving them with commercial mixed-integer solvers for these problems.</description>

      <title>Projected Stochastic Momentum Methods for Nonlinear Equality-Constrained Optimization for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two algorithms are proposed, analyzed, and tested for solving continuous optimization problems with nonlinear equality constraints. Each is an extension of a stochastic momentum-based method from the unconstrained setting to the setting of a stochastic Newton-SQP-type algorithm for solving equality-constrained problems. One is an extension of the heavy-ball method and the other is an extension of the Adam optimization method. Convergence guarantees for the algorithms for the constrained setting are provided that are on par with state-of-the-art guarantees for their unconstrained counterparts. A critical feature of each extension is that the momentum terms are implemented with projected gradient estimates, rather than with the gradient estimates themselves. The significant practical effect of this choice is seen in an extensive set of numerical experiments on solving informed supervised machine learning problems. These experiments also show benefits of employing a constrained approach to supervised machine learning rather than a typical regularization-based approach.</description>

      <title>A high-order augmented Lagrangian method with arbitrarily fast convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a high-order version of the augmented Lagrangian method for solving convex optimization problems with linear constraints, which achieves arbitrarily fast -- and even superlinear -- convergence rates. First, we analyze the convergence rates of the high-order proximal point method under certain uniform convexity assumptions on the energy functional. We then introduce the high-order augmented Lagrangian method and analyze its convergence by leveraging the convergence results of the high-order proximal point method. Finally, we present applications of the high-order augmented Lagrangian method to various problems arising in the sciences, including data fitting, flow in porous media, and scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Observer design and boundary output feedback stabilization for semilinear parabolic system over general multidimensional domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the output feedback stabilization of parabolic equation with Lipschitz nonlinearity over general multidimensional domain using spectral geometry theories. First, a novel nonlinear observer is designed, and the error system is shown to achieve any prescribed decay rate by leveraging the Berezin-Li-Yau inequality from spectral geometry, which also provides effective guidance for sensor placement. Subsequently, a finite-dimensional state feedback controller is proposed, which ensures the quantitative rapid stabilization of the linear part. By integrating this control law with the observer, an efficient boundary output feedback control strategy is developed. The feasibility of the proposed control design is rigorously verified for arbitrary Lipschitz constants, thereby resolving a persistent theoretical challenge. Finally, a numerical case study confirms the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Offline Policy Learning with Weight Clipping and Heaviside Composite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline policy learning aims to use historical data to learn an optimal personalized decision rule. In the standard estimate-then-optimize framework, reweighting-based methods (e.g., inverse propensity weighting or doubly robust estimators) are widely used to produce unbiased estimates of policy values. However, when the propensity scores of some treatments are small, these reweighting-based methods suffer from high variance in policy value estimation, which may mislead the downstream policy optimization and yield a learned policy with inferior value. In this paper, we systematically develop an offline policy learning algorithm based on a weight-clipping estimator that truncates small propensity scores via a clipping threshold chosen to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in policy value estimation. Focusing on linear policies, we address the bilevel and discontinuous objective induced by weight-clipping-based policy optimization by reformulating the problem as a Heaviside composite optimization problem, which provides a rigorous computational framework. The reformulated policy optimization problem is then solved efficiently using the progressive integer programming method, making practical policy learning tractable. We establish an upper bound for the suboptimality of the proposed algorithm, which reveals how the reduction in MSE of policy value estimation, enabled by our proposed weight-clipping estimator, leads to improved policy learning performance.</description>

      <title>Balancing adaptability and predictability: K-revision multistage stochastic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standard assumption in multistage stochastic programming is that decisions are made after observing the uncertainty from the prior stage. The resulting solutions can be difficult to implement in practice, as they leave practitioners ill-prepared for future stages. To provide better foresight, we introduce the K-revision approach. This new framework requires plans to be specified in advance. To maintain flexibility, we allow plans to be revised a maximum of K times as new information becomes available. We analyze the complexity of K-revision problems, showing NP-hardness even in a simple setting. We examine, both theoretically and computationally, the impact of the K-revision approach on the objective compared with classical multistage stochastic programming models and the partially adaptive approach introduced in [1, 2]. We develop two MIP formulations, one directly from our definition and the other based on a combinatorial characterization. We analyze the tightness of these formulations and propose several methods to strengthen them. Computational experiments on synthetic problems and practical applications demonstrate that our approach is both computationally tractable and effective in reaching near-optimal performance while increasing the predictability of the solutions produced.</description>

      <title>Optimal Leveraging of Smoothness and Strong Convexity for Peaceman--Rachford Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple methodology to leverage strong convexity and smoothness in order to obtain an optimal linear convergence rate for the Peaceman--Rachford splitting (PRS) scheme applied to optimization problems involving two smooth strongly convex functions. The approach consists of adding and subtracting suitable quadratic terms from one function to the other so as to redistribute strong convexity in the primal formulation and smoothness in the dual formulation. This yields an equivalent modified optimization problem in which each term has adjustable levels of strong convexity and smoothness. In this setting, the Peaceman--Rachford splitting method converges linearly to the solution of the modified problem with a convergence rate that can be optimized with respect to the introduced parameters. Upon returning to the original formulation, this procedure gives rise to a modified variant of PRS. The optimal linear rate established in this work is strictly better than the best rates previously available in the general setting. The practical performance of the method is illustrated through an academic example and applications in image processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the properties and characterization of interval B-tensors and interval double B-tensors. We propose verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions that allow for determining whether an entire interval tensor family belongs to these classes based solely on its extreme point tensors. The study elucidates profound connections between these interval tensors and other structured ones such as interval Z-tensors and P-tensors, while also providing simplified criteria for special cases like circulant structures. Furthermore, under the condition of even order and symmetry, we prove that interval B-tensors (double B-tensors) ensure the property of being an interval P-tensor. This work extends interval matrix theory to tensors, offering new analytical tools for fields such as polynomial optimization and complementarity problems involving uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Games Under Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study discrete-time, finite-state mean-field games (MFGs) under model uncertainty, where agents face ambiguity about the state transition probabilities. Each agent maximizes its expected payoff against the worst-case transitions within an uncertainty set. Unlike in classical MFGs, model uncertainty renders the population distribution flow stochastic. This leads us to consider strategies that depend on both individual states and the realized distribution of the population. Our main results establish the asymptotic relationship between $N$-agent games and MFGs: every MFG equilibrium constitutes an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium for sufficiently large populations, and conversely, limits of $N$-agent equilibria are MFG equilibria. We also prove the existence of equilibria for finite-agent games and construct a solvable mean-field example with closed-form solutions.</description>

      <title>An efficient penalty decomposition algorithm for minimization over sparse symmetric sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an improved quasi-Newton penalty decomposition algorithm for the minimization of continuously differentiable functions, possibly nonconvex, over sparse symmetric sets. The method solves a sequence of penalty subproblems approximately via a two-block decomposition scheme: the first subproblem admits a closed-form solution without sparsity constraints, while the second subproblem is handled through an efficient sparse projection over the symmetric feasible set. Under a new assumption on the gradient of the objective function, weaker than global Lipschitz continuity from the origin, we establish that accumulation points of the outer iterates are basic feasible and cardinality-constrained Mordukhovich stationarity points. To ensure robustness and efficiency in finite-precision arithmetic, the algorithm incorporates several practical enhancements, including an enhanced line search strategy based on either backtracking or extrapolation, and four inexpensive diagonal Hessian approximations derived from differences of previous iterates and gradients or from eigenvalue-distribution information. Numerical experiments on a diverse benchmark of $30$ synthetic and data-driven test problems, including machine-learning datasets from the UCI repository and sparse symmetric instances with dimensions ranging from $10$ to $500$, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive with several state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, robustness, and strong stationarity.</description>

Abstract: This paper applies the Anderson Acceleration (AA) technique to accelerate the Fenchel dual gradient method (FDGM) to solve constrained optimization problems over time-varying networks. AA is originally designed for accelerating fixed-point iterations, and its direct application to FDGM faces two challenges: 1) FDGM in time-varying networks cannot be formulated as a standard fixed-point update; 2) even if the network is fixed so that FDGM can be expressed as a fixed-point iteration, the direct application of AA is not distributively implementable. To overcome these challenges, we first rewrite each update of FDGM as inexactly solving several \emph{local} problems where each local problem involves two neighboring nodes only, and then incorporate AA to solve each local problem with higher accuracy, resulting in the Fenchel Dual Gradient Method with Anderson Acceleration (FDGM-AA). To guarantee global convergence of FDGM-AA, we equip it with a newly designed safe-guard scheme. Under mild conditions, our algorithm converges at a rate of \(O(1/\sqrt{k})\) for the primal sequence and \(O(1/k)\) for the dual sequence. The competitive performance of our algorithm is validated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>BiCoLoR: Communication-Efficient Optimization with Bidirectional Compression and Local Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow and costly communication is often the main bottleneck in distributed optimization, especially in federated learning where it occurs over wireless networks. We introduce BiCoLoR, a communication-efficient optimization algorithm that combines two widely used and effective strategies: local training, which increases computation between communication rounds, and compression, which encodes high-dimensional vectors into short bitstreams. While these mechanisms have been combined before, compression has typically been applied only to uplink (client-to-server) communication, leaving the downlink (server-to-client) side unaddressed. In practice, however, both directions are costly. We propose BiCoLoR, the first algorithm to combine local training with bidirectional compression using arbitrary unbiased compressors. This joint design achieves accelerated complexity guarantees in both convex and strongly convex heterogeneous settings. Empirically, BiCoLoR outperforms existing algorithms and establishes a new standard in communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dynamic resource allocation in eukaryotic Resource Balance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource Balance Analysis (RBA) is a framework for predicting steady-state cellular growth under resource constraints. However, classical RBA formulations are static and do not capture the dynamic regulation of biosynthetic resources or macromolecular turnover, which is particularly important in eukaryotic cells. In this work, we propose a dynamic extension of eukaryotic RBA based on an optimal control formulation. Cellular growth is modeled as the result of a time-dependent allocation of translational capacity between metabolic enzymes and macromolecular machinery, aimed at maximizing biomass accumulation over a finite time horizon. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, we characterize optimal allocation strategies and show that steady-state RBA solutions arise as limiting regimes of the dynamic problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monotonicity of pairs of operators is an extension of monotonicity of operators, which plays an important role in solving non-monotone inclusions. One of challenging problems in this new tool is how to design the associated mappings to obtain the monotone pairs. In this paper, we solve this problem and propose a Generalized Inertial Proximal Point Algorithm (GIPPA) using warped resolvents under the monotonicity of pairs. The weak, strong and linear convergence of the algorithm under some mild assumptions are established. We also provide numerical examples illustrating the implementability and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: We derive sharp bounds for the boundary control cost of the one-dimensional fractional Schr\"odinger and heat equations. The analysis of the lower bound is based on the study of the control cost of a related singular boundary control problem in finite time, using tools from complex analysis. The analysis of the upper bound relies on the moment method, involving estimates of the Fourier transform of a class of compactly supported functions.</description>

      <title>Multi-gear bandits, partial conservation laws, and indexability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers what we propose to call multi-gear bandits, which are Markov decision processes modeling a generic dynamic and stochastic project fueled by a single resource and which admit multiple actions representing gears of operation naturally ordered by their increasing resource consumption. The optimal operation of a multi-gear bandit aims to strike a balance between project performance costs or rewards and resource usage costs, which depend on the resource price. A computationally convenient and intuitive optimal solution is available when such a model is indexable, meaning that its optimal policies are characterized by a dynamic allocation index (DAI), a function of state--action pairs representing critical resource prices. Motivated by the lack of general indexability conditions and efficient index-computing schemes, and focusing on the infinite-horizon finite-state and -action discounted case, we present a verification theorem ensuring that, if a model satisfies two proposed PCL-indexability conditions with respect to a postulated family of structured policies, then it is indexable and such policies are optimal, with its DAI being given by a marginal productivity index computed by a downshift adaptive-greedy algorithm in $A N$ steps, with $A+1$ actions and $N$ states. The DAI is further used as the basis of a new index policy for the multi-armed multi-gear bandit problem.</description>

      <title>Optimality Conditions for Sparse Bilinear Least Squares Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-order optimality conditions of sparse bilinear least squares problems are studied. The so-called T-type and N-type stationary points for this problem are characterized in terms of tangent cone and normal cone in Bouligand and Clarke senses, and another stationarity concept called the coordinate-wise minima is introduced and discussed. Moreover, the L-like stationary point for this problem is introduced and analyzed through the newly introduced concept of like-projection, and the M-stationary point is also investigated via a complementarity-type reformulation of the problem. The relationship between these stationary points is discussed as well. It turns out that all stationary points discussed in this work satisfy the necessary optimality conditions for the sparse bilinear least squares problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The restless multi-armed bandit problem is a paradigmatic modeling framework for optimal dynamic priority allocation in stochastic models of wide-ranging applications that has been widely investigated and applied since its inception in a seminal paper by Whittle in the late 1980s. The problem has generated a vast and fast-growing literature from which a significant sample is thematically organized and reviewed in this paper. While the main focus is on priority-index policies due to their intuitive appeal, tractability, asymptotic optimality properties, and often strong empirical performance, other lines of work are also reviewed. Theoretical and algorithmic developments are discussed, along with diverse applications. The main goals are to highlight the remarkable breadth of work that has been carried out on the topic and to stimulate further research in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fully characterize the core of a broad class of nonlinear games by identifying a suitable relaxation for inherent nonlinearity, directly generalizing the linear frameworks in the literature. This characterization significantly expands the scope of cooperative games that can be analyzed and contributes to the literature on games induced from optimization models. We apply these insights to not only establish connections with and provide new insights on classical models but also solve new games untamed in the existing literature, including combinatorial quadratic and ratio games such as portfolio, maximum cut, matching, and assortment games. These results are further extended to more general models and also the approximate core.</description>

      <title>Age of information cost minimization with no buffers, random arrivals and unreliable channels: A PCL-indexability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Age of Information has emerged as a key concept and metric for applications where the freshness of sensor-provided data is critical. Limited transmission capacity has motivated research on the design of tractable policies for scheduling information updates to minimize Age of Information cost based on Markov decision models, in particular on the restless multi-armed bandit problem (RMABP). This allows the use of Whittle's popular index policy, which is often nearly optimal, provided indexability (index existence) is proven, which has been recently accomplished in some models. We aim to extend the application scope of Whittle's index policy in a broader AoI scheduling model. We address a model with no buffers incorporating random packet arrivals, unreliable channels, and nondecreasing AoI costs. We use sufficient indexability conditions based on partial conservation laws previously introduced by the author to establish the model's indexability and evaluate its Whittle index in closed form under discounted and average cost criteria. We further use the index formulae to draw insights on how scheduling priority depends on model parameters.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) on a finite state-action space with a long-run risk-sensitive criterion used as the objective function. We discuss the concept of Blackwell optimality and comment on intricacies which arise when the risk-neutral expectation is replaced by the risk-sensitive entropy. Also, we show the relation between the Blackwell optimality and ultimate stationarity and provide an illustrative example that helps to better understand the structural difference between these two concepts.</description>

      <title>Classical Optimal Designs for Stationary Diffusion with Multiple Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal design problems for stationary diffusion involving one or more state equations and mixtures of an arbitrary number of anisotropic materials. Since such problems typically do not admit classical solutions, we adopt a homogenization-based relaxation framework.
  The objective considered is the maximization of a weighted sum of the energies associated with each state equation, with particular emphasis on identifying cases in which the optimal design is classical, that is, of bang-bang type, composed solely of the original pure materials. Such cases provide valuable benchmarks for numerical methods in optimal design.
  A simplified optimization problem expressed in terms of local material proportions is analyzed through a dual formulation in terms of fluxes. Using a saddle-point characterization, we establish a complete description of its optimal solutions. The proposed approach is applied in detail to spherically symmetric problems. In the case of a ball, the method yields explicit classical solutions of the homogenization-based relaxation problem.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior of solutions to fluid dynamic shape optimization problems via phase-field method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long time behavior of solutions to a shape and topology optimization problem with respect to the time-dependent Navier--Stokes equations. The sought topology is represented by a stationary phase-field that represents a smooth indicator function. The fluid equations are approximated by a porous media approach and are time-dependent. In the latter aspect, the considered problem formulation extends earlier work.
  We prove that if the time horizon tends to infinity, minima of the time-dependent problem converge towards minima of the corresponding stationary problem. To do so, a convergence rate with respect to the time horizon, of the values of the objective functional, is analytically derived. This allowed us to prove that the solution to the time-dependent problem converges to a phase-field, as the time horizon goes to infinity, which is proven to be a minimizer for the stationary problem. We validate our results by numerical investigation.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Optimal Control of Species Augmentation for Predator-Prey Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Species augmentation is one of the methods used to promote biodiversity and prevent endangered species loss and extinction. The current work applies discrete-time optimal control theory to two models of species augmentation for predator-prey relationships. In discrete-time models, the order in which events occur can give different qualitative results. Two models representing different orders of events of optimal augmentation timing are considered. In one model, the population grows and predator-prey action occurs before the translocation of reserve species for augmentation. In the second model, the augmentation happens first and is followed by growth and then predator-prey action.
  The reserve and target populations are subjected to strong Allee effects. The optimal augmentation models employed in this work aim to maximize the prey (target population) and reserve population at the final time and minimize the associated cost at each time step. Numerical simulations in the two models are conducted using the discrete version of the forward-backward sweep method and the sequential quadratic programming iterative method, respectively. The simulation results show different population levels in the two models under varying parameter scenarios. Objective functional values showing percentage increases with optimal controls are calculated for each simulation. Different optimal augmentation strategies for the two orders of events are discussed. This work represents the first optimal augmentation results for models incorporating the predator-prey relationship with discrete events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adjoint method is an efficient way to numerically compute gradients in optimization problems with constraints, but is only formulated to differentiable cost and constraint functions on real variables. With the introduction of complex variables, which occur often in many inverse problems in electromagnetism and signal processing problems, both the cost and constraint can become non-holomorphic and hence non-differentiable in the standard definitions. Using the notion of CR-calculus, a generalized adjoint method is introduced that can compute the direction of steepest ascent for the cost function while enforcing the constraint even if both are non-holomorphic.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning of Parametric Approximation for Security-Constrained DC-OPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a self-supervised learning framework for approximating the Security-Constrained DC Optimal Power Flow (SC-DCOPF) problem using a parametric linear model. The approach preserves the physical structure of the DC-OPF while incorporating demand-dependent tunable parameters that scale transmission line limits. These parameters are predicted via a Graph Neural Network and optimized through differentiable layers, enabling direct training from contingency costs without requiring labeled data. The framework integrates pre- and post-contingency optimization layers into an implicit loss function. Numerical experiments on benchmark systems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high dispatch accuracy, low cost approximation error, and strong data efficiency, outperforming semi-supervised and end-to-end baselines. This scalable and interpretable approach offers a promising solution for real-time secure power system operations.</description>

      <title>LQ Mean Field Games with Common Noise in Hilbert Spaces: Small and Arbitrary Finite Time Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the results of (Liu and Firoozi, 2025), which develops the theory of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games in Hilbert spaces, by incorporating a common noise. This common noise is an infinite-dimensional Wiener process affecting the dynamics of all agents. In the presence of common noise, the mean-field consistency condition is characterized by a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic evolution equations (FBSEEs) in Hilbert spaces, whereas in its absence, it is represented by forward-backward deterministic evolution equations. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the coupled linear FBSEEs associated with the LQ MFG setting for small time horizons and prove the $\epsilon$-Nash property of the resulting equilibrium strategy. Furthermore, for the first time in the literature, we develop an analysis that establishes the well-posedness of these coupled linear FBSEEs in Hilbert spaces, for which only mild solutions exist, over arbitrary finite time horizons.</description>

      <title>Hidden convexity of quadratic systems and its application to quadratic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present sufficient conditions ensuring that the sum of the image of quadratic functions and the nonnegative orthant is convex. The hidden convexity of the trust-region problem with linear inequality constraints is established under a newly proposed assumption, which is compared with the previous one in [{\it Math. Program. 147, 171--206, 2014}]. We also provide a complete proof of the hidden convexity of a system of two quadratic functions in [{\it J. Glob. Optim. 56, 1045--1072, 2013}]. Furthermore, necessary and sufficient conditions for the S-lemma concerning systems of quadratic inequalities are investigated. Finally, we derive necessary and sufficient global optimality conditions and strong duality results for quadratic programming.</description>

      <title>Control policies for a two-stage queueing system with parallel and single server options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-stage tandem service queue attended by two servers. Each job-server pair must complete both service phases together, with the server unable to begin a new job until the current one is fully processed after two stages. Immediately after the first phase of service, the server decides whether to send the job/customer to a downstream station that allows parallel processing or to a single-service facility that offers faster or higher-quality service but handles only one job at a time. This choice determines whether the second phase commences immediately or (potentially) after waiting in a queue for the single-service facility to become available.
  The decision-making scenario is modeled via a Markov decision process formulation, of a clearing system with holding costs at each station. We fully characterize the structural properties of an optimal control policy based on the relationship between the service rates at the downstream stations. A numerical study highlights the significance of optimal control by comparing its performance against several natural heuristic policies.</description>

      <title>Balancing Independent and Collaborative Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-type server queueing system where flexible Type-I servers, upon their initial interaction with jobs, decide in real time whether to process them independently or in collaboration with dedicated Type-II servers. Independent processing begins immediately, as does collaborative service if a Type-II server is available. Otherwise, the job and its paired Type-I server wait in queue for collaboration. Type-I servers are non-preemptive and cannot engage with new jobs until their current job is completed.
  We provide a complete characterization of the structural properties of the optimal policy for the clearing system. In particular, an optimal control is shown to follow a threshold structure based on the number of jobs in the queue before a Type-I first interaction and on the number of jobs in either independent or collaborative service.
  We propose simple threshold heuristics, based on linear approximations, for real-time decision-making. In much of the parameter and state spaces, we establish theoretical bounds that compare the thresholds proposed by our heuristics to those of optimal policies and identify parameter configurations where these bounds are attained. Outside of these regions, the optimal thresholds are infinite. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our heuristics, particularly when the initial queue length is high. Our proposed heuristics achieve costs within 0.5% of the optimal policy on average and significantly outperform benchmark policies that exhibit extreme sensitivity to system parameters, sometimes incurring costs exceeding 100% of the optimal.</description>

      <title>Distributed Coverage Control on Poriferous Surface via Poly-Annulus Conformal Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent non-convexity of poriferous surfaces typically entraps agents in local minima and complicates workload distribution. To resolve this, we propose a distributed diffeomorphic coverage control framework for the multi-agent system (MAS) in such surfaces. First, we establish a distributed poly-annulus conformal mapping that transforms arbitrary poriferous surfaces into a multi-hole disk. Leveraging this topological equivalence, a collision-free sectorial partition mechanism is designed in the multi-hole disk, which rigorously induces strictly connected subregions and workload balance on the poriferous surfaces. This mechanism utilizes a buffer-based sequence mechanism to ensure strict topological safety when bypassing obstacles. Furthermore, a pull-back Riemannian metric is constructed to define the length metric that encodes safety constraints. Based on this metric, a distributed gradient-based control law is synthesized to drive agents toward optimal configurations, ensuring simultaneous obstacle avoidance and coverage optimization. Theoretical analyses guarantee the Input-to-State Stability (ISS) of the partition dynamics and the asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations confirm the reachability and robustness of the proposed coverage algorithm, offering a scalable solution for distributed coverage in poriferous surfaces.</description>

      <title>A turnpike property in an eigenvalue optimization problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a constrained eigenvalue optimization problem that arises in an important nonlinear dynamical model for mRNA translation in the cell. We prove that the ordered list of optimal parameters admits a turnpike property, namely, it includes three parts with the first and third part relatively short, and the values in the middle part are all approximately equal. Turnpike properties have attracted considerable attention in econometrics and optimal control theory, but to the best of our knowledge this is the first rigorous proof of such a structure in an eigenvalue optimization problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a data-driven framework for the design of stabilizing controllers from input-output data in the continuous-time, linear, and time-invariant domain. Rather than relying on measurements or reliable estimates of input and output time derivatives, the proposed approach uses filters to derive a parameterization of the system dynamics. This parameterization is amenable to the application of linear matrix inequalities enabling the design of stabilizing output feedback controllers from input-output data and the knowledge of the order of the system.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Geometry of an L-Shaped Building to Enhance Energy Efficiency and Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric form of a building strongly influences its material use, heat losses, and energy efficiency. This paper presents an analytical optimization of L-shaped residential buildings aimed at minimizing the external surface area for a prescribed volume. Both symmetric and asymmetric configurations are examined under realistic design constraints, including fixed or bounded wing aspect ratios and fixed building height. Using explicit optimization methods and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, closed-form expressions for the optimal geometric parameters and minimal envelope area are derived. The results show that unconstrained optimization leads to degenerate cuboid shapes, highlighting the importance of geometric constraints to preserve the L-shaped form. The obtained results provide practical design guidelines for architects and engineers, supporting informed early stage decisions that balance functional requirements, regulatory constraints, architectural intent, and energy performance. Case studies of existing houses demonstrate that the proposed approach can reduce external surface area or confirm near-optimality of practical designs, supporting energy-efficient early-stage architectural decisions.</description>

      <title>From geometry to sustainability: Optimal shapes of hip roof houses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a rigorous mathematical framework for the optimization of hip roof house geometry, with the primary goal of minimizing the external surface of the building envelope for a given set of design constraints. Five optimization scenarios are systematically analyzed: fixed volume, fixed footprint ratio, fixed slenderness ratio, fixed floor area, and constrained height. For each case, explicit formulas for the optimal dimensions are derived, offering architects and engineers practical guidelines for improving material efficiency, reducing construction costs, and enhancing energy performance. To illustrate the practical relevance of the theoretical results, case studies of real-world hip roof houses are presented, revealing both inefficiencies in common practice and near-optimal examples. Furthermore, a freely available software application has been developed to support designers in applying the optimization methods directly to architectural projects. The findings confirm that square-based footprints combined with balanced slenderness ratios yield the most efficient forms, while deviations toward elongated or flattened proportions significantly increase energy and material demands. This work demonstrates how mathematical modeling and architectural design can be integrated to support sustainable architecture, providing both theoretical insight and practical tools for shaping energy-efficient, cost-effective, and aesthetically coherent residential buildings.</description>

      <title>Designing sustainable barn-type houses: Optimal shapes for minimal envelope and energy use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barn-type houses have become one of the most popular single-family housing typologies in Poland and across Europe due to their simplicity, functionality, and potential for energy efficiency. Despite their widespread use, systematic methods for optimizing their geometry in terms of envelope area and energy performance remain limited. This paper develops a rigorous mathematical framework for determining the optimal proportions of barn-type houses with respect to minimizing the external surface area while satisfying constraints of either fixed volume or fixed floor area. Closed-form solutions for the optimal width, length, and height are derived as explicit functions of the roof slope, together with formulas for the minimal achievable surface. A recently introduced dimensionless compactness measure is also calculated, allowing quantitative assessment of how far a given design deviates from the theoretical optimum. The methodology is applied to case studies of three existing houses, showing that while some designs deviate significantly from optimal compactness, others already closely approximate it. The results confirm that theoretical optimization can lead to meaningful reductions in construction costs and energy demand. To support practical implementation, two original freely available software tools were developed, enabling architects and engineers to perform optimization analyses.</description>

      <title>A Bregman Regularized Proximal Point Method for Solving Equilibrium Problems on Hadamard Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a Bregman regularized proximal point algorithm for solving monotone equilibrium problems on Hadamard manifolds. It has been shown that the regularization term induced by a Bregman function is, in general, nonconvex on Hadamard manifolds unless the curvature is zero. Nevertheless, we prove that the proposed Bregman regularization scheme does converge to a solution of the equilibrium problem on Hadamard manifolds in the presence of a strong assumption on the convexity of the set formed by the regularization term. Moreover, we employ a coercivity condition on the Bregman function which is weaker than those typically assumed in the existing literature on Bregman regularization. Numerical experiments on illustrative examples demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a delayed forward-backward stochastic control system in which all the coefficients depend on the state and control terms, and the control domain is not necessarily convex. A global stochastic maximum principle is obtained by using a new method. More precisely, this method introduces first-order and second-order auxiliary equations and offers a novel approach to deriving the adjoint equations as well as the variational equation for $y^\e - y^*$.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow for Finding E-optimal Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of Wasserstein gradient flows for finding an $E$-optimal design for a regression model. Unlike the commonly used $D$- and $L$-optimality criteria, the $E$-criterion finds a design that maximizes the smallest eigenvalue of the information matrix, and so it is a non-differentiable criterion unless the minimum eigenvalue has geometric multiplicity equals to one. Such maximin design problems abound in statistical applications and present unique theoretical and computational challenges. Building on the differential structure of the $2$-Wasserstein space, we derive explicit formulas for the Wasserstein gradient of the $E$-optimality criterion in the simple-eigenvalue case. For higher multiplicities, we propose a Wasserstein steepest ascent direction and show that it can be computed exactly via a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. We develop particle approximations that connect infinite-dimensional flows with finite-dimensional optimization, and provide approximation guarantees for empirical measures. Our framework extends naturally to constrained designs via projected Wasserstein gradient flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods successfully recover $E$-optimal designs for both linear and nonlinear regression models, with competitive accuracy and scalability compared to existing heuristic approaches. This work highlights the potential of optimal transport-based dynamics as a unifying tool for studying challenging optimal design problems.</description>

      <title>On Analyzing the Conditions for Stability of Opportunistic Supply Chains Under Network Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even large firms such as Walmart, Apple, and Coca-Cola face persistent fluctuations in costs, demand, and raw material availability. These are not \textit{rare events} and cannot be evaluated using traditional disruption models focused on infrequent events. Instead, sustained volatility induces opportunistic behavior, as firms repeatedly reconfigure partners in absence of long-term contracts, often due to trust deficits. The resulting web of transient relationships forms opportunistic supply chains (OSCs). To capture OSC evolution, we develop an integrated mathematical framework combining a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model to represent stochastic price volatility, a Bayesian learning model to describe adaptive belief updates regarding partner reliability, and a Latent Order Logistic (LOLOG) network model for endogenous changes in network structure. This framework is implemented in an agent-based simulation to examine how volatility, trust, and network structure jointly shape SC resilience. Our modeling approach identifies critical volatility threshold; a tipping point beyond which the network shifts from a stable, link-preserving regime to a fragmented regime marked by rapid relationship dissolution. We analytically establish monotonic effects of volatility on profitability, trust, and link activation; derive formal stability conditions and volatility-driven phase transitions, and show how these mechanisms shape node importance and procurement behavior. These theoretical mechanisms are illustrated through computational experiments reflecting industry behaviors in fast fashion, electronics, and perishables. Overall, our contribution is to develop an integrated GBM-Bayesian-LOLOG framework to analyze OSC stability and our model can be extended to other OSCs including humanitarian, pharmaceutical, and poultry networks.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Black-Box Optimization (PBBO): Theory and the Model-Based Algorithm DFOp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on solving unconstrained privacy-preserving black-box optimization (PBBO), its corresponding least Frobenius norm updating of quadratic models, and the differentially privacy mechanisms for PBBO. Optimization problems with transformed/encrypted objective functions aim to minimize F(x), which is encrypted/transformed/encrypted to F_k(x) as the output at the k-th iteration. A new derivative-free solver named DFOp, with its implementation, is proposed in this paper, which has a new updating formula for the quadratic model functions. The convergence of DFOp for solving problems with transformed/encrypted objective functions is given. Other analyses, including the new model updating formula and the analysis of the transformation's impact to model functions are presented. We propose two differentially private noise-adding mechanisms for privacy-preserving black-box optimization. Numerical results show that DFOp performs better than compared algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, DFOp is the first derivative-free solver that can solve black-box optimization problems with step-encryption and privacy-preserving black-box problems exactly, which also tries to answer the open question about the combination of derivative-free optimization and privacy.</description>

      <title>The global well-posedness for master equations of mean field games of controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we establish the global well-posedness for master equations of mean field games of controls, where the interaction is through the joint law of the state and control. Our results are proved under two different conditions: the Lasry-Lions monotonicity and the displacement $\lambda$-monotonicity, both considered in their integral forms. We provide a detailed analysis of both the differential and integral versions of these monotonicity conditions for the corresponding nonseparable Hamiltonian and examine their relation. The proof of global well-posedness relies on the propagation of these monotonicity conditions in their integral forms and a priori uniform Lipschitz continuity of the solution with respect to the measure variable.</description>

      <title>Least-Squares Multi-Step Koopman Operator Learning for Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MPC is widely used in real-time applications, but practical implementations are typically restricted to convex QP formulations to ensure fast and certified execution. Koopman-based MPC enables QP-based control of nonlinear systems by lifting the dynamics to a higher-dimensional linear representation. However, existing approaches rely on single-step EDMD. Consequently, prediction errors may accumulate over long horizons when the EDMD operator is applied recursively. Moreover, the multi-step prediction loss is nonconvex with respect to the single-step EDMD operator, making long-horizon model identification particularly challenging. This paper proposes a multi-step EDMD framework that directly learns the condensed multi-step state-control mapping required for Koopman-MPC, thereby bypassing explicit identification of the lifted system matrices and subsequent model condensation. The resulting identification problem admits a convex least-squares formulation. We further show that the problem decomposes across prediction horizons and state coordinates, enabling parallel computation and row-wise $\ell_1$-regularization for automatic dictionary pruning. A non-asymptotic finite-sample analysis demonstrates that, unlike one-step EDMD, the proposed method avoids error compounding and yields error bounds that depend only on the target multi-step mapping. Numerical examples validate improved long-horizon prediction accuracy and closed-loop performance.</description>

      <title>A Constraint Programming Model for the Super-Agile Earth Observation Satellite Imaging Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the dependence on satellite imaging continues to grow, modern satellites have become increasingly agile, with the new generation, namely super-agile Earth observation satellites (SAEOS), providing unprecedented imaging flexibility. The highly dynamic capabilities of these satellites introduce additional challenges to the scheduling of observation tasks, as existing approaches for conventional agile satellites do not account for variable observation durations and multiple imaging directions. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, the SAEOS imaging scheduling problem (SAEOS-ISP) remains largely unexplored, and no exact approaches have yet been proposed. In this context, this study presents the first exact Constraint Programming formulation for the SAEOS-ISP, considering flexible observation windows, multiple pointing directions and sequence-dependent transition times across multiple satellites. Computational experiments on a newly generated benchmark set demonstrate that the model can be solved efficiently and within very short computational times. Moreover, the results also show that the proposed approach has the potential to achieve higher computational performance compared to the non-exact approaches that are currently considered state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Scheduling Problems in Robotic Process Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the growing domain of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) problems. Motivated by scheduling problems arising in RPA, we study the parameterized complexity of the single-machine problem $1|\text{prec},r_j,d_j|*$. We focus on parameters naturally linked to RPA systems, including chain-like precedences, the number of distinct processing times, and the structure of the time windows. We show that the problem is W[2]-hard parameterized by the number of chains, even with only two prescribed processing times and two distinct time-window lengths. This hardness remains even for distinct processing times and time windows under prec-consistent time windows. On the positive side, we obtain polynomial-time algorithm when all jobs share a single time-window length and FPT when the processing times, release times and deadlines are chain-uniform. We also show that the problem lies in XP when parameterized by the width of the precedence relation.</description>

      <title>Solvability of The Output Corridor Control Problem by Pulse-Modulated Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of maintaining the output of a positive time-invariant single-input single-output system within a predefined corridor of values is treated. For third-order plants possessing a certain structure, it is proven that the problem is always solvable under stationary conditions by means of pulse-modulated feedback. The obtained result is utilized to assess the feasibility of patient-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models with respect to patient safety. A population of Wiener models capturing the dynamics of a neuromuscular blockade agent is studied to investigate whether or not they can be driven into the desired output corridor by clinically acceptable sequential drug doses (boluses). It is demonstrated that low values of a parameter in the nonlinear pharmacodynamic part lie behind the detected model infeasibility.</description>

      <title>One-Sided Matrix Completion from Ultra-Sparse Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix completion is a classical problem that has received recurring interest across a wide range of fields. In this paper, we revisit this problem in an ultra-sparse sampling regime, where each entry of an unknown, $n\times d$ matrix $M$ (with $n \ge d$) is observed independently with probability $p = C / d$, for a fixed integer $C \ge 2$. This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\top} M / n$.
  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance. When the row vectors of $M$ are drawn uniformly from a rank-$r$ factor model satisfying an incoherence condition, we prove that if $n \ge O({d r^5 \epsilon^{-2} C^{-2} \log d})$, any local minimum of the gradient-descent objective is approximately global and recovers $T$ with error at most $\epsilon^2$.
  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our approach. On three MovieLens datasets, our algorithm reduces bias by $88\%$ relative to baseline estimators. We also empirically validate the linear sampling complexity of $n$ relative to $d$ on synthetic data. On an Amazon reviews dataset with sparsity $10^{-7}$, our method reduces the recovery error of $T$ by $59\%$ and $M$ by $38\%$ compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>On the Provable Suboptimality of Momentum SGD in Nonstationary Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While momentum-based acceleration has been studied extensively in deterministic optimization problems, its behavior in nonstationary environments -- where the data distribution and optimal parameters drift over time -- remains underexplored. We analyze the tracking performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak heavy-ball and Nesterov) under uniform strong convexity and smoothness in varying stepsize regimes. We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Scheduling for Optimal Spot Instance Savings in the Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of scheduling delay-sensitive jobs over spot and on-demand cloud instances to minimize average cost while meeting an average delay constraint. Jobs arrive as a general stochastic process, and incur different costs based on the instance type. This work provides the first analytical treatment of this problem using tools from queuing theory, stochastic processes, and optimization. We derive cost expressions for general policies, prove queue length one is optimal for low target delays, and characterize the optimal wait-time distribution. For high target delays, we identify a knapsack structure and design a scheduling policy that exploits it. An adaptive algorithm is proposed to fully utilize the allowed delay, and empirical results confirm its near-optimality.</description>

      <title>The generalized Lax conjecture is true for topological reasons related to compactness, convexity and determinantal deformations of increasing products of pointwise approximating linear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a topological approach to prove the generalized Lax conjecture using the fact that determinants of sufficiently big symmetric linear pencils are able to express the rigidly convex sets of RZ polynomials of any degree $d$. Monicity of the representation is assessed through a topological argument that allows us to perturbate a sufficiently close linear approximation into a suitable nice determinantal multiple of the initial RZ polynomial with the same rigidly convex set. The perturbation can be smoothly performed. This fact is what will allow us to determine that the multiple obtained respects the initial rigidly convex sets. This argument provides thus a full proof of the generalized Lax conjecture. However, an effective proof providing the representation in nice terms seems far from reachable at this moment.</description>

      <title>HOT-POT: Optimal Transport for Sparse Stereo Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stereo vision between images faces a range of challenges, including occlusions, motion, and camera distortions, across applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and face analysis. Due to parameter sensitivity, further complications arise for stereo matching with sparse features, such as facial landmarks. To overcome this ill-posedness and enable unsupervised sparse matching, we consider line constraints of the camera geometry from an optimal transport (OT) viewpoint. Formulating camera-projected points as (half)lines, we propose the use of the classical epipolar distance as well as a 3D ray distance to quantify matching quality. Employing these distances as a cost function of a (partial) OT problem, we arrive at efficiently solvable assignment problems. Moreover, we extend our approach to unsupervised object matching by formulating it as a hierarchical OT problem. The resulting algorithms allow for efficient feature and object matching, as demonstrated in our numerical experiments. Here, we focus on applications in facial analysis, where we aim to match distinct landmarking conventions.</description>

      <title>Approximation Schemes for Sequential Hiring Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of this paper resides in providing novel algorithmic advances and analytical insights for the sequential hiring problem, a recently introduced dynamic optimization model where a firm adaptively fills a limited number of positions from a pool of applicants with known values and acceptance probabilities. While earlier research established a strong foundation -- notably an LP-based $(1 - \frac{e^{-k}k^k}{k!})$-approximation by Epstein and Ma (Operations Research, 2024) -- the attainability of superior approximation guarantees has remained a central open question.
  Our work addresses this challenge by establishing the first polynomial-time approximation scheme for sequential hiring, proposing an $O(n^{O(1)} \cdot T^{2^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^{2})}})$-time construction of semi-adaptive policies whose expected reward is within factor $1 - \epsilon$ of optimal. To overcome the constant-factor optimality loss inherent to earlier literature, and to circumvent intrinsic representational barriers of adaptive policies, our approach is driven by the following innovations:
  -- The block-responsive paradigm: We introduce block-responsive policies, a new class of decision-making strategies, selecting ordered sets (blocks) of applicants rather than single individuals, while still allowing for internal reactivity.
  -- Adaptivity and efficiency: We prove that these policies can nearly match the performance of general adaptive policies while utilizing polynomially-sized decision trees.
  -- Efficient construction: By developing a recursive enumeration-based framework, we resolve the problematic ``few-positions'' regime, bypassing a fundamental hurdle that hindered previous approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 3-dimensional polytope is called k-equiprojective if every planar projection along a direction non-parallel to any facet is a k-gon. In this article, we generalise equiprojectivity to higher dimensions and give a lower bound on the number of combinatorial types of equiprojective polytopes. We also establish the pathwise connectedness of a subset of the Grassmannian in the case of (d-2)-dimensional spaces with conditions on the explicit path. This makes it possible to extend the Hasan--Lubiw characterisation of equiprojectivity to higher dimensions. Equiprojectivity provides cases relevant to the study of the Shadow Vertex algorithm, showing there is no hope minimising the complexity of the projection. It also offers a reverse point of view on the usual study of planar projections of polytopes as the projections have a fixed size.</description>

      <title>Emissions and cost tradeoffs of time-matched clean electricity procurement under inter-annual weather variability: case study of hydrogen production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-matching requirements (TMRs) for clean electricity procurement are increasingly adopted in voluntary corporate sustainability initiatives and regulatory frameworks. While prior research has evaluated cost and emissions impacts of hourly vs. annual TMR, these studies typically rely on single-year weather scenarios that do not capture inter-annual variability in variable renewable energy (VRE) generation. We use a capacity expansion model to assess how inter-annual weather variability affects procurement-driven infrastructure investments, costs, and emissions for a grid-connected hydrogen producer under both annual and hourly time-matching strategies. Using a Texas case study, we compare deterministic (single weather scenario) and stochastic (nine weather scenarios) modeling approaches. Both procurement investments and cost and emissions outcomes are sensitive to weather scenario, with annual matching exhibiting greater sensitivity than hourly matching. Stochastic modeling finds higher cost premiums for hourly versus annual matching compared to deterministic modeling, though emissions trends remain directionally consistent. Demand flexibility through H2 storage is critical for lowering hourly matching cost premiums under weather-driven VRE variability. Partial hourly matching (e.g., 80-90% compliance) can modestly reduce costs while maintaining minimal emissions impacts. Finally, we examine how grid-level renewable portfolio standards (RPS) affect additionality and emissions. When stringent additionality is achieved via binding RPS constraints on non-H2 electricity demand, annual matching can produce emissions reductions comparable to hourly matching at lower cost.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Sequential Framework for Dynamic Inverse Problems via Model Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale dynamic inverse problems are often ill-posed due to model complexity and the high dimensionality of the unknown parameters. Regularization is commonly employed to mitigate ill-posedness by incorporating prior information and structural constraints. However, classical regularization formulations are frequently infeasible in this setting due to prohibitive memory requirements, necessitating sequential methods that process data and state information online, eliminating the need to form the full space-time problem. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient framework for reconstructing dynamic sequences of undersampled images from computerized tomography data that requires minimal hyperparameter tuning. The approach is based on a prior-informed, dimension-reduced Kalman filter with smoothing. While well suited for dynamic image reconstruction, practical deployment is challenging when the state transition model and covariance parameters must be initialized without prior knowledge and estimated in a single pass. To address these limitations, we integrate regularized motion models with expectation-maximization strategies for the estimation of state transition dynamics and error covariances within the Kalman filtering framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments on limited-angle and single-shot computerized tomography problems, highlighting improvements in reconstruction accuracy, memory efficiency, and computational cost.</description>

      <title>A uniformity principle for spatial matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platforms matching spatially distributed supply to demand face a fundamental design choice: given a fixed total budget of service range, how should it be allocated across supply nodes ex ante, i.e. before supply and demand locations are realized, to maximize fulfilled demand? We model this problem using bipartite random geometric graphs where $n$ supply and $m$ demand nodes are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]^k$ ($k \ge 1$), and edges form when demand falls within a supply node's service region, the volume of which is determined by its service range. Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching. We establish a uniformity principle: whenever one service range allocation is more uniform than the other, the more uniform allocation yields a larger expected matching. This principle emerges from diminishing marginal returns to range expanding service range, and limited interference between supply nodes due to bounded ranges naturally fragmenting the graph. For $k=1$, we further characterize the expected matching size through a Markov chain embedding and derive closed-form expressions for special cases. Our results provide theoretical guidance for optimizing service range allocation and designing incentive structures in ride-hailing, on-demand labor markets, and drone delivery networks.</description>

      <title>Fairness-informed Pareto Optimization : An Efficient Bilevel Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their promise, fair machine learning methods often yield Pareto-inefficient models, in which the performance of certain groups can be improved without degrading that of others. This issue arises frequently in traditional in-processing approaches such as fairness-through-regularization. In contrast, existing Pareto-efficient approaches are biased towards a certain perspective on fairness and fail to adapt to the broad range of fairness metrics studied in the literature. In this paper, we present BADR, a simple framework to recover the optimal Pareto-efficient model for any fairness metric. Our framework recovers its models through a Bilevel Adaptive Rescalarisation procedure. The lower level is a weighted empirical risk minimization task where the weights are a convex combination of the groups, while the upper level optimizes the chosen fairness objective. We equip our framework with two novel large-scale, single-loop algorithms, BADR-GD and BADR-SGD, and establish their convergence guarantees. We release badr, an open-source Python toolbox implementing our framework for a variety of learning tasks and fairness metrics. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the advantages of BADR over existing Pareto-efficient approaches to fairness.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning Benefits of Spectral Orthogonalization in Muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Muon optimizer, a matrix-structured algorithm that leverages spectral orthogonalization of gradients, is a milestone in the pretraining of large language models. However, the underlying mechanisms of Muon -- particularly the role of gradient orthogonalization -- remain poorly understood, with very few works providing end-to-end analyses that rigorously explain its advantages in concrete applications. We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior. Our theory formalizes the preconditioning effect induced by spectral orthogonalization, offering insight into Muon's effectiveness in these matrix optimization problems and potentially beyond.</description>

      <title>Small Gradient Norm Regret for Online Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new problem-dependent regret measure for online convex optimization with smooth losses. The notion, which we call the $G^\star$ regret, depends on the cumulative squared gradient norm evaluated at the decision in hindsight $\sum_{t=1}^T \|\nabla \ell(x^\star)\|^2$. We show that the $G^\star$ regret strictly refines the existing $L^\star$ (small loss) regret, and that it can be arbitrarily sharper when the losses have vanishing curvature around the hindsight decision. We establish upper and lower bounds on the $G^\star$ regret and extend our results to dynamic regret and bandit settings. As a byproduct, we refine the existing convergence analysis of stochastic optimization algorithms in the interpolation regime. Some experiments validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>StoTAM: Stochastic Alternating Minimization for Tucker-Structured Tensor Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank tensor sensing is a fundamental problem with broad applications in signal processing and machine learning. Among various tensor models, low-Tucker-rank tensors are particularly attractive for capturing multi-mode subspace structures in high-dimensional data. Existing recovery methods either operate on the full tensor variable with expensive tensor projections, or adopt factorized formulations that still rely on full-gradient computations, while most stochastic factorized approaches are restricted to tensor decomposition settings. In this work, we propose a stochastic alternating minimization algorithm that operates directly on the core tensor and factor matrices under a Tucker factorization. The proposed method avoids repeated tensor projections and enables efficient mini-batch updates on low-dimensional tensor factors. Numerical experiments on synthetic tensor sensing demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits favorable convergence behavior in wall-clock time compared with representative stochastic tensor recovery baselines.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effectiveness of Adult Hepatitis A Vaccination Strategies in Korea Under an Aging Susceptibility Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hepatitis A severity increases sharply with age, while Korea is experiencing a cohort shift in which low seroprevalence adult cohorts are aging into older, higher fatality age groups. This demographic and immunological transition creates an urgent policy question regarding how adult vaccination should be prioritized under resource constraints. We evaluated three adult vaccination scenarios targeting low seroprevalence age groups (S1) 20 to 39 years, (S2) 40 to 59 years, and (S3) 20 to 59 years. Using an age structured dynamic transmission model calibrated to Korean data, we derived dynamically feasible vaccination allocation trajectories under realistic capacity constraints using an optimal control framework and linked these trajectories to long term transmission model simulations. We conducted DALY based cost effectiveness analyses over a lifetime horizon from both healthcare system and societal perspectives, and characterized uncertainty using probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and cost effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). Robustness was examined using one way sensitivity analyses. In the base case, S2 consistently yields the most favorable and robust cost effectiveness profile under both perspectives, with the lowest ICER. S3 achieved the largest reduction in DALYs but requires substantially higher incremental costs, resulting in a higher ICER than S2. S1 produces the smallest DALY reduction and is the least efficient strategy. PSA and CEACs confirm that S2 remains the preferred option across most willingness to pay ranges. S2 offers the most balanced and robustly cost effective strategy in Korea, capturing substantial mortality reduction while limiting additional program costs. S3 may be justified when higher budgets or willingness to pay thresholds are acceptable, but S2 provides the clearest value for money under epidemiological and economic conditions.</description>

      <title>Eigensets of switching dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reachability sets of linear switching dynamical systems (systems of ODE with time-dependent matrices that take values from a given compact set) are analysed. An eigenset is a non-trivial compact set M that possesses the following property: the closure of the set of points reachable by trajectories starting in M in time t is equal to exp(at)M. This concept introduced in a recent paper of E.Viscovini is an analogue of an eigenvector for compact sets of matrices. We prove the existence of eigensets, analyse their structure and properties, and find ``eigenvalues'' a for an arbitrary system. The question which compact sets, in particular, which convex sets and polyhedra, can be presented as eigensets of suitable systems, is studied.</description>

      <title>Performance enhancing of hybrid quantum-classical Benders approach for MILP optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming problems are extensively used in industry for a wide range of optimization tasks. However, as they get larger, they present computational challenges for classical solvers within practical time limits. Quantum annealers can, in principle, accelerate the solution of problems formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization instances, but their limited scale currently prevents achieving practical speedups. Quantum-classical algorithms have been proposed to take advantage of both paradigms and to allow current quantum computers to be used in larger problems. In this work, a hardware-agnostic Benders' decomposition algorithm and a series of enhancements with the goal of taking the most advantage of quantum computing are presented. The decomposition consists of a master problem with integer variables, which is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem and solved with a quantum annealer, and a linear subproblem solved by a classical computer. The enhancements consist, among others, of different embedding processes that substantially reduce the pre-processing time of the embedding computation without compromising solution quality, a conservative handling of cut constraints, and a stopping criterion that accounts for the limited size of current quantum computers and their heuristic nature. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked against classical approaches using a D-Wave quantum annealer for a scalable family of transmission network expansion planning problems.</description>

      <title>A Control-Theoretic Perspective on Optimal High-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.07168v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a control-theoretic perspective on optimal tensor algorithms for minimizing a convex function in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. Given a function $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that is convex and twice continuously differentiable, we study a closed-loop control system that is governed by the operators $\nabla \Phi$ and $\nabla^2 \Phi$ together with a feedback control law $\lambda(\cdot)$ satisfying the algebraic equation $(\lambda(t))^p\|\nabla\Phi(x(t))\|^{p-1} = \theta$ for some $\theta \in (0, 1)$. Our first contribution is to prove the existence and uniqueness of a local solution to this system via the Banach fixed-point theorem. We present a simple yet nontrivial Lyapunov function that allows us to establish the existence and uniqueness of a global solution under certain regularity conditions and analyze the convergence properties of trajectories. The rate of convergence is $O(1/t^{(3p+1)/2})$ in terms of objective function gap and $O(1/t^{3p})$ in terms of squared gradient norm. Our second contribution is to provide two algorithmic frameworks obtained from discretization of our continuous-time system, one of which generalizes the large-step A-HPE framework and the other of which leads to a new optimal $p$-th order tensor algorithm. While our discrete-time analysis can be seen as a simplification and generalization of~\citet{Monteiro-2013-Accelerated}, it is largely motivated by the aforementioned continuous-time analysis, demonstrating the fundamental role that the feedback control plays in optimal acceleration and the clear advantage that the continuous-time perspective brings to algorithmic design. A highlight of our analysis is that we show that all of the $p$-th order optimal tensor algorithms that we discuss minimize the squared gradient norm at a rate of $O(k^{-3p})$, which complements the recent analysis.</description>

      <title>Invertibility Conditions for the Admittance Matrices of Balanced Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.04087v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The admittance matrix encodes the network topology and electrical parameters of a power system in order to relate the current injection and voltage phasors. Since admittance matrices are central to many power engineering analyses, their characteristics are important subjects of theoretical studies. This paper focuses on the key characteristic of \emph{invertibility}. Previous literature has presented an invertibility condition for admittance matrices. This paper first identifies and fixes a technical issue in the proof of this previously presented invertibility condition. This paper then extends this previous work by deriving new conditions that are applicable to a broader class of systems with lossless branches and transformers with off-nominal tap ratios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15894v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate two-player zero-sum stochastic differential games with an ergodic payoff, in which the diffusion coefficient does not need to be non-degenerate. We first establish the existence of a viscosity solution to the associated ergodic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equation under a dissipativity condition. With the help of this viscosity solution, we then derive estimates for the upper and the lower ergodic value functions by constructing a series of non-degenerate approximating processes combined with the sup- and inf-convolution techniques. Finally, we prove the existence of a value for the game under the Isaacs condition and provide its representation formulae. As an application, we study the pollution accumulation problem with a long-run average social welfare to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a connected network of finitely many agents working cooperatively to solve a min-max problem with convex-concave structure. We propose a decentralised first-order algorithm which can be viewed as a non-trivial combination of two algorithms: PG-EXTRA for decentralised minimisation problems and the forward reflected backward method for (non-distributed) min-max problems. In each iteration of our algorithm, each agent computes the gradient of the smooth component of its local objective function as well as the proximal operator of its nonsmooth component, following by a round of communication with its neighbours. Our analysis shows that the sequence generated by the method converges under standard assumptions with non-decaying stepsize.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that every polynomial function is mixed monotone globally with a polynomial decomposition function. For univariate polynomials, the decomposition functions can be constructed from the Gram matrix representation of polynomial functions. The tightness of polynomial decomposition functions is discussed. Several examples are provided. An example is provided to show that polynomial decomposition functions, in addition to being global decomposition functions, can be much tighter than local decomposition functions constructed using local Jacobian bounds. Furthermore, an example is provided to demonstrate the application to reachable set over-approximation.</description>

      <title>Virtual Holonomic and Nonholonomic Constraints on Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for virtual constraints on Lie groups, with emphasis on mechanical systems modeled as affine connection systems. Virtual holonomic and virtual nonholonomic constraints, including linear and affine nonholonomic constraints, are formulated directly at the level of the Lie algebra and characterized as feedback--invariant manifolds. For each class of constraint, we establish existence and uniqueness conditions for enforcing feedback laws and show that the resulting closed--loop trajectories evolve as the dynamics of mechanical systems endowed with induced constrained connections, generalizing classical holonomic and nonholonomic reductions. Beyond stabilization, the framework enables the systematic generation of low--dimensional motion primitives on Lie groups by enforcing invariant, possibly affine, manifolds and shaping nontrivial dynamical regimes. The approach is illustrated through representative examples, including quadrotor UAVs and a rigid body with an internal rotor, where classical control laws are recovered as special cases and affine constraint--induced motion primitives are obtained.</description>

      <title>Fast Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Gradient Method with Applications in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09660v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-time-scale optimization is a framework introduced in Zeng et al. (2024) that abstracts a range of policy evaluation and policy optimization problems in reinforcement learning (RL). Akin to bi-level optimization under a particular type of stochastic oracle, the two-time-scale optimization framework has an upper level objective whose gradient evaluation depends on the solution of a lower level problem, which is to find the root of a strongly monotone operator. In this work, we propose a new method for solving two-time-scale optimization that achieves significantly faster convergence than the prior arts. The key idea of our approach is to leverage an averaging step to improve the estimates of the operators in both lower and upper levels before using them to update the decision variables. These additional averaging steps eliminate the direct coupling between the main variables, enabling the accelerated performance of our algorithm. We characterize the finite-time convergence rates of the proposed algorithm under various conditions of the underlying objective function, including strong convexity, Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, and general non-convexity. These rates significantly improve over the best-known complexity of the standard two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithm. When applied to RL, we show how the proposed algorithm specializes to novel online sample-based methods that surpass or match the performance of the existing state of the art. Finally, we support our theoretical results with numerical simulations in RL.</description>

Abstract: Ensemble systems appear frequently in many engineering applications and, as a result, they have become an important research topic in control theory. These systems are best characterized by the evolution of their underlying state distribution. Despite the work to date, few results exist dealing with the problem of directly modifying (i.e., ``steering'') the distribution of an ensemble system. In addition, in most existing results, the distribution of the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be Gaussian. However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not always realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a Gaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem. In this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for first-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the system parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments. Linear system dynamics are considered using the method of power moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment system, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control inputs. Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control inputs from their corresponding power moments. We provide a numerical example to validate our theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Proximal ADMM for Nonconvex Linearly Constrained Composite Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an adaptive proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving linearly constrained, composite optimization problems under the assumption that the smooth component of the objective is weakly convex, while the non-smooth component is convex and block-separable. The proposed method is adaptive to all problem parameters, including smoothness and weak convexity constants, and allows each of its block proximal subproblems to be inexactly solved. Each iteration of our adaptive proximal ADMM consists of two steps: the sequential solution of each block proximal subproblem; and adaptive tests to decide whether to perform a full Lagrange multiplier and/or penalty parameter update(s). Without any rank assumptions on the constraint matrices, it is shown that the adaptive proximal ADMM obtains an approximate first-order stationary point of the constrained problem in a number of iterations that matches the state-of-the-art complexity for the class of proximal ADMM's. The three proof-of-concept numerical experiments that conclude the paper suggest our adaptive proximal ADMM enjoys significant computational benefits.</description>

      <title>Safety on the Fly: Constructing Robust Safety Filters via Policy Control Barrier Functions at Runtime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have proven to be an effective tool for performing safe control synthesis for nonlinear systems. However, guaranteeing safety in the presence of disturbances and input constraints for high relative degree systems is a difficult problem. In this work, we propose the Robust Policy CBF (RPCBF), a practical approach for constructing robust CBF approximations online via the estimation of a value function. We establish conditions under which the approximation qualifies as a valid CBF and demonstrate the effectiveness of the RPCBF-safety filter in simulation on a variety of high relative degree input-constrained systems. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of our method in compensating for model errors on a hardware quadcopter platform by treating the model errors as disturbances.

      <title>Two-stage Online Reusable Resource Allocation: Reservation, Overbooking and Confirmation Call</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-stage online reusable resource allocation problem over T days involving advance reservations and walk-ins. Each day begins with a reservation stage (Stage I), where reservation requests arrive sequentially. When service starts (Stage II), both reserved and walk-in customers arrive to check in and occupy resources for several days. Reserved customers can cancel without penalty before or during a confirmation call initiated by the decision maker (DM) before day's end. The DM must immediately accept or reject each booking or check-in request, potentially overbooking by accepting more reservations than capacity. An overbooking loss occurs if a reserved customer's check-in is rejected in Stage II; a reward is obtained for each occupied resource unit daily. Our goal is to develop an online policy that controls bookings and check-ins to maximize total revenue over the T-day horizon. We show that due to cancellation uncertainties and complex correlations between occupancy durations, any online policy incurs a regret of \Omega(T) compared to the offline optimal policy when the \textit{busy season} assumption does not hold. To address this, we introduce decoupled adaptive safety stocks, which use only single-day information to hedge against overbooking risks and reduce resource idling. Under the busy season condition, our policy decouples the overall offline optimal into single-day offline optimal policies. Consequently, the regret between our policy and the offline optimal decays exponentially with the time between the confirmation call and day's end, suggesting the DM can delay confirmation calls while maintaining near-optimal performance. We validate our algorithm through sythetic experiments and empirical data from an Algarve resort hotel.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Benders decomposition for solving a sequence of sample average approximation replications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sample average approximation (SAA) is a technique for obtaining approximate solutions to stochastic programs that uses the average from a random sample to approximate the expected value that is being optimized. Since the outcome from solving an SAA is random, statistical estimates on the optimal value of the true problem can be obtained by solving multiple SAA replications with independent samples. We study techniques to accelerate the solution of this set of SAA replications, when solving them sequentially via Benders decomposition. We investigate how to exploit similarities in the problem structure, as the replications just differ in the realizations of the random samples. Our extensive computational experiments provide empirical evidence that our techniques for using information from solving previous replications can significantly reduce the solution time of later replications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MPAX (Mathematical Programming in JAX), an open-source first-order solver for large-scale linear programming (LP) and convex quadratic programming (QP) built natively in JAX. The primary goal of MPAX is to exploit modern machine learning infrastructure for large-scale mathematical programming, while also providing advanced mathematical programming algorithms that are easy to integrate into machine learning workflows. MPAX implements two PDHG variants, r2HPDHG for LP and rAPDHG for QP, together with diagonal preconditioning, adaptive restarts, adaptive step sizes, primal-weight updates, infeasibility detection, and feasibility polishing. Leveraging JAX's compilation and parallelization ecosystem, MPAX provides across-hardware portability, batched solving, distributed optimization, and automatic differentiation. We evaluate MPAX on CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, and Google TPUs, observing substantial GPU speedups over CPU baselines and competitive performance relative to GPU-based codebases on standard LP/QP benchmarks. Our numerical experiments further demonstrate MPAX's capabilities in high-throughput batched solving, near-linear multi-GPU scaling for dense LPs, and efficient end-to-end differentiable training. The solver is publicly available at https://github.com/MIT-Lu-Lab/MPAX.</description>

      <title>Towards a constructive framework for control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive analysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their implementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In control engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered submerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and addressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be compromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms fail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required properties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov function, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even destabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with regards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical problems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control engineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should indeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The major contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in analysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which explicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite precision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous works is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization, approximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories, measurable selectors. Additionally, a new constructive version of the Danskin's theorem, which is crucial in adversarial defense, is presented.</description>

      <title>A Quadratically-Constrained Convex Approximation for the AC Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quadratically-constrained approximation (QCAC) of the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem. Unlike existing approximations like the DC-OPF, our model does not rely on typical assumptions such as high reactance-to-resistance ratio, near-nominal voltage magnitudes, or small angle differences, and preserves the structural sparsity of the original AC power flow equations, making it suitable for decentralized power systems optimization problems. To achieve this, we reformulate the AC-OPF problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program. The nonconvex terms are expressed as differences of convex functions, which are then convexified around a base point derived from a warm start of the nodal voltages. If this linearization results in a non-empty constraint set, the convexified constraints form an inner convex approximation. Our experimental results, based on Power Grid Library instances of up to 30,000 buses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the QCAC approximation with respect to other well-documented conic relaxations and a linear approximation. We further showcase its potential advantages over the well-documented second-order conic relaxation of the power flow equations in two proof-of-concept case studies: optimal reactive power dispatch in transmission networks and PV hosting capacity in distribution grids.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov analysis of Korpelevich's extragradient method with fast and flexible extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Lyapunov-based analysis of Korpelevich's extragradient method and show that it achieves an $o(1/k)$ last-iterate convergence rate of the constructed Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function simultaneously upper bounds several standard measures of optimality, which allows our analysis to sharpen existing last-iterate convergence guarantees for these measures. Moreover, the same analysis enables the design of a class of flexible extensions of the extragradient method in which extragradient steps are adaptively blended with user-specified directions via a Lyapunov-guided line-search procedure. These extensions retain global convergence under practical assumptions and can attain superlinear rates when the directions are chosen appropriately. Numerical experiments confirm the simplicity and efficiency of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Extreme-Scale EV Charging Infrastructure Planning for Last-Mile Delivery Using High-Performance Parallel Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses stochastic charger location and allocation problems under queue congestion for last-mile delivery using electric vehicles (EVs). The objective is to decide where to open charging stations and how many chargers of each type to install, subject to budgetary and waiting-time constraints. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program, where each station-charger pair is modeled as a multiserver queue with stochastic arrivals and service times to capture the notion of waiting in fleet operations. The model is extremely large, with billions of variables and constraints for a typical metropolitan area; even loading the model in solver memory is difficult, let alone solving it. To address this challenge, we develop a Lagrangian-based dual decomposition framework that decomposes the problem by station and leverages parallelization on high-performance computing systems, where the subproblems are solved by using a cutting plane method and their solutions are collected at the master level. We also develop a three-step rounding heuristic to transform the fractional subproblem solutions into feasible integral solutions. Computational experiments on data from the Chicago metropolitan area with hundreds of thousands of households and thousands of candidate stations show that our approach produces high-quality solutions in cases where existing exact methods cannot even load the model in memory. We also analyze various policy scenarios, demonstrating that combining existing depots with newly built stations under multiagency collaboration substantially reduces costs and congestion. These findings offer a scalable and efficient framework for developing sustainable large-scale EV charging networks.</description>

      <title>$k$-Inductive and Interpolation-Inspired Barrier Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two new types of barrier certificates that are based on multiple functions rather than a single one. A conventional barrier certificate for a stochastic dynamical system is a nonnegative real-valued function whose expected value does not increase as the system evolves. This requirement guarantees that the barrier certificate forms a nonnegative supermartingale and can be used to derive a lower bound on the probability that the system remains safe. A key advantage of such certificates is that they can be automatically searched for using tools such as optimization programs instantiated with a fixed template. When this search is unsuccessful, the common practice is to modify the template and attempt the synthesis again. Drawing inspiration from logical interpolation, we first propose an alternative framework that uses a collection of functions to jointly serve as a barrier certificate. We refer to this construct as an interpolation-inspired barrier certificate. Nonetheless, we observe that these certificates still require one function in the collection to satisfy a supermartingale condition. Motivated by recent work in the literature, we next combine k-induction with interpolation-inspired certificates to relax this supermartingale constraint. We develop a general and more flexible notion of barrier certificates, which we call k-inductive interpolation-inspired barrier certificates. This formulation encompasses multiple ways of integrating interpolation-inspired barrier certificates with k-induction. We highlight two specific instantiations among these possible combinations. For polynomial systems, we employ sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to synthesize the corresponding set of functions. Finally, through our case studies, we show that the proposed methods enable the use of simpler templates and yield tighter lower bounds on the safety probability.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Average Impulse Control with Mean Field Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes and explicitly solves a class of long-term average impulse control problems with a specific mean-field interaction. The underlying process is a general one-dimensional diffusion with appropriate boundary behavior. The model is motivated by applications such as the optimal long-term management of renewable resources and financial portfolio management. Each individual agent seeks to maximize her long-term average reward, which consists of a running reward and income from discrete impulses, where the unit intervention price depends on the market through a stationary supply rate, the specific mean field variable to be considered. In a competitive market setting, we establish the existence of and explicitly characterize an equilibrium strategy within a large class of policies under mild conditions. Additionally, we formulate and solve the mean field control problem, in which agents cooperate with each other, aiming to realize a common maximal long-term average profit. To illustrate the theoretical results, we examine a stochastic logistic growth model and a population growth model in a stochastic environment with impulse control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proximal safeguarded augmented Lagrangian method for minimizing the difference of convex (DC) functions over a nonempty, closed and convex set with additional linear equality as well as convex inequality constraints is presented. Thereby, all functions involved may be nonsmooth. Iterates (of the primal variable) are obtained by solving convex optimization problems as the concave part of the objective function gets approximated by an affine linearization. Under the assumption of a modified Slater constraint qualification, both convergence of the primal and dual variables to a generalized Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point is proven, at least on a subsequence. Numerical experiments and comparison with existing solution methods are presented using some classes of constrained and nonsmooth DC problems.</description>

      <title>Binno: A 1st-order method for Bi-level Nonconvex Nonsmooth Optimization for Matrix Factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a method for nonconvex, nonsmooth bi-level optimization and we introduce Binno, a first order method that leverages proximal constructions together with carefully designed descent conditions and variational analysis. Within this framework, Binno provably enforces a descent property for the overall objective surrogate associated with the bi-level problem. Each iteration performs blockwise proximal-gradient updates for the upper and the lower problems separately and then forms a calibrated, block-diagonal convex combination of the two tentative iterates. A linesearch selects the combination weights to enforce simultaneous descent of both level-wise objectives, and we establish conditions guaranteeing the existence of such weights together with descent directions induced by the associated proximal-gradient maps. We also apply Binno in the context of sparse low-rank factorization, where the upper level uses elementwise $\ell_1$ penalties and the lower level uses nuclear norms, coupled via a Frobenius data term. We test Binno on synthetic matrix and a real traffic-video dataset, attaining lower relative reconstruction error and higher peak signal-to-noise ratio than some standard methods.</description>

      <title>Cellular flow control design for mixing based on the least action principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a novel approach for the enhancement of fluid mixing via pure stirring strategies building upon the Least Action Principle (LAP) for incompressible flows. The LAP is formally analogous to the Benamou--Brenier formulation of optimal transport, but imposes an incompressibility constraint. Our objective is to find a velocity field, generated by Hamiltonian flows, that minimizes the kinetic energy while ensuring that the initial scalar distribution reaches a prescribed degree of mixedness by a finite time. This formulation leads to a ``point to set" type of optimization problem which relaxes the requirement on controllability of the system compared to the classic LAP framework. In particular, we assume that the velocity field is induced by a finite set of cellular flows that can be controlled in time. We justify the feasibility of this constraint set and leverage Benamou--Brenier's results to establish the existence of a global optimal solution. Finally, we derive the corresponding optimality conditions for solving the optimal time control and conduct numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our control design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nesterov accelerated gradient method, introduced in 1983, has been a cornerstone of optimization theory and practice. Yet the question of its point convergence had remained open. In this work, we resolve this longstanding open problem in the affirmative. The discovery of the proof was heavily assisted by ChatGPT, a proprietary large language model, and we describe the process through which its assistance was elicited.</description>

      <title>Integrating ethical, societal and environmental issues into algorithm design courses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This document, intended for computer science teachers, describes a case study that puts into practice a questioning of ethical, societal and environmental issues when designing or implementing a decision support system. This study is based on a very popular application, namely road navigation software that informs users of real-time traffic conditions and suggests routes between a starting point and a destination, taking these conditions into account (such as Waze). The approach proposes to intertwine technical considerations (optimal path algorithms, data needed for location, etc.) with a broader view of the ethical, environmental and societal issues raised by the tools studied. Based on the authors' experience conducting sessions with students over several years, this document discusses the context of such a study, suggests teaching resources for implementing it, describes ways to structure discussions, and shares scenarios in different teaching contexts.</description>

      <title>Sum of Squares Decompositions and Rank Bounds for Biquadratic Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study SOS properties of biquadratic forms. For the class of partially symmetric biquadratic forms, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for positive semi-definiteness and prove that every PSD partially symmetric biquadratic form is a sum of squares of bilinear forms. This extends the known result for fully symmetric biquadratic forms. We describe an efficient computational procedure for constructing SOS decompositions, exploiting the Kronecker-product structure of the associated matrix representation. We introduce simple biquadratic forms. For $m \ge 2$, we present a $m \times 2$ PSD biquadratic form and show that it can be expressed as the sum of $m+1$ squares, but cannot be expressed as the sum of $m$ squares. This provides a lower bound for sos rank of $m \times 2$ biquadratic forms, and shows that previously proved results that a $2 \times 2$ PSD biquadratic form can be expressed as the sum of three squares, and a $3 \times 2$ PSD biquadratic form can be expressed as the sum of four squares, are tight. We also present an $3 \times 3$ SOS biquadratic form, which can be expressed as the sum of six squares, but not the sum of five squares.We present a $2 \times 2$ PSD biquadratic form, and show that it can be expressed as the sum of three squares, but cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares. Furthermore, we present a $3 \times 2$ PSD biquadratic form, and show that it can be expressed as the sum of four squares, but cannot be expressed as the sum of three squares. These show that previously proved results that a $2 \times 2$ PSD biquadratic form can be expressed as the sum of three squares, and a $3 \times 2$ PSD biquadratic form can be expressed as the sum of four squares, are tight. Moreover, we establish a universal upper bound SOS-rank$(P) \le mn-1$ for any SOS biquadratic form, which improves the trivial bound $mn$ and is tight in small dimensions.</description>

      <title>System Availability Optimization: Integrating Quantity Discounts and Delivery Lead Time Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: The model allocates the system components orders to the suppliers to minimize the parts price and the system construction delay penalties and maximize the system availability during its use. It considers the quantity-based discount and variation of delivery lead time by ordering similar components. The model also reflects the prerequisite relationships between construction activities and calculates the delay penalty resulting from parts delivery lead time. Design/methodology/approach: This research presents a model for selecting suppliers of components of an industrial series-parallel multi-state system. A nonlinear binary mathematical program uses the Markov process results to select system components. It minimizes the total system construction phase costs, including the components' price, and the system construction delay penalty, and the system exploitation phase costs, including the system shutdown and working at half capacity. Findings: The model allocates the optimal orders for a typical industrial system's components, composing four elements. The proposed approach combines the nonlinear binary program and the Markov process results to optimize the system life cycle parameters, including the system construction cost and operational availability. Originality/value: Using the Markov chain results in binary nonlinear mathematical programming, this study attempts to strike the right balance between the construction phase's objectives and an industrial unit's operation phase.</description>

      <title>Infinite-horizon controllability scores for linear time-invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a numerically stable reformulation of controllability scoring based on a scaled controllability Gramian, which remains reliably computable even for unstable systems. The resulting optimization problems define dynamics-aware network centrality measures, referred to as the volumetric controllability score (VCS) and the average energy controllability score (AECS). Building on this stable reformulation, we derive the corresponding infinite-horizon problems, develop an algorithm to solve them, and highlight computational advantages over their finite-horizon counterparts. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the infinite-horizon VCS and AECS are unique and that the finite-horizon scores converge to them. We further show that VCS and AECS can differ markedly in this limit, because VCS enforces controllability of the full system, whereas AECS accounts only for the stable modes. Finally, numerical experiments on Laplacian dynamics illustrate this convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.02135v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy evaluation is an important instrument for the comparison of different algorithms in Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, even a precise knowledge of the value function $V^{\pi}$ corresponding to a policy $\pi$ does not provide reliable information on how far the policy $\pi$ is from the optimal one. We present a novel model-free upper value iteration procedure ({\sf UVIP}) that allows us to estimate the suboptimality gap $V^{\star}(x) - V^{\pi}(x)$ from above and to construct confidence intervals for \(V^\star\). Our approach relies on upper bounds to the solution of the Bellman optimality equation via the martingale approach. We provide theoretical guarantees for {\sf UVIP} under general assumptions and illustrate its performance on a number of benchmark RL problems.</description>

      <title>Expander graphs are globally synchronizing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12788v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model is fundamental to the study of synchronization. It consists of a collection of oscillators with interactions given by a network, which we identify respectively with vertices and edges of a graph. In this paper, we show that a graph with sufficient expansion must be globally synchronizing, meaning that a homogeneous Kuramoto model of identical oscillators on such a graph will converge to the fully synchronized state with all the oscillators having the same phase, for every initial state up to a set of measure zero. In particular, we show that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $p \geq (1 + \varepsilon) (\log n) / n$, the homogeneous Kuramoto model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n, p)$ is globally synchronizing with probability tending to one as $n$ goes to infinity. This improves on a previous result of Kassabov, Strogatz, and Townsend and solves a conjecture of Ling, Xu, and Bandeira. We also show that the model is globally synchronizing on any $d$-regular Ramanujan graph, and on typical $d$-regular graphs, for large enough degree $d$.</description>

      <title>On the Global Convergence of Risk-Averse Natural Policy Gradient Methods with Expected Conditional Risk Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10932v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular tool for controlling the risk of uncertain outcomes and ensuring reliable performance in highly stochastic sequential decision-making problems. While it has been shown that policy gradient methods can find globally optimal policies in the risk-neutral setting, it remains unclear if the risk-averse variants enjoy the same global convergence guarantees. In this paper, we consider a class of dynamic time-consistent risk measures, named Expected Conditional Risk Measures (ECRMs), and derive natural policy gradient (NPG) updates for ECRMs-based RL problems. We provide global optimality and iteration complexity of the proposed risk-averse NPG algorithm with softmax parameterization and entropy regularization under both exact and inexact policy evaluation. Furthermore, we test our risk-averse NPG algorithm on a stochastic Cliffwalk environment to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>Controlled Interacting Branching Diffusion Processes: Relaxed Formulation in the Mean-Field Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The focus of this article is studying an optimal control problem for branching diffusion processes. Initially, we introduce the problem in its strong formulation and expand it to include linearly growing drifts. Then, we present a relaxed formulation that provides a suitable characterization based on martingale measures. Considering weak controls, we prove they are equivalent to strong controls in the relaxed setting, and establish the equivalence between the strong and relaxed problem, under a Filippov--type convexity condition. Furthermore, by defining control rules, we can restate the problem as the minimization of a lower semi-continuous function over a compact set, leading to the existence of optimal controls both for the relaxed problem and the strong one. Finally, with a useful embedding technique, we show that the value function solves a system of HJB equations, establishing a verification theorem. We then apply it to a linear-quadratic example and a kinetic one.</description>

      <title>Hidden Minima in Two-Layer ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16819v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimization problem associated with training two-layer ReLU networks with \(d\) inputs under the squared loss, where the labels are generated by a target network. Recent work has identified two distinct classes of infinite families of minima: one whose training loss vanishes in the high-dimensional limit, and another whose loss remains bounded away from zero. The latter family is empirically avoided by stochastic gradient descent, hence \emph{hidden}, motivating the search for analytic criteria that distinguish hidden from non-hidden minima. A key challenge is that prior analyses have shown the Hessian spectra at hidden and non-hidden minima to coincide up to terms of order \(O(d^{-1/2})\), seemingly limiting the discriminative power of spectral methods. We therefore take a different route, studying instead certain curves along which the loss is locally minimized. Our main result shows that arcs emanating from hidden minima exhibit distinctive structural and symmetry properties, arising precisely from \(\Omega(d^{-1/2})\) eigenvalue contributions that are absent from earlier analyses.</description>

      <title>Few for Many: Tchebycheff Set Scalarization for Many-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization can be found in many real-world applications where some conflicting objectives can not be optimized by a single solution. Existing optimization methods often focus on finding a set of Pareto solutions with different optimal trade-offs among the objectives. However, the required number of solutions to well approximate the whole Pareto optimal set could be exponentially large with respect to the number of objectives, which makes these methods unsuitable for handling many optimization objectives. In this work, instead of finding a dense set of Pareto solutions, we propose a novel Tchebycheff set scalarization method to find a few representative solutions (e.g., 5) to cover a large number of objectives (e.g., $&gt;100$) in a collaborative and complementary manner. In this way, each objective can be well addressed by at least one solution in the small solution set. In addition, we further develop a smooth Tchebycheff set scalarization approach for efficient optimization with good theoretical guarantees. Experimental studies on different problems with many optimization objectives demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Optimization Insights into Deep Diagonal Linear Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based methods successfully train highly overparameterized models in practice, even though the associated optimization problems are markedly nonconvex. Understanding the mechanisms that make such methods effective has become a central problem in modern optimization. To investigate this question in a tractable setting, we study Deep Diagonal Linear Networks. These are multilayer architectures with a reparameterization that preserves convexity in the effective parameter, while inducing a nontrivial geometry in the optimization landscape. Under mild initialization conditions, we show that gradient flow on the layer parameters induces a mirror-flow dynamic in the effective parameter space. This structural insight yields explicit convergence guarantees, including exponential decay of the loss under a Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, and clarifies how the parametrization and initialization scale govern the training speed. Overall, our results demonstrate that deep diagonal over parameterizations, despite their apparent complexity, can endow standard gradient methods with well-behaved and interpretable optimization dynamics.</description>

      <title>The frequency $K_i$s for symmetrical traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19608v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frequency $K_i$s ($i\in[4,n]$) are studied for symmetric traveling salesman problem ($TSP$) to illustrate the structure properties of the edges in optimal Hamiltonian cycle ($OHC$). A frequency $K_i$ is computed with the set of ${{i}\choose{2}}$ optimal $i$-vertex paths with given endpoints (optimal $i$-vertex paths) in one corresponding $K_i$ in $K_n$. Given an $OHC$ edge related to $K_i$, it has certain frequency bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the frequency $K_i$, and that of an ordinary edge not in $OHC$ is smaller than $2(n-3)$. Moreover, given a frequency $K_i$ containing an $OHC$ edge related to $K_n$, the frequency of the $OHC$ edge is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the average case. It also found that the probability that an $OHC$ edge is contained in the optimal $i$-vertex paths increases according to $i\in [4, n]$ or keeps stable if it decreases from $i$ to $i+1\leq n$. As the frequency $K_i$s are used to compute the frequency of an edge, each $OHC$ edge reaches its own peak frequency at $i=P_0$ where $P_0=\frac{n}{2} + 2$ for even $n$ or $\frac{n+1}{2} + 1$ for odd $n$. For each ordinary edge out of $OHC$, the probability that they are contained in the optimal $i$-vertex paths decreases according to $i$, respectively, in the average case. Moreover, the average frequency of an ordinary edge will be smaller than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ if $i \geq 2i_d$ where $i_d$ is the smallest number meeting the condition $\frac{(n-2)(n-3) - (i_d-2)(i_d-3)}{(n-2)(n-3) - (i_d-1)(i_d-2)} \geq \sqrt{1 + \frac{2}{i_d(i_d+1)}}$ and $i_d = O(n^{\frac{4}{7}})$. Based on these findings, an algorithm is presented to find $OHC$ in $O(n^2i_d^42^{2i_d})$ time using dynamic programming. The experiments are executed to verify these findings with the benchmark $TSP$ instances.</description>

      <title>ADMM-Based Training for Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained momentum due to their high potential in time-series processing combined with minimal energy consumption. However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, the approximation introduced by the use of surrogate gradients leads to numerical imprecision, poor tracking of SNN firing times at training time, and, in turn, poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step function's non-differentiability by taking an entirely new approach with respect to gradient backpropagation. For the first time, we formulate the SNN training problem as an ADMM-based iterative optimization, derive closed-form updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence, its great potential, and discuss future and promising research directions to improve the method to different layer types and deeper architectures.</description>

      <title>RDA-PSO: A computational method to quantify the diffusive dispersal of insects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a computational method, called "Recapture of Diffusive Agents &amp; Particle Swarm Optimization" (RDA-PSO), designed to estimate the dispersal parameter of diffusive insects in mark-release-recapture (MRR) field experiments. In addition to describing the method, its properties are discussed, with particular focus on robustness in estimating the observed diffusion coefficient in the presence of uncertainty. It is shown that RDA-PSO provides a simple and reliable approach to quantify insect dispersal that can handle low recapture rates and uneven capture site distributions without the need for area corrections. Tests on synthetic data, for which the actual diffusion coefficient is known, show the method outperforms three techniques based on the solution of the diffusion equation, which are also introduced in this work. Examples of application to real field data for the yellow fever mosquito are provided.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hybrid Modeling: Incremental Identification and Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models are crucial for optimizing and controlling chemical processes, yet they often face significant limitations in terms of computational time, algorithm complexity, and development costs. Hybrid models, which combine mechanistic models with data-driven models (i.e. models derived via the application of machine learning to experimental data), have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. However, the identification of dynamic hybrid models remains difficult due to the need to integrate data-driven models within mechanistic model structures.
  We present an incremental identification approach for dynamic hybrid models that decouples the mechanistic and data-driven components to overcome computational and conceptual difficulties. Our methodology comprises four key steps: (1) regularized dynamic parameter estimation to determine optimal time profiles for flux variables, (2) correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between variables, (3) data-driven model identification using advanced machine learning techniques, and (4) hybrid model integration to combine the mechanistic and data-driven components. This approach facilitates early evaluation of model structure suitability, accelerates the development of hybrid models, and allows for independent identification of data-driven components.
  Three case studies are presented to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of our incremental approach in handling complex systems and scenarios with limited data.</description>

      <title>Modeling Hierarchical Spaces: A Review and Unified Framework for Surrogate-Based Architecture Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based problems involving mixed-variable inputs frequently feature domains that are hierarchical, conditional, heterogeneous, or tree-structured. These characteristics pose challenges for data representation, modeling, and optimization. This paper reviews extensive literature on these structured input spaces and proposes a unified framework that generalizes existing approaches.
  In this framework, input variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical. A variable is described as meta if its value governs the presence of other decreed variables, enabling the modeling of conditional and hierarchical structures. We further introduce the concept of partially-decreed variables, whose activation depends on contextual conditions.
  To capture these inter-variable hierarchical relationships, we introduce design space graphs, combining principles from feature modeling and graph theory. This allows the definition of general hierarchical domains suitable for describing complex system architectures.
  Our framework defines hierarchical distances and kernels to enable surrogate modeling and optimization on hierarchical domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness on complex system design problems, including a neural network and a green-aircraft case study. Our methods are available in the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0).</description>

      <title>A predictive modular approach to constraint satisfaction under uncertainty -- with application to glycosylation in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper proposes a modular-based approach to constraint handling in process optimization and control. This is partly motivated by the recent interest in learning-based methods, e.g., within bioproduction, for which constraint handling under uncertainty is a challenge. The proposed constraint handler, called predictive filter, is combined with an adaptive constraint margin and a constraint violation cost monitor to minimize the cost of violating soft constraints due to model uncertainty and disturbances. The module can be combined with any controller and is based on minimally modifying the controller output, in a least squares sense, such that constraints are satisfied within the considered horizon. The proposed method is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through a realistic case study of glycosylation constraint satisfaction in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production using Chinese hamster ovary cells, employing a metabolic network model consisting of 23 extracellular metabolites and 126 reactions. In the case study, the average constraint-violation cost is reduced by more than 60% compared to the case without the proposed constraint-handling method.</description>

      <title>Robustness of quantum algorithms: Worst-case fidelity bounds and implications for design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Errors occurring on noisy hardware pose a key challenge to reliable quantum computing. Existing techniques such as error correction, mitigation, or suppression typically separate the error handling from the algorithm analysis and design. In this paper, we develop an alternative, algorithm-centered framework for understanding and improving the robustness against errors. For a given quantum algorithm and error model, we derive worst-case fidelity bounds which can be efficiently computed to certify the robustness. We consider general error models including coherent and (Markovian) incoherent errors and allowing for set-based error descriptions to address uncertainty or time-dependence in the errors. Our results give rise to guidelines for robust algorithm design and compilation by optimizing our theoretical robustness measure. We demonstrate the practicality of the framework with numerical results on algorithm analysis and robust optimization, including the robustness analysis of a 50-qubit modular adder circuit.</description>

      <title>Learning to Solve Optimization Problems Constrained with Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables, and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints. This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation, heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control is central to designing spin manipulation pulses. Gradient-based pulse optimization can be facilitated by either accelerating gradient evaluation or enhancing the convergence rate. In this work, we accelerated single-spin optimal control by combining the finite element method with the method of moving asymptotes. By treating discretized time as spatial coordinates, the Liouville - von Neumann equation was reformulated as a linear system, efficiently yielding a joint solution of the spin trajectory and control gradient. The method of moving asymptotes, relying on the ensemble fidelities and gradients, achieves rapid convergence for a target fidelity of 0.995.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Saving under Risk Preference Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that wealthy households have substantially higher saving rates and markedly lower marginal propensity to consume (MPC) than other groups. Existing theory cannot account for this pattern unless under restrictive assumptions on returns, discounting, and preferences. This paper develops a general theory of optimal savings with preference shocks, allowing risk aversion to vary across states and over time, and shows that incorporating such heterogeneity in risk attitudes fundamentally reshapes the asymptotic dynamics of consumption and saving. In particular, zero asymptotic MPCs (100% asymptotic saving rates) arise under markedly weaker conditions than in existing theory. Strikingly, such outcomes occur whenever there is a positive probability that agents become less risk averse in the future. Therefore, the vanishing MPC emerges as a generic feature rather than a knife-edge result of the optimal savings model, offering a more theoretically robust and empirically consistent account of the saving behavior of wealthy households.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) for Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) require accurate state estimation with limited sensors. Uniform sampling often wastes resources across nodes with different uncertainty. We propose an adaptive framework combining LSTM forecasting and Conformal Prediction (CP) to estimate node-wise uncertainty and focus sensing on the most uncertain points. Marginal CP is used for its low computational cost, suitable for real-time DTs. Experiments on Hanoi, Net3, and CTOWN show 33--34\% lower demand error than uniform sampling at 40\% coverage and maintain 89.4--90.2\% empirical coverage with only 5--10\% extra computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a joint estimation method for the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) and the Noise Covariance Matrix (NCM) tailored for beamforming applications. Building upon an existing NCM framework, our approach simplifies the estimation procedure by deriving an quasi-linear solution, instead of the traditional exhaustive search. Additionally, we introduce a novel DoA estimation technique that operates across all frequency bins, improving robustness in reverberant environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms classical techniques, such as MUSIC, in mid- to high-angle scenarios, achieving lower angular errors and superior signal enhancement through beamforming. The proposed framework was also fared against other techniques for signal enhancement, having better noise rejection and interference canceling capabilities. These improvements are validated using both theoretical and empirical performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Threshold graphs are globally synchronizing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model describes phase oscillators on the unit circle whose interactions are encoded by a graph. Each edge acts like a spring that pulls adjacent oscillators toward each other whenever their phases differ. A central question is to determine which graphs are globally synchronizing, meaning that trajectories of the Kuramoto dynamics converge to the fully synchronized state from almost all initial conditions. This property is tightly linked to the benign nonconvexity of the model's energy landscape. Existing guarantees for global synchronization typically require every node to connect to sufficiently many neighbors, which in turn enforces rather homogeneous degree sequences and highly dense graphs. In this work, we identify threshold graphs as a class of graphs that lie outside this regime yet nevertheless exhibit global synchronization. More precisely, connected threshold graphs realize all admissible edge densities ranging from \(2/n\) to \(1\), and their degree sequences are maximally left-skewed among all graphs with the same edge density, when ordered in nonincreasing order. Our proof relies on a phasor-geometric analysis of the stationary points of the associated energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Heuristics for Combinatorial Optimization via Value-based Reinforcement Learning: A Unified Framework and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the 1990s, considerable empirical work has been carried out to train statistical models, such as neural networks (NNs), as learned heuristics for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. When successful, such an approach eliminates the need for experts to design heuristics per problem type. Due to their structure, many hard CO problems are amenable to treatment through reinforcement learning (RL). Indeed, we find a wealth of literature training NNs using value-based, policy gradient, or actor-critic approaches, with promising results, both in terms of empirical optimality gaps and inference runtimes. Nevertheless, there has been a paucity of theoretical work undergirding the use of RL for CO problems. To this end, we introduce a unified framework to model CO problems through Markov decision processes (MDPs) and solve them using RL techniques. We provide easy-to-test assumptions under which CO problems can be formulated as equivalent undiscounted MDPs that provide optimal solutions to the original CO problems. Moreover, we establish conditions under which value-based RL techniques converge to approximate solutions of the CO problem with a guarantee on the associated optimality gap. Our convergence analysis provides: (1) a sufficient rate of increase in batch size and projected gradient descent steps at each RL iteration; (2) the resulting optimality gap in terms of problem parameters and targeted RL accuracy; and (3) the importance of a choice of state-space embedding. Together, our analysis illuminates the success (and limitations) of the celebrated deep Q-learning algorithm in this problem context.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Proof of the Near Optimality of LogSumExp Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the design of smoothings of the (coordinate-wise) max function in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the infinity norm. The LogSumExp function $f(x)=\ln(\sum^d_i\exp(x_i))$ provides a classical smoothing, differing from the max function in value by at most $\ln(d)$. We provide an elementary construction of a lower bound, establishing that every overestimating smoothing of the max function must differ by at least $\sim 0.8145\ln(d)$. Hence, LogSumExp is optimal up to small constant factors. However, in small dimensions, we provide stronger, exactly optimal smoothings attaining our lower bound, showing that the entropy-based LogSumExp approach to smoothing is not exactly optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning algorithm for computing convex conjugates of differentiable convex functions, a fundamental operation in convex analysis with various applications in different fields such as optimization, control theory, physics and economics. While traditional numerical methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality and become computationally intractable in high dimensions, more recent neural network--based approaches scale better, but have mostly been studied with the aim of solving optimal transport problems and require the solution of complicated optimization or max--min problems. Using an implicit Fenchel formulation of convex conjugation, our approach facilitates an efficient gradient--based framework for the minimization of approximation errors and, as a byproduct, also provides a posteriori estimates of the approximation accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate our method's ability to deliver accurate results across different high-dimensional examples. Moreover, by employing symbolic regression with Kolmogorov--Arnold networks, it is able to obtain the exact convex conjugates of specific convex functions.</description>

Abstract: This work extends a previous study that introduced an algorithm for state estimation on manifolds within the framework of the Kalman filter. Its objective is to address the limitations of the earlier approach. The reversible Kalman filter was designed to provide a methodology for evaluating the accuracy of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary precision on synthetic data. It has favorable numerical properties on synthetic data, achieving arbitrary precision without relying on the small-velocity assumption and depending only on sensor noise. However, its application to real data encountered difficulties related to measurement noise, which was mitigated using a heuristic. In particular, the heuristic involved an event detection step switching between reversible Kalman filter and classical Kalman variant at chosen moments. In the present work, we propose a study of this detection step and propose a methodology to prove at which moment the reversible Kalman approach improves on classical multiplicative variant.</description>

      <title>Determining the Winner in Alternating-Move Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for determining the winner in two-player win-lose alternating-move games on trees, in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of the target set. We focus our study on special cases, including the Gale-Stewart game on the complete binary tree and a family of Schmidt games. Building on the Hausdorff dimension games originally introduced by Das, Fishman, Simmons, and Urba\'nski, which provide a game-theoretic approach for computing Hausdorff dimensions, we employ a generalized family of these games, and show that they are useful for analyzing sets underlying the win-lose games we study.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Tokenization: Optimization-Based Continuous-Time Tokens for Learnable Decision Policies in Noisy Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers are designed for discrete tokens, yet many real-world signals are continuous processes observed through noisy sampling. Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.</description>
