      <title>Collaboration for the Bioeconomy -- Evidence from Innovation Output in Sweden, 1970-2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaboration is expected to play a central role in the transition to a bioeconomy - a central pillar of a green economy. Such collaboration is supposed to connect traditional biomass processing firms with diverse actors in fields where biomass ought to substitute existing or create novel products and processes. This study analyzes the network of technology collaborations among innovating firms in Sweden between 1970 and 2021. The results reveal generally positive associations between direct and indirect ties, with meaningful increases in innovation output for each additional direct collaboration partner. Relationships between brokerage positions and innovation output were statistically insignificant, and cognitive proximity - while following theoretical expectations - materially insignificant. These associations are mostly equal between actors heavily invested in the bioeconomy and those focusing on other innovation areas, indicating that these actors operate under largely similar mechanisms linking collaboration and subsequent innovation output. These results suggest that stimulating collaboration broadly - rather than attempting to optimize collaboration compositions - could result in higher number of significant Swedish innovations, for bioeconomy and other sectors alike.</description>

      <title>Trimming of extreme votes and favoritism: Evidence from the field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite a large body of theoretical literature on voting mechanisms, there is no documented evidence from real-world panel evaluations about the effect of trimming the extreme votes on sincere voting. We provide the first such evidence by comparing subjective evaluations of experts from different countries in competitive settings with and without a trimming mechanism. In these evaluations, some of the evaluated subjects are experts' compatriots. Using data on 29,383 subjective evaluations, we find that experts assign significantly higher scores to their compatriots in panels without trimming. However, in panels with trimming, this favoritism is generally insignificant.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Resource Allocation with Karma: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system of non-tradable credits that flow between individuals like karma, hence proposed under that name, is a mechanism for repeated resource allocation that comes with attractive efficiency and fairness properties, in theory. In this study, we test karma in an online experiment in which human subjects repeatedly compete for a resource with time-varying and stochastic individual preferences or urgency to acquire the resource. We confirm that karma has significant and sustained welfare benefits even in a population with no prior training. We identify mechanism usage in contexts with sporadic high urgency, more so than with frequent moderate urgency, and implemented as a simple (binary) karma bidding scheme as particularly effective for welfare improvements: relatively larger aggregate efficiency gains are realized that are (almost) Pareto superior. These findings provide guidance for further testing and for future implementation plans of such mechanisms in the real world.</description>

      <title>AI Persuasion, Bayesian Attribution, and Career Concerns of Decision-Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies AI persuasion by distinguishing between two reasons for disagreement: attention differences, where the AI detects features the decision-maker missed, and comprehension differences, where the AI and the decision-maker interpret observed features differently. We show that AI is more effective in persuading the decision-maker when the disagreement is due to attention differences rather than comprehension differences. We also show that the AI's interpretability shapes how the decision-maker attributes the sources of disagreement and, in turn, whether they follow the AI's recommendation. Our main result is that making AI uninterpretable can actually enhance persuasion and, in the presence of career concerns, improve decision accuracy.</description>
