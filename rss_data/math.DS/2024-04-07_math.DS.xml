      <title>Odometers in non-compact spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an odometer in the Baire space. That is the non-compact space of one sided sequences of natural numbers. We go on to prove that it is topologically conjugated to the dyadic odometer restricted to an appropriate non-compact subset of the space of one sided sequences on two symbols. We extend the action of the odometer to finite words. It turns out that, arranging the finite words in appropriate binary tree, this extension runs through the tree from left-right and top-down. Several well known binary trees made out of rational numbers, such as the Kepler tree or the Calkin and Wilf tree, are recovered in this way. Indeed, it suffices to identify finite words with rational numbers by means of certain continued fractions. The odometric action allow us to recover, in a unified way, several counting results for the rational numbers. Moreover, associated to certain interval maps with countably many branches we construct their corresponding odometers. Explicit formulas are provided in the cases of the Gauss map (continued fractions) and the Renyi map (backward continued fractions).</description>

      <title>Authomorphic measures with negative exponents for multicritical circle maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authomorphic or $s$-measures for circle diffeomorphisms were introduced by R.Douady and J.-C. Yoccoz in 1999. They have multiple applications in circle dynamics, with the case $s=-1$ being particularly important for describing conjugacy classes. In arxiv:2306.13524, E. de Faria, P. Guarino and B. Nussenzveig proved existence and uniqueness of automorphic $s$-measures for multicritical circle maps for all $s&gt;0$. The purpose of this paper is to extend these results to $s$-measures with negative values of $s$. As an application, we prove a smoothness result for irrational Arnold tongues in families of multicritical maps.</description>

      <title>A Complete Mathematical Model For Trichoderma Fungi Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an unstructured mathematical model describing the growth kinetics of the Trichoderma fungus and the production of enzymes (cellulase) by degradation of a substrate (cellulose) in the rhizosphere. We integrate into this model the hydrolysis step of the organic matter and analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the obtained system. We show that our system evolves towards a global attractor consisting of infinite non-hyperbolic equilibria.</description>

      <title>On sncc-inheritance of pointwise almost periodicity in flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a subnormal co-compact closed subgroup of a Hausdorff topological group $T$ and $X$ a compact Hausdorff space. We prove the inheritance theorem: A point of $X$ is almost periodic (a.p.) for $T\curvearrowright X$ iff it is a.p. for $H\curvearrowright X$. Moreover, if $T\curvearrowright X$ is minimal with $H\lhd T$, then $\mathscr{O}_H\colon X\rightarrow2^X$, ${x\mapsto\overline{Hx}}$ is a continuous mapping, and, $T\curvearrowright X/H$ is an a.p. nontrivial factor of $T\curvearrowright X$ iff $T\curvearrowright X\times T/H$ is not minimal.</description>

      <title>Two bifurcation sets of expansive Lorenz maps with a hole at the critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be an expansive Lorenz map on $[0,1]$ and $c$ be the critical point. The survivor set we are discussing here is denoted as $S^+_{f}(a,b):=\{x\in[0,1]:f(b)\leq f^{n}(x) \leq f(a)\ \forall n\geq0\}$, where the hole $(a,b)\subseteq [0,1]$ satisfies $a\leq c \leq b$ and $a\neq b$. Let $a\in[0,c]$ be fixed, we mainly focus on the following two bifurcation sets: $$ E_{f}(a):=\{b\in[c,1]:S^{+}_{f}(a,\epsilon)\neq S^{+}_{f}(a,b) \ \forall \ \epsilon&gt;b\}, \ \ {\rm and} $$ $$ B_{f}(a):=\{b\in[c,1]:h_{top}(S^+_{f}(a,\epsilon))\neq h_{top}(S^+_{f}(a,b)) \ \forall \ \epsilon&gt;b\}. $$
  By combinatorial renormalization tools, we give a complete characterization of the maximal plateau $P(b)$ such that for all $\epsilon\in P(b)$, $h_{top}(S^+_{f}(a,\epsilon))=h_{top}(S^+_{f}(a,b))$. Moreover, we obtain a sufficient and necessary condition for $E_{f}(a)=B_{f}(a)$, which partially extends the results in \cite{allaart2023} and \cite{baker2020}.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb R$- and $\mathbb C$-supercyclicity for some classes of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of $\mathbb C$-supercyclic operators was introduced by Hilden and Wallen in \cite{hilden} and, since then, a multitude of variants have been studied. In \cite{herzog1992linear}, Herzog proved that every real or complex, separable, infinite dimensional Banach space supports a $\mathbb C$-supercyclic operator. In the present paper we investigate different variants of supercyclicity, precisely $\mathbb R^+$-, $\mathbb R$- and $\mathbb C$-supercyclicity in the context of composition operators. We characterize $\mathbb R$-supercyclic composition operators on $L^p$, $1 \leq p &lt; \infty$. Then, we turn our attention to dissipative composition operators, and we show that $\mathbb R$- and $\mathbb C$-supercyclicity are equivalent notions in this setting and they have a ``shift-like'' characterization.</description>

      <title>Meyer sets, Pisot numbers, and self-similarity in symbolic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aperiodic order refers to the mathematical formalisation of quasicrystals. Substitutions and cut and project sets are among their main actors; they also play a key role in the study of dynamical systems, whether they are symbolic, generated by tilings, or point sets. We focus here on the relations between quasicrystals and self-similarity from an arithmetical and dynamical viewpoint, illustrating how efficiently aperiodic order irrigates various domains of mathematics and theoretical computer science, on a journey from Diophantine approximation to computability theory. In particular, we see how Pisot numbers allow the definition of simple model sets, and how they also intervene for scaling factors for invariance by multiplication of Meyer sets. We focus in particular on the characterisation due to Yves Meyer: any Pisot or Salem number is a parameter of dilation that preserves some Meyer set.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of stable Lyapunov exponents for codimension one Anosov covering maps on nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Psi$ be an endomorphism of a nilmanifold $M = N/\Gamma$. We show that the preimages of a point under $\Psi$ become dense exponentially if and only if $\Psi$ is totally non-invertible, which means $(M, \Psi)$ has no invertible factors of quotients of factors. As an application, let $f$ be a non-invertible Anosov covering map on $M$ with one-dimensional stable bundle, if $f$ has such linear part $\Psi$ and is topologically conjugate to $\Psi$, then every periodic point of $f$ admits the same stable Lyapunov exponent with $\Psi$, and hence the conjugacy is automatically smooth along each stable leaf. Conversely, if $\Psi$ is horizontally irreducible, which means the induced horizontal toral endomorphism is irreducible, then $f$ admitting a constant periodic stable Lyapunov exponent implies that there exists a topological conjugacy to $\Psi$.
  In summary, for an Anosov covering map on a nilmanifold with one-dimensional stable bundle and totally non-invertible, horizontally irreducible linear part, we get the equivalence among the existence of invariant unstable bundle, the existence of topological conjugacy to linear part, and a constant periodic stable Lyapunov exponent.</description>

Abstract: We show that every Hardy field extends to an $\omega$-free Hardy field. This result relates to classical oscillation criteria for second-order homogeneous linear differential equations. It is essential in [12], and here we apply it to answer questions of Boshernitzan, and to generalize a theorem of his.</description>

Abstract: We prove that Jacobi and CMV matrices associated to generic continuous sampling functions have all gaps predicted by the Gap Labelling Theorem open. We also give a mechanism for generic gap opening for quasi-periodic analytic sampling functions in the subcritical region following from the analyticity of resonance tongue boundaries for both Jacobi and CMV matrices.</description>

      <title>Arboreal Galois groups for cubic polynomials with colliding critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field, and let $f\in K(z)$ be a rational function of degree $d\geq 2$. The Galois group of the field extension generated by the preimages of $x_0\in K$ under all iterates of $f$ naturally embeds in the automorphism group of an infinite $d$-ary rooted tree. In some cases the Galois group can be the full automorphism group of the tree, but in other cases it is known to have infinite index. In this paper, we consider a previously unstudied such case: that $f$ is a polynomial of degree $d=3$, and the two finite critical points of $f$ collide at the $\ell$-th iteration, for some $\ell\geq 2$. We describe an explicit subgroup $Q_{\ell,\infty}$ of automorphisms of the $3$-ary tree in which the resulting Galois group must always embed, and we present sufficient conditions for this embedding to be an isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity in the use of SIR models to fit epidemic incidence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When fitting a multi-parameter model to a data set, computer algorithms may suggest that a range of parameters provide equally reasonable fits, making the parameter estimation difficult. Here, we prove this fact for an SIR model. We say a set of parameter values is a good fit to outbreak data if the solution has the data's three most significant characteristics: the standard deviation, the mean time, and the total number of cases. In our model, in addition to the "basic reproduction number" $R_0$, three other parameters need to be estimated to fit a solution to outbreak data. We will show that those parameters can be chosen so that each gives a linear transformation of a solution's incidence data. As a result, we show that for every choice of $R_0&gt;1$, there is a good fit for each outbreak. We also illustrate our results by providing the least square best fits of the New York City and London data sets of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Furthermore, we show how versions of the SIR model with $N$ compartments have far more good fits- - indeed a high dimensional set of good fits -- for each target -- showing that more complicated models may have an even greater problem in overparametrizing outbreak characteristics.</description>

      <title>The effects of HIV self-testing on HIV incidence and awareness of status among men who have sex with men in the United States: Insights from a novel compartmental model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The OraQuick In-Home HIV self-test represents a fast, inexpensive, and convenient method for users to assess their HIV status. If integrated thoughtfully into existing testing practices, accompanied by efficient pathways to formal diagnosis, self-testing could both enhance HIV awareness and reduce HIV incidence. However, currently available self-tests are less sensitive, particularly for recent infection, than gold-standard laboratory tests. It is important to understand the impact if some portion of standard testing is replaced by self-tests. We introduced a novel compartmental model to evaluate the effects of self-testing among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States for the period 2020 to 2030. We varied the model for different screening rates, self-test proportions, and delays to diagnosis for those identified through self-tests to determine the potential impact on HIV incidence and awareness of status. When HIV self-tests are strictly supplemental, self-testing can decrease HIV incidence among MSM in the US by up to 10% and increase awareness of status among MSM from 85% to 91% over a 10-year period, provided linkage to care and formal diagnosis occur promptly following a positive self-test (90 days or less). As self-tests replace a higher percentage laboratory-based testing algorithms, increases in overall testing rates were necessary to ensure reductions in HIV incidence. However, such increases were small (under 10% for prompt engagement in care and moderate levels of replacement). Improvements in self-test sensitivity and/or decreases in the detection period may further reduce any necessary increases in overall testing. Our study suggests that, if properly utilized, self-testing can provide significant long-term reductions to HIV incidence and improve awareness of HIV status.</description>

      <title>Eremenko's conjecture, wandering Lakes of Wada, and maverick points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.10256v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general technique for realising full closed subsets of the complex plane as wandering sets of entire functions. Using this construction, we solve a number of open problems.
  (1) We construct a counterexample to Eremenko's conjecture, a central problem in transcendental dynamics that asks whether every connected component of the set of escaping points of a transcendental entire function is unbounded.
  (2) We prove that there is a transcendental entire function for which infinitely many Fatou components share the same boundary. This resolves the long-standing problem whether "Lakes of Wada continua" can arise in complex dynamics, and answers the analogue of a question of Fatou from 1920 concerning Fatou components of rational functions.
  (3) We answer a question of Rippon concerning the existence of non-escaping points on the boundary of a bounded escaping wandering domain, that is, a wandering Fatou component contained in the escaping set. In fact we show that the set of such points can have positive Lebesgue measure.
  (4) We give the first example of an entire function having a simply connected Fatou component whose closure has a disconnected complement, answering a question of Boc Thaler.
  In view of (3), we introduce the concept of "maverick points": points on the boundary of a wandering domain whose accumulation behaviour differs from that of internal points. We prove that the set of such points has harmonic measure zero, but that both escaping and oscillating wandering domains can contain large sets of maverick points.</description>

      <title>Coboundaries and eigenvalues of finitary S-adic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An S-adic system is a symbolic dynamical system generated by iterating an infinite sequence of substitutions or morphisms, called a directive sequence. A finitary S-adic dynamical system is one where the directive sequence consists of morphisms selected from a finite set. We study eigenvalues and coboundaries for finitary recognizable S-adic dynamical systems, i.e., those where points can be uniquely desubstituted using the given sequence of morphisms. To do this we identify the notions of straightness and essential words, and use them to define a coboundary, inspired by of Host's formalism, which allows us to express necessary and sufficient conditions that a complex number must satisfy in order to be a continuous or measurable eigenvalue. We then apply our results to finitary directive sequences of substitutions of constant length, and show how to create constant-length $S$-adic shifts with non-trivial coboundaries. We show that in this case all continuous eigenvalues are rational and we give a complete description of the rationals that can be an eigenvalue, indicating how this leads to a Cobham-style result for these systems.</description>

      <title>On the connectedness of multistationarity regions of small reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multistationarity region is the part of a reaction network's parameter space that gives rise to multiple steady states. Mathematically, this region consists of the positive parameters for which a parametrized family of polynomial equations admits two or more positive roots. Much recent work has focused on analyzing multistationarity regions of biologically significant reaction networks and determining whether such regions are connected; indeed, a better understanding of the topology and geometry of such regions may help elucidate how robust multistationarity is to perturbations. Here we focus on the multistationarity regions of small networks, those with few species and few reactions. For two families of such networks -- those with one species and up to three reactions, and those with two species and up to two reactions -- we prove that the resulting multistationarity regions are connected. We also give an example of a network with one species and six reactions for which the multistationarity region is disconnected. Our proofs rely on the formula for the discriminant of a trinomial, a classification of small multistationary networks, and a recent result of Feliu and Telek that partially generalizes Descartes' rule of signs.</description>

Abstract: Rough paths theory allows for a pathwise theory of solutions to differential equations driven by highly irregular signals. The fundamental observation of rough paths theory is that if one can define "iterated integrals" above a signal, then one can construct solutions to differential equations driven by the signal.
  The typical examples of the signals of interest are stochastic processes such as (fractional) Brownian motion. However, rough paths theory is not inherently random and therefore can treat irregular deterministic driving signals such as a (multivariate) Weierstrass function. To the authors' best knowledge, no explicit construction of a rough path (the "iterated integrals") above a multivariate Weierstrass function has been constructed, nor has there been an explicit solution to a differential equation driven by a multivariate Weierstrass function. This note supplies a construction of a rough path above a multivariate Weierstrass function. We conclude with some illustrations and some examples of solving differential equations driven by rough Weierstrass functions.</description>

      <title>A Floquet-Lyapunov Theory for nonautonomous linear periodic differential equations with piecewise constant deviating arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00661v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a version of the classical Floquet-Lyapunov theorem for $\omega-$periodic nonautonomous linear (impulsive and non-impulsive) differential equations with piecewise constant arguments of generalized type (in short, IDEPCAG or DEPCAG). We have proven that the nonautonomous linear IDEPCAG is kinematically similar to an autonomous linear ordinary differential equation. We have also provided some examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12370v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss some families of integrable and superintegrable systems in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space which are invariant to $m\geq n-2$ rotations. The integrable invariant Hamiltonian $H=\sum p_i^2+V(q)$ commutes with $n-2$ integrals of motion $M_\alpha $ and an additional integral of motion $G$, which are polynomials of first and fourth-order in momenta, respectively.</description>

      <title>Learning Collective Behaviors from Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive examination of learning methodologies employed for the structural identification of dynamical systems. These techniques are designed to elucidate emergent phenomena within intricate systems of interacting agents. Our approach not only ensures theoretical convergence guarantees but also exhibits computational efficiency when handling high-dimensional observational data. The methods adeptly reconstruct both first- and second-order dynamical systems, accommodating observation and stochastic noise, intricate interaction rules, absent interaction features, and real-world observations in agent systems. The foundational aspect of our learning methodologies resides in the formulation of tailored loss functions using the variational inverse problem approach, inherently equipping our methods with dimension reduction capabilities.</description>

      <title>Zero distributions of derivatives of polynomial families centering on a set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose $C \subset \mathbb{C}$ is compact. Let $q_k$ be a sequence of polynomials of degree $n_k \to \infty$, such that the locus of roots of all the polynomials is bounded, and the number of roots of $q_k$ in any closed set $L$ not meeting $C$ is uniformly bounded. Supposing that $(q_k)_k$ has an asymptotic root distribution $\mu$ we provide conditions on $C$ and $\mu$ assuring the sequence of $m$th derivatives $(q_k^{(m)})_k$ also has asymptotic root distribution $\mu$ for any $m\geq 1$. This complements recent results of Totik.</description>
