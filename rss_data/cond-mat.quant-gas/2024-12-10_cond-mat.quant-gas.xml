      <title>Vortex lattice melting and critical temperature shift in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a shift in the critical temperature of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates mediated by the melting of the vortex lattice. Numerical simulations reveal that this temperature exhibits contrasting behavior depending on the system configuration: a negative shift occurs for fixed trap potentials due to the expansion of the condensate, while a positive shift is observed for fixed volumes, where vortex lattice rigidity suppresses thermal fluctuations. We introduce a vortex-energy model that captures the role of vortex interactions, the positional energy of the vortex lattice, as well as the phase transition and how the vortex lattice disappears. The findings provide insights into the thermodynamic properties of rotating condensates and the dynamics of vortex lattice melting, offering potential parallels with other quantum systems such as type-II superconductors.</description>

      <title>Effective theory for strongly attractive one-dimensional fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional system of two-component fermions in the limit of strong attractive particle-particle interactions. First, we analyze scattering in the corresponding few-body problem, which is analytically solvable via Bethe ansatz. This allows us to engineer effective interactions between the system's effective degrees of freedom: fermions and bosonic dimers (tightly bound pairs of fermions). We argue that, although these interactions are strong, the resulting effective problem can be mapped onto a weakly interacting one, paving the way for the use of perturbation theory. This finding simplifies studies of many-fermion systems under confinement that are beyond reach of state-of-the-art numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Heating of a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling non-equilibrium processes at ultralow temperatures are central to quantum physics and technology. In such extreme environments, quantum coherence and dissipation can interact intimately to give rise to intriguing thermalization phenomena. Here, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate a novel scenario of thermalization in an ultracold atomic system, distinct from various quantum thermalization scenarios currently under intense investigations. We observe that after a sudden quench, an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) behaves as a rigid body and undergoes a random walk in momentum space due to atom loss and interactions with the surrounding thermal component. Consequently its center of mass degree of freedom gets heated up at a constant rate. This heating mechanism, rooted in random momentum scattering, falls into the paradigm of stochastic heating initiated by Fermi and thoroughly explored in plasma physics, which differs conceptually from the traditional thermal conduction. At longer times, the stochastic heating of the BEC is balanced by forced evaporative cooling, and a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is achieved. Our findings offer new perspectives on the non-equilibrium dynamics of open Bose systems at ultralow temperature and quantum thermalization.</description>

      <title>Polaronic dressing of bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons have emerged as a powerful concept across many-fields in physics to study an impurity coupled to a quantum bath. The interplay between impurity physics and the formation of composite objects remains a relevant problem to understand how few- and many-body states are robust towards complex environments and polaron physics. In most cases, impurities are point-like objects. The question we address here is how quasiparticle properties are affected when impurities possess an internal structure. The simplest yet fundamental structure for the impurity is a dimer state. Here, we investigate the polaronic properties of a dimer dressed by the elementary excitations of a bosonic bath. We solve the two-body impurity-impurity problem to determine the position and broadening of the bound state and consider the polaron dressing using a field-theory approach. We demonstrate the emergence of different dressed dimer regimes, where polaron dressing drives a dimer from a well-defined to an ill-defined bound state.</description>

      <title>The quantum magic of fermionic Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in magic at the topological phase boundary, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fractional discrete NLS equations: dispersion relations, rogue waves, fundamental and vortex solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce physically relevant new models of two-dimensional (2D) fractional lattice media accounting for the interplay of fractional intersite coupling and onsite self-focusing. Our approach features novel discrete fractional operators based on an appropriately modified definition of the continuous Riesz fractional derivative. The model of the 2D isotropic lattice employs the discrete fractional Laplacian, whereas the 2D anisotropic system incorporates discrete fractional derivatives acting independently along orthogonal directions with different L\'evy indices (LIs). We derive exact linear dispersion relations (DRs), and identify spectral bands that permit linear modes to exist, finding them to be similar to their continuous counterparts, apart from differences in the wavenumber range. Additionally, the modulational instability in the discrete models is studied in detail, and, akin to the linear DRs, it is found to align with the situation in continuous models. This consistency highlights the nature of our newly defined discrete fractional derivatives. Furthermore, using Gaussian inputs, we produce a variety of rogue-wave structures. By means of numerical methods, we systematically construct families of 2D fundamental and vortex solitons, and examine their stability. Fundamental solitons maintain the stability due to the discrete nature of the interactions, preventing the onset of the critical and supercritical collapse. On the other hand, vortex solitons are unstable in the isotropic lattice model. However, the anisotropic one -- in particular, its symmetric version with equal LIs acting in both directions -- maintains stable vortex solitons with winding numbers $S=1$ and $S=3$. The detailed results stress the robustness of the newly defined discrete fractional Laplacian in supporting well-defined soliton modes in the 2D lattice media.</description>

      <title>The Ising dual-reflection interface: $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, Majorana strong zero modes and SPT phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interface in the transverse field quantum Ising chain connecting an ordered ferromagnetic phase and a disordered paramagnetic phase that are Kramers-Wannier duals of each other. Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection operation with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. In an open geometry of the studied model, we identify two regimes that exhibit different degeneracy patterns. We discuss whether this is a manifestation of distinct fermion symmetry-protected topological orders protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Absence of the breakdown of ferrodark solitons exhibiting a snake instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical stability and real time dynamics of the two-types of ferrodark solitons (FDSs) which occur as topological magnetic domain walls in the easy-plane phase of a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. The type-I FDS has positive inertial mass and exhibits a single dynamical instability that generates in plane spin winding, causing polar-core spin vortex dipoles. The positive inertial mass leads to the elastic oscillations of the soliton under transverse perturbations. The type-II FDS has negative inertial mass and exhibits a snake instability and a spin-twist instability, with the latter involving the generation of out of plane spin winding. Distinct from the normal dynamics of negative mass solitons under long wave length transverse perturbations, the snake instability does not lead to the type-II FDS breaking down. Instead, segments of the type-II FDS convert to type-I and mass vortex dipoles are produced. The resulting hybridized-chain of the two soliton types and vortices exhibits complex 2D soliton dynamics at long times while the vortices remain confined and the topological structure of a magnetic domain wall is preserved.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Condensation of Composite Bosonic Trions in Interacting Bose-Fermi Mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal a quantum coherent state characterized by composite bosonic trions, wherein paired fermions further associate with bosons, in one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures. The system features onsite boson-fermion attraction and pair hopping of spinless fermions. Our extensive density matrix renormalization group calculations demonstrate the quasi-condensation of these composite trions, evidenced by algebraically decaying correlations of trions, gapped single-particle excitations, and suppressed correlations of fermion pairs. The negative binding energy further underscores the stability of trion formation. Additionally, we offer a phenomenological analysis based on a mean-field variational ansatz to elucidate the emergence of these composite trions. Furthermore, We discuss feasible experimental techniques for realizing this novel phase of matter in ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Operator Valued Flow Equation Approach to the Bosonic Lattice Polaron: Dispersion Renormalization Beyond the Fr\"ohlich Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the ground state properties of a lattice Bose polaron, a quasiparticle arising from the interaction between an impurity confined to an optical lattice and a surrounding homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate hosting phononic modes. We present an extension of Wegner's and Wilson's flow equation approach, the operator valued flow equation approach, which allows us to calculate the renormalized dispersion of the polaron and assess the role of two-phonon scattering processes on the dispersion. The results obtained in this way are compared to a variational mean-field approach. We find that in certain impurity phonon interaction regimes the shape of the dispersion is significantly altered by the inclusion of two-phonon scattering events as opposed to only single-phonon scattering events. Moreover, our results predict that a polaronic bound state may emerge, which is not present in Fr\"ohlich-type models that only consider single-phonon scattering events.</description>

      <title>The Bosonic Quantum Breakdown Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a bosonic quantum breakdown Hubbard model, which generalizes the Bose-Hubbard model by adding an asymmetric breakdown interaction turning one boson into two between adjacent sites. When the normal hopping is zero, this model has a global exponential U(1) symmetry, and we show that the ground state undergoes a first-order phase transition from Mott insulator (MI) to a spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) breakdown condensate as the breakdown interaction increases. Surprisingly, the SSB breakdown condensate does not have a gapless Goldstone mode, which invalidates the Mermin-Wagner theorem and leads to stable SSB in 1D. Moreover, we show that the quench dynamics of a boson added to MI exhibits a dynamical transition from dielectric to breakdown phases, which happens at a larger breakdown interaction than the ground state phase transition. Between these two transitions, the MI (dielectric) state is a false vacuum stable against dynamical breakdown. Our results reveal that quantum models with unconventional symmetries like the exponential symmetry can exhibit unexpected properties.</description>
