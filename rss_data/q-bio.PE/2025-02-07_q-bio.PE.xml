      <title>Generalised Bayesian distance-based phylogenetics for the genomics era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As whole genomes become widely available, maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic methods are demonstrating their limits in meeting the escalating computational demands. Conversely, distance-based phylogenetic methods are efficient, but are rarely favoured due to their inferior performance. Here, we extend distance-based phylogenetics using an entropy-based likelihood of the evolution among pairs of taxa, allowing for fast Bayesian inference in genome-scale datasets. We provide evidence of a close link between the inference criteria used in distance methods and Felsenstein's likelihood, such that the methods are expected to have comparable performance in practice. Using the entropic likelihood, we perform Bayesian inference on three phylogenetic benchmark datasets and find that estimates closely correspond with previous inferences. We also apply this rapid inference approach to a 60-million-site alignment from 363 avian taxa, covering most avian families. The method has outstanding performance and reveals substantial uncertainty in the avian diversification events immediately after the K-Pg transition event. The entropic likelihood allows for efficient Bayesian phylogenetic inference, accommodating the analysis demands of the genomic era.</description>

      <title>A two-size Wright-Fisher Model: asymptotic Analysis via Uniform Renewal Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a population with two types of individuals, distinguished by the resources required for reproduction: type-$0$ (small) individuals need a fractional resource unit of size $\vartheta \in (0,1)$, while type-$1$ (large) individuals require $1$ unit. The total available resource per generation is $R$. To form a new generation, individuals are sampled one by one, and if enough resources remain, they reproduce, adding their offspring to the next generation. The probability of sampling an individual whose offspring is small is $\rho_{R}(x)$, where $x$ is the proportion of small individuals in the current generation. This discrete-time stochastic model is called the two-size Wright-Fisher model, where the function $\rho_{R}$ can represent mutation and/or frequency-dependent selection. We show that on the evolutionary time scale, i.e. accelerating time by a factor $R$, the frequency process of type-$0$ individuals converges to the solution of a Wright-Fisher-type SDE. The drift term of that SDE accounts for the bias introduced by the function $\rho_R$ and the consumption strategy, the latter also inducing an additional multiplicative factor in the diffusion term. To prove this, the dynamics within each generation are viewed as a renewal process, with the population size corresponding to the first passage time $\tau(R)$ above level $R$. The proof relies on methods from renewal theory, in particular a uniform version of Blackwell's renewal theorem for binary, non-arithmetic random variables, established via $\varepsilon$-coupling.</description>

      <title>Controllable Sequence Editing for Counterfactual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequence models generate counterfactuals by modifying parts of a sequence based on a given condition, enabling reasoning about "what if" scenarios. While these models excel at conditional generation, they lack fine-grained control over when and where edits occur. Existing approaches either focus on univariate sequences or assume that interventions affect the entire sequence globally. However, many applications require precise, localized modifications, where interventions take effect only after a specified time and impact only a subset of co-occurring variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for counterfactual reasoning about both immediate and delayed effects. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when interventions should influence a sequence. With these concepts, CLEF selectively edits relevant time steps while preserving unaffected portions of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on cellular and patient trajectory datasets, where gene regulation affects only certain genes at specific time steps, or medical interventions alter only a subset of lab measurements. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing by up to 36.01% in MAE compared to baselines. Unlike prior methods, CLEF enables one-step generation of counterfactual sequences at any future time step, outperforming baselines by up to 65.71% in MAE. A case study on patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus shows that CLEF identifies clinical interventions that shift patient trajectories toward healthier outcomes.</description>

      <title>Lotka-Volterra-type kinetic equations for competing species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of size distribution densities of two populations governed by predator-prey interactions. The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of complex spatial population structure on early and long-term adaptation in rugged fitness landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17108v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the exploration of rugged fitness landscapes by spatially structured populations with demes on the nodes of a graph, connected by migrations. In the rare migration regime, we find that finite structures can adapt more efficiently than very large ones, especially in high-dimensional fitness landscapes. Furthermore, we show that, in most landscapes, migration asymmetries associated with some suppression of natural selection allow the population to reach higher fitness peaks first. In this sense, suppression of selection can make early adaptation more efficient. However, the time it takes to reach the first fitness peak is then increased. We also find that suppression of selection tends to enhance finite-size effects. We extend our study to frequent migrations, suggesting that our conclusions hold in this regime. We then investigate the impact of spatial structure with rare migrations on long-term evolution by studying the steady state of the population. For this, we define an effective population size for the steady-state distribution. We find that suppression of selection is associated to reduced steady-state effective population sizes, and reduced average steady-state fitnesses.</description>
