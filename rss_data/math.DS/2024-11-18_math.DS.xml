      <title>Two Colored Diagrams for Central Configurations of the Planar Five-vortex Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the singular sequence method to investigate the finiteness problem for stationary configurations of the planar five-vortex problem. The initial step of the singular sequence method involves identifying all two-colored diagrams. These diagrams represent potential scenarios where finiteness may fail. We determined all such diagrams for the planar five-vortex problem.</description>

      <title>Mapping class group orbit closures for Deroin-Tholozan representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that infinite mapping class group orbits are dense in the character variety of Deroin-Tholozan representations. In other words, the action is minimal except for finite orbits. Our arguments rely on the symplectic structure of the character variety, emphasizing this geometric perspective over its algebraic properties.</description>

      <title>Ghost states underlying spatial and temporal patterns: how non-existing invariant solutions control nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close to a saddle-node bifurcation, when two invariant solutions collide and disappear, the behavior of a dynamical system can closely resemble that of a solution which is no longer present at the chosen parameter value. For bifurcating equilibria in low-dimensional ODEs, the influence of such 'ghosts' on the temporal behavior of the system, namely delayed transitions, has been studied previously. We consider spatio-temporal PDEs and characterize the phenomenon of ghosts by defining representative state-space structures, which we term 'ghost states,' as minima of appropriately chosen cost functions. Using recently developed variational methods, we can compute and parametrically continue ghost states of equilibria, periodic orbits, and other invariant solutions. We demonstrate the relevance of ghost states to the observed dynamics in various nonlinear systems including chaotic maps, the Lorenz ODE system, the spatio-temporally chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE, the buckling of an elastic arc, and 3D Rayleigh-B\'enard convection.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional inelastic collapse of four particles: asymmetric collision sequences and spherical billiard reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional system of four inelastic hard spheres, colliding with a fixed restitution coefficient $r$, and we study the inelastic collapse phenomenon for such a particle system. We study a periodic, asymmetric collision pattern, proving that it can be realized, despite its instability. We prove that we can associate to the four-particle dynamical system another dynamical system of smaller dimension, acting on $\{1,2,3\} \times \mathbb{S}^2$, and that encodes the collision orders of each trajectory. We provide different representations of this new dynamical system, and study numerically its $\omega$-limit sets. In particular, the numerical simulations suggest that the orbits of such a system might be quasi-periodic.</description>

      <title>Some rigidity results for polynomial automorphisms of C^2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several new rigidity results for polynomial automorphisms of $\mathbb C^2$ with positive entropy. A first result is that a complex slice of the (forward or backward) Julia set is never a smooth, or even rectifiable, curve. We also show that such an automorphism cannot preserve a global holomorphic foliation, nor a real-analytic foliation with complex leaves.
  These results are used to show that under mild assumptions, two real-analytically conjugate automorphisms are polynomially conjugate.
  For mappings defined over a number field, we also study the fields of definition of multipliers of saddle periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of homoclinic orbits to $L_1$ of the hydrogen atom in a circularly polarized microwave field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Rydberg electron in a circularly polarized microwave field, whose dynamics is described by a 2 d.o.f. Hamiltonian, which is a perturbation of size $K&gt;0$ of the standard rotating Kepler problem. In a rotating frame, the largest chaotic region of this system lies around a center-saddle equilibrium point $L_1$ and its associated invariant manifolds. We compute the distance between stable and unstable manifolds of $L_1$ by means of a semi-analytical method, which consists of combining normal form, Melnikov, and averaging methods with numerical methods. Also, we introduce a new family of Hamiltonians, which we call Toy CP systems, to be able to compare our numerical results with the existing theoretical results in the literature. It should be noted that the distance between these stable and unstable manifolds is exponentially small in the perturbation parameter $K$ (in analogy with the $L_3$ libration point of the R3BP).</description>

      <title>Modelling Population-Level Hes1 Dynamics: Insights from a Multi-Framework Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models of living cells have been successively refined with advancements in experimental techniques. A main concern is striking a balance between modelling power and the tractability of the associated mathematical analysis.
  In this work we model the dynamics for the transcription factor Hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1), whose expression oscillates during neural development, and which critically enables stable fate decision in the embryonic brain. We design, parametrise, and analyse a detailed spatial model using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) over a grid capturing both transient oscillatory behaviour and fate decision on a population-level. We also investigate the relationship between this ODE model and a more realistic grid-based model involving intrinsic noise using mostly directly biologically motivated parameters.
  While we focus specifically on Hes1 in neural development, the approach of linking deterministic and stochastic grid-based models shows promise in modelling various biological processes taking place in a cell population. In this context, our work stresses the importance of the interpretability of complex computational models into a framework which is amenable to mathematical analysis.</description>

      <title>Interpolating quasiregular power mappings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a quasiregular mapping $f$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that is the first to illustrate several important properties: the quasi-Fatou set contains bounded, hollow components, the Julia set contains bounded components and, moreover, some of these components are genuine round spheres. The key tool to this construction is a new quasiregular interpolation in round rings in $\mathbb{R}^3$ between power mappings of differing degrees on the boundary components. We also exhibit the flexibility of constructions based on these interpolations by showing that we may obtain quasiregular mappings which grow as quickly, or as slowly, as desired.</description>

      <title>Phase and gain stability for adaptive dynamical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In adaptive dynamical networks, the dynamics of the nodes and the edges influence each other. We show that we can treat such systems as a closed feedback loop between edge and node dynamics. Using recent advances on the stability of feedback systems from control theory, we derive local, sufficient conditions for steady states of such systems to be linearly stable. These conditions are local in the sense that they are written entirely in terms of the (linearized) behavior of the edges and nodes. We apply these conditions to the Kuramoto model with inertia written in adaptive form, and the adaptive Kuramoto model. For the former we recover a classic result, for the latter we show that our sufficient conditions match necessary conditions where the latter are available, thus completely settling the question of linear stability in this setting. The method we introduce can be readily applied to a vast class of systems. It enables straightforward evaluation of stability in highly heterogeneous systems.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the top Lyapunov exponent for linear PDEs driven by the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the top Lyapunov exponent associated to the advection-diffusion and linearised Navier-Stokes equations on the two-dimensional torus. The velocity field is given by the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by a non-degenerate white-in-time noise with a power-law correlation structure. We show that the top Lyapunov exponent is bounded from below by a negative power of the diffusion parameter. This partially answers a conjecture of Doering and Miles and provides a first lower bound on the Batchelor scale in terms of the diffusivity. The proof relies on a robust analysis of the projective process associated to the linear equation, through its spectral median dynamics. We introduce a probabilistic argument to show that high-frequency states for the projective process are unstable under stochastic perturbations, leading to a Lyapunov drift condition and quantitative-in-diffusivity estimates.</description>

Abstract: The variations of Hodge structures of weight one associated to square-tiled surfaces naturally generate interesting subgroups of integral symplectic matrices called Kontsevich--Zorich monodromies. In this paper, we show that arithmetic groups are frequent among the Kontsevich--Zorich monodromies of square-tiled surfaces of low genera $g$.</description>

Abstract: Using some techniques from topological dynamics, we give a uniform treatment of Li-Yorke chaos, mean Li-Yorke chaos and distributional chaos for continuous endomorphisms of completely metrizable groups, and characterize three kinds of chaos (resp. extreme chaos) in terms of the existence of the so-called semi-irregular points (resp. irregular points). We exhibit some examples of inner automorphisms of Polish groups to illustrate the results. We also apply our results to the chaos theory of continuous linear operators on Fr\'echet spaces, which improves some results in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We define the topological multiplicity of an invertible topological system $(X,T)$ as the minimal number $k$ of real continuous functions $f_1,\cdots, f_k$ such that the functions $f_i\circ T^n$, $n\in\mathbb Z$, $1\leq i\leq k,$ span a dense linear vector space in the space of real continuous functions on $X$ endowed with the supremum norm. We study some properties of topological systems with finite multiplicity. After giving some examples, we investigate the multiplicity of subshifts with linear growth complexity.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff dimension and Cantor set structure of sliding Shilnikov invariant sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10720v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of sliding Shilnikov connection has been recently introduced and represents an important notion in Filippov systems, because its existence implies chaotic behavior on an invariant subset of the system. The investigation of its properties has just begun, and understanding the topology and complexity of its invariant set is of interest. In this paper, we conduct a local analysis on the first return map associated to a Shilnikov sliding connection, which reveals a conformal iterated function system (CIFS) structure. By using the theory of CIFS, we estimate the Hausdorff dimension of the local invariant set of the first return map, showing, in particular, that it is strictly greater than $0$ and strictly less than $1$, and its one-dimensional Lebesgue measure is 0. Moreover, we prove that the closure of the local invariant set is a Cantor set and has the same Hausdorff dimension and Lebesgue measure of the original invariant set. Furthermore, it is given by the invariant set adjoined with the set of all pre-images of the regular-fold point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distortion of the Assouad dimension and (regularized) spectrum of sets under planar quasiregular maps. While the respective results for the Hausdorff and upper box-counting dimension follow immediately from their quasiconformal counterparts by employing elementary properties of these dimension notions (e.g. countable stability and Lipschitz stability), the Assouad dimension and spectrum do not share such properties. We obtain upper bounds on the Assouad dimension and spectrum of images of compact sets under planar quasiregular maps by studying their behavior around their critical points. As an application the invariance of porosity of compact subsets of the plane under quasiregular maps is established.</description>

      <title>An "Opinion Reproduction Number" for Infodemics in a Bounded-Confidence Content-Spreading Process on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spreading dynamics of content on networks. To do this, we use a model in which content spreads through a bounded-confidence mechanism. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, the agents of a network have continuous-valued opinions, which they adjust when they interact with agents whose opinions are sufficiently close to theirs. The employed content-spreading model introduces a twist into BCMs by using bounded confidence for the content spread itself. We define an analogue of the basic reproduction number from disease dynamics that we call an \emph{opinion reproduction number}. A critical value of the opinion reproduction number indicates whether or not there is an ``infodemic'' (i.e., a large content-spreading cascade) of content that reflects a particular opinion. By determining this critical value, one can determine whether or not an opinion dies off or propagates widely as a cascade in a population of agents. Using configuration-model networks, we quantify the size and shape of content dissemination by calculating a variety of summary statistics, and we illustrate how network structure and spreading-model parameters affect these statistics. We find that content spreads most widely when the agents have a large expected mean degree or a large receptiveness to content. When the spreading process slightly exceeds the infodemic threshold, there can be longer dissemination trees than when the expected mean degree or receptiveness are larger, even though the total number of content shares is smaller.</description>

Abstract: We consider a fluid governed by the randomly forced 2D Navier-Stokes system. It is assumed that the force is bounded, acts directly only on a small number of Fourier modes, and satisfies some natural decomposability and observability properties. Under these assumptions, we show that the Lagrangian flow associated with the random fluid exhibits chaotic behavior characterized by the strict positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent. To achieve this, we introduce a new abstract result that allows to derive positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent from controllability properties of the underlying deterministic system.</description>

      <title>Extensions of $\mathcal{KL}$ and Lyapunov Functions for Discrete-time Dynamical System Peaks Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04896</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend two classes of functions classically involved in asymptotic stability analyses for studying a maximization problem on the reachable values of a discrete-time dynamical system. This maximization problem is called a peaks computation problem. The problem is to find a couple composed of an initial state and a time which maximizes a given function over states. The paper focuses on the time component of the optimal solution which is an integer as the time is discrete. We develop a method to provide an upper bound of this integer from a formula which requires a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on [0,1] and a scalar in (0,1). A first result proves that the formula provides, in theory, the optimal integer. However, in practice, the computation cannot be so precise. Then, we develop two alternative methods. The first is based on discontinuous and non strictly increasing/decreasing $\mathcal{KL}$-like functions named $\klgen$ functions. We prove that the existence of a $mathcal{KL}_{\rm gen}$ upper bound is equivalent to the existence of a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on [0,1] and a scalar in (0,1). The construction of the strictly increasing continuous function from a $mathcal{KL}_{\rm gen}$ function needs an extension of the famous Sontag's lemma. Finally, we construct a new type of Lyapunov functions, called Opt-Lyapunov functions, well designed for our peaks computation problem. Opt-Lyapunov functions are well designed as we establish an equivalence theorem between the existence of an Opt-Lyapunov function and of a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on $[0,1]$ and a scalar in (0,1). The construction of a Opt-Lyapunov function from a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on [0,1] and a convergent geometric sequence is insipred by the Yoshizawa construction of Lyapunov functions.</description>

      <title>The replacement number dynamics in SIR-type epidemic models I: From SSISS to RND picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In SIR-type epidemic models time derivative of prevalence $I$ can always be cast into the form $\dot{I}=(X-1)I$, where $X$ is the replacement number and recovery rate is normalized to one. Assuming $\dot{X}=f(X,I)$ for some smooth function $f$ defines a "replacement number dynamics" (RND). Choosing transmission coefficients $\beta_1&gt;\beta_2$, any such system uniquely maps to an isomorphic "SSISS model", i.e. an abstract SIR-type 3-compartment model. Extending to negative values $\beta_i&lt;0$ takes care of demographic dynamics with compartment dependent birth and death rates. Fixing $f$ and varying $\beta_i$ generates a family of isomorphic SSISS systems, the "SSISS fiber" $\cal{F}(f)$}. A symmetry group $G_\sigma$ acts freely and transitively on fibers $\cal{F}(f)$, so SSISS systems become a principal $G_\sigma$-fiber bundle over the space of RND systems. Choosing two specific 6-parameter polynomials $f$ at most quadratic in $(X,I)$ covers a large class of models in the literature, with in total up to 17 (largely redundant!) parameters, including also reactive social behavior models. Epidemiological admissibility conditions guarantee forward boundedness and absence of periodic solutions in all these models. Part II of this work will prove existence and stability properties of endemic equilibria, which in RND picture simply boils down to analyzing zeros of the parabolas $f|_{I=0}$ and $f|_{X=1}$. This will cover and extend well known results for a wide range of models by a unifying approach while also closing some open issues in the literature.</description>
