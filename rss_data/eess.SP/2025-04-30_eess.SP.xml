      <title>The Mean of Multi-Object Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a mean for trajectories and multi-object trajectories--sets or multi-sets of trajectories--along with algorithms for computing them. Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</description>

      <title>A High-Resolution Transmission Line Model with De-embedding Structure for Ultralow Contact Resistivity Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a contact resistivity extraction method calibrated using a de-embedding structure, called High-Resolution Transmission Line Model (HR-TLM). HR-TLM has the similar infrastructure with Refined TLM (RTLM) or Refined-Ladder TLM(R-LTLM), but is optimized for calibration methods. Its advantage lies in maintaining low \r{ho}_c extraction accuracy while significantly reducing the impact of structural process errors. According to the error analysis model, we verify that the extraction accuracy of HR-TLM based on R-LTLM can reach 10-9 {\Omega}cm2 at micron scale lithography precision.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Semantic Communication with Importance-Aware Rate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication is recognized for its high compression efficiency and robust resistance to noise. However, utilizing a fixed transmission rate in environments with dynamic signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) often results in inefficient use of communication resources. To address this challenge, this letter proposes an importance-aware rate control semantic communication (IRCSC) scheme, which dynamically adjusts transmission rates in response to both channel conditions and semantic importance. The scheme employs a contribution-based importance analyzer to rank semantic importance. Additionaly, a novel metric, the semantic transmission integrity index (STII), is proposed to quantify the amount of correctly transmitted information and to correlate it with inference performance. Simulations indicate that, with low computational complexity, IRCSC guarantees a controllable trade-off between performance and rate, delivering higher compression efficiency and improved task performance in high-SNR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Distributed U6G ELAA Communication Systems: Channel Measurement and Small-Scale Fading Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distributed upper 6 GHz (U6G) extra-large scale antenna array (ELAA) is a key enabler for future wireless communication systems, offering higher throughput and wider coverage, similar to existing ELAA systems, while effectively mitigating unaffordable complexity and hardware overhead. Uncertain channel characteristics, however, present significant bottleneck problems that hinder the hardware structure and algorithm design of the distributed U6G ELAA system. In response, we construct a U6G channel sounder and carry out extensive measurement campaigns across various typical scenarios. Initially, U6G channel characteristics, particularly small-scale fading characteristics, are unveiled and compared across different scenarios. Subsequently, the U6G ELAA channel characteristics are analyzed using a virtual array comprising 64 elements. Furthermore, inspired by the potential for distributed processing, we investigate U6G ELAA channel characteristics from the perspectives of subarrays and sub-bands, including subarray-wise nonstationarities, consistencies, far-field approximations, and sub-band characteristics. Through a combination of analysis and measurement validation, several insights and benefits, particularly suitable for distributed processing in U6G ELAA systems, are revealed, which provides practical validation for the deployment of U6G ELAA systems.</description>

      <title>Histogram-Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracking with Integrated Target Existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The histogram-probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracker (H-PMHT) is a parametric approach to solving the multi-target track-before-detect (TBD) problem, using expectation maximisation (EM). A key limitation of this method is the assumption of a known and constant number of targets. In this paper, we propose the integrated existence Poisson histogram probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracker (IE-PHPMHT), for TBD of multiple targets. It extends the H-PMHT framework by adding a probability of existence to each potential target. For the derivation, we utilise a Poisson point process (PPP) measurement model and Bernoulli targets, allowing for a multi-Bernoulli birth process and an unknown, time-varying number of targets. Hence, integrated track management is achieved through the discrimination of track quality assessments based on existence probabilities. The algorithm is evaluated in a simulation study of two scenarios and is compared with several other algorithms, demonstrating its performance.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network for Parameter Identification: a Buck Converter Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System-level condition monitoring methods estimate the electrical parameters of multiple components in a converter to assess their health status. The estimation accuracy and variation can differ significantly across parameters. For instance, inductance estimations are generally more accurate and stable than inductor resistance in a buck converter. However, these performance differences remain to be analyzed with a more systematic approach otherwise the condition monitoring results can be unreliable. Therefore, this paper analyzes the training loss landscape against multiple parameters of a buck converter to provide a systematic explanation of different performances. If the training loss is high and smooth, the estimated circuit parameter typically is accurate and has low variation. Furthermore, a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed, offering faster convergence and lower computation requirements compared to an existing PINN method. The proposed method is validated through simulations, where the loss landscape identifies the unreliable parameter estimations, and the PINN can estimate the remaining parameters.</description>

      <title>Sense-then-Charge: Wireless Power Transfer to Unresponsive Devices with Unknown Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a multi-antenna dual-functional radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) and radar system to charge multiple unresponsive devices. We formulate a beamforming problem to maximize the minimum received power at the devices without prior location and channel state information (CSI) knowledge. We propose dividing transmission blocks into sensing and charging phases. First, the location of the devices is estimated by sending sensing signals and performing multiple signal classification and least square estimation on the received echo. Then, the estimations are used for CSI prediction and RF-WPT beamforming. Simulation results reveal that there is an optimal number of blocks allocated for sensing and charging depending on the system setup. Our sense-then-charge (STC) protocol can outperform CSI-free benchmarks and achieve near-optimal performance with a sufficient number of receive antennas and transmit power. However, STC struggles if using insufficient antennas or power as device numbers grow.</description>

      <title>Communications-Centric Secure ISAC with Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (HRISs) constitute an emerging paradigm of metasurfaces that empowers the concept of smart wireless environments, inherently supporting simultaneously communications and sensing. Very recently, some preliminary HRIS designs for Integrated Sensing And Communications (ISAC) have appeared, however, secure ISAC schemes are still lacking. In this paper, we present a novel communications-centric secure ISAC framework capitalizing on the dual-functional capability of HRISs to realize bistatic sensing simultaneously with secure downlink communications. In particular, we jointly optimize the BS precoding vector and the HRIS reflection and analog combining configurations to enable simultaneous accurate estimation of both a legitimate user and an eavesdropper, while guaranteeing a predefined threshold for the secrecy spectral efficiency, with both operations focused within an area of interest. The presented simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed secure ISAC design, highlighting the interplay among key system design parameters as well as quantifying the trade-offs between the HRIS's absorption and reflection coeffcients.</description>

      <title>Cell-free Fluid Antenna Multiple Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna enables position reconfigurability that gives transceiver access to a high-resolution spatial signal and the ability to avoid interference through the ups and downs of fading channels. Previous studies investigated this fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) approach in a single-cell setup only. In this paper, we consider a cell-free network architecture in which users are associated with the nearest base stations (BSs) and all users share the same physical channel. Each BS has multiple fixed antennas that employ maximum ratio transmission (MRT) to beam to its associated users while each user relies on its fluid antenna system (FAS) on one radio frequency (RF) chain to overcome the inter-user interference. Our aim is to analyze the outage probability performance of such cell-free FAMA network when both large- and small-scale fading effects are considered. To do so, we derive the distribution of the received \textcolor{black}{magnitude} for a typical user and then the interference distribution under both fast and slow port switching techniques. The outage probability is finally obtained in integral form in each case. Numerical results demonstrate that in an interference-limited situation, although fast port switching is typically understood as the superior method for FAMA, slow port switching emerges as a more effective solution when there is a large antenna array at the BS. Moreover, it is revealed that FAS at each user can serve to greatly reduce the burden of BS in terms of both antenna costs and CSI estimation overhead, thereby enhancing the scalability of cell-free networks.</description>

      <title>Disjoint Delay-Doppler Estimation in OTFS ISAC with Deep Learning-aided Path Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the problem of communication and radar sensing in orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) with reduced cyclic prefix (RCP) is addressed. A monostatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system is developed and, it is demonstrated that by leveraging the cyclic shift property inherent in the RCP, a delay-Doppler (DD) channel matrix that encapsulates the effects of propagation delays and Doppler shifts through unitary matrices can be derived. Consequently, a novel low-complexity correlation-based algorithm performing disjoint delay-Doppler estimation is proposed for channel estimation. Subsequently, this estimation approach is adapted to perform radar sensing on backscattered data frames. Moreover, channel estimation is complemented by a deep learning (DL) architecture that improves path detection and accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, compared to stopping criterion (SC) based multipath detection. Simulation results indicate that the proposed estimation scheme achieves lower normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to conventional channel estimation algorithms and sensing performance close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Furthermore, an iterative data detection algorithm based on matched filter (MF) and combining is developed by exploiting the unitary property of delay-Doppler parameterized matrices. Simulation results reveal that this iterative scheme achieves performance comparable to that of the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator while significantly reducing computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Parametrized Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) as a tool to improve the performance of bistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) schemes. To that end, we optimize the SIMs and design a radar parameter estimation (RPE) scheme aimed at enhancing radar sensing capabilities as well as communication performance under ISAC-enabling waveforms known to perform well in doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. The SIM optimization is done via a min-max problem formulation solved via steepest ascent with closed-form gradients, while the RPE is carried out via a compressed sensing-based probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm. Our numerical results indicate that the design of waveforms suitable to mitigating the effects of DD channels is significantly impacted by the emerging SIM technology.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Efficient Hybrid Compression Methods For Devanagiri-Encoded Hindi Text Using Lossless Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper provides a comprehensive performance analysis of five standard lossless compression algorithms-LZMA, Zstd, Brotli, Bzip2, and LZ4HC-alongside sixty hybrid combinations on UTF-8 encoded Hindi text datasets, written in the Devanagari script, across varying sizes-small, medium, and large. The evaluation covers compression ratio, compression speed, decompression speed, and a derived weighted normalized efficiency score. Hybrid algorithms-especially those combining Zstd with LZ4HC or Brotli-demonstrate superior performance across all individual parameters. Independent Zstd achieves the highest efficiency score for the medium-sized dataset, illustrating how a well-balanced algorithm can excel in overall efficiency despite not leading in any single metric. However, in terms of compression ratio, speed, and decompression speed, hybrid methods consistently outperform standalone approaches. Notably, the hybrid combination Zstd + LZ4HC achieves the highest efficiency, with scores of 0.6764 for small files and 0.8597 for large files. Independent algorithms such as Zstd and Bzip2 perform well but are consistently surpassed by strategic hybrid pairings. The analysis underscores the significance of combining fast and high-ratio compression techniques, particularly for language-specific data. However, not all hybrids yielded significant improvements, with some introducing computational overhead. This comparative analysis highlights the potential of hybrid compression in applications such as cloud storage, mobile messaging, and NLP-based Hindi text processing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel precoder design aimed at reducing pilot overhead for effective channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) applications utilizing high-order modulation. We propose an innovative demodulation reference signal scheme that achieves up to an 8x reduction in overhead by implementing a delay-domain sparsity constraint on the precoder. Furthermore, we present a deep neural network (DNN)-based end-to-end architecture that integrates a propagation channel estimation module, a precoder design module, and an effective channel estimation module. Additionally, we propose a Bayesian model-assisted training framework that incorporates domain knowledge, resulting in an interpretable datapath design. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed solution significantly outperforms various baseline schemes while exhibiting substantially lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Swapped Logit Distillation via Bi-level Teacher Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) compresses the network capacity by transferring knowledge from a large (teacher) network to a smaller one (student). It has been mainstream that the teacher directly transfers knowledge to the student with its original distribution, which can possibly lead to incorrect predictions. In this article, we propose a logit-based distillation via swapped logit processing, namely Swapped Logit Distillation (SLD). SLD is proposed under two assumptions: (1) the wrong prediction occurs when the prediction label confidence is not the maximum; (2) the "natural" limit of probability remains uncertain as the best value addition to the target cannot be determined. To address these issues, we propose a swapped logit processing scheme. Through this approach, we find that the swap method can be effectively extended to teacher and student outputs, transforming into two teachers. We further introduce loss scheduling to boost the performance of two teachers' alignment. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that SLD consistently performs best among previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: For the upcoming 6G wireless networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces are an essential technology, enabling dynamic beamforming and signal manipulation in both reflective and transmissive modes. It is expected to utilize frequency bands in the millimeter-wave and THz, which presents unique opportunities but also significant challenges. The selection of switching technologies that can support high-frequency operation with minimal loss and high efficiency is particularly complex. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of advanced components such as Schottky diodes, memristor switches, liquid metal-based switches, phase change materials, and RF-SOI technology in RIS designs as an alternative to overcome limitations inherent in traditional technologies in D-band (110-170 GHz).</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Models for Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a supervised training algorithm for learning stochastic resource allocation policies with generative diffusion models (GDMs). We formulate the allocation problem as the maximization of an ergodic utility function subject to ergodic Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Given samples from a stochastic expert policy that yields a near-optimal solution to the problem, we train a GDM policy to imitate the expert and generate new samples from the optimal distribution. We achieve near-optimal performance through sequential execution of the generated samples. To enable generalization to a family of network configurations, we parameterize the backward diffusion process with a graph neural network (GNN) architecture. We present numerical results in a case study of power control in multi-user interference networks.</description>

      <title>Computation of Capacity-Distortion-Cost Functions for Continuous Memoryless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims at computing the capacity-distortion-cost (CDC) function for continuous memoryless channels, which is defined as the supremum of the mutual information between channel input and output, constrained by an input cost and an expected distortion of estimating channel state. Solving the optimization problem is challenging because the input distribution does not lie in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and the optimal estimation function has no closed form in general. We propose to adopt the Wasserstein proximal point method and parametric models such as neural networks (NNs) to update the input distribution and estimation function alternately. To implement it in practice, the importance sampling (IS) technique is used to calculate integrals numerically, and the Wasserstein gradient descent is approximated by pushing forward particles. The algorithm is then applied to an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, validating theoretical results at minimum and maximum distortion as well as the random-deterministic trade-off.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Wireless Data Center: Gaussian Beam or Airy Beam?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is emerging as a pivotal enabler for 6G and beyond wireless systems owing to its multi-GHz bandwidth. One of its novel applications is in wireless data centers, where it enables ultra-high data rates while enhancing network reconfigurability and scalability. However, due to numerous racks, supporting walls, and densely deployed antennas, the line-of-sight (LoS) path in data centers is often instead of fully obstructed, resulting in quasi-LoS propagation and degradation of spectral efficiency. To address this issue, Airy beam-based hybrid beamforming is investigated in this paper as a promising technique to mitigate quasi-LoS propagation and enhance spectral efficiency in THz wireless data centers. Specifically, a cascaded geometrical and wave-based channel model (CGWCM) is proposed for quasi-LoS scenarios, which accounts for diffraction effects while being more simplified than conventional wave-based model. Then, the characteristics and generation of the Airy beam are analyzed, and beam search methods for quasi-LoS scenarios are proposed, including hierarchical focusing-Airy beam search, and low-complexity beam search. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the CGWCM and demonstrate the superiority of the Airy beam over Gaussian beams in mitigating blockages, verifying its potential for practical THz wireless communication in data centers.</description>

      <title>A Geography-Inspired and Self-Adaptive Clustering Algorithm: A Study in Channel Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon that multi-path components (MPCs) arrive in clusters has been verified by channel measurements, and is widely adopted by cluster-based channel models. As a crucial intermediate processing step, MPC clustering bridges raw data in channel measurement and cluster characteristics for channel modeling. In this paper, a physical-interpretable and self-adaptive MPC clustering algorithm is proposed, which can locate both single-point and wide-spread scatterers without prior knowledge. Inspired by the concept in geography, a novel metaphor that interprets features of MPC attributes in the power-delay-angle profile (PDAP) as topographic concepts is developed. In light of the interpretation, the proposed algorithm disassembles the PDAP by constructing contour lines and identifying characteristic points that indicate the skeleton of MPC clusters, which are fitted by analytical models that associate MPCs with physical scatterer locations. Besides, a new clustering performance index, the power gradient consistency index, is proposed. Calculated as the weighted Spearman correlation coefficient between the power and the distance to the center, the index captures the intrinsic property of MPC clusters that the dominant high-power path is surrounded by lower-power paths. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and compared with the counterparts of conventional clustering algorithms based on the channel measurement conducted in an outdoor scenario. The proposed algorithm performs better in average Silhouette index and weighted Spearman correlation coefficient, and the average root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated scatterer location is 0.1 m.</description>

      <title>Statistical Channel Based Low-Complexity Rotation and Position Optimization for 6D Movable Antennas Enabled Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a promising technology to fully exploit spatial variation in wireless channels by allowing flexible adjustment of three-dimensional (3D) positions and rotations of antennas at the transceiver. In this paper, we investigate the practical low-complexity design of 6DMA-enabled communication systems, including transmission protocol, statistical channel information (SCI) acquisition, and joint position and rotation optimization of 6DMA surfaces based on the SCI of users. Specifically, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based algorithm is proposed for the estimation of SCI of users at all possible position-rotation pairs of 6DMA surfaces based on the channel measurements at a small subset of position-rotation pairs. Then, the average sum logarithmic rate of all users is maximized by jointly designing the positions and rotations of 6DMA surfaces based on their SCI acquired. Different from prior works on 6DMA which adopt alternating optimization to design 6DMA positions/rotations with iterations, we propose a new sequential optimization approach that first determines 6DMA rotations and then finds their feasible positions to realize the optimized rotations subject to practical antenna placement constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed sequential optimization significantly reduces the computational complexity of conventional alternating optimization, while achieving comparable communication performance. It is also shown that the proposed SCI-based 6DMA design can effectively enhance the communication throughput of wireless networks over existing fixed (position and rotation) antenna arrays, yet with a practically appealing low-complexity implementation.</description>

      <title>On the Secrecy-Sensing Optimization of RIS-assisted Full-Duplex Integrated Sensing and Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently emerged as a viable technique for establishing sensing and communication using the same resources. Nonetheless, the operation of ISAC networks is often challenged by the absence of a direct link between the sensing node and the targets, and by the risk of disclosing confidential data to malicious targets when using the same signal for both tasks. In this paper, a robust reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided scheme for securing a full-duplex (FD) ISAC network is proposed. The considered network consists of uplink and downlink users served in FD through a multi-antenna dual-functional radar communication base station (BS), which employs co-located multi-antenna communication-radar arrays to detect multiple malicious targets while preserving communication secrecy in their presence. Additionally, the BS utilizes an optimized artificial noise (AN) that serves to disrupt the malicious targets' reception and increase the sensing power. By optimally designing the RIS phase shifts, transmit beamforming, AN covariance, and uplink users' transmit power and combining vectors using an alternating optimization-based algorithm, the network's sensing performance is maximized under secrecy and total power constraints. Numerical results present the proposed scheme's efficacy, particularly when a direct link between the BS and the various nodes/targets is absent.</description>

      <title>Flexible Semantic-Aware Resource Allocation: Serving More Users Through Similarity Range Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) aims to enhance the resource efficiency of next-generation networks by transmitting the underlying meaning of messages, focusing on information relevant to the end user. Existing literature on SemCom primarily emphasizes learning the encoder and decoder through end-to-end deep learning frameworks, with the objective of minimizing a task-specific semantic loss function. Beyond its influence on the physical and application layer design, semantic variability across users in multi-user systems enables the design of resource allocation schemes that incorporate user-specific semantic requirements. To this end, \emph{a semantic-aware resource allocation} scheme is proposed with the objective of maximizing transmission and semantic reliability, ultimately increasing the number of users whose semantic requirements are met. The resulting resource allocation problem is a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is known to be NP-hard. To make the problem tractable, it is decomposed into a set of sub-problems, each of which is efficiently solved via geometric programming techniques. Finally, simulations demonstrate that the proposed method improves user satisfaction by up to $17.1\%$ compared to state of the art methods based on quality of experience-aware SemCom methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Characterizes Depression and Suicidal Ideation from Eye Movements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying physiological and behavioral markers for mental health conditions is a longstanding challenge in psychiatry. Depression and suicidal ideation, in particular, lack objective biomarkers, with screening and diagnosis primarily relying on self-reports and clinical interviews. Here, we investigate eye tracking as a potential marker modality for screening purposes. Eye movements are directly modulated by neuronal networks and have been associated with attentional and mood-related patterns; however, their predictive value for depression and suicidality remains unclear. We recorded eye-tracking sequences from 126 young adults as they read and responded to affective sentences, and subsequently developed a deep learning framework to predict their clinical status. The proposed model included separate branches for trials of positive and negative sentiment, and used 2D time-series representations to account for both intra-trial and inter-trial variations. We were able to identify depression and suicidal ideation with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.765-0.819) against healthy controls, and suicidality specifically with 0.826 AUC (95% CI: 0.797-0.852). The model also exhibited moderate, yet significant, accuracy in differentiating depressed from suicidal participants, with 0.609 AUC (95% CI 0.571-0.646). Discriminative patterns emerge more strongly when assessing the data relative to response generation than relative to the onset time of the final word of the sentences. The most pronounced effects were observed for negative-sentiment sentences, that are congruent to depressed and suicidal participants. Our findings highlight eye tracking as an objective tool for mental health assessment and underscore the modulatory impact of emotional stimuli on cognitive processes affecting oculomotor control.</description>

Abstract: The key ingredient to retrieving a signal from its Fourier magnitudes, namely, to solve the phase retrieval problem, is an effective prior on the sought signal. In this paper, we study the phase retrieval problem under the prior that the signal lies in a semi-algebraic set. This is a very general prior as semi-algebraic sets include linear models, sparse models, and ReLU neural network generative models. The latter is the main motivation of this paper, due to the remarkable success of deep generative models in a variety of imaging tasks, including phase retrieval. We prove that almost all signals in R^N can be determined from their Fourier magnitudes, up to a sign, if they lie in a (generic) semi-algebraic set of dimension N/2. The same is true for all signals if the semi-algebraic set is of dimension N/4. We also generalize these results to the problem of signal recovery from the second moment in multi-reference alignment models with multiplicity free representations of compact groups. This general result is then used to derive improved sample complexity bounds for recovering band-limited functions on the sphere from their noisy copies, each acted upon by a random element of SO(3).</description>

      <title>A Deep Generative Model for Five-Class Sleep Staging with Arbitrary Sensor Input</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gold-standard sleep scoring is based on epoch-based assignment of sleep stages based on a combination of EEG, EOG and EMG signals. However, a polysomnographic recording consists of many other signals that could be used for sleep staging, including cardio-respiratory modalities. Leveraging this signal variety would offer important advantages, for example increasing reliability, resilience to signal loss, and application to long-term non-obtrusive recordings. We developed a deep generative model for automatic sleep staging from a plurality of sensors and any -- arbitrary -- combination thereof. We trained a score-based diffusion model using a dataset of 1947 expert-labelled overnight recordings with 36 different signals, and achieved zero-shot inference on any sensor set by leveraging a novel Bayesian factorization of the score function across the sensors. On single-channel EEG, the model reaches the performance limit in terms of polysomnography inter-rater agreement (5-class accuracy 85.6%, Cohen's kappa 0.791). Moreover, the method offers full flexibility to use any sensor set, for example finger photoplethysmography, nasal flow and thoracic respiratory movements, (5-class accuracy 79.0%, Cohen's kappa of 0.697), or even derivations very unconventional for sleep staging, such as tibialis and sternocleidomastoid EMG (5-class accuracy 71.0%, kappa 0.575). Additionally, we propose a novel interpretability metric in terms of information gain per sensor and show this is linearly correlated with classification performance. Finally, our model allows for post-hoc addition of entirely new sensor modalities by merely training a score estimator on the novel input instead of having to retrain from scratch on all inputs.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in Time Series of EDFA Pump Currents to Monitor Degeneration Processes using Fuzzy Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel fuzzy clustering based anomaly detection method for pump current time series of EDFA systems. The proposed change detection framework (CDF) strategically combines the advantages of entropy analysis (EA) and principle component analysis (PCA) with fuzzy clustering procedures. In the framework, EA is applied for dynamic selection of features for reduction of the feature space and increase of computational performance. Furthermore, PCA is utilized to extract features from the raw feature space to enable generalization capability of the subsequent fuzzy clustering procedures. Three different fuzzy clustering methods, more precisely the fuzzy clustering algorithm, a probabilistic clustering algorithm and a possibilistic clustering algorithm are evaluated for performance and generalization. Hence, the proposed framework has the innovative feature to detect changes in pump current time series at an early stage for arbitrary points of operation, compared to state-of-the-art predefined alarms in commercially used EDFAs. Moreover, the approach is implemented and tested using experimental data. In addition, the proposed framework enables further approaches of applying decentralized predictive maintenance for optical fiber networks.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhance sensing capabilities in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems by leveraging UAV mobility as a mono-static radar. By integrating uniform planar arrays (UPAs) and modeling the UAV dynamics in $SE(3)$, we address key challenges such as 3D space sensing and trajectory design. We propose a target tracking scheme using extended Kalman filtering (EKF) in $SE(3)$, along with trajectory optimization based on the conditional Posterior Cramer-Rao bound (CPCRB). Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory design in enhancing performance of target tracking and physical parameter estimation in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Based Probe Skew Correction for High-frequency BH Loop Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental characterization of magnetic components has grown to be increasingly important to understand and model their behaviours in high-frequency PWM converters. The BH loop measurement is the only available approach to separate the core loss as an electrical method, which, however, is susceptive to the probe phase skew. As an alternative to the regular de-skew approaches based on hardware, this work proposes a novel machine-learning-based method to identify and correct the probe skew, which builds on the newly discovered correlation between the skew and the shape/trajectory of the measured BH loop. A special technique is proposed to artificially generate skewed images from measured waveforms as augmented training sets. A machine learning pipeline is developed with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to treat the problem as an image-based prediction task. The trained model has demonstrated a high accuracy and generalizability in identifying the skew value from a BH loop unseen by the model, which enables the compensation of the skew to yield the corrected core loss value and BH loop.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network for EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous neuroscientific studies demonstrate that specific areas of the brain are connected to human emotional responses, with these regions exhibiting variability across individuals and emotional states. To fully leverage these neural patterns, we propose an Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network (APAGNN), which dynamically captures the spatial relationships among brain regions during emotional processing. The APAGNN employs three specialized experts that progressively analyze brain topology. The first expert captures global brain patterns, the second focuses on region-specific features, and the third examines emotion-related channels. This hierarchical approach enables increasingly refined analysis of neural activity. Additionally, a weight generator integrates the outputs of all three experts, balancing their contributions to produce the final predictive label. Extensive experiments conducted on SEED, SEED-IV and MPED datasets indicate that our method enhances EEG emotion recognition performance, achieving superior results compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of novel model architectures and large-scale foundational models in temporal series analysis of lower limb rehabilitation motion data, aiming to leverage advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence to empower active rehabilitation guidance strategies for post-stroke patients in limb motor function recovery. Utilizing the SIAT-LLMD dataset of lower limb movement data proposed by the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, we systematically elucidate the implementation and analytical outcomes of the innovative xLSTM architecture and the foundational model Lag-Llama in short-term temporal prediction tasks involving joint kinematics and dynamics parameters. The research provides novel insights for AI-enabled medical rehabilitation applications, demonstrating the potential of cutting-edge model architectures and large-scale models in rehabilitation medicine temporal prediction. These findings establish theoretical foundations for future applications of personalized rehabilitation regimens, offering significant implications for the development of customized therapeutic interventions in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>The Adaptive $\tau$-Lasso: Robustness and Oracle Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09310v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new regularized version of the robust $\tau$-regression estimator for analyzing high-dimensional datasets subject to gross contamination in the response variables and covariates. The resulting estimator, termed adaptive $\tau$-Lasso, is robust to outliers and high-leverage points. It also incorporates an adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term, which enables the selection of relevant variables and reduces the bias associated with large true regression coefficients. More specifically, this adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term assigns a weight to each regression coefficient. For a fixed number of predictors $p$, we show that the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso has the oracle property, ensuring both variable-selection consistency and asymptotic normality. Asymptotic normality applies only to the entries of the regression vector corresponding to the true support, assuming knowledge of the true regression vector support. We characterize its robustness by establishing the finite-sample breakdown point and the influence function. We carry out extensive simulations and observe that the class of $\tau$-Lasso estimators exhibits robustness and reliable performance in both contaminated and uncontaminated data settings. We also validate our theoretical findings on robustness properties through simulations. In the face of outliers and high-leverage points, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators achieve the best performance or match the best performances of competing regularized estimators, with minimal or no loss in terms of prediction and variable selection accuracy for almost all scenarios considered in this study. Therefore, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators provide attractive tools for a variety of sparse linear regression problems, particularly in high-dimensional settings and when the data is contaminated by outliers and high-leverage points.</description>

Abstract: Condition monitoring plays a significant role in the safety and reliability of modern industrial systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are gaining attention from academia and industry as a growing subject in industrial applications and as a powerful way of identifying faults. This paper provides an overview of intelligent condition monitoring and fault detection and diagnosis methods for industrial plants with a focus on the open-source benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). In this survey, the most popular and state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for industrial plant condition monitoring, fault detection, and diagnosis are summarized and the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm are studied. Challenges like imbalanced data, unlabelled samples and how deep learning models can handle them are also covered. Finally, a comparison of the accuracies and specifications of different algorithms utilizing the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) is conducted. This research will be beneficial for both researchers who are new to the field and experts, as it covers the literature on condition monitoring and state-of-the-art methods alongside the challenges and possible solutions to them.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Neural Unscented Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unscented Kalman filter is an algorithm capable of handling nonlinear scenarios. Uncertainty in process noise covariance may decrease the filter estimation performance or even lead to its divergence. Therefore, it is important to adjust the process noise covariance matrix in real time. In this paper, we developed an adaptive neural unscented Kalman filter to cope with time-varying uncertainties during platform operation. To this end, we devised ProcessNet, a simple yet efficient end-to-end regression network to adaptively estimate the process noise covariance matrix. We focused on the nonlinear inertial sensor and Doppler velocity log fusion problem in the case of autonomous underwater vehicle navigation. Using a real-world recorded dataset from an autonomous underwater vehicle, we demonstrated our filter performance and showed its advantages over other adaptive and non-adaptive nonlinear filters.</description>
