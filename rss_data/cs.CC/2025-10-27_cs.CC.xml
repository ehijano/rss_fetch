      <title>Relative-error unateness testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model of relative-error property testing of Boolean functions has been the subject of significant recent research effort [CDH+24][CPPS25a][CPPS25b] In this paper we consider the problem of relative-error testing an unknown and arbitrary $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ for the property of being a unate function, i.e. a function that is either monotone non-increasing or monotone non-decreasing in each of the $n$ input variables.
  Our first result is a one-sided non-adaptive algorithm for this problem that makes $\tilde{O}(\log(N)/\epsilon)$ samples and queries, where $N=|f^{-1}(1)|$ is the number of satisfying assignments of the function that is being tested and the value of $N$ is given as an input parameter to the algorithm.
  Building on this algorithm, we next give a one-sided adaptive algorithm for this problem that does not need to be given the value of $N$ and with high probability makes $\tilde{O}(\log(N)/\epsilon)$ samples and queries.
  We also give lower bounds for both adaptive and non-adaptive two-sided algorithms that are given the value of $N$ up to a constant multiplicative factor. In the non-adaptive case, our lower bounds essentially match the complexity of the algorithm that we provide.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Submodular Maximization Under Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function with access to a noisy value oracle for the function instead of an exact value oracle. Similar to prior work, we assume that the noisy oracle is persistent in that multiple calls to the oracle for a specific set always return the same value. In this model, Hassidim and Singer (2017) design a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint, and Huang et al (2022) design a $(1-1/e)/2$-approximation algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to any arbitrary matroid constraint. In this paper, we design a meta-algorithm that allows us to take any "robust" algorithm for exact submodular maximization as a black box and transform it into an algorithm for the noisy setting while retaining the approximation guarantee. By using the meta-algorithm with the measured continuous greedy algorithm, we obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation (resp. $1/e$-approximation) for monotone (resp. non-monotone) submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint under noise. Furthermore, by using the meta-algorithm with the double greedy algorithm, we obtain a $1/2$-approximation for unconstrained (non-monotone) submodular maximization under noise.</description>

      <title>Additive Models Explained: A Computational Complexity Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable* within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations are possible or provably hard.</description>

      <title>Placing Green Bridges Optimally, with Close-Range Habitats in Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a network design problem motivated by the challenge of placing wildlife crossings to reconnect fragmented habitats of animal species, which is among the 17 goals towards sustainable development by the UN: Given a graph, whose vertices represent the fragmented habitat areas and whose edges represent possible green bridge locations (with costs), and the habitable vertex set for each species' habitat, the goal is to find the cheapest set of edges such that each species' habitat is sufficiently connected. We focus on the established variant where a habitat is considered sufficiently connected if it has diameter two in the solution and study its complexity in cases justified by our setting namely small habitat sizes on planar graphs and graphs of small maximum degree $\Delta$. We provide efficient algorithms and NP-hardness results for different values of $\Delta$ and maximum habitat sizes on general and planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Distributed $(\Delta+1)$-Coloring in Graphs of Bounded Neighborhood Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distributed coloring problem is arguably one of the key problems studied in the area of distributed graph algorithms. The most standard variant of the problem asks for a proper vertex coloring of a graph with $\Delta+1$ colors, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. Despite an immense amount of work on distributed coloring problems in the distributed setting, determining the deterministic complexity of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring in the standard message passing model remains one of the most important open questions of the area. In this paper, we aim to improve our understanding of the deterministic complexity of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring as a function of $\Delta$ in a special family of graphs for which significantly faster algorithms are already known. The neighborhood independence $\theta$ of a graph is the maximum number of pairwise non-adjacent neighbors of some node of the graph. In general, in graphs of neighborhood independence $\theta=O(1)$ (e.g., line graphs), it is known that $(\Delta+1)$-coloring can be solved in $2^{O(\sqrt{\log\Delta})}+O(\log^* n)$ rounds. In the present paper, we significantly improve this result, and we show that in graphs of neighborhood independence $\theta$, a $(\Delta+1)$-coloring can be computed in $(\theta\cdot\log\Delta)^{O(\log\log\Delta / \log\log\log\Delta)}+O(\log^* n)$ rounds and thus in quasipolylogarithmic time in $\Delta$ as long as $\theta$ is at most polylogarithmic in $\Delta$. We also show that the known approach that leads to a polylogarithmic in $\Delta$ algorithm for $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring already fails for edge colorings of hypergraphs of rank at least $3$.</description>

      <title>SHAP Meets Tensor Networks: Provably Tractable Explanations with Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic* time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs, this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models. Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become *efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.</description>

      <title>The Low-Degree Hardness of Finding Large Independent Sets in Sparse Random Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic task of finding large independent sets in Erdos-Renyi $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices having average degree $d$. Krivelevich and Sudakov showed that the maximum independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. We show that the class of low-degree polynomial algorithms can find independent sets of density $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ but no larger. This extends and generalizes earlier results of Gamarnik and Sudan, Rahman and Virag, and Wein on graphs, and answers a question of Bal and Bennett. We conjecture that this statistical-computational gap holds for this problem.
  Additionally, we explore the universality of this gap by examining $r$-partite hypergraphs. A hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ is $r$-partite if there is a partition $V=V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_r$ such that each edge contains exactly one vertex from each set $V_i$. We consider the problem of finding large balanced independent sets (independent sets containing the same number of vertices in each partition) in random $r$-partite hypergraphs with $n$ vertices in each partition and average degree $d$. We prove that the maximum balanced independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ asymptotically. Furthermore, we prove an analogous low-degree computational threshold of $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. Our results recover and generalize recent work of Perkins and the second author on bipartite graphs.
  While the graph case has been extensively studied, this work is the first to consider statistical-computational gaps of optimization problems on random hypergraphs. Our results suggest that these gaps persist for larger uniformities as well as across many models. A somewhat surprising aspect of the gap for balanced independent sets is that the algorithm achieving the lower bound is a simple degree-1 polynomial.</description>

      <title>Non-crossing $H$-graphs: a generalization of proper interval graphs admitting FPT algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new parameterized complexity results for the FO Model Checking problem on a well-known generalization of interval and circular-arc graphs: the class of $H$-graphs, for any fixed multigraph $H$. In particular, we research how the parameterized complexity differs between two subclasses of $H$-graphs: proper $H$-graphs and non-crossing $H$-graphs, each generalizing proper interval graphs and proper circular-arc graphs. We first generalize a known result of Bonnet et al. (IPEC 2022) from interval graphs to $H$-graphs, for any (simple) forest $H$, by showing that for such $H$, the class of $H$-graphs is delineated. This implies that for every hereditary subclass ${\cal D}$ of $H$-graphs, FO Model Checking is in FPT if ${\cal D}$ has bounded twin-width and AW[$*$]-hard otherwise. As proper claw-graphs have unbounded twin-width, this means that FO Model Checking is AW[$*$]-hard for proper $H$-graphs for certain forests $H$ like the claw. In contrast, we show that even for every multigraph $H$, non-crossing $H$-graphs have bounded proper mixed-thinness and hence bounded twin-width, and thus FO Model Checking is in FPT on non-crossing $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+\ell$, where $\Vert H \Vert$ is the size of $H$ and $\ell$ is the size of a formula. It is known that a special case of FO Model Checking, Independent Set, is $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard on $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert +k$, where $k$ is the size of a solution. We strengthen this $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hardness result to proper $H$-graphs. Hence, we solve, in two different ways, an open problem of Chaplick (Discrete Math. 2023), who asked about problems that can be solved faster for non-crossing $H$-graphs than for proper $H$-graphs.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Counting Linear Regions in ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of the Skolem Problem at Low Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Skolem Problem asks to determine whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) $\langle u_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty$ over the integers has a zero term, that is, whether there exists $n$ such that $u_n = 0$. Decidability of the problem is open in general, with the most notable positive result being a decision procedure for LRS of order at most 4.
  In this paper we consider a bounded version of the Skolem Problem, in which the input consists of an LRS $\langle u_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty$ and a bound $N \in \mathbb N$ (with all integers written in binary), and the task is to determine whether there exists $n\in\{0,\ldots,N\}$ such that $u_n=0$. We give a randomised algorithm for this problem that, for all $d\in \mathbb N$, runs in polynomial time on the class of LRS of order at most $d$. As a corollary we show that the (unrestricted) Skolem Problem for LRS of order at most 4 lies in $\mathsf{coRP}$, improving the best previous upper bound of $\mathsf{NP}^{\mathsf{RP}}$.
  The running time of our algorithm is exponential in the order of the LRS -- a dependence that appears necessary in view of the $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness of the Bounded Skolem Problem. However, even for LRS of a fixed order, the problem involves detecting zeros within an exponentially large range. For this, our algorithm relies on results from $p$-adic analysis to isolate polynomially many candidate zeros and then test in randomised polynomial time whether each candidate is an actual zero by reduction to arithmetic-circuit identity testing.</description>

      <title>The geodesic cover problem for butterfly networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geodesic cover, also known as an isometric path cover, of a graph is a set of geodesics which cover the vertex set of the graph. An edge geodesic cover of a graph is a set of geodesics which cover the edge set of the graph. The geodesic (edge) cover number of a graph is the cardinality of a minimum (edge) geodesic cover. The (edge) geodesic cover problem of a graph is to find the (edge) geodesic cover number of the graph. Surprisingly, only partial solutions for these problems are available for most situations. In this paper we demonstrate that the geodesic cover number of the $r$-dimensional butterfly is $\lceil (2/3)2^r\rceil$ and that its edge geodesic cover number is $2^r$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lower Bounds by Sample-to-Query Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01794v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polynomial method by Beals, Buhrman, Cleve, Mosca, and de Wolf (FOCS 1998, J. ACM 2001), the adversary method by Ambainis (STOC 2000, J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 2002), and the compressed oracle method by Zhandry (CRYPTO 2019) have been shown to be powerful in proving quantum query lower bounds for a wide variety of problems. In this paper, we propose a new method for proving quantum query lower bounds by a quantum sample-to-query lifting theorem, which is from an information theory perspective. Using this method, we obtain the following new results: 1. A quadratic relation between quantum sample and query complexities regarding quantum property testing, which is optimal and saturated by quantum state discrimination. Here, the sample complexity is measured given sample access to the quantum state to be tested, while the query complexity is measured given query access to an oracle that block-encodes the quantum state. 2. A matching lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(\beta)$ for quantum Gibbs sampling at inverse temperature $\beta$, showing that the quantum Gibbs sampler by Gily\'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe (STOC 2019) is optimal. 3. A new lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ for the entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, which was recently studied by She and Yuen (ITCS 2023). 4. A series of quantum query lower bounds for matrix spectrum testing, based on the sample lower bounds for quantum state spectrum testing by O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015, Comm. Math. Phys. 2021). In addition, we also provide unified proofs for some known lower bounds that have been proven previously via different techniques, including those for phase/amplitude estimation and Hamiltonian simulation.</description>
