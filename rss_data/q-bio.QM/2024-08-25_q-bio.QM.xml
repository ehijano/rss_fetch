      <title>Bundling instability of lophotrichous bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mathematical model of lophotrichous bacteria, motivated by Pseudomonas putida, which swim through fluid by rotating a cluster of multiple flagella extended from near one pole of the cell body. Although the flagella rotate individually, they are typically bundled together, enabling the bacterium to exhibit three primary modes of motility: push, pull, and wrapping. One key determinant of these modes is the coordination between motor torque and rotational direction of motors. The computational variations in this coordination reveal a wide spectrum of dynamical motion regimes, which are modulated by hydrodynamic interactions between flagellar filaments. These dynamic modes can be categorized into two groups based on the collective behavior of flagella, i.e., bundled and unbundled configurations. For some of these configurations, experimental examples from fluorescence microscopy recordings of swimming P. putida cells are also presented. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of stable bundles, such as push and pull, and investigate the dependence of swimming behaviors on the elastic properties of the flagella.</description>

      <title>Comparative prospects of imaging methods for whole-brain mammalian connectomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mammalian whole-brain connectomes at nanoscale synaptic resolution are a crucial ingredient for holistic understanding of brain function. Imaging these connectomes at sufficient resolution to densely reconstruct cellular morphology and synapses represents a longstanding goal in neuroscience. Although the technologies needed to reconstruct whole-brain connectomes have not yet reached full maturity, they are advancing rapidly enough that the mouse brain might be within reach in the near future. Detailed exploration of these technologies is warranted to help plan projects with varying goals and requirements. Whole-brain human connectomes remain a more distant goal yet are worthy of consideration to orient large-scale neuroscience program plans. Here, we quantitatively compare existing and emerging imaging technologies that have potential to enable whole-brain mammalian connectomics. We perform calculations on electron microscopy (EM) techniques and expansion microscopy coupled with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (ExLSFM) methods. We consider techniques from the literature that have sufficiently high resolution to identify all synapses and sufficiently high speed to be relevant for whole mammalian brains. Each imaging modality comes with benefits and drawbacks, so we suggest that attacking the problem through multiple approaches could yield the best outcomes. We offer this analysis as a resource for those considering how to organize efforts towards imaging whole-brain mammalian connectomes.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Analysis of White Blood Cell Differentiation in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients using a \beta-Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical imaging and RNA sequencing with single-cell resolution improves our understanding of white blood cell diseases like leukemia. By combining morphological and transcriptomic data, we can gain insights into cellular functions and trajectoriess involved in blood cell differentiation. However, existing methodologies struggle with integrating morphological and transcriptomic data, leaving a significant research gap in comprehensively understanding the dynamics of cell differentiation. Here, we introduce an unsupervised method that explores and reconstructs these two modalities and uncovers the relationship between different subtypes of white blood cells from human peripheral blood smears in terms of morphology and their corresponding transcriptome. Our method is based on a beta-variational autoencoder ({\ss}-VAE) with a customized loss function, incorporating a R-CNN architecture to distinguish single-cell from background and to minimize any interference from artifacts. This implementation of {\ss}-VAE shows good reconstruction capability along with continuous latent embeddings, while maintaining clear differentiation between single-cell classes. Our novel approach is especially helpful to uncover the correlation of two latent features in complex biological processes such as formation of granules in the cell (granulopoiesis) with gene expression patterns. It thus provides a unique tool to improve the understanding of white blood cell maturation for biomedicine and diagnostics.</description>
