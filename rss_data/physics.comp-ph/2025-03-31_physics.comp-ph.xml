      <title>Fully GPU-Accelerated Immersed Boundary Method for Fluid-Structure Interaction in Complex Cardiac Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) plays a crucial role in cardiac mechanics, where the strong coupling between fluid flow and deformable structures presents significant computational challenges. The immersed boundary (IB) method efficiently handles large deformations and contact without requiring mesh regeneration. However, solving complex FSI problems demands high computational efficiency, making GPU acceleration essential to leverage massive parallelism, high throughput, and memory bandwidth. We present a fully GPU-accelerated algorithm for the IB method to solve FSI problems in complex cardiac models. The Navier-Stokes equations are discretized using the finite difference method, while the finite element method is employed for structural mechanics. Traditionally, IB methods are not GPU-friendly due to irregular memory access and limited parallelism. The novelty of this work lies in eliminating sparse matrix storage and operations entirely, significantly improving memory access efficiency and fully utilizing GPU computational capability. Additionally, the structural materials can be modeled using general hyperelastic constitutive laws, including fiber-reinforced anisotropic biological tissues such as the Holzapfel-Ogden (HO) model. Furthermore, a combined geometric multigrid solver is used to accelerate the convergence. The full FSI system, consisting of millions of degrees of freedom, achieves a per-timestep computation time of just 0.1 seconds. We conduct FSI simulations of the left ventricle, mitral valve, and aortic valve, achieving results with high consistency. Compared to single-core CPU computations, our fully GPU-accelerated approach delivers speedups exceeding 100 times.</description>

      <title>A soft particle dynamics method based on shape degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a 2D numerical model developed to simulate the dynamics of soft, deformable particles. To accommodate significant particle deformations, the particle surface is represented as a narrow shell composed of mass points that interact through elasto-plastic force laws governing their linear and angular relative displacements. Particle shape changes are controlled by these interactions, in conjunction with a uniform particle core stiffness. We calibrate and verify this model by comparing the deformation of constrained beams under load with theoretical predictions. Subsequently, we explore the diametral compression of a single particle between two walls, focusing on the influence of the particle core stiffness and shell plasticity. Our findings indicate that increased core stiffness reduces particle volume change and promotes the development of faceting through flat contact areas with the walls. To further illustrate the model's capabilities, we apply it to the uniaxial compaction of a granular material composed of core-shell particles. We show that, depending on the core stiffness and shell plasticity, the compaction leads to either a significant reduction of particle volumes or an improved pore filling due to particle shape changes. At high compaction, particle shapes vary: elastic particles without core stiffness become mostly elongated, elastic particles with core stiffness form polygonal shapes, while plastic particles develop elliptical or highly irregular forms. Finally, we simulate the tensile fracture of a tissue composed of elastic or plastic cells, illustrating the model's potential applicability to soft tissues that undergo both large cell deformations and fracture.</description>

      <title>Numerical limits in the integration of Vlasov-Poisson equation for Cold Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Poisson systems of equations (VP) describes the evolution of a distribution of collisionless particles under the effect of a collective-field potential. VP is at the basis of the study of the gravitational instability of cosmological density perturbations in Dark-Matter (DM), but its range of application extends to other fields, such as plasma physics.
  In the case of Cold Dark Matter, a single velocity is associated with each fluid-element (or particle) , the initial condition presents a stiff discontinuity. This creates problems such as diffusion or negative distribution function when a grid based method is used to solve VP. In this work we want to highlight this problem, focusing on the technical aspects of this phenomenon. By comparing different finite volume methods and a spectral method we observe that, while all integration schemes preserve the invariants of the system (e.g, energy), the physical observable of interest, i.e., the density, is not correctly reproduced. We thus compare the density obtained with the different Eulerian integration schemes with the result obtained from a reference N-body method. We point out that the most suitable method to solve the VP system for a self-gravitating system is a spectral method.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Temperature and Stress Fields in Mass Concrete Based on Average Forming Temperature Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass concrete plays a crucial role in large-scale projects such as water conservancy hubs and transportation infrastructure. Due to its substantial volume and poor thermal conductivity, the accumulation of hydration heat during the curing process can lead to uneven temperature gradients and stress field distribution, which may cause structural cracking. This phenomenon represents one of the critical challenges in quality control for hydraulic dams, bridge piers and abutments, tunnel linings, and similar engineering structures. To ensure structural safety, it is imperative to calculate temperature variations while optimizing and controlling the temperature stress field. In this paper, a novel method for calculating the zero-stress temperature field is proposed, considering the temperature history and hydration heat release increments at various locations within mass concrete during the curing period, the parameter of average forming temperature field is defined to subsequently solve the temperature stress field. Several typical hydration heat release models were selected to calibrate the computational accuracy of the average forming temperature. Based on simulation results, an optimal model was applied to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through practical engineering case studies. The impacts of casting temperature, ambient temperature during the curing period, and dimensional thickness on temperature-induced stresses were systematically investigated. Additionally, stress variations at different representative points were compared with the overall mean stress distribution. The results demonstrate that this method can more accurately evaluate temperature induced stresses caused by seasonal temperature variations. This study provides a more reliable computational basis for ensuring the long-term service safety of mass concrete structures.</description>

      <title>OpenOrbitalOptimizer -- a reusable open source library for self-consistent field calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the modern paradigms of software engineering, standard tasks are best accomplished by reusable open source libraries. We describe OpenOrbitalOptimizer: a reusable open source C++ library for the iterative solution of coupled self-consistent field (SCF) equations $\boldsymbol{F}_{p}^{\sigma}(\{\boldsymbol{C}_{p}^{\sigma}\})\boldsymbol{C}_{p}^{\sigma}=\boldsymbol{C}_{p}^{\sigma}\boldsymbol{E}_{p}^{\sigma}$ for an arbitrary number of particle types $p$ and symmetries. Although OpenOrbitalOptimizer is a new project, it already implements standard algorithms for solving SCF equations: Pulay's direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS), energy DIIS (EDIIS), augmented DIIS (ADIIS), and the optimal damping algorithm (ODA). The library was designed as an easy way to introduce the state-of-the-art convergence accelerators in a number of legacy programs. It is easy to interface with various programs, as it only requires a function to evaluate the total energy $E$ and Fock matrices $\{\boldsymbol{F}_{p}^{\sigma}\}$ for a given set of orbitals $\{\boldsymbol{C}_{p}^{\sigma}\}$. The only assumption behind the library is that one is able to easily store Fock and orbital matrices in memory, and to diagonalize the Fock matrices in full, which is the case in the overwhelming majority of quantum chemistry applications. We exemplify the library with nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) calculations of protonated water clusters with Gaussian-type orbital basis sets. We find that a minimal-basis protonic guess works well, and that the stepwise SCF algorithm requires less computational time than the simultaneous SCF algorithm.</description>

      <title>Can Neural Networks Bridge the Gap Between Lagrangian Mesh-Free Methods and High-Order Interpolants?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesh-free numerical methods provide flexibility in discretizing complex geometries and can tackle problems where mesh-based methods struggle. Although Eulerian mesh-free approaches can achieve high-order approximations by solving linear systems, they are computationally expensive for Lagrangian simulations, which typically show low-order convergence. Here, we investigate using neural networks to bridge this gap. We develop strategies to couple data-driven models, in particular multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and residual MLPs (ResMLPs) with the Local Anisotropic Basis Function Method (LABFM), as an exemplar high-order mesh-free method. In the first strategy, we use neural networks to surrogate the high-order kernel; in the second, we develop surrogate models for computing the solutions of dense, low-rank linear systems present in high-order mesh-free methods. Qualitative results from networks aimed at predicting support nodal weights yield a qualitative match with validation data, but fall short in eliminating lower-order errors due to inaccuracies in the ML-computed weights, and thus leading to divergent behaviour. The ML-computed solution vector generates residuals with mean absolute errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. However, convergence studies reveal this level of accuracy to be insufficient, causing derivative operators to diverge at a lower resolution and achieve a lower accuracy than LABFM theoretically allows. Furthermore, there is marginal computational gain when computing the solution vector with neural networks compared to LU factorisation. These findings suggest that using MLPs and ResMLPs to solve ill-conditioned dense linear systems is not advantageous due to the computational cost similarity and insufficient accuracy for the current state-of-the-art in mesh-free methods.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning in Physics: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly transforming various scientific fields, enabled by advancements in computational power and access to large data sets from experiments and simulations. As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow in capability, these algorithms will enable many scientific discoveries beyond human capabilities. Since the primary goal of science is to understand the world around us, fully leveraging machine learning in scientific discovery requires models that are interpretable -- allowing experts to comprehend the concepts underlying machine-learned predictions. Successful interpretations increase trust in black-box methods, help reduce errors, allow for the improvement of the underlying models, enhance human-AI collaboration, and ultimately enable fully automated scientific discoveries that remain understandable to human scientists. This review examines the role of interpretability in machine learning applied to physics. We categorize different aspects of interpretability, discuss machine learning models in terms of both interpretability and performance, and explore the philosophical implications of interpretability in scientific inquiry. Additionally, we highlight recent advances in interpretable machine learning across many subfields of physics. By bridging boundaries between disciplines -- each with its own unique insights and challenges -- we aim to establish interpretable machine learning as a core research focus in science.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces JAX-BTE, a GPU-accelerated, differentiable solver for the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) based on differentiable programming. JAX-BTE enables accurate, efficient and differentiable multiscale thermal modeling by leveraging high-performance GPU computing and automatic differentiation. The solver efficiently addresses the high-dimensional and complex integro-differential nature of the phonon BTE, facilitating both forward simulations and data-augmented inverse simulations through end-to-end optimization. Validation is performed across a range of 1D to 3D simulations, including complex FinFET structures, in both forward and inverse settings, demonstrating excellent performance and reliability. JAX-BTE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BTE solvers in forward simulations and uniquely enables inverse simulations, making it a powerful tool for multiscale thermal analysis and design for semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Force-Free Molecular Dynamics Through Autoregressive Equivariant Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in scientific research. Yet their computational cost often limits the timescales and system sizes that can be explored. Most data-driven efforts have been focused on reducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for solving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In this work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework based on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly updates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by traditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various systems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural, dynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows for forecast intervals up to $30\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps, generating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than 4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended timescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments. An open-source implementation of TrajCast is accessible under https://github.com/IBM/trajcast.</description>

      <title>Data-driven construction of a generalized kinetic collision operator from molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach to learn a generalized kinetic collision operator directly from molecular dynamics. Unlike the conventional (e.g., Landau) models, the present operator takes an anisotropic form that accounts for a second energy transfer arising from the collective interactions between the pair of collision particles and the environment. Numerical results show that preserving the broadly overlooked anisotropic nature of the collision energy transfer is crucial for predicting the plasma kinetics with non-negligible correlations, where the Landau model shows limitations.</description>

      <title>Pyrometheus: Symbolic abstractions for XPU and automatically differentiated computation of combustion kinetics and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cost of combustion simulations is often dominated by the evaluation of net production rates of chemical species and mixture thermodynamics (thermochemistry). Execution on computing accelerators (XPUs) like graphic processing units (GPUs) can greatly reduce this cost. However, established thermochemistry software is not readily portable to such devices or sacrifices valuable analytical forms that enable differentiation for sensitivity analysis and implicit time integration. Symbolic abstractions are developed with corresponding transformations that enable computation on accelerators and automatic differentiation by avoiding premature specification of detail. The software package Pyrometheus is introduced as an implementation of these abstractions and their transformations for combustion thermochemistry. The formulation facilitates code generation from the symbolic representation of a specific thermochemical mechanism in multiple target languages, including Python, C++, and Fortran. Computational concerns are separated: the generated code processes array-valued expressions but does not specify their semantics. These semantics are provided by compatible array libraries, such as NumPy, Pytato, and Google JAX. Thus, the generated code retains a symbolic representation of the thermochemistry, which translates to computation on accelerators and CPUs and automatic differentiation. The design and operation of these symbolic abstractions and their companion tool, Pyrometheus, are discussed throughout. Roofline demonstrations show that the computation of chemical source terms within MFC, a Fortran-based flow solver we link to Pyrometheus, is performant.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation Models for Computing Probability Distributions of Complex Multiscale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data assimilation strategy aimed at accurately capturing key non-Gaussian structures in probability distributions using a small ensemble size. A major challenge in statistical forecasting of nonlinearly coupled multiscale systems is mitigating the large errors that arise when computing high-order statistical moments. To address this issue, a high-order stochastic-statistical modeling framework is proposed that integrates statistical data assimilation into finite ensemble predictions. The method effectively reduces the approximation errors in finite ensemble estimates of non-Gaussian distributions by employing a filtering update step that incorporates observation data in leading moments to refine the high-order statistical feedback. Explicit filter operators are derived from intrinsic nonlinear coupling structures, allowing straightforward numerical implementations. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through extensive numerical experiments on a prototype triad system. The triad system offers an instructive and computationally manageable platform mimicking essential aspects of nonlinear turbulent dynamics. The numerical results show that the statistical data assimilation algorithm consistently captures the mean and covariance, as well as various non-Gaussian probability distributions exhibited in different statistical regimes of the triad system. The modeling framework can serve as a useful tool for efficient sampling and reliable forecasting of complex probability distributions commonly encountered in a wide variety of applications involving multiscale coupling and nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a shock capturing for high-order entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods on moving meshes is proposed using Gauss--Lobatto nodes. The shock capturing is achieved via the convex blending of the high-order scheme with a low-order finite volume subcell operator. The free-stream and convergence properties of the hybrid scheme are demonstrated numerically along with the entropy stability and shock capturing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Hackathons for biophysics education: simulating the cytoskeleton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hackathons are intensive innovation-oriented events where participants work in teams to solve problems or create projects in as little as 24 or 48 hours. These events are common in startup culture, open source communities and mainstream industry. Here we examine how hackathons can be ported to academic teaching, specifically in computational biophysics. We propose hackathons as a teaching modality distinct from traditional courses and structured workshops. In particular, we suggest they can offer a low-stakes platform for students to overcome entry barriers to computational tools or to explore new topics, disciplines, and skills beyond their academic comfort zone. We tested this format in two computational biophysics hackathons on the G\"ottingen campus in 2023 and 2024, providing practical insights and a preliminary evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, the 2024 event is the first public hackathon dedicated to Biophysics. This paper explores the benefits of the hackathon format for teachers and researchers and provides guidelines for running a hackathon adapted to a teaching goal.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Forecasting of High-Dimensional Transient and Stationary Processes via Space-Time Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-Time Projection (STP) is introduced as a data-driven forecasting approach for high-dimensional and time-resolved data. The method computes extended space-time proper orthogonal modes from training data spanning a prediction horizon comprising both hindcast and forecast intervals. Forecasts are then generated by projecting the hindcast portion of these modes onto new data, simultaneously leveraging their orthogonality and optimal correlation with the forecast extension. Rooted in Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) theory, dimensionality reduction and time-delay embedding are intrinsic to the approach. For a given ensemble and fixed prediction horizon, the only tunable parameter is the truncation rank--no additional hyperparameters are required. The hindcast accuracy serves as a reliable indicator for short-term forecast accuracy and establishes a lower bound on forecast errors. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated using two datasets: transient, highly anisotropic simulations of supernova explosions in a turbulent interstellar medium, and experimental velocity fields of a turbulent high-subsonic engineering flow. In a comparative study with standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks--acknowledging that alternative architectures or training strategies may yield different outcomes--the method consistently provided more accurate forecasts. Considering its simplicity and robust performance, STP offers an interpretable and competitive benchmark for forecasting high-dimensional transient and chaotic processes, relying purely on spatiotemporal correlation information.</description>

      <title>Effects of the delocalized charge distribution in trapped ion-atom collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of ion-atom interactions, the ion often remain trapped during the experiments. However, the effects of the trapping potential of the ion on ion-neutral interactions remain largely unexplored. Although trap-assisted ion-neutral complex formation has been experimentally studied and described by applying semiclassical theories where the ion is treated as a point charge particle, the potential effect of a delocalized charge distribution of a confined ion due to its quantum mechanical wavefunction has not been considered. To remedy this, in the present theoretical work we substitute the point charge of the ion with a delocalized charged distribution according to its motional ground state in the trap. Our results show that the trapping frequency and hence the spatial extension of the ion's ground-state wavefunction drastically affects the elastic and transport cross sections in interactions with neutral atoms. Stimulated by these results, we propose experimental procedures to verify the effects of the delocalize charge distribution in ion-atom interactions via measuring the heating rate of the ion due to the energy transfer in atomic collisions. Our novel approach brings new possibilities for investigating ion-neutral systems and, through them, new perspectives on ionic polarons and potentially a better understanding of trap-induced losses in ion-neutral experiments.</description>

      <title>Performing Path Integral Molecular Dynamics Using Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Molecular Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employed an artificial intelligence-enhanced molecular simulation framework to enable efficient Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD) simulations. Owing to its modular architecture and high-throughput capabilities, the framework effectively mitigates the computational complexity and resource-intensive limitations associated with conventional PIMD approaches. By integrating machine learning force fields (MLFFs) into the framework, we rigorously tested its performance through two representative cases: a small-molecule reaction system (double proton transfer in formic acid dimer) and a bulk-phase transition system (water-ice phase transformation). Computational results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accelerated PIMD simulations while preserving quantum mechanical accuracy. These findings show that nuclear quantum effects can be captured for complex molecular systems, using relatively low computational cost.</description>

      <title>He-Mg compounds and helium-driven nonmetal transition in metallic magnesium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polymorphism and mechanism of helium compounds is crucial for understanding the physical and chemical nature of He-bearing materials under pressures. Here, we predict two new types of He-bearing compounds, MgHe and MgnHe (n = 6, 8, 10, 15, 18), being formed above 750 GPa by unbiased ab initio structure search. An unexpected bandgap is opened up in MgHe at as low as around 200 GPa. This is the first case of noble gas driven metal-nonmetal transition in all elements. The same mechanism is demonstrated also being applicable to other metallic elements, and making beryllium transform into a non-metallic state, a triumph that is impossible otherwise. Furthermore, the stability of the simple cubic phase of Mg (Mg-sc) is greatly enhanced by mixing with He, which lowers the critical pressure of pure Mg-sc from about 1.1 TPa down to 750 GPa to form ordered substitutional alloying phase of MgnHe on a simple cubic lattice of Mg. This is the first report on Mg-based noble gas substitutional alloy, in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that He preferring interstitial sites. The observed striking influences of He demonstrate the rich physics and chemistry of He-bearing compounds under ultra-high pressures.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of UGe$_2$ at ambient pressure: comparison with X-ray photoemission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on experimental crystallographic data, electronic structure of UGe$_2$ have been calculated and compared with our results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. We employed two different advanced full potential (FP) methods: FP-local-orbital (FPLO) and FP-linear augmented plane waves (Wien2k) codes for non-magnetic and ferromagnetic states. Starting from the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) or generalised gradient approximation (GGA), we verified either the orbital polarisation (OP) correction or the GGA+U approach for the U 5f-electrons, changing Coulomb-repulsion energies U in the range 0-4 eV. Satisfying agreement was achieved between experimental and our calculated magnetic moments using ab-initio LSDA+OP and non-ab-initio GGA+U approaches, the latter for realistic U values of 2-3 eV. We proved by the LSDA+OP approach an existence of the Fermi surface nesting vector along the a axis, possibly responsible for the triplet superconducting pairing. The calculated data reveal predominantly an itinerant U 5f-electron character of bands near the Fermi level, EF, with only small contributions from the U 6d and Ge 4p states. The experimental XPS spectrum of valence bands (VB) also contains the sharp main 5f-electron peak at EF, a wide hump (around -2 eV), and broad small peaks at higher energies. In the calculated XPS spectrum, the width of the main 5f-electron peak varies between 0.8 and 1.4 eV, depending on a method used in computations, but the hump remains unresolved. A newly observed asymmetric 1-eV satellite in the experimental 4f-core XPS spectrum together with known 3-eV and 7-eV satellites suggest dual behaviour of U-5f-electrons in UGe$_2$, the feature is inferred also from the VB studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the electronic structure of water across scales, from individual molecules to bulk liquid, remains a grand challenge. Traditional computational methods face a critical trade-off between computational cost and efficiency.We present an enhanced machine-learning Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS) method for improved electronic structure, DeePKS-ES, that overcomes this dilemma. By incorporating the Hamiltonian matrix and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors into the loss function, we establish a universal model for water systems, which can reproduce high-level hybrid functional (HSE06) electronic properties from inexpensive generalized gradient approximation (PBE) calculations. Validated across molecular clusters and liquid-phase simulations, our approach reliably predicts key electronic structure properties such as band gaps and density of states, as well as total energy and atomic forces. This work bridges quantum-mechanical precision with scalable computation, offering transformative opportunities for modeling aqueous systems in catalysis, climate science, and energy storage.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for hidden boundary detection and flow field reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously detecting hidden solid boundaries and reconstructing flow fields from sparse observations poses a significant inverse challenge in fluid mechanics. This study presents a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework designed to infer the presence, shape, and motion of static or moving solid boundaries within a flow field. By integrating a body fraction parameter into the governing equations, the model enforces no-slip/no-penetration boundary conditions in solid regions while preserving conservation laws of fluid dynamics. Using partial flow field data, the method simultaneously reconstructs the unknown flow field and infers the body fraction distribution, thereby revealing solid boundaries. The framework is validated across diverse scenarios, including incompressible Navier-Stokes and compressible Euler flows, such as steady flow past a fixed cylinder, an inline oscillating cylinder, and subsonic flow over an airfoil. The results demonstrate accurate detection of hidden boundaries, reconstruction of missing flow data, and estimation of trajectories and velocities of a moving body. Further analysis examines the effects of data sparsity, velocity-only measurements, and noise on inference accuracy. The proposed method exhibits robustness and versatility, highlighting its potential for applications when only limited experimental or numerical data are available.</description>

Abstract: Data-driven and non-intrusive DMDc and DMDspc models successfully expedite the reconstruction and forecasting of CO2 fluid flow with acceptable accuracy margins, aiding in the rapid optimization of geological CO2 storage forecast and optimization. DMDc and DMDspc models were trained with weekly, monthly, and yearly simulation pressure and CO2 saturation fields using a commercial simulator. The domain of interest is a large-scale, offshore, highly heterogeneous reservoir model with over 100,000 cells. DMD snapshot reconstruction significantly reduced simulation times from several hours to mere minutes. DMDspc reduced the number of DMD modes for pressure without losing accuracy while sometimes even improving accuracy. Two operation cases were considered: 1. CO2 injection, 2. CO2 injection and water production for pressure maintenance. For pressure, DMDspc achieved a slightly higher than DMDc average error by removing several modes. On the other hand, DMDspc showed limited success in reducing modes for CO2 saturation. The forecast performance of DMD models was evaluated using percent change error, mean absolute error and Pearsons R correlation coefficient metrics. Almost all DMD pressure models managed to successfully forecast pressure fields, while a smaller number of DMD models managed to forecast CO2 saturation. While forecast errors have a considerable range, only DMD models with errors below 5% PCE for pressure or 0.01 MAE for saturation were considered acceptable for geological CO2 storage optimization. Optimized CO2 injection and water production amounts were consistent across selected DMD models and all time scales. The DMDspc-monitored cells approach, which only reconstructs the monitored-during-optimization cells, reduced even further optimization time while providing consistent results with the optimization that used full snapshot reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Multi-soliton solutions and data-driven discovery of higher-order Burgers' hierarchy equations with physics informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Burgers hierarchy consists of nonlinear evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) with progressively higher-order dispersive and nonlinear terms. Notable members of this hierarchy are the Burgers equation and the Sharma-Tasso-Olver equation, which are widely applied in fields such as plasma physics, fluid mechanics, optics, and biophysics to describe nonlinear waves in inhomogeneous media. Various soliton and multi-soliton solutions to these equations have been identified and the fission and fusion of solitons have been studied using analytical and numerical techniques. Recently, deep learning methods, particularly Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), have emerged as a new approach for solving PDEs. These methods use deep neural networks to minimize PDE residuals while fitting relevant data. Although PINNs have been applied to equations like Burgers' and Korteweg-de Vries, higher-order members of the Burgers hierarchy remain unexplored in this context. In this study, we employ a PINN algorithm to approximate multi-soliton solutions of linear combinations of equations within the Burgers hierarchy. This semi-supervised approach encodes the PDE and relevant data, determining PDE parameters and resolving the linear combination to discover the PDE that describes the data. Additionally, we employ gradient-enhanced PINNs (gPINNs) and a conservation law, specific to the generic Burgers' hierarchy, to improve training accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs in describing multi-soliton solutions within the generic Burgers' hierarchy, their robustness to increased levels of data noise, and their limited yet measurable predictive capabilities. They also verify the potential for training refinement and accuracy improvement using enhanced approaches in certain cases, while enabling the discovery of the PDE model that describes the observed solitary structures.</description>

      <title>Automatic Identification of Traps in Molecular Charge Transport Networks of Organic Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method to identify traps in molecular charge transport networks as obtained by multiscale modeling of organic semiconductors. Depending on the materials, traps can be defect-like single molecules or clusters of several neighboring ones, and can have a significant impact on the dynamics of charge carriers. Our proposed method builds on the random walk model of charge dynamics on a directed, weighted graph, the molecular transport network. It comprises an effective heuristic to determine the number of traps or trap clusters based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the random walk Laplacian matrix and uses subsequent spectral clustering techniques to identify these traps. In contrast to currently available methods, ours enables identification of trap molecules in organic semiconductors without having to explicitly simulate the charge dynamics and is applicable to a variety of energy- or topology-based traps in homomolecular or mixed systems with or without detailed-balance. As a prototypical system we simulate an amorphous morphology of bathocuproine, a material with known high energetic disorder and charge trapping. Based on a first-principle multiscale model, we first obtain a reference charge transport network and then purposefully modify its properties to represent different trap characteristics. In contrast to currently available methods, our approach successfully identifies both single trap, multiple distributed traps, and a combination of a single-molecule trap and trap regions on an equal footing.</description>

Abstract: Direct minimization method on the complex Stiefel manifold in Kohn-Sham density functional theory is formulated to treat both finite and extended systems in a unified manner. This formulation is well-suited for scenarios where straightforward iterative diagonalization becomes challenging, especially when the Aufbau principle is not applicable. We present the theoretical foundation and numerical implementation of the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG)
  within a localized non-orthogonal basis set. Riemannian Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) method is tentatively implemented. Extensive testing compares the performance of the proposed methods
  and highlights that the quasi-Newton method is more efficient. However, for extended systems, the computational time required grows rapidly with respect to the number of $\bk$-points.</description>

      <title>Residual-based Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration for sparse Hermitian eigenvalue problems tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chebyshev Filtered Subspace Iteration (ChFSI) has been widely adopted for computing a small subset of extreme eigenvalues in large sparse matrices. This work introduces a residual-based reformulation of ChFSI, referred to as R-ChFSI, designed to accommodate inexact matrix-vector products while maintaining robust convergence properties. By reformulating the traditional Chebyshev recurrence to operate on residuals rather than eigenvector estimates, the R-ChFSI approach effectively suppresses the errors made in matrix-vector products, improving the convergence behaviour for both standard and generalized eigenproblems. This ability of R-ChFSI to be tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products allows one to incorporate approximate inverses for large-scale generalized eigenproblems, making the method particularly attractive where exact matrix factorizations or iterative methods become computationally expensive for evaluating inverses. It also allows us to compute the matrix-vector products in lower-precision arithmetic allowing us to leverage modern hardware accelerators. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that R-ChFSI achieves desired residual tolerances while leveraging low-precision arithmetic. For problems with millions of degrees of freedom and thousands of eigenvalues, R-ChFSI attains final residual norms in the range of 10$^{-12}$ to 10$^{-14}$, even with FP32 and TF32 arithmetic, significantly outperforming standard ChFSI in similar settings. In generalized eigenproblems, where approximate inverses are used, R-ChFSI achieves residual tolerances up to ten orders of magnitude lower, demonstrating its robustness to approximation errors. Finally, R-ChFSI provides a scalable and computationally efficient alternative for solving large-scale eigenproblems in high-performance computing environments.</description>

Abstract: We present a graph random walk (GRW) method for the study of charge transport properties of complex molecular materials in the time-of-flight regime. The molecules forming the material are represented by the vertices of a directed weighted graph, and the charge carriers are random walkers. The edge weights are rates for elementary jumping processes for a charge carrier to move along the edge and are determined from a combination of the energies of the involved vertices and an interaction strength. Exclusions are built into the random walk to account for the Pauli exclusion principle. In time-of-flight experiments, charge carriers are injected into the material and the time until they reach a collecting electrode is recorded. Our approach allows direct evaluation of the expected hitting time of the collecting nodes in terms of a sparse, linear system, avoiding numerically cumbersome and potentially fluctuations-prone methods based on explicit time evolution from solutions of a high-dimensional Master Equation or from kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We validate the GRW approach by numerical studies of charge dynamics of single and multiple carriers in diffusive and drift-diffusive regimes using a surrogate lattice model of a realistic material whose properties have been simulated within a multiscale model framework combining quantum-mechanical and molecular-mechanics methods. The surrogate model allows varying types and strengths of energetic disorder from the reference baseline. Comparison with results from the Master Equation confirms the theoretical equivalence of both approaches also in numerical implementations. We further show that KMC results show substantial deviations due to inadequate sampling. All in all, we find that the GRW method provides a powerful alternative to the more commonly used methods without sampling issues and with the benefit of making use of sparse matrix methods.</description>

      <title>Learning out-of-time-ordered correlators with classical kernel methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators (OTOCs) are widely used to investigate information scrambling in quantum systems. However, directly computing OTOCs with classical computers is an expensive procedure. This is due to the need to classically simulate the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, which entails computational costs that scale rapidly with system size. Similarly, exact simulation of the dynamics with a quantum computer (QC) will either only be possible for short times with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, or will require a fault-tolerant QC which is currently beyond technological capabilities. This motivates a search for alternative approaches to determine OTOCs and related quantities. In this study, we explore four parameterised sets of Hamiltonians describing local one-dimensional quantum systems of interest in condensed matter physics. For each set, we investigate whether classical kernel methods (KMs) can accurately learn the XZ-OTOC and a particular sum of OTOCs, as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters. We frame the problem as a regression task, generating small batches of labelled data with classical tensor network methods for quantum many-body systems with up to 40 qubits. Using this data, we train a variety of standard kernel machines and observe that the Laplacian and radial basis function (RBF) kernels perform best, achieving a coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) on the testing sets of at least 0.7167, with averages between 0.8112 and 0.9822 for the various sets of Hamiltonians, together with small root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Hence, after training, the models can replace further uses of tensor networks for calculating an OTOC function of a system within the parameterised sets. Accordingly, the proposed method can assist with extensive evaluations of an OTOC function.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of 3D Nanophotonic Devices with Structural Integrity Using Auxiliary Thermal Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of nanophotonic structures with subwavelength features that control light across macroscopic scales. Gradient-based optimization offers an efficient approach to design these complex and non-intuitive structures. However, expanding this methodology from 2D to 3D introduces complexities, such as the need for structural integrity and connectivity. This work introduces a multi-objective optimization method to address these challenges in 3D nanophotonic designs. Our method combines electromagnetic simulations with an auxiliary heat-diffusion solver to ensure continuous material and void connectivity. By modeling material regions as heat sources and boundaries as heat sinks, we optimize the structure to minimize the total temperature, thereby penalizing disconnected regions that cannot dissipate thermal loads. Alongside the optical response, this heat metric becomes part of our objective function. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm by designing two 3D nanophotonic devices. The first is a focusing element. The second is a waveguide junction, which connects two incoming waveguides for two different wavelengths into two outgoing waveguides, which are rotated by 90{\deg} to the incoming waveguides. Our approach offers a design pipeline that generates digital blueprints for fabricable nanophotonic materials, paving the way for practical 3D nanoprinting applications.</description>

      <title>Scalable freeform optimization of wide-aperture 3D metalenses by zoned discrete axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07979v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for design and optimization of 3D freeform metalenses that attains nearly linear scaling of computational cost with diameter, by breaking the lens into a sequence of radial "zones" with $n$-fold discrete axisymmetry, where $n$ increases with radius. This allows vastly more design freedom than imposing continuous axisymmetry, while avoiding the compromises of the locally periodic approximation (LPA) or scalar diffraction theory. Using a GPU-accelerated finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver in cylindrical coordinates, we perform full-wave simulation and topology optimization within each supra-wavelength zone. We validate our approach by designing millimeter and centimeter-scale, poly-achromatic, 3D freeform metalenses which outperform the state of the art. By demonstrating the scalability and resulting optical performance enabled by our "zoned discrete axisymmetry" (ZDA) and supra-wavelength domain decomposition, we highlight the potential of our framework to advance large-scale meta-optics and next-generation photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Trilinear coupling and toroidicity in multiferroics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric responses are related in general to magnetic multipoles, and in particular the off-diagonal linear response is proportional to the toroidization order parameter. In multiferroics with three order parameters (polarization, magnetization, and toroidization), such response turns out to be also proportional to the trilinear coupling between the order parameters. Here we explore this scenario, discussing the effects of such trilinear coupling within a Landau theory framework, and using ab initio calculations to discuss a specific model system for this effect, namely the recently predicted three-order-parameter multiferroic metal Bi$_5$Mn$_5$O$_{17}$.</description>
