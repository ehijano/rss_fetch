      <title>Challenge on Sound Scene Synthesis: Evaluating Text-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in neural text-to-audio generation, challenges persist in controllability and evaluation. This paper addresses these issues through the Sound Scene Synthesis challenge held as part of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events 2024. We present an evaluation protocol combining objective metric, namely Fr\'echet Audio Distance, with perceptual assessments, utilizing a structured prompt format to enable diverse captions and effective evaluation. Our analysis reveals varying performance across sound categories and model architectures, with larger models generally excelling but innovative lightweight approaches also showing promise. The strong correlation between objective metrics and human ratings validates our evaluation approach. We discuss outcomes in terms of audio quality, controllability, and architectural considerations for text-to-audio synthesizers, providing direction for future research.</description>

      <title>Dual Inverse Degradation Network for Real-World SDRTV-to-HDRTV Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we address the emerging necessity of converting Standard Dynamic Range Television (SDRTV) content into High Dynamic Range Television (HDRTV) in light of the limited number of native HDRTV content. A principal technical challenge in this conversion is the exacerbation of coding artifacts inherent in SDRTV, which detrimentally impacts the quality of the resulting HDRTV. To address this issue, our method introduces a novel approach that conceptualizes the SDRTV-to-HDRTV conversion as a composite task involving dual degradation restoration. This encompasses inverse tone mapping in conjunction with video restoration. We propose Dual Inversion Downgraded SDRTV to HDRTV Network (DIDNet), which can accurately perform inverse tone mapping while preventing encoding artifacts from being amplified, thereby significantly improving visual quality. DIDNet integrates an intermediate auxiliary loss function to effectively separate the dual degradation restoration tasks and efficient learning of both artifact reduction and inverse tone mapping during end-to-end training. Additionally, DIDNet introduces a spatio-temporal feature alignment module for video frame fusion, which augments texture quality and reduces artifacts. The architecture further includes a dual-modulation convolution mechanism for optimized inverse tone mapping. Recognizing the richer texture and high-frequency information in HDRTV compared to SDRTV, we further introduce a wavelet attention module to enhance frequency features. Our approach demonstrates marked superiority over existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of quantitative performance and visual quality.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Supervised Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition under Occlusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To integrate self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition methods into autonomous robotic systems, it is crucial to consider adverse situations involving target occlusions. Such a scenario, despite its practical relevance, is rarely addressed in existing self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition methods. To empower models with the capacity to address occlusion, we propose a simple and effective method. We first pre-train using occluded skeleton sequences, then use k-means clustering (KMeans) on sequence embeddings to group semantically similar samples. Next, we propose KNN-Imputation to fill in missing skeleton data based on the closest sample neighbors. Imputing incomplete skeleton sequences to create relatively complete sequences as input provides significant benefits to existing skeleton-based self-supervised methods. Meanwhile, building on the state-of-the-art Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (PSTL), we introduce an Occluded Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (OPSTL) framework. This enhancement utilizes Adaptive Spatial Masking (ASM) for better use of high-quality, intact skeletons. The new proposed method is verified on the challenging occluded versions of the NTURGB+D 60 and NTURGB+D 120. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/cyfml/OPSTL.</description>

      <title>MMBench-Video: A Long-Form Multi-Shot Benchmark for Holistic Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has spurred research into their applications in multi-modal contexts, particularly in video understanding. Traditional VideoQA benchmarks, despite providing quantitative metrics, often fail to encompass the full spectrum of video content and inadequately assess models' temporal comprehension. To address these limitations, we introduce MMBench-Video, a quantitative benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' proficiency in video understanding. MMBench-Video incorporates lengthy videos from YouTube and employs free-form questions, mirroring practical use cases. The benchmark is meticulously crafted to probe the models' temporal reasoning skills, with all questions human-annotated according to a carefully constructed ability taxonomy. We employ GPT-4 for automated assessment, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness over earlier LLM-based evaluations. Utilizing MMBench-Video, we have conducted comprehensive evaluations that include both proprietary and open-source LVLMs for images and videos. MMBench-Video stands as a valuable resource for the research community, facilitating improved evaluation of LVLMs and catalyzing progress in the field of video understanding. The evalutation code of MMBench-Video will be integrated into VLMEvalKit: https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit.</description>

      <title>Multi-Track MusicLDM: Towards Versatile Music Generation with Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising results in cross-modal generation tasks involving audio and music, such as text-to-sound and text-to-music generation. These text-controlled music generation models typically focus on generating music by capturing global musical attributes like genre and mood. However, music composition is a complex, multilayered task that often involves musical arrangement as an integral part of the process. This process involves composing each instrument to align with existing ones in terms of beat, dynamics, harmony, and melody, requiring greater precision and control over tracks than text prompts usually provide. In this work, we address these challenges by extending the MusicLDM, a latent diffusion model for music, into a multi-track generative model. By learning the joint probability of tracks sharing a context, our model is capable of generating music across several tracks that correspond well to each other, either conditionally or unconditionally. Additionally, our model is capable of arrangement generation, where the model can generate any subset of tracks given the others (e.g., generating a piano track complementing given bass and drum tracks). We compared our model with an existing multi-track generative model and demonstrated that our model achieves considerable improvements across objective metrics for both total and arrangement generation tasks.</description>

      <title>NVLM: Open Frontier-Class Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce NVLM 1.0, a family of frontier-class multimodal large language models (LLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on vision-language tasks, rivaling the leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-access models (e.g., Llama 3-V 405B and InternVL 2). Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved text-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. In terms of model design, we perform a comprehensive comparison between decoder-only multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) and cross-attention-based models (e.g., Flamingo). Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose a novel architecture that enhances both training efficiency and multimodal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a 1-D tile-tagging design for tile-based dynamic high-resolution images, which significantly boosts performance on multimodal reasoning and OCR-related tasks. Regarding training data, we meticulously curate and provide detailed information on our multimodal pretraining and supervised fine-tuning datasets. Our findings indicate that dataset quality and task diversity are more important than scale, even during the pretraining phase, across all architectures. Notably, we develop production-grade multimodality for the NVLM-1.0 models, enabling them to excel in vision-language tasks while maintaining and even improving text-only performance compared to their LLM backbones. To achieve this, we craft and integrate a high-quality text-only dataset into multimodal training, alongside a substantial amount of multimodal math and reasoning data, leading to enhanced math and coding capabilities across modalities. To advance research in the field, we release the model weights at https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVLM-D-72B and will open-source the training code for the community soon.</description>

      <title>LocoMotion: Learning Motion-Focused Video-Language Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper strives for motion-focused video-language representations. Existing methods to learn video-language representations use spatial-focused data, where identifying the objects and scene is often enough to distinguish the relevant caption. We instead propose LocoMotion to learn from motion-focused captions that describe the movement and temporal progression of local object motions. We achieve this by adding synthetic motions to videos and using the parameters of these motions to generate corresponding captions. Furthermore, we propose verb-variation paraphrasing to increase the caption variety and learn the link between primitive motions and high-level verbs. With this, we are able to learn a motion-focused video-language representation. Experiments demonstrate our approach is effective for a variety of downstream tasks, particularly when limited data is available for fine-tuning.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present OpenMU-Bench, a large-scale benchmark suite for addressing the data scarcity issue in training multimodal language models to understand music. To construct OpenMU-Bench, we leveraged existing datasets and bootstrapped new annotations. OpenMU-Bench also broadens the scope of music understanding by including lyrics understanding and music tool usage. Using OpenMU-Bench, we trained our music understanding model, OpenMU, with extensive ablations, demonstrating that OpenMU outperforms baseline models such as MU-Llama. Both OpenMU and OpenMU-Bench are open-sourced to facilitate future research in music understanding and to enhance creative music production efficiency.</description>
