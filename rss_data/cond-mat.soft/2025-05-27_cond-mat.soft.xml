      <title>Spatial organisation of multiple species of active particles interacting with an interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state organisation of active particles residing on an interface. Particle activity induces interface deformations, while the local shape of the interface guides particle movement. We consider multiple species of particles which can locally pull on the interface or push it. This coupled system exhibits a wide variety of behaviours, including clustering, anti-clustering, diffusion, mixing, demixing, and localisation. Our findings suggest that one can control surface properties by strategically adding or removing specific particle types. Furthermore, by adjusting particle activity levels, we can selectively disperse particle types, enabling precise manipulation of surface movement and geometry.</description>

      <title>Superstability of micrometer jets surrounded by a polymeric shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have produced superstable compound liquid microjets with a three-dimensional printed coaxial flow-focusing injector. The aqueous jet core is surrounded by a shell, a few hundred nanometers in thickness, of a low-concentration aqueous solution of a low-molecular-weight polymer. Due to the stabilizing effect of the polymeric shell, the minimum liquid flow rate leading to stable flow-focusing is decreased by one order of magnitude, resulting in much thinner and longer jets. Possible applications of this technique for Serial Femtosecond X-ray Crystallography are discussed.</description>

      <title>The non-equilibrium thermodynamics of active suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active suspensions composed of self-propelled colloidal particles are considered. Their propulsion of is generated by chemical reactions occurring by heterogeneous catalysis and diffusiophoresis coupling the concentration gradients of reacting molecular species to the fluid velocity. By this mechanism, chemical free energy is transduced into mechanical motion. The non-equilibrium thermodynamics of such active suspensions is developed by explicitly taking into account the internal degrees of freedom of active particles, which are the Eulerian angles specifying their orientation. Accordingly, the distribution function of colloidal particles is defined in the six-dimensional configuration space of their position and their orientation, which fully characterises polar, nematic, and higher orientational orders in the active system. The local Gibbs and Euler thermodynamic relations are expressed in terms of the colloidal distribution function, the dynamics of which is ruled by a six-dimensional local conservation equation. All the processes contributing to the entropy production rate are derived from the local conservation and kinetic equations for colloids, molecular species, mass, linear momentum, and energy, identifying their thermodynamic forces, also called affinities, and their dissipative current densities. The non-equilibrium constitutive relations are obtained using the Curie symmetry principle and the Onsager-Casimir reciprocal relations based on microreversibility. In this way, all the mechanochemical coupling coefficients are completely determined for isothermal, incompressible, dilute suspensions composed of spherical Janus particles on the basis of the interfacial properties between the fluid solution and the solid particles and chemohydrodynamics. The complete expression of the entropy production rate is established for such active systems.</description>

      <title>Ordered buckling structures in a twisted crimped tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a ribbon or tube is twisted far enough it forms buckles and wrinkles. Its new geometry can be strikingly ordered, or hopelessly disordered. Here we study this process in a tube with hybrid boundary conditions: one end a cylinder, and the other end crimped flat like a ribbon, so that the sample resembles a toothpaste tube. The resulting irregular structures and mechanical responses can be dramatically different from those of a ribbon. However, when we form two creases in the tube prior to twisting, we obtain an ordered structure composed of repeating triangular facets oriented at varying angles, and a more elastic torque response, reminiscent of the creased helicoid structure of a twisted ribbon. We measure how the torque and structural evolution depend on parameters such as material thickness and the twist angle. When only part of the tube is pre-creased, the ordered structures are confined to this segment. Surprisingly, in some tubes made from thicker sheets, an ordered structure forms without pre-creasing. This study provides insights into controlling the buckling of thin shells, offering a potential pathway for designing ordered structures in soft materials.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Water Evaporation in Hydrogels from Aspect of Mechanical Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water evaporation is critically important for hydrogels in open-air applications, but theoretically modeling is difficult due to the complicated intermolecular interactions and sustained deformation. In this work, we construct a simplified model to describe the state of water inside the hydrogel by only considering mechanical stretching. We employ "negative pressure" to bridge the stretching force in water and elastic force generated by the polymer network. Combined with a constitutive equation of elasticity for hydrogels and classic diffusion equation, this model gives a universal solution to calculate the saturated vapor pressure, dynamic evaporation rates and real-time deformation of different hydrogels. The calculated results agree well with experiments results both in steady state and dynamic process for commonly used poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and polyacrylamide hydrogels with diverse components. In addition, the model predicts that, hydrogels with high modulus shows stronger ability to retain water in open environment.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Roles of Dissolved Oxygen, Common Salts, and pH on the Spontaneous Hydrogen Peroxide Production in Water: No O2, No H2O2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the mounting evidence proving that the air-water interface or the microdroplet geometry has nothing to do with the spontaneous formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the myth persists. Three recent studies by George and co-workers give credence to the myth by showing connections between the spontaneous formation of hydroxyl (HO) radicals and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in sprayed microdroplets with the solution pH, dissolved salts, nebulizing gas, and the gaseous environment. They report that among halides (chloride, bromide, and iodide), bromide dominates the H2O2 formation because of its ability to donate electrons. Also, they conclude that the H2O2 production at the air-water interface scales with waters alkalinity. In response, we apply a broad set of techniques, spanning NMR, potentiodynamic polarization, electron microscopy, and hydrogen peroxide assay kit (HPAK) fluorometry, to reexamine these claims. Our experiments reveal that regardless of the halide present in water, the air-water interface or the microdroplet geometry does not drive the H2O2 formation. It is the reduction of O2 at the solid-water interface that produces H2O2, i.e., in the absence of O2, no H2O2 is formed regardless of the halide ions. We explain the relative dependence of H2O2 concentrations on the halides based on their propensity to drive pitting corrosion (Chloride &gt; Bromide &gt; Iodide). As the pits appear in the passivating layer, exposing the metal, H2O2 is consumed in further oxidation. Next, we disprove the claim of alkalinity-driven H2O2 formation by demonstrating that aluminum and titanium surfaces produce more H2O2 in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Taken together, these findings refute the conclusions of George and co-workers and others regarding spontaneous H2O2 generation at the air-water interface. The following mnemonic captures our conclusion: no O2, no H2O2.</description>

      <title>A stochastic Stirling engine powered by an active particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a model of a stochastic engine operating cyclically at constant bath temperature, which consists of an overdamped Brownian harmonic oscillator that plays the role of working substance and is elastically coupled to an active particle. Stirling-like cycles are implemented by time-periodic changes of the active particle speed and the potential confining the oscillator. By analyzing its quasistatic and finite-time performance, we distinguish two regimes, which are determined by the relative magnitudes of the persistence time of active particle, the characteristic time of the elastic interaction, and the viscous relaxation time of the working substance. In the quasistatic limit, we derive analytic expressions for the average output work, the mean absorbed heat, and the efficiency, which explicitly involve the ratios of such three time-scales. For sufficiently large finite cycles, the different quantities characterizing the engine performance converge to their quasistatic values. For shorter cycles, the efficiencies are systematically lower, but with positive mean output powers that exhibit a maximum as a function of the cycle duration if the corresponding quasistatic mean work is positive. For sufficiently short cycles or if the quasistatic work is zero, the engine behaves at finite-time as a heat pump with negative power and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Machine Learning and Mathematical Modeling for Tumor Dynamics Prediction: Comparing SPIONs against mNP-FDG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a Machine Learning guided study towards zone-specific ray therapy. Combining Machine Learning (Extreme Gradient Boosting) with continuum modeling (exponential and logistic growth), we find that while fluorodeoxyglucose-coated (mNP-FDG) can control cancerous tumor progression within 2 days compared to 18 days by Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs), for complete termination of the tumor, SPIONS (20 days) are superior compared to mNP-FDG (more than 40 days). We also provide an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) developed with Tkinter/Python that allows users to input relevant data, such as treatment type and time, to receive real-time tumor volume predictions. Our ML-guided prediction indicates joint therapy as the optimum choice, with mNP-FDG ideal for taming the tumor spread, followed by SPIONs for complete eradication, facilitating personalized cancer treatment in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Effect of Vaccine Dose Intervals: Considering Immunity Levels, Vaccine Efficacy, and Strain Variants for Disease Control Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present an immuno-epidemic model to understand mitigation options during an epidemic break. The model incorporates comorbidity and multiple-vaccine doses through a system of coupled integro-differential equations to analyze the epidemic rate and intensity from a knowledge of the basic reproduction number and time-distributed rate functions. Our modeling results show that the interval between vaccine doses is a key control parameter that can be tuned to significantly influence disease spread. We show that multiple doses induce a hysteresis effect in immunity levels that offers a better mitigation alternative compared to frequent vaccination which is less cost-effective while being more intrusive. Optimal dosing intervals, emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of each vaccination effort, and determined by various factors such as the level of immunity and efficacy of vaccines against different strains, appear to be crucial in disease management. The model is sufficiently generic that can be extended to accommodate specific disease forms.</description>

      <title>Identifying Heart Attack Risk in Vulnerable Population: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the incidence of post-infection cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, in individuals over 40. While the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, this study employs a hybrid machine learning approach to analyze epidemiological data in assessing 13 key heart attack risk factors and their susceptibility. Based on a unique dataset that combines demographic, biochemical, ECG, and thallium stress-tests, this study categorizes distinct subpopulations against varying risk profiles and then divides the population into 'at-risk' (AR) and 'not-at-risk' (NAR) groups using clustering algorithms. The study reveals strong association between the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack on the 13 risk factors studied. The aggravated risk for postmenopausal patients indicates compromised individual risk factors due to estrogen depletion that may be, further compromised by extraneous stress impacts, like anxiety and fear, aspects that have traditionally eluded data modeling predictions.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous shear thickening of a moderately dense inertial suspension of hydrodynamically interacting frictionless soft particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05348v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that discontinuous shear thickening (DST) can occur even in moderately dense, inertial suspensions of hydrodynamically interacting, frictionless soft particles. Using the Lubrication-Friction Discrete Element Method, our simulations reveal that DST can emerge at lower particle densities, provided that both the inertia of the suspended particles and their softness are sufficiently pronounced. Furthermore, we show that, under these conditions, the DST behavior obtained from the simulation qualitatively agrees with that predicted by kinetic theory, even without accounting for hydrodynamic interactions. These findings expand the understanding of DST in soft particle systems and highlight the importance of particle inertia and softness in controlling rheological behavior.</description>

      <title>Orbits, spirals, and trapped states: Dynamics of a phoretic Janus particle in a radial concentration gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A longstanding goal in colloidal active matter is to understand how gradients in fuel concentration influence the motion of phoretic Janus particles. Here, we present a theoretical description of the motion of a spherical phoretic Janus particle in the presence of a radial gradient of the chemical solute driving self-propulsion. Radial gradients are a geometry relevant to many scenarios in active matter systems and naturally arise due to the presence of a point source or sink of fuel. We derive an analytical solution for the Janus particle's velocity and quantify the influence of the radial concentration gradient on the particle's trajectory. Compared to a phoretic Janus particle in a linear gradient in fuel concentration, we uncover a much richer set of dynamical behaviors, including circular orbits and trapped stationary states. We identify the ratio of the phoretic mobilities between the two domains of the Janus particle as a central quantity in tuning their dynamics. Our results provide a path for developing novel protocols for tuning the dynamics of phoretic Janus particles and mixing fluid at the microscale. In addition, this work suggests a method for quantifying the surface properties of phoretic Janus particles, which have proven challenging to probe experimentally.</description>

      <title>Generic multicomponent mixtures are multistable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid mixtures of many interacting components often exhibit numerous coexisting types of droplets. An exciting example is the cytosol of biological cells, where diverse droplets, called condensates, are essential for cellular function. However, how much their formation is constrained by thermodynamics is currently unclear. Linear stability analysis predicts that homogeneous mixtures become more robust to fluctuations as the number of components increases, suggesting that droplets do not form easily in multicomponent mixtures. In contrast, we show through numerical simulations and analytical scaling laws that the number of coexisting phases typically increases with the number of components in equilibrium. The combination of both results suggests that generic multicomponent mixtures can maintain many metastable states with various droplets, generalizing the nucleation-and-growth regime of binary mixtures. Our theory also indicates why cells exhibit much fewer condensates than components and how they could exploit multistability to independently form various condensates.</description>

      <title>Effect of the background flow on the motility induced phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate active Brownian particles (ABPs) with soft-repulsive interactions subjected to a four-roll-mill flow. In the absence of flow, this system exhibits motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). To investigate the interplay between MIPS and flow-induced mixing, we introduce dimensionless parameters: a scaled time, $\tau$, and a scaled velocity, ${\rm v}$, characterizing the ratio of ABP to fluid time and velocity scales, respectively. The parameter space defined by $\tau$ and ${\rm v}$ reveals three distinct ABP distribution regimes. At low velocities ${\rm v} \ll 1$, flow dominates, leading to a homogeneous mixture. Conversely, at high velocities ${\rm v} \gg 1$, motility prevails, resulting in MIPS. In the intermediate regime (${\rm v} \sim 1$), the system's behavior depends on $\tau$. For $\tau &lt;1$, a moderately mixed homogeneous phase emerges, while for $\tau &gt;1$, a novel phase, termed flow-induced phase separation (FIPS), arises due to the combined effects of flow topology and ABP motility and size. To characterize these phases, we analyze drift velocity, diffusivity, mean-squared displacement, giant number fluctuations, radial distribution function, and cluster-size distribution.</description>

      <title>Single-File Diffusion of Active Brownian Particles</title>

Abstract: Single-file diffusion (SFD) is a key mechanism underlying transport phenomena in confined physical and biological systems. In a typical SFD process, microscopic particles are restricted to moving in a narrow channel where they cannot pass one another, resulting in constrained motion and anomalous long-time diffusion. In this study, we use Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical theory to investigate the SFD of athermal active Brownian particles (ABPs), a minimal model of active colloids. Building on prior work (Phys. Rev. E 108, 064601 (2023)), where the kinetic temperature, pressure, and compressibility of the single-file ABP system were derived, we develop an accurate analytical expression for the mean square displacement (MSD) of a tagged particle. We find that the MSD exhibits ballistic behavior at short times, governed by the reduced kinetic temperature of the system. At long times, the characteristic subdiffusive scaling of SFD, $\langle (\Delta x)^2 \rangle \sim t^{1/2}$, is preserved. However, self-propulsion introduces significant changes to the 1D mobility, which we directly relate to the system's compressibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized 1D mobility, originally proposed by Kollmann for equilibrium systems (Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 180602 (2003)), can be extended to active systems with minimal modification. These findings provide a framework for understanding particle transport in active systems and for tuning transport properties at the microscale, particularly in geometries where motion is highly restricted.</description>

      <title>Preliminary experimental investigation on the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow experimentally using optical diagnostics in the Shields and Froude parameter space ($0.05{\leq}{\theta}{\leq}0.32$, $0.1{\leq}Fr{\leq}0.4$). Interactions between the turbulent flow and the granular structure give rise to transient erosion-deposition dynamics leading to various types of particle transport. The subaqueous structures in the channel bed evolves due to shear-stress-induced erosion, gravity-driven deposition, and subsequent particle transport. We study the centroid motion and the granular structure shape evolution. At lower end of our ${\theta}-Fr$ parameter space, we observe no erosion and the structure remains at rest. We show that the critical Shields number (${\theta}_{cr}$) is of the order of $0.1$ beyond which erosion starts to occur. At intermediate values of ${\theta}$ and $Fr$ we observe slow erosion, resulting in a rigid body motion of the granular structure without significant shape deformation. Higher values of ${\theta}$ and $Fr$ causes vortex formation at the upstream of the dune resulting in stronger erosion, rapid shape deformation and relatively higher translation velocity of the centroid.</description>

      <title>Disentangling hierarchical relaxations in glass formers via dynamic eigenmodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical dynamics in glass-forming systems span multiple timescales, from fast vibrations to slow structural rearrangements, appearing in both supercooled fluids and glassy states. Understanding how these diverse processes interact across timescales remains a central challenge. Here, by combining direct particle-level observations with a dynamic eigenmode approach that decomposes intermediate-timescale responses into distinct modes, we reveal the microscopic organisation of relaxation dynamics in two-dimensional colloidal systems. We identify five classes of modes characterizing hierarchical dynamics: (i) quasi-elastic modes, (ii) slow-reversible string modes contributing to dynamic heterogeneity, (iii) slow-irreversible string modes leading to flow, (iv) fast-$\beta$ modes with fast-reversible strings, and (v) random noise modes. The emergence of quasi-elastic modes marks the onset of glassy dynamics, while reversible string modes dominate dynamic heterogeneity throughout both supercooled and glassy regimes. Our findings offer a unified microscopic framework for understanding how distinct relaxation processes interconnect across timescales, illuminating the mechanisms driving glass formation.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Molecular Aggregation in Drug Discovery with Predictive Insights from Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Herein, we present the application of MEGAN, our explainable AI (xAI) model, for the identification of small colloidally aggregating molecules (SCAMs). This work offers solutions to the long-standing problem of false positives caused by SCAMs in high throughput screening for drug discovery and demonstrates the power of xAI in the classification of molecular properties that are not chemically intuitive based on our current understanding. We leverage xAI insights and molecular counterfactuals to design alternatives to problematic compounds in drug screening libraries. Additionally, we experimentally validate the MEGAN prediction classification for one of the counterfactuals and demonstrate the utility of counterfactuals for altering the aggregation properties of a compound through minor structural modifications. The integration of this method in high-throughput screening approaches will help combat and circumvent false positives, providing better lead molecules more rapidly and thus accelerating drug discovery cycles.</description>

      <title>Optimal constrained control for generally damped Brownian heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization of cyclic stochastic heat engines, a topic spanning decades of research, commonly assumes fixed control or response parameters at discrete points in the cycle-a limitation that often leads to experimentally impractical protocols. We overcome this with a general algorithm, adapted from optimal control theory, that optimizes full-cycle dynamics under realistic constraints, such as stiffness and temperature bounds, across diverse systems. Unlike geometric or mass transport methods, which rely on fixed endpoints and are unsuitable for unconstrained cycles, our approach simultaneously tunes both cycle time and control variations. Applied to a generally damped Brownian particle in a harmonic potential-an experimentally relevant case-our method is validated in the overdamped regime and extended to arbitrary damping rates. As damping decreases, maximum power vanishes and cycle time diverges; at fixed cycle times, efficiency follows a similar trend, with optimal protocols exhibiting non-monotonic complexity. Notably, optimizing temperature profiles-often overlooked-significantly enhances efficiency in intermediate damping regimes. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for optimizing cyclic stochastic processes under experimental constraints, broadening the scope of power and efficiency optimization in nonequilibrium thermodynamics.</description>
