      <title>TNSA based proton acceleration by two oblique laser pulses in the presence of an axial magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently proposed strategy to boost the proton/ion cutoff energy in the target normal sheath acceleration scheme employs two obliquely incident laser pulses simultaneously irradiating the flat target rather than a single normally incident laser pulse of twice the pulse energy. Moreover, the presence of an externally applied magnetic field along the normal of the target's rear surface is known to reduce the angular divergence of hot electrons which results in a more efficient sheath field at the target rear leading to increased cutoff energy of accelerated protons/ions. In the present work, we employ two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to examine, in detail, the effect of such a magnetic field on the cutoff energy of protons/ions in the cases of normal as well as oblique incidence of the laser pulse on a flat target. It is shown that the two-oblique-pulse configuration combined with an external magnetic field results in a stronger enhancement of the cutoff energies as compared to the normal incidence case.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection, plasmoids and numerical resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining fast magnetic reconnection in electrically conducting plasmas has been a theoretical challenge in plasma physics since its first description by Eugene N. Parker. In the recent years the observed reconnection rate has been shown by numerical simulations to be explained by the plasmoid instability that appears in highly conductive plasmas. In this work we show that the plasmoid instability is very sensitive to the numerical resolution used. It is shown that well resolved runs display no plasmoid instability even at Lundquist number as large as $5\cdot10^5$ achieved at resolutions of $32\,768^2$ grid points. On the contrary in simulations that are under-resolved below a threshold, the plasmoid instability manifests itself with the formation of larger plasmoids the larger the under-resolving is. The present results thus question the description of the plasmoid instability as a mechanism for fast magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>General relativistic force-free electrodynamics with a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic plasmas around compact objects can sometimes be approximated as being force-free. In this limit, the plasma inertia is negligible and the overall dynamics is governed by global electric currents. We present a novel numerical approach for simulating such force-free plasmas, which allows for high accuracy in smooth regions as well as capturing dissipation in current sheets. Using a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method augmented with a conservative finite-difference method, we demonstrate efficient global simulations of black hole and neutron star magnetospheres. In addition to a series of challenging test problems, we show that our approach can-depending on the physical properties of the system and the numerical implementation-be up to 10x more efficient than conventional simulations, with a speedup of 2-3x for most problems we consider in practice.</description>
