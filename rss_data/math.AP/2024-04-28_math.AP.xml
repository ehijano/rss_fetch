      <title>Asymptotics for Sobolev extremals: the hyperdiffusive case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded, smooth domain of $\mathbb{R}^{N},$ $N\geq2.$ For $p&gt;N$ and $1\leq q(p)&lt;\infty$ set \[ \lambda_{p,q(p)}:=\inf\left\{ \int_{\Omega}\left\vert \nabla u\right\vert ^{p}\mathrm{d}x:u\in W_{0}^{1,p}(\Omega)\text{ \ and \ }\int_{\Omega }\left\vert u\right\vert ^{q(p)}\mathrm{d}x=1\right\} \] and let $u_{p,q(p)}$ denote a corresponding positive extremal function. We show that if $\lim\limits_{p\rightarrow\infty}q(p)=\infty$, then $\lim\limits_{p\rightarrow\infty}\lambda_{p,q(p)}^{1/p}=\left\Vert d_{\Omega }\right\Vert _{\infty}^{-1}$, where $d_{\Omega}$ denotes the distance function to the boundary of $\Omega.$ Moreover, in the hyperdiffusive case: $\lim\limits_{p\rightarrow\infty}\frac{q(p)}{p}=\infty,$ we prove that each sequence $u_{p_{n},q(p_{n})},$ with $p_{n}\rightarrow\infty,$ admits a subsequence converging uniformly in $\overline{\Omega}$ to a viscosity solution to the problem \[ \left\{ \begin{array} [c]{lll} -\Delta_{\infty}u=0 &amp; \text{in} &amp; \Omega\setminus M\\ u=0 &amp; \text{on} &amp; \partial\Omega\\ u=1 &amp; \text{in} &amp; M, \end{array} \right. \] where $M$ is a closed subset of the set of all maximum points of $d_{\Omega}.$</description>

      <title>Uniform bounds and the inviscid limit for the Navier-Stokes equations with Navier boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the vanishing viscosity problem for solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with Navier boundary conditions in the half-space. We lower the currently known conormal regularity needed to establish that the inviscid limit holds. Our requirement for the Lipschitz initial data is that the first four conormal derivatives are bounded along with two for the gradient. In addition, we establish a new class of initial data for the local existence and uniqueness for the Euler equations in the half-space or a channel for initial data in the conormal space without conormal requirements on the gradient.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness of strong solutions to the 2D nonhomogeneous primitive equations with density-dependent viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the initial-boundary value problem of the nonhomogeneous primitive equations with density-dependent viscosity. Local well-posedness of strong solutions is established for this system with a natural compatibility condition. The initial density does not need to be strictly positive and may contain vacuum. Meanwhile, we also give the corresponding blow-up criterion if the maximum existence interval with respect to the time is finite.</description>

      <title>A multi-scale multi-lane model for traffic regulation via autonomous vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new model for multi-lane traffic with moving bottlenecks, e.g., autonomous vehicles (AV). It consists of a system of  balance laws for traffic in each lane, coupled in the source terms for lane changing, and fully coupled to ODEs for the AVs' trajectories.More precisely, each AV solves a controlled equation depending on the traffic density, while the PDE on the corresponding lane has a flux constraint at the AV's location. We prove existence of entropy weak solutions, and we characterize the limiting behavior for the source term converging to zero (without AVs), corresponding to a scalar conservation law for the total density.The convergence in the presence of AVs is more delicate and we show that the limit does not satisfy an entropic equation for the total density as in the original coupled ODE-PDE model. Finally, we illustrate our results via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimal gradient estimates for the insulated conductivity problem with general convex inclusions case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the insulated conductivity problem involving two adjacent convex insulators embedded in a bounded domain. It is known that the gradient of solutions may blow up as the distance between two inclusions tends to zero. For general convex insulators, we establish a pointwise upper bound and a lower bound of the gradient with optimal blow up rates, which are associated with the first nonzero eigenvalue of an elliptic operator determined by the geometry of insulators. This extends the previous result for ball insulators in \cite{DLY}.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and potential-based formulation for the propagation of hydro-acoustic waves and tsunamis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a linear model for the propagation of hydro-acoustic waves and tsunami in a stratified free-surface ocean. A formulation was previously obtained by linearizing the compressible Euler equations. The new formulation is obtained by studying the functional spaces and operators associated to the model. The mathematical study of this new formulation is easier and the discretization is also more efficient than for the previous formulation. We prove that both formulations are well posed and show that the solution to the first formulation can be obtained from the solution to the second. Finally, the formulations are discretized using a spectral element method, and we simulate tsunamis generation from submarine earthquakes and landslides.</description>

      <title>Infinite dimensional Slow Manifolds for a Linear Fast-Reaction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this expository paper is twofold. We start with a concise overview of the theory of invariant slow manifolds for fast-slow dynamical systems starting with the work by Tikhonov and Fenichel to the most recent works on infinite-dimensional fast-slow systems. The main part focuses on a class of linear fast-reaction PDE, which are particular forms of fast-reaction systems. The first result shows the convergence of solutions of the linear system to the limit system as the time-scale parameter $\varepsilon$ goes to zero. Moreover, from the explicit solutions the slow manifold is constructed and the convergence to the critical manifold is proven. The subsequent result, then, states a generalized version of the Fenichel-Tikhonov theorem for linear fast-reaction systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup for Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While finite-time blowup solutions have been studied in depth for the Keller-Segel equation, a fundamental model describing chemotaxis, the existence of finite-time blowup solutions to chemotaxis-fluid models remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap in the literature, we use a quantitative method to directly construct a smooth finite-time blowup solution for the Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system with buoyancy in 3D. The heart of the proof is to establish the non-radial finite-codimensional stability of an explicit self-similar blowup solution to 3D Keller-Segel equation with the abstract semigroup tool from [Merle-Rapha\"el-Rodnianski-Szeftel, 2022], which partially generalizes the radial stability result [Glogi\'c-Sch\"orkhuber, 2024] to the non-radial setting. Additionally, we introduce a robust localization argument to find blowup solutions with non-negative density and finite mass.</description>

      <title>Stochastic solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Dirichlet problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear Dirichlet problem on a bounded domain whose Hamiltonian is given by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman operator with merely continuous and bounded coefficients. The objective of this paper is to study the existence question from a stochastic point of view. Using a relaxed control framework, we define a candidate for a viscosity solution. We prove that this stochastic solution satisfies viscosity sub- and supersolution properties and we establish a strong Markov selection principle, which shows that the stochastic solution can be realized through a strong Markov family. Building on the selection principle, we investigate regularity properties of the stochastic solution. For certain elliptic cases, we show that the strong Markov selection is even a Feller selection, which entails the continuity of the stochastic solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the close relation between certain weighted Sobolev spaces (Kondratiev spaces) and refined localization spaces from introduced by Triebel [39,40]. In particular, using a characterization for refined localization spaces from Scharf [32], we considerably improve an embedding from Hansen [17]. This embedding is of special interest in connection with convergence rates for adaptive approximation schemes.</description>

      <title>An introduction to extended Gevrey regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gevrey classes are the most common choice when considering the regularities of smooth functions that are not analytic. However, in various situations, it is important to consider smoothness properties that go beyond Gevrey regularity, for example when initial value problems are ill-posed in Gevrey settings. Extended Gevrey classes provide a convenient framework for studying smooth functions that possess weaker regularity than any Gevrey function. Since the available literature on this topic is scattered, our aim is to provide an overview to extended Gevrey regularity, highlighting its most important features. Additionally, we consider related dual spaces of ultradistributions and review some results on micro-local analysis in the context of extended Gevrey regularity. We conclude the paper with a few selected applications that may motivate further study of the topic.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and convergence of entropic approximation of semi-geostrophic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions for an entropic version of the semi-geostrophic equations. We also establish convergence to a weak solution of the semi-geostrophic equations as the entropic parameter vanishes. Convergence is also proved for discretizations that can be computed numerically in practice as shown recently in [6].</description>

      <title>Stability of partially congested travelling wave solutions for the extended Aw-Rascle system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the non-linear stability of a class of travelling-wave solutions to the extended Aw-Rascle system with a singular offset function, which is formally equivalent to the compressible pressureless Navier-Stokes system with a singular viscosity. These solutions encode the effect of congestion by connecting a congested left state to an uncongested right state, and may also be viewed as approximations of solutions to the 'hard-congestion model'. By using carefully weighted energy estimates we are able to prove the non-linear stability of viscous shock waves to the Aw-Rascle system under a small zero integral perturbation, which in particular extends previous results that do not handle the case where the viscosity is singular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an area-minimizing integral $m$-current in $\Sigma$, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the interior singular set of $T$ cannot exceed $m-2$, provided that $\Sigma$ is an embedded $(m+\bar{n})$-submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ of class $C^{2,\alpha}$, where $\alpha&gt;0$. This result establishes the complete counterpart, in the arbitrary codimension setting, of the interior regularity theory for area-minimizing integral hypercurrents within a Riemannian manifold of class $C^{2,\alpha}$.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis-inspired PDE model for airborne infectious disease transmission: analysis and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) models for infectious disease have received renewed interest in recent years. Most models of this type extend classical compartmental formulations with additional terms accounting for spatial dynamics, with Fickian diffusion being the most common such term. However, while diffusion may be appropriate for modeling vector-borne diseases, or diseases among plants or wildlife, the spatial propagation of airborne diseases in human populations is heavily dependent on human contact and mobility patterns, which are not necessarily well-described by diffusion. By including an additional chemotaxis-inspired term, in which the infection is propagated along the positive gradient of the susceptible population (from regions of low- to high-density of susceptibles), one may provide a more suitable description of these dynamics. This article introduces and analyzes a mathematical model of infectious disease incorporating a modified chemotaxis-type term. The model is analyzed mathematically and the well-posedness of the resulting PDE system is demonstrated. A series of numerical simulations are provided, demonstrating the ability of the model to naturally capture important phenomena not easily observed in standard diffusion models, including propagation over long spatial distances over short time scales and the emergence of localized infection hotspots</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following classical conjecture of Besicovitch: a $1$-dimensional Borel set in the plane with finite Hausdorff $1$-dimensional measure $\mathcal{H}^1$ which has lower density strictly larger than $\frac{1}{2}$ almost everywhere must be countably rectifiable. We improve the best known bound, due to Preiss and Ti\v{s}er, showing that the statement is indeed true if $\frac{1}{2}$ is replaced by $\frac{7}{10}$ (in fact we improve the Preiss-Ti\v{s}er bound even for the corresponding statement in general metric spaces). More importantly, we propose a family of variational problems to produce the latter and many other similar bounds and we study several properties of them, paving the way for further improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.10860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that linear advection equations with Sobolev velocity fields have very poor regularity properties: Solutions propagate only derivatives of logarithmic order, which can be measured in terms of suitable Gagliardo seminorms. We propose a new approach to the study of regularity that is based on Littlewood-Paley theory, thus measuring regularity in terms of Besov norms. We recover the results that are available in the literature and extend these optimally to the diffusive setting. As a consequence, we derive sharp bounds on rates of convergence in the zero-diffusivity limit.</description>

      <title>Layer separation of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in a bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an unconditional $L^2$ upper bound for the boundary layer separation of Leray-Hopf solutions in a smooth bounded domain. By layer separation, we mean the discrepancy between a (turbulent) low-viscosity Leray-Hopf solution $u^\nu$ and a fixed (laminar) regular Euler solution $\bar u$ with similar initial conditions and body force. We show an asymptotic upper bound $C \|\bar u\|_{L^\infty}^3 T$ on the layer separation, anomalous dissipation, and the work done by friction. This extends the previous result when the Euler solution is a regular shear in a finite channel. The key estimate is to control the boundary vorticity in a way that does not degenerate in the vanishing viscosity limit.</description>

Abstract: We construct an entire solution $U:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$ to the elliptic system \[ \Delta U=\nabla_uW(U), \] where $W:\mathbb{R}^2\to [0,\infty)$ is a `triple-well' potential. This solution is a local minimizer of the associated energy \[ \int \frac{1}{2}|\nabla U|^2+W(U)\,dx \] in the sense that $U$ minimizes the energy on any compact set among competitors agreeing with $U$ outside that set. Furthermore, we show that along subsequences, the `blowdowns' of $U$ given by $U_R(x):=U(Rx)$ approach a minimal triple junction as $R\to\infty$. Previous results had assumed various levels of symmetry for the potential and had not established local minimality, but here we make no such symmetry assumptions.</description>

      <title>Hard congestion limit of the dissipative Aw-Rascle system with a polynomial offset function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Aw-Rascle system in a one-dimensional domain with periodic boundary conditions, where the offset function is replaced by the gradient of the function $\rho_{n}^{\gamma}$, where $\gamma \to \infty$. The resulting system resembles the 1D pressureless compressible Navier-Stokes system with a vanishing viscosity coefficient in the momentum equation and can be used to model traffic and suspension flows. We first prove the existence of a unique global-in-time classical solution for $n$ fixed. Unlike the previous result for this system, we obtain global existence without needing to add any approximation terms to the system. This is by virtue of a $n-$uniform lower bound on the density which is attained by carrying out a maximum-principle argument on a suitable potential, $W_{n} = \rho_{n}^{-1}\partial_{x}w_{n}$. Then, we prove the convergence to a weak solution of a hybrid free-congested system as $n \to \infty$, which is known as the hard-congestion model.</description>

      <title>Faber-Krahn inequalities, the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman formula, and Carleson's $\varepsilon^2$ conjecture in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06187v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this article is to prove quantitative spectral inequalities for the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions. More specifically, we prove sharp quantitative stability for the Faber-Krahn inequality in terms of Newtonian capacities and Hausdorff contents of positive codimension, thus providing an answer to a question posed by De Philippis and Brasco.
  One of our results asserts that for any bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq3$, with Lebesgue measure equal to that of the unit ball and whose first eigenvalue is $\lambda_\Omega$, denoting by $\lambda_B$ the first eigenvalue for the unit ball, for any $a\in (0,1)$ it holds $$\lambda_\Omega - \lambda_B \geq C(a) \,\inf_B \bigg(\sup_{t\in (0,1)} \frac1{H^{n-1}(\partial ((1-t) B))} \int_{\partial ((1-t) B)} \frac{\operatorname{Cap}_{n-2}(B(x,atr_B)\setminus \Omega)}{(t\,r_B)^{n-3}}\,dH^{n-1}(x)\bigg)^2,$$ where the infimum is taken over all balls $B$ with the same Lebesgue measure as $\Omega$ and $\operatorname{Cap}_{n-2}$ is the Newtonian capacity of homogeneity $n-2$. In fact, this holds for bounded subdomains of the sphere and the hyperbolic space, as well.
  In a second result, we also apply the new Faber-Krahn type inequalities to quantify the Hayman-Friedland inequality about the characteristics of disjoint domains in the unit sphere. Thirdly, we propose a natural extension of Carleson's $\varepsilon^2$-conjecture to higher dimensions in terms of a square function involving the characteristics of certain spherical domains, and we prove the necessity of the finiteness of such square function in the tangent points via the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity formula. Finally, we answer in the negative a question posed by Allen, Kriventsov and Neumayer in connection to rectifiability and the positivity set of the ACF monotonicity formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the intermediate long wave equation (ILW) in negative Sobolev spaces. In particular, despite the lack of scaling invariance, we identify the regularity $s = -\frac 12$ as the critical regularity for ILW with any depth parameter, by establishing the following two results. (i) By viewing ILW as a perturbation of the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) and exploiting the complete integrability of BO, we establish a global-in-time a priori bound on the $H^s$-norm of a solution to ILW for $ - \frac 12 &lt; s &lt; 0$. (ii) By making use of explicit solutions, we prove that ILW is ill-posed in $H^s$ for $s &lt; - \frac 12$. Our results apply to both the real line case and the periodic case.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend G{\'e}rard's formula for the solution of the Benjamin--Ono equation on the line to square integrable and real valued initial data. Combined with this formula, we also extend the G{\'e}rard's formula for the zero dispersion limit of the Benjamin--Ono equation on the line to more singular initial data. In the derivation of the extension of the formula for the zero dispersion limit, we also find an interesting integral equality, which might be useful in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of stabilization in the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin method for linear anisotropic elastic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is concerned with implementing the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to solve the linear anisotropic elastic equation in the frequency domain. First-order formulation with the compliance tensor and Voigt notation are employed to provide a compact description of the discretized problem and flexibility with highly heterogeneous media. We further focus on the question of optimal choices of stabilization in the definition of HDG numerical traces. For this purpose, we construct a hybridized Godunov-upwind flux for anisotropic elastic media possessing three distinct wavespeeds. This stabilization removes the need to choose a scaling factor, contrary to the identity and Kelvin-Christoffel based stabilizations which are popular choices in the literature. We carry out comparisons among these families for isotropic and anisotropic material, with constant background and highly heterogeneous ones, in two and three dimensions. These experiments establish the optimality of the Godunov stabilization which can be used as a reference choice for a generic material in which different types of waves propagate.</description>

      <title>Global solution and singularity formation for the supersonic expanding wave of compressible Euler equations with radial symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the rarefaction and compression characters for the supersonic expanding wave of the compressible Euler equations with radial symmetry. Under this new definition, we show that solutions with rarefaction initial data will not form shock in finite time, i.e. exist global-in-time as classical solutions. On the other hand, singularity forms in finite time when the initial data include strong compression somewhere. Several useful invariant domains will be also given.</description>

      <title>An extension theorem for weak solutions of the 3d incompressible Euler equations and applications to singular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an extension theorem for local solutions of the 3d incompressible Euler equations. More precisely, we show that if a smooth vector field satisfies the Euler equations in a spacetime region $\Omega\times(0,T)$, one can choose an admissible weak solution on $\mathbf R^3\times (0,T)$ of class $C^\beta$ for any $\beta&lt;1/3$ such that both fields coincide on $\Omega\times (0,T)$. Moreover, one controls the spatial support of the global solution. Our proof makes use of a new extension theorem for local subsolutions of the incompressible Euler equations and a $C^{1/3}$ convex integration scheme implemented in the context of weak solutions with compact support in space. We present two nontrivial applications of these ideas. First, we construct infinitely many admissible weak solutions of class $C^\beta_{\text{loc}}$ with the same vortex sheet initial data, which coincide with it at each time $t$ outside a turbulent region of width $O(t)$. Second, given any smooth solution $v$ of the Euler equation on $\mathbf T^3\times(0,T)$ and any open set $U \subset \mathbf T^3$, we construct admissible weak solutions which coincide with $v$ outside $U$ and are uniformly close to it everywhere at time 0, yet blow up dramatically on a subset of $U\times (0,T)$ of full Hausdorff dimension. These solutions are of class $C^\beta$ outside their singular set.</description>

      <title>A remark on Gibbs measures with log-correlated Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.06729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Gibbs measures with log-correlated base Gaussian fields on the $d$-dimensional torus. In the defocusing case, the construction of such Gibbs measures follows from Nelson's argument. In this paper, we consider the focusing case with a quartic interaction. Using the variational formulation, we prove non-normalizability of the Gibbs measure. When $d = 2$, our argument provides an alternative proof of the non-normalizability result for the focusing $\Phi^4_2$-measure by Brydges and Slade (1996). Furthermore, we provide a precise rate of divergence, where the constant is characterized by the optimal constant for a certain Bernstein's inequality on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We also go over the construction of the focusing Gibbs measure with a cubic interaction. In the appendices, we present (a) non-normalizability of the Gibbs measure for the two-dimensional Zakharov system and (b) the construction of focusing quartic Gibbs measures with smoother base Gaussian measures, showing a critical nature of the log-correlated Gibbs measure with a focusing quartic interaction.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization of the $\Phi^3_3$-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.06777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study the construction of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and complete the program on the (non-)construction of the focusing Gibbs measures, initiated by Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988). This problem turns out to be critical, exhibiting the following phase transition. In the weakly nonlinear regime, we prove normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that it is singular with respect to the massive Gaussian free field. Moreover, we show that there exists a shifted measure with respect to which the $\Phi^3_3$-measure is absolutely continuous. In the strongly nonlinear regime, by further developing the machinery introduced by the authors (2020), we establish non-normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure. Due to the singularity of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure with respect to the massive Gaussian free field, this non-normalizability part poses a particular challenge as compared to our previous works. In order to overcome this issue, we first construct a $\sigma$-finite version of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that this measure is not normalizable. Furthermore, we prove that the truncated $\Phi^3_3$-measures have no weak limit in a natural space, even up to a subsequence.
  We also study the dynamical problem. By adapting the paracontrolled approach, in particular from the works by Gubinelli, Koch, and the first author (2018) and by the authors (2020), we prove almost sure global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model and invariance of the Gibbs measure in the weakly nonlinear regime. In the globalization part, we introduce a new, conceptually simple and straightforward approach, where we directly work with the (truncated) Gibbs measure, using the variational formula and ideas from theory of optimal transport.</description>

      <title>A Computational Method for $H_2$-optimal Estimator and State Feedback Controller Synthesis for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present solvable, convex formulations of $H_2$-optimal state estimation and state-feedback control problems for a general class of linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with one spatial dimension. These convex formulations are derived by using an analysis and control framework called the `Partial Integral Equation' (PIE) framework, which utilizes the PIE representation of infinite-dimensional systems. Since PIEs are parameterized by Partial Integral (PI) operators that form an algebra, $H_2$-optimal estimation and control problems for PIEs can be formulated as Linear PI Inequalities (LPIs). Furthermore, if a PDE admits a PIE representation, then the stability and $H_2$ performance of the PIE system implies that of the PDE system. Consequently, the optimal estimator and controller obtained for a PIE using LPIs provide the same stability and performance when applied to the corresponding PDE. These LPI optimization problems can be solved computationally using semi-definite programming solvers because such problems can be formulated using Linear Matrix Inequalities by using positive matrices to parameterize a cone of positive PI operators. We illustrate the application of these methods by constructing observers and controllers for some standard PDE examples.</description>

      <title>Sharp local propagation of chaos for mean field particles with $W^{-1,\infty}$ kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two methods to obtain $O(1/N^2)$ local propagation of chaos bounds for $N$ diffusive particles in $W^{-1,\infty}$ mean field interaction. This extends the recent finding of Lacker [Probab. Math. Phys., 4(2):377-432, 2023] to the case of singular interactions. The first method is based on a hierarchy of relative entropies and Fisher informations, and applies to the 2D viscous vortex model in the high temperature regime. Time-uniform local chaos bounds are also shown in this case. In the second method, we work on a hierarchy of $L^2$ distances and Dirichlet energies, and derive the desired sharp estimates for the same model in short time without restrictions on the temperature.</description>
