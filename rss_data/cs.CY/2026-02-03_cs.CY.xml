      <title>Beyond Static Question Banks: Dynamic Knowledge Expansion via LLM-Automated Graph Construction and Adaptive Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized education systems increasingly rely on structured knowledge representations to support adaptive learning and question generation. However, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations. First, constructing and maintaining knowledge graphs for educational content largely depends on manual curation, resulting in high cost and poor scalability. Second, most personalized education systems lack effective support for state-aware and systematic reasoning over learners' knowledge, and therefore rely on static question banks with limited adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Generative GraphRAG framework for automated knowledge modeling and personalized exercise generation. It consists of two core modules. The first module, Automated Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Constructor (Auto-HKG), leverages LLMs to automatically construct hierarchical knowledge graphs that capture structured concepts and their semantic relations from educational resources. The second module, Cognitive GraphRAG (CG-RAG), performs graph-based reasoning over a learner mastery graph and combines it with retrieval-augmented generation to produce personalized exercises that adapt to individual learning states. The proposed framework has been deployed in real-world educational scenarios, where it receives favorable user feedback, suggesting its potential to support practical personalized education systems.</description>

      <title>Early Warning Signals Appear Long Before Dropping Out: An Idiographic Approach Grounded in Complex Dynamic Systems Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to sustain engagement and recover from setbacks (i.e., resilience) -- is fundamental for learning. When resilience weakens, students are at risk of disengagement and may drop out and miss on opportunities. Therefore, predicting disengagement long before it happens during the window of hope is important. In this article, we test whether early warning signals of resilience loss, grounded in the concept of critical slowing down (CSD) can forecast disengagement before dropping out. CSD has been widely observed across ecological, climate, and neural systems, where it precedes tipping points into catastrophic failure (dropping out in our case). Using 1.67 million practice attempts from 9,401 students who used a digital math learning environment, we computed CSD indicators: autocorrelation, return rate, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and coefficient of variation. We found that 88.2% of students exhibited CSD signals prior to disengagement, with warnings clustering late in activity and before practice ceased (dropping out). Our results provide the first evidence of CSD in education, suggesting that universal resilience dynamics also govern social systems such as human learning. These findings offer a practical indicator for early detection of vulnerability and supporting learners across different applications and contexts long before critical events happen. Most importantly, CSD indicators arise universally, independent of the mechanisms that generate the data, offering new opportunities for portability across contexts, data types, and learning environments.</description>

      <title>Groundwater vulnerability assessment in semi-arid regions using GIS-based DRASTIC models and FUZZY AHP: South Chott Hodna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Groundwater vulnerability is a major concern in arid regions worldwide, where population growth and intensive agriculture increase the risks of depletion and contamination. This study proposes a hybrid groundwater vulnerability assessment framework that improves the conventional DRASTIC model by integrating land-use data and applying advanced weighting techniques, namely the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and its fuzzy logic variant (Fuzzy AHP). This method makes expert-based weighting less subjective, better captures anthropogenic effects, and facilitates adaptation to challenging situations and limited data. Four vulnerability maps were produced using Geographic Information Systems (GIS): DRASTIC, DRASTIC_LU, AHP DRASTIC_LU, and Fuzzy AHP DRASTIC_LU. We used nitrate levels from 70 wells to verify our work. We found that agricultural areas, especially those above the alluvial aquifer, were the most vulnerable. The ROC curve analysis showed that the model improved over time, with the area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.812 for DRASTIC, 0.864 for DRASTIC_LU, 0.875 for AHP DRASTIC_LU, and 0.951 for fuzzy AHP DRASTIC_LU. These results show that fuzzy AHP DRASTIC_LU makes groundwater risk assessments much more. The GIS-based hybrid models offer a scalable and transferable method for mapping vulnerability, but they also provide local and regional water resource managers with useful information.</description>

      <title>Strategies for Creating Uncertainty in the AI Era to Trigger Students Critical Thinking: Pedagogical Design, Assessment Rubric, and Exam System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI challenges traditional assessments by allowing students to produce correct answers without demonstrating understanding or reasoning. Rather than prohibiting AI, this work argues that one way to integrate AI into education is by creating uncertain situations with the help of AI models and using thinking-oriented teaching approaches, where uncertainty is a central pedagogical concept for stimulating students critical thinking. Drawing on epistemology and critical thinking research studies, we propose designing learning activities and assessments around the inherent limitations of both AI models and instructors. This encourages students to reason, question, and justify their final answers. We show how explicitly controlling AI behavior during exams (such as preventing direct answers or generating plausible but flawed responses) prevents AI from becoming a shortcut to certainty. To support this pedagogy, we introduce MindMosaicAIExam, an exam system that integrates controllable AI tools and requires students to provide initial answers, critically evaluate AI outputs, and iteratively refine their reasoning. We also present an evaluation rubric designed to assess critical thinking based on students reasoning artifacts collected by the exam system.</description>

      <title>Happy Young Women, Grumpy Old Men? Emotion-Driven Demographic Biases in Synthetic Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic face generation has rapidly advanced with the emergence of text-to-image (T2I) and of multimodal large language models, enabling high-fidelity image production from natural-language prompts. Despite the widespread adoption of these tools, the biases, representational quality, and cross-cultural consistency of these models remain poorly understood. Prior research on biases in the synthetic generation of human faces has examined demographic biases, yet there is little research on how emotional prompts influence demographic representation and how models trained in different cultural and linguistic contexts vary in their output distributions. We present a systematic audit of eight state-of-the-art T2I models comprising four models developed by Western organizations and four developed by Chinese institutions, all prompted identically. Using state-of-the-art facial analysis algorithms, we estimate the gender, race, age, and attractiveness levels in the generated faces. To measure the deviations from global population statistics, we apply information-theoretic bias metrics including Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences. Our findings reveal persistent demographic and emotion-conditioned biases in all models regardless of their country of origin. We discuss implications for fairness, socio-technical harms, governance, and the development of transparent generative systems.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Stochastic Penal Colony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With peak content moderation seemingly behind us, this paper revisits its punitive side. But instead of focusing on who is being (disproportionately) moderated, it focuses on the punishment itself and makes three contributions. First, it develops a novel methodology that combines auto-ethnography for collecting experiences and artifacts with procedural justice for analyzing them. Second, it reworks Foucault's model of the penal system for the algorithmic age, restoring the penal colony as the historically liminal practice between punishment as performance and punishment as discipline, i.e., the stochastic penal colony. Finally, it applies this methodological and conceptual framing to three case studies, one on the gallingly performative moderation by pre-Musk Twitter, one on the exhaustively punitive content moderation for OpenAI's DALLE~2, and one on the relatively light touch but still rather precious moderation by Pinterest. While substantially different, all three feature the pervasive threat of account suspension, thereby banishing users to the stochastic penal colony.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Student Responses: LLM-Extracted Features for IRT Difficulty Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Educational assessment relies heavily on knowing question difficulty, traditionally determined through resource-intensive pre-testing with students. This creates significant barriers for both classroom teachers and assessment developers. We investigate whether Item Response Theory (IRT) difficulty parameters can be accurately estimated without student testing by modeling the response process and explore the relative contribution of different feature types to prediction accuracy. Our approach combines traditional linguistic features with pedagogical insights extracted using Large Language Models (LLMs), including solution step count, cognitive complexity, and potential misconceptions. We implement a two-stage process: first training a neural network to predict how students would respond to questions, then deriving difficulty parameters from these simulated response patterns. Using a dataset of over 250,000 student responses to mathematics questions, our model achieves a Pearson correlation of approximately 0.78 between predicted and actual difficulty parameters on completely unseen questions.</description>

      <title>LSSF: Safety Alignment for Large Language Models through Low-Rank Safety Subspace Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safety mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) exhibit notable fragility, as even fine-tuning on datasets without harmful content may still undermine their safety capabilities. Meanwhile, existing safety alignment methods predominantly rely on the fine-tuning process, which inadvertently leads to the increased complexity and computational resources required. To address these issues, we introduce LSSF, a novel safety re-alignment framework with \underline{L}ow-Rank \underline{S}afety \underline{S}ubspace \underline{F}usion. Our proposed method exploits the low-rank characteristics of safety information in LLMs by constructing a low-rank projection matrix to extract the principal components of safety vectors. Notably, this projection matrix represents the low-rank safety subspace of the LLMs, which we have observed to remain stable during fine-tuning process and is isolated from the model's general capabilities. These principal components are used to effectively restore safety alignment when combined with fine-tuned LLMs through linear arithmetic. Additionally, to account for the varying encoding densities of safety information across different layers of LLMs, we propose a novel metric called safety singular value entropy. This metric quantifies the encoding density and allows for the dynamic computation of the safety-critical rank for each safety vector. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed post-hoc alignment method can effectively restore the safety alignment of fine-tuned models with minimal impact on their performance in downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Student Perceptions of Large Language Models Use in Self-Reflection and Design Critique in Architecture Studio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the feedback mechanisms of the architectural design studio, shifting the focus from generative production to reflective pedagogy. Employing a mixed-methods approach with architecture students at the Singapore Uni-versity of Technology and Design, the research analyzes student percep-tions across three distinct feedback domains: self-reflection, peer critique, and professor-led reviews. The findings reveal that students engage with LLMs not as authoritative instructors, but as collaborative "cognitive mir-rors" that scaffold critical thinking. In self-directed learning, LLMs help structure thoughts and overcome the "blank page" problem, though they are limited by a lack of contextual nuance. In peer critiques, the technology serves as a neutral mediator, mitigating social anxiety and the "fear of of-fending". Furthermore, in high-stakes professor-led juries, students utilize LLMs primarily as post-critique synthesis engines to manage cognitive overload and translate abstract academic discourse into actionable design iterations.</description>

      <title>When LLMs Imagine People: A Human-Centered Persona Brainstorm Audit for Bias and Fairness in Creative Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biased outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) can reinforce stereotypes and perpetuate inequities in real-world applications, making fairness auditing essential. We introduce the Persona Brainstorm Audit (PBA), a scalable and transparent auditing method for detecting bias through open-ended persona generation. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed identity categories and static benchmarks, PBA uncovers biases across multiple social dimensions while supporting longitudinal tracking and mitigating data leakage risks. Applying PBA to 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, we compare bias severity across models, dimensions, and versions, uncover distinct patterns and lineage-specific variability, and trace how biases attenuate, persist, or resurface across successive generations. Robustness analyses show PBA remains stable under varying sample sizes, role-playing prompts, and debiasing prompts, establishing its reliability for fairness auditing in LLMs.</description>

      <title>AI in Debt Collection: Estimating the Psychological Impact on Consumers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the psychological and behavioral implications of integrating AI into debt collection practices using data from eleven European countries. Drawing on a large-scale experimental design (n = 3514) comparing human versus AI-mediated communication, we examine effects on consumers' social preferences (fairness, trust, reciprocity, efficiency) and social emotions (stigma, empathy). Participants perceive human interactions as more fair and more likely to elicit reciprocity, while AI-mediated communication is viewed as more efficient; no differences emerge in trust. Human contact elicits greater empathy, but also stronger feelings of stigma. Exploratory analyses reveal notable variation between gender, age groups, and cultural contexts. In general, the findings suggest that AI-mediated communication can improve efficiency and reduce stigma without diminishing trust, but should be used carefully in situations that require high empathy or increased sensitivity to fairness. The study advances our understanding of how AI influences the psychological dynamics in sensitive financial interactions and informs the design of communication strategies that balance technological effectiveness with interpersonal awareness.</description>

      <title>Examining The CoVCues Dataset: Supporting COVID Infodemic Research Through A Novel User Assessment Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The public confidence and trust in online healthcare information have been greatly dented following the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered a significant rise in online health misinformation. Existing literature shows that different datasets have been created to aid with detecting false information associated with this COVID infodemic. However, most of these datasets contain mostly unimodal data, which comprise primarily textual cues, and not visual cues, like images, infographics, and other graphic data components. Prior works point to the fact that there are only a handful of multimodal datasets that support COVID misinformation identification, and they lack an organized, processed and analyzed repository of visual cues. The novel CoVCues dataset, which represents a varied set of image artifacts, addresses this gap and advocates for the use of visual cues towards detecting online health misinformation. As part of validating the contents and utility of our CoVCues dataset, we have conducted a preliminary user assessment study, where different participants have been surveyed through a set of questionnaires to determine how effectively these dataset images contribute to the user perceived information reliability. These survey responses helped provide early insights into how different stakeholder groups interpret visual cues in the context of online health information and communication. The findings from this novel user assessment study offer valuable feedback for refining our CoVCues dataset and for supporting our claim that visual cues are underutilized but useful in combating the COVID infodemic. To our knowledge, this user assessment research study, as described in this paper, is the first of its kind work, involving COVID visual cues, that demonstrates the important role that our CoVCues dataset can potentially play in aiding COVID infodemic related future research work.</description>

      <title>How Hyper-Datafication Impacts the Sustainability Costs in Frontier AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale data has fuelled the success of frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models over the past decade. This expansion has relied on sustained efforts by large technology corporations to aggregate and curate internet-scale datasets. In this work, we examine the environmental, social, and economic costs of large-scale data in AI through a sustainability lens. We argue that the field is shifting from building models from data to actively creating data for building models. We characterise this transition as hyper-datafication, which marks a critical juncture for the future of frontier AI and its societal impacts. To quantify and contextualise data-related costs, we analyse approximately 550,000 datasets from the Hugging Face Hub, focusing on dataset growth, storage-related energy consumption and carbon footprint, and societal representation using language data. We complement this analysis with qualitative responses from data workers in Kenya to examine the labour involved, including direct employment by big tech corporations and exposure to graphic content. We further draw on external data sources to substantiate our findings by illustrating the global disparity in data centre infrastructure. Our analyses reveal that hyper-datafication does not merely increase resource consumption but systematically redistributes environmental burdens, labour risks, and representational harms toward the Global South, precarious data workers, and under-represented cultures. Thus, we propose Data PROOFS recommendations spanning provenance, resource awareness, ownership, openness, frugality, and standards to mitigate these costs. Our work aims to make visible the often-overlooked costs of data that underpin frontier AI and to stimulate broader debate within the research community and beyond.</description>

      <title>A longitudinal geospatial multimodal dataset of post-discharge frailty, physiology, mobility, and neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frailty in older adults is associated with increased vulnerability to functional decline, reduced mobility, social isolation, and challenges during the transition from hospital to community living. These factors are associated with rehospitalization and may adversely influence recovery. Neighborhood environments can further shape recovery trajectories by affecting mobility opportunities, social engagement, and access to community resources. Multimodal sensing technologies combined with data-driven analytical approaches offer the potential to continuously monitor these multidimensional factors in real-world settings. This Data Descriptor presents GEOFRAIL, a longitudinal geospatial multimodal dataset collected from community-dwelling frail older adults following hospital discharge. The dataset is organized into interconnected tables capturing participant demographics, features derived from multimodal sensors, biweekly clinical assessments of frailty, physical function, and social isolation, and temporal location records linked to neighborhood amenities, crime rates, and census-based socioeconomic indicators. Data were collected over an eight-week post-discharge period using standardized pipelines with privacy-preserving spatial aggregation. Technical validation demonstrates internal consistency across geospatial, sensor-derived, and clinical measures and reports baseline performance of machine learning models for characterizing recovery trajectories.</description>

      <title>Simple Role Assignment is Extraordinarily Effective for Safety Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Principle-based alignment often lacks context sensitivity and completeness. Grounded in Theory of Mind, we propose role conditioning as a compact alternative: social roles (e.g., mother, judge) implicitly encode both values and the cognitive schemas required to apply them. We introduce a training-free pipeline featuring a role-conditioned generator and iterative role-based critics for refinement. Across five model families, our approach consistently outperforms principle-based, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and other baselines across benchmarks. Notably, it reduces unsafe outputs on the WildJailbreak benchmark from 81.4\% to 3.6\% with DeepSeek-V3. Not only for common safety benchmarks, it consistently applies for agentic safety tasks. These results establish role assignment as a powerful, interpretable paradigm for AI alignment and LLM-as-a-Judge construction.</description>

      <title>Responsible Evaluation of AI for Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although artificial intelligence (AI) shows growing promise for mental health care, current approaches to evaluating AI tools in this domain remain fragmented and poorly aligned with clinical practice, social context, and first-hand user experience. This paper argues for a rethinking of responsible evaluation -- what is measured, by whom, and for what purpose -- by introducing an interdisciplinary framework that integrates clinical soundness, social context, and equity, providing a structured basis for evaluation. Through an analysis of 135 recent *CL publications, we identify recurring limitations, including over-reliance on generic metrics that do not capture clinical validity, therapeutic appropriateness, or user experience, limited participation from mental health professionals, and insufficient attention to safety and equity. To address these gaps, we propose a taxonomy of AI mental health support types -- assessment-, intervention-, and information synthesis-oriented -- each with distinct risks and evaluative requirements, and illustrate its use through case studies.</description>

      <title>FoundationalASSIST: An Educational Dataset for Foundational Knowledge Tracing and Pedagogical Grounding of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can Large Language Models understand how students learn? As LLMs are deployed for adaptive testing and personalized tutoring, this question becomes urgent -- yet we cannot answer it with existing resources. Current educational datasets provide only question identifiers and binary correctness labels, rendering them opaque to LLMs that reason in natural language. We address this gap with FoundationalASSIST, the first English educational dataset providing the complete information needed for research on LLMs in education: full question text, actual student responses (not just right/wrong), records of which wrong answers students chose, and alignment to Common Core K-12 standards. These 1.7 million interactions from 5,000 students enable research directions that were previously impossible to pursue, from fine-tuning student models to analyzing misconception patterns. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we evaluate four frontier models (GPT-OSS-120B, Llama-3.3-70B, Qwen3-Next-80B variants) on two complementary task families: Knowledge Tracing, testing whether LLMs can predict student performance on questions, and the exact answer a student will give; and \textbf{Pedagogical Grounding}, testing whether LLMs understand the properties that make assessment items effective. Our evaluation reveals significant gaps in current LLM capabilities. Every model barely achieves a trivial baseline on knowledge tracing. All models fall below random chance on item discrimination, indicating that LLMs do not understand what makes one problem more diagnostic than another. Models do show competence at judging relative difficulty (up to 68.6%), but this partial success only highlights the gaps elsewhere. These results establish that substantial advances are needed before LLMs can reliably support personalized learning at scale. We release FoundationalASSIST to support progress on these foundational challenges.</description>

      <title>Adoption and Use of LLMs at an Academic Medical Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) can support clinical documentation needs, standalone tools struggle with "workflow friction" from manual data entry. We developed ChatEHR, a system that enables the use of LLMs with the entire patient timeline spanning several years. ChatEHR enables automations - which are static combinations of prompts and data that perform a fixed task - and interactive use in the electronic health record (EHR) via a user interface (UI). The resulting ability to sift through patient medical records for diverse use-cases such as pre-visit chart review, screening for transfer eligibility, monitoring for surgical site infections, and chart abstraction, redefines LLM use as an institutional capability. This system, accessible after user-training, enables continuous monitoring and evaluation of LLM use.
  In 1.5 years, we built 7 automations and 1075 users have trained to become routine users of the UI, engaging in 23,000 sessions in the first 3 months of launch. For automations, being model-agnostic and accessing multiple types of data was essential for matching specific clinical or administrative tasks with the most appropriate LLM. Benchmark-based evaluations proved insufficient for monitoring and evaluation of the UI, requiring new methods to monitor performance. Generation of summaries was the most frequent task in the UI, with an estimated 0.73 hallucinations and 1.60 inaccuracies per generation. The resulting mix of cost savings, time savings, and revenue growth required a value assessment framework to prioritize work as well as quantify the impact of using LLMs. Initial estimates are $6M savings in the first year of use, without quantifying the benefit of the better care offered. Such a "build-from-within" strategy provides an opportunity for health systems to maintain agency via a vendor-agnostic, internally governed LLM platform.</description>

      <title>Standards for trustworthy AI in the European Union: technical rationale, structural challenges, and an implementation path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This white paper examines the technical foundations of European AI standardization under the AI Act. It explains how harmonized standards enable the presumption of conformity mechanism, describes the CEN/CENELEC standardization process, and analyzes why AI poses unique standardization challenges including stochastic behavior, data dependencies, immature evaluation practices, and lifecycle dynamics. The paper argues that AI systems are typically components within larger sociotechnical systems, requiring a layered approach where horizontal standards define process obligations and evidence structures while sectoral profiles specify domain-specific thresholds and acceptance criteria. It proposes a workable scheme based on risk management, reproducible technical checks redefined as stability of measured properties, structured documentation, comprehensive logging, and assurance cases that evolve over the system lifecycle. The paper demonstrates that despite methodological difficulties, technical standards remain essential for translating legal obligations into auditable engineering practice and enabling scalable conformity assessment across providers, assessors, and enforcement authorities</description>

      <title>Exploring the Role of Automated Feedback in Programming Education: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated feedback systems have become increasingly integral to programming education, where learners engage in iterative cycles of code construction, testing, and refinement. Despite its wider integration in practices and technical advancements into AI, research in this area remains fragmented, lacking synthesis across technological and instructional dimensions. This systematic literature review synthesizes 61 empirical studies published by September 2024, offering a conceptually grounded analysis of automated feedback systems across five dimensions: system architecture, pedagogical function, interaction mechanism, contextual deployment, and evaluation approach. Findings reveal that most systems are fully automated, embedded within online platforms, and primarily focused on error detection and code correctness. While recent developments incorporate adaptive features and large language models to enable more personalized and interactive feedback, few systems offer support for higher-order learning processes, interactive components, or learner agency. Moreover, evaluation practices tend to emphasize short-term performance gains, with limited attention to long-term outcomes or instructional integration. These findings call for a reimagining of automated feedback not as a technical add-on for error correction, but as a pedagogical scaffold that supports deeper, adaptive, and interactive learning.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence in Small and Medium Enterprises: Navigating its Promises and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest technological developments in generative artificial intelligence (GAI) offer powerful capabilities to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), as they facilitate the democratization of both scalability and creativity. Even if they have little technical expertise or financial resources, SMEs can leverage this technology to streamline work processes and unleash innovation, thereby improving their product offerings and long-term competitiveness. This paper discusses how SMEs can navigate both the promises and challenges of GAI and offers a roadmap for deploying GAI. We introduce a sailing metaphor that reveals key strategic dimensions for GAI deployment: competency of employees, effective leadership and work values, organizational culture, collaboration and cooperation, and relationships with third parties. We offer practical recommendations that serve as a useful compass for successfully deploying GAI in SMEs.</description>

      <title>Not All Students Engage Alike: Multi-Institution Patterns in GenAI Tutor Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has created unprecedented opportunities to provide individualized learning support in classrooms as automated tutoring systems at scale. However, concerns have been raised that students may engage with these tools in ways that do not support learning. Moreover, student engagement with GenAI Tutors may vary across instructional contexts, potentially leading to unequal learning experiences. In this study, we utilize de-identified student interaction logs from an existing GenAI Tutor and the learning management system in which it is embedded. We systematically examined student engagement (N = 11,406) with the tool across 200 classes in ten post-secondary institutions through a two-stage pipeline: First, we identified four distinct engagement types at the conversation session level. In particular, 10.4% of them were "shallow engagement" where copy-pasting behavior was prevalent. Then, at the student level, we show that students transitioned across engagement types over time. However, students who exhibited shallow engagement with the tool were more likely to remain in this mode, whereas those who engaged deeply with the tool transitioned more flexibly across engagement types. Finally, at both the session and student levels, we show substantial heterogeneity in student engagement across institution selectivity and course disciplines. In particular, students from highly selective institutions were more likely to exhibit deep engagement. Together, our study advances the understanding of how GenAI Tutors are used in authentic educational settings and provides a framework for analyzing student engagement with GenAI Tutors, with implications for responsible implementation at scale.</description>

      <title>A Qualitative Study of IT Students' Skill Development: Comparing Online and Face- to-Face Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each student has specific characteristics and learning preferences, that reflect on each type of learning environment, online or face-to-face. Understanding these differences is crucial for educators to create learning environments that can inspire and engage students. This qualitative study explores and tries to better understand, specifically the IT student's experiences and perceived skills development in online and face-to-face learning environments, while trying to address the question: "Regarding online and face-to-face learning environments, in IT, how do students experience and assess their skill development in one learning environment compared to the other?". Using a social constructive paradigm, the purpose of the research is to focus as much as possible on the student's views of the situation and how their perspectives and experiences shape the perception of developed skills. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews by focusing on the student and asking for their personal experience on skill development through online and face-to-face learning environments. The data analysis strategy adopts the grounded theory approach, using a systematic procedure. The results suggest that face-to-face learning may develop a better communication and collaborative skills more effectively while experiencing a synchronous interaction, where online learning may strength in self-regulation and adaptability skills because of the independence and flexibility it provides. This study produces two grounded theories that explain how different IT learning environments influence the development of student's specific skills, that can contribute to pedagogical discussions on optimizing hybrid learning experiences.</description>

      <title>PS$^2$: Parameterized Control for Fine-Grained Student Proficiency Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how students with different proficiency levels respond to educational materials is a critical issue within the field of AI for Education. However, acquiring sufficient real student response data for a robust evaluation is often hindered by cost, ethics, and security constraints. Consequently, LLM-based student proficiency simulation, especially prompt-based methods, has emerged as a practical alternative under data-scarce conditions. Despite their promise, current methods still exhibit limited controllability with coarse-grained proficiency representations, high sensitivity to prompt design, and the lack of calibration with academic performance. Therefore, we propose Parameterized Student Proficiency Simulation (PS$^2$), an unsupervised and parameterized model-level framework that simulates students with different proficiencies by interpolating between a strong upper-bound LLM and a weaker, cognitive error-informed lower-bound student LLM via a hybrid ratio. Specifically, the lower-bound model is constructed by fine-tuning the weaker LM to exhibit cognitive errors when responding to educational materials. To ensure alignment with target proficiency levels, PS$^2$ further calibrates the interpolation ratio with academic performance. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that PS$^2$ achieves finer-grained and consistent proficiency simulation compared to existing baselines, leading to superior performance in student behavior similarity and item difficulty prediction.</description>

      <title>Does Ad-Free Mean Less Data Collection? An Empirical Study of Platform Data Practices and User Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online platforms increasingly offer "paid" ad-free subscriptions as an alternative to the traditional "free" ad-based model. The transition to ad-free models ostensibly removes advertising as a key justification for data processing under the GDPR. So, normatively, platforms should collect less user data. However, platforms may justify continued data collection as a means to provide an improved, personalized experience. This tension between privacy principles and platform incentives raises a critical underexplored question: do data collection practices vary between ad-free and ad-based subscription models?
  In this paper, we shed light on this important privacy issue by investigating the alignment between platform data collection practices and related user expectations. With respect to data collection process, our analyses of data exports from three major online platforms - Instagram, Facebook, and X - reveal that these platforms continue to retain or collect some ad-related data, even in ad-free subscriptions. With respect to user expectations, our survey among 255 participants on Prolific reveals that 69% of the participants normatively expect data collection to be reduced, indicating their expectation of improved digital privacy in an ad-free model. However, when asked what they think actually happens, 63% of these participants believed that platforms would still collect about the same amount of data, highlighting skepticism about platform practices. Our findings not only indicate a significant disconnect between data practices and normative user expectations, but also raise serious questions about platform compliance with core GDPR principles, such as purpose limitation, data minimization, and transparency.</description>

      <title>Making Bias Non-Predictive: Training Robust LLM Judges via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated judges, yet they remain susceptible to cognitive biases -- often altering their reasoning when faced with spurious prompt-level cues such as consensus claims or authority appeals. Existing mitigations via prompting or supervised fine-tuning fail to generalize, as they modify surface behavior without changing the optimization objective that makes bias cues predictive. To address this gap, we propose Epistemic Independence Training (EIT), a reinforcement learning framework grounded in a key principle: to learn independence, bias cues must be made non-predictive of reward. EIT operationalizes this through a balanced conflict strategy where bias signals are equally likely to support correct and incorrect answers, combined with a reward design that penalizes bias-following without rewarding bias agreement. Experiments on Qwen3-4B demonstrate that EIT improves both accuracy and robustness under adversarial biases, while preserving performance when bias aligns with truth. Notably, models trained only on bandwagon bias generalize to unseen bias types such as authority and distraction, indicating that EIT induces transferable epistemic independence rather than bias-specific heuristics. Code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/bias-mitigation-with-rl-BC47.</description>

      <title>DrawSim-PD: Simulating Student Science Drawings to Support NGSS-Aligned Teacher Diagnostic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing expertise in diagnostic reasoning requires practice with diverse student artifacts, yet privacy regulations prohibit sharing authentic student work for teacher professional development (PD) at scale. We present DrawSim-PD, the first generative framework that simulates NGSS-aligned, student-like science drawings exhibiting controllable pedagogical imperfections to support teacher training. Central to our approach are apability profiles--structured cognitive states encoding what students at each performance level can and cannot yet demonstrate. These profiles ensure cross-modal coherence across generated outputs: (i) a student-like drawing, (ii) a first-person reasoning narrative, and (iii) a teacher-facing diagnostic concept map. Using 100 curated NGSS topics spanning K-12, we construct a corpus of 10,000 systematically structured artifacts. Through an expert-based feasibility evaluation, K--12 science educators verified the artifacts' alignment with NGSS expectations (&gt;84% positive on core items) and utility for interpreting student thinking, while identifying refinement opportunities for grade-band extremes. We release this open infrastructure to overcome data scarcity barriers in visual assessment research.</description>

      <title>Multi-party Computation Protocols for Post-Market Fairness Monitoring in Algorithmic Hiring: From Legal Requirements to Computational Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-market fairness monitoring is now mandated to ensure fairness and accountability for high-risk employment AI systems under emerging regulations such as the EU AI Act. However, effective fairness monitoring often requires access to sensitive personal data, which is subject to strict legal protections under data protection law. Multi-party computation (MPC) offers a promising technical foundation for compliant post-market fairness monitoring, enabling the secure computation of fairness metrics without revealing sensitive attributes. Despite growing technical interest, the operationalization of MPC-based fairness monitoring in real-world hiring contexts under concrete legal, industrial, and usability constraints remains unknown. This work addresses this gap through a co-design approach integrating technical, legal, and industrial expertise. We identify practical design requirements for MPC-based fairness monitoring, develop an end-to-end, legally compliant protocol spanning the full data lifecycle, and empirically validate it in a large-scale industrial setting. Our findings provide actionable design insights as well as legal and industrial implications for deploying MPC-based post-market fairness monitoring in algorithmic hiring systems.</description>

      <title>The Verification Crisis: Expert Perceptions of GenAI Disinformation and the Case for Reproducible Provenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has shifted disinformation production from manual fabrication to automated, large-scale manipulation. This article presents findings from the first wave of a longitudinal expert perception survey (N=21) involving AI researchers, policymakers, and disinformation specialists. It examines the perceived severity of multimodal threats -- text, image, audio, and video -- and evaluates current mitigation strategies.
  Results indicate that while deepfake video presents immediate "shock" value, large-scale text generation poses a systemic risk of "epistemic fragmentation" and "synthetic consensus," particularly in the political domain. The survey reveals skepticism about technical detection tools, with experts favoring provenance standards and regulatory frameworks despite implementation barriers.
  GenAI disinformation research requires reproducible methods. The current challenge is measurement: without standardized benchmarks and reproducibility checklists, tracking or countering synthetic media remains difficult. We propose treating information integrity as an infrastructure with rigor in data provenance and methodological reproducibility.</description>

      <title>MetaCLASS: Metacognitive Coaching for Learning with Adaptive Self-regulation Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models can generate fluent explanations, but effective tutoring requires supporting the learner's thought process, not just delivering content. Metacognitive tutoring targets this gap by prompting planning, monitoring, debugging, and evaluation, and crucially, deciding when to be active versus minimally present, based on learner signals and trajectory. We introduce MetaCLASS, a learning-science grounded framework that formulates metacognitive tutoring as move selection over 11 interpretable actions aligned to self-regulated learning processes. MetaCLASS uses a two-phase framework that first plans a pedagogical trajectory conditioned on learner profiles (calibration, help-seeking) and then generates natural dialogue consistent with that plan. This yields a dataset of 1,015 conversations (7,711 turns) annotated with turn-level metacognitive labels, and validated for pedagogical contingency and trajectory adherence. We benchmark nine LLMs on predicting the next coach move given the problem and dialogue context. The best model achieves only 43.2\% accuracy, and models exhibit compulsive intervention bias: in turns where effective metacognitive tutoring requires silent (41.7\% of cases), models predict `no intervention' only 4.2\% of the time, while severely over-predicting high-intervention moves. These results show that traditional content-based tutoring ability does not translate to metacognitive tutoring competence, positioning MetaCLASS as a testbed for developing intelligent tutors that promote self-regulated learning.</description>

      <title>Motivation, Attention, and Visual Platform Design: How Moral Contagions Spread on TikTok and Instagram in the 2024 United States Presidential Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual social media platforms have become primary venues for political discourse, yet we know little about how moralization operates differently across platforms and topics. Analyzing 2,027,595 TikToks and 1,126,972 Instagram posts during the 2024 US presidential election, we demonstrate that issues are not necessarily inherently moralized, but a product of audience demographics, platform architecture, and partisan framing. Using temporal supply-demand analysis and moral foundations scoring (eMFD), we examine the dynamics of key electoral issues. Three key findings emerge. First, moralization patterns diverge dramatically by platform: TikTok's algorithm enabled viral spread of moralized abortion and immigration content despite lower supply, while Instagram amplified economic discourse that aligned supply and demand. Second, traditionally "pragmatic" economic issues became moralized-cryptocurrency discourse invoked loyalty and authority foundations more strongly than any other topic, framing regulation as government overreach. Third, platforms responded to different events: TikTok surged after Harris's nomination across all topics (96% reduction in supply volatility), while Instagram spiked around cryptocurrency policy developments. Semantic network analysis reveals TikTok's circular topology enables cross-cutting exposure while Instagram's fragmented structure isolates Harris from economic discourse. These findings demonstrate that understanding political moralization requires examining platform-specific ecosystems where architecture, demographics, and content strategy interact to determine which issues get moralized and how moral content spreads.</description>

      <title>Culinary Crossroads: A RAG Framework for Enhancing Diversity in Cross-Cultural Recipe Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers: it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book LLMs.</description>

      <title>Front-Loaded or Balanced? The Mechanism through Which Review Order Affects Overall Ratings in Premium Service Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the increasingly prevalent landscape of high-quality service contexts, whether consumer evaluation interfaces adopt a rating-first or review-first sequence has become a critical factor shaping rating authenticity and feedback quality. While prior research has primarily examined review content and sentiment, systematic investigation into how evaluation order influences rating outcomes remains limited. Through exploratory analyses, we find that Letterboxd -- which employs a review-first, rating-after mechanism -- exhibits a more centralized rating distribution with fewer extreme scores, whereas Yelp -- which adopts a rating-first, review-after mechanism -- shows a pronounced bimodal distribution with more polarized ratings. Three controlled experiments further demonstrate that in high-quality service contexts, a rating-first (vs. review-first) interface significantly elevates consumers' overall ratings. Mechanism analyses indicate that cognitive effort and affective heuristics serve as dual pathways: a rating-first (vs. review-first) sequence reduces cognitive effort and heightens affective heuristics, thereby increasing rating scores. Moreover, service quality moderates this process. When service quality is low, the rating-first (vs. review-first) sequence instead leads to lower ratings. This research reveals the psychological mechanisms through which evaluation order affects consumer ratings via cognitive and affective pathways. It extends theoretical understanding of online rating formation and offers practical implications for optimizing platform interface design to enhance rating authenticity and credibility.</description>

      <title>OGD4All: A Framework for Accessible Interaction with Geospatial Open Government Data Based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present OGD4All, a transparent, auditable, and reproducible framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance citizens' interaction with geospatial Open Government Data (OGD). The system combines semantic data retrieval, agentic reasoning for iterative code generation, and secure sandboxed execution that produces verifiable multimodal outputs. Evaluated on a 199-question benchmark covering both factual and unanswerable questions, across 430 City-of-Zurich datasets and 11 LLMs, OGD4All reaches 98% analytical correctness and 94% recall while reliably rejecting questions unsupported by available data, which minimizes hallucination risks. Statistical robustness tests, as well as expert feedback, show reliability and social relevance. The proposed approach shows how LLMs can provide explainable, multimodal access to public data, advancing trustworthy AI for open governance.</description>

      <title>SafeTalkCoach: Diversity-Driven Multi-Agent Simulation for Parent-Teen Health Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of effective parent-child communication about sexual health is widely acknowledged, but real-world data on these conversations is scarce and challenging to collect, due to their private and sensitive nature. Although LLMs have been widely adopted in dialogue generation, they may deviate from best practices and frequently lack realism and diversity. We introduce SafeTalkCoach, a diversity-driven multi-agent dialogue generation framework that simulates parent-child conversations about sexual health, and present an accompanying dataset. SafeTalkCoach integrates crowd-sourced and synthesized scenarios, established sexual health guidelines, evidence-based personas, adaptive control modules, and hierarchical diversification. Through evaluations, we demonstrate that SafeTalkCoach generates diverse conversations while maintaining realism, communication quality, and controllability in practice. Our goal is that the SafeTalkCoach framework and the dataset support both AI research and health communications practices.</description>

      <title>Toward Trait-Aware Learning Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning analytics (LA) draws from the learning sciences to interpret learner behavior and inform system design. Yet, past personalization remains largely at the content or performance level (during learner-system interactions), overlooking relatively stable individual differences such as personality (unfolding over long-term learning trajectories such as college degrees). The latter could bring underappreciated benefits to the design, implementation, and impact of LA. In this position paper, we conduct an ad hoc literature review and argue for an expanded framing of LA that centers on learner traits as key to both interpreting and designing close-the-loop experiments in LA. We show that personality traits are relevant to LA's central outcomes (e.g., engagement and achievement) and conducive to action, as their established ties to human-computer interaction (HCI) inform how systems time, frame, and personalize support. Drawing inspiration from HCI, where psychometrics inform personalization strategies, we propose that LA can evolve by treating traits not only as predictive features but as design resources and moderators of analytics efficacy. In line with past position papers published at LAK, we present a research agenda grounded in the LA cycle and discuss methodological and ethical challenges.</description>

      <title>Trade-offs Between Individual and Group Fairness in Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has become a central concern in computational decision-making systems, where ensuring equitable outcomes is essential for both ethical and legal reasons. Two dominant notions of fairness have emerged in the literature: Group Fairness (GF), which focuses on mitigating disparities across demographic subpopulations, and Individual Fairness (IF), which emphasizes consistent treatment of similar individuals. These notions have traditionally been studied in isolation. In contrast, this survey examines methods that jointly address GF and IF, integrating both perspectives within unified frameworks and explicitly characterizing the trade-offs between them. We provide a systematic and critical review of hybrid fairness approaches, organizing existing methods according to the fairness mechanisms they employ and the algorithmic and mathematical strategies used to reconcile multiple fairness criteria. For each class of methods, we examine their theoretical foundations, optimization mechanisms, and empirical evaluation practices, and discuss their limitations. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and identify open research directions for developing principled, context-aware hybrid fairness methods. By synthesizing insights across the literature, this survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to design hybrid algorithms that provide reliable fairness guarantees at both the individual and group levels.</description>

      <title>EDU-CIRCUIT-HW: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Real-World University-Level STEM Student Handwritten Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant promise for revolutionizing traditional education and reducing teachers' workload. However, accurately interpreting unconstrained STEM student handwritten solutions with intertwined mathematical formulas, diagrams, and textual reasoning poses a significant challenge due to the lack of authentic and domain-specific benchmarks. Additionally, current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on the outcomes of downstream tasks (e.g., auto-grading), which often probe only a subset of the recognized content, thereby failing to capture the MLLMs' understanding of complex handwritten logic as a whole. To bridge this gap, we release EDU-CIRCUIT-HW, a dataset consisting of 1,300+ authentic student handwritten solutions from a university-level STEM course. Utilizing the expert-verified verbatim transcriptions and grading reports of student solutions, we simultaneously evaluate various MLLMs' upstream recognition fidelity and downstream auto-grading performance. Our evaluation uncovers an astonishing scale of latent failures within MLLM-recognized student handwritten content, highlighting the models' insufficient reliability for auto-grading and other understanding-oriented applications in high-stakes educational settings. In solution, we present a case study demonstrating that leveraging identified error patterns to preemptively detect and rectify recognition errors, with only minimal human intervention (approximately 4% of the total solutions), can significantly enhance the robustness of the deployed AI-enabled grading system on unseen student solutions.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Forgetting: Attack Unlearned Diffusion via Initial Latent Variable Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although unlearning-based defenses claim to purge Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) concepts from diffusion models (DMs), we reveals that this "forgetting" is largely an illusion. Unlearning partially disrupts the mapping between linguistic symbols and the underlying knowledge, which remains intact as dormant memories. We find that the distributional discrepancy in the denoising process serves as a measurable indicator of how much of the mapping is retained, also reflecting the strength of unlearning. Inspired by this, we propose IVO (Initial Latent Variable Optimization), a concise and powerful attack framework that reactivates these dormant memories by reconstructing the broken mappings. Through Image Inversion}, Adversarial Optimization and Reused Attack, IVO optimizes initial latent variables to realign the noise distribution of unlearned models with their original unsafe states. Extensive experiments across 8 widely used unlearning techniques demonstrate that IVO achieves superior attack success rates and strong semantic consistency, exposing fundamental flaws in current defenses. The code is available at anonymous.4open.science/r/IVO/. Warning: This paper has unsafe images that may offend some readers.</description>

      <title>Development of a Cacao Disease Identification and Management App Using Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smallholder cacao producers often rely on outdated farming techniques and face significant challenges from pests and diseases, unlike larger plantations with more resources and expertise. In the Philippines, cacao farmers have limited access to data, information, and good agricultural practices. This study addresses these issues by developing a mobile application for cacao disease identification and management that functions offline, enabling use in remote areas where farms are mostly located. The core of the system is a deep learning model trained to identify cacao diseases accurately. The trained model is integrated into the mobile app to support farmers in field diagnosis. The disease identification model achieved a validation accuracy of 96.93% while the model for detecting cacao black pod infection levels achieved 79.49% validation accuracy. Field testing of the application showed an agreement rate of 84.2% compared with expert cacao technician assessments. This approach empowers smallholder farmers by providing accessible, technology-enabled tools to improve cacao crop health and productivity.</description>

      <title>Does Algorithmic Uncertainty Sway Human Experts? Evidence from a Field Experiment in Selective College Admissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic predictions are inherently uncertain: even models with similar aggregate accuracy can produce different predictions for the same individual, raising concerns that high-stakes decisions may become sensitive to arbitrary modeling choices. In this paper, we define algorithmic reliance as the extent to which a decision outcome depends on whether a more favorable versus less favorable algorithmic prediction is presented to the decision-maker. We estimate this in a randomized field experiment (n=19,545) embedded in a selective U.S. college admissions cycle, in which admissions officers reviewed each application alongside an algorithmic score while we randomly varied whether the score came from one of two similarly accurate prediction models. Although the two models performed similarly in aggregate, they frequently assigned different scores to the same applicant, creating exogenous variation in the score shown. Surprisingly, we find little evidence of algorithmic reliance: presenting a more favorable score does not meaningfully increase an applicant's probability of admission on average, even when the models disagree substantially. These findings suggest that, in this expert, high-stakes setting, human decision-making is largely invariant to arbitrary variation in algorithmic predictions, underscoring the role of professional discretion and institutional context in mediating the downstream effects of algorithmic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>When Handwriting Goes Social: Creativity, Anonymity, and Communication in Graphonymous Online Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While most digital communication platforms rely on text, relatively little research has examined how users engage through handwriting and drawing in anonymous, collaborative environments. We introduce Graphonymous Interaction, a form of communication where users interact anonymously via handwriting and drawing. Our study analyzed over 600 canvas pages from the Graphonymous Online Space (GOS) CollaNote and conducted interviews with 20 users. Additionally, we examined 70 minutes of real-time GOS sessions using Conversation Analysis and Multimodal Discourse Analysis. Findings reveal that Graphonymous Interaction fosters artistic expression, intellectual engagement, sharing and supporting, and social connection. Notably, anonymity coexisted with moments of recognition through graphological identification. Distinct conversational strategies also emerged, which allow smoother exchanges and fewer conversational repairs compared to text-based communication. This study contributes to understanding Graphonymous Interaction and Online Spaces, offering insights into designing platforms that support creative and socially engaging forms of communication beyond text.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Companion: Lived Experiences of People with Mental Health Disorders Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for mental health support, yet little is known about how people with mental health challenges engage with them, how they evaluate their usefulness, and what design opportunities they envision. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with people in the UK who live with mental health conditions and have used LLMs for mental health support. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we found that participants engaged with LLMs in conditional and situational ways: for immediacy, the desire for non-judgement, self-paced disclosure, cognitive reframing, and relational engagement. Simultaneously, participants articulated clear boundaries informed by prior therapeutic experience: LLMs were effective for mild-to-moderate distress but inadequate for crises, trauma, and complex social-emotional situations. We contribute empirical insights into the lived use of LLMs for mental health, highlight boundary-setting as central to their safe role, and propose design and governance directions for embedding them responsibly within care ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Revising Bloom's Taxonomy for Dual-Mode Cognition in Human-AI Systems: The Augmented Cognition Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) models become routinely integrated into knowledge work, cognitive acts increasingly occur in two distinct modes: individually, using biological resources alone, or distributed across a human-AI system. Existing revisions to Bloom's Taxonomy treat AI as an external capability to be mapped against human cognition rather than as a driver of this dual-mode structure, and thus fail to specify distinct learning outcomes and assessment targets for each mode. This paper proposes the Augmented Cognition Framework (ACF), a restructured taxonomy built on three principles. First, each traditional Bloom level operates in two modes (Individual and Distributed) with mode-specific cognitive verbs. Second, an asymmetric dependency relationship holds wherein effective Distributed cognition typically requires Individual cognitive foundations, though structured scaffolding can in some cases reverse this sequence. Third, a seventh level, Orchestration, specifies a governance capacity for managing mode-switching, trust calibration, and partnership optimization. We systematically compare existing AI-revised taxonomies against explicit assessment-utility criteria and show, across the frameworks reviewed, that ACF uniquely generates assessable learning outcomes for individual cognition, distributed cognition, and mode-governance as distinct targets. The framework addresses fluent incompetence, the central pedagogical risk of the AI era, by making the dependency relationship structurally explicit while accommodating legitimate scaffolding approaches.</description>

      <title>A Baseline Multimodal Approach to Emotion Recognition in Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lightweight multimodal baseline for emotion recognition in conversations using the SemEval-2024 Task 3 dataset built from the sitcom Friends. The goal of this report is not to propose a novel state-of-the-art method, but to document an accessible reference implementation that combines (i) a transformer-based text classifier and (ii) a self-supervised speech representation model, with a simple late-fusion ensemble. We report the baseline setup and empirical results obtained under a limited training protocol, highlighting when multimodal fusion improves over unimodal models. This preprint is provided for transparency and to support future, more rigorous comparisons.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Students Who Think Aloud: Overly Coherent, Verbose, and Confident</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in AI-based tutoring systems. Can they faithfully model novice reasoning and metacognitive judgments? Existing evaluations emphasize problem-solving accuracy, overlooking the fragmented and imperfect reasoning that characterizes human learning. We evaluate LLMs as novices using 630 think-aloud utterances from multi-step chemistry tutoring problems with problem-solving logs of student hint use, attempts, and problem context. We compare LLM-generated reasoning to human learner utterances under minimal and extended contextual prompting, and assess the models' ability to predict step-level learner success. Although GPT-4.1 generates fluent and contextually appropriate continuations, its reasoning is systematically over-coherent, verbose, and less variable than human think-alouds. These effects intensify with a richer problem-solving context during prompting. Learner performance was consistently overestimated. These findings highlight epistemic limitations of simulating learning with LLMs. We attribute these limitations to LLM training data, including expert-like solutions devoid of expressions of affect and working memory constraints during problem solving. Our evaluation framework can guide future design of adaptive systems that more faithfully support novice learning and self-regulation using generative artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Bowling with ChatGPT: On the Evolving User Interactions with Conversational AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have discussed how users are increasingly using conversational AI systems, powered by LLMs, for information seeking, decision support, and even emotional support. However, these macro-level observations offer limited insight into how the purpose of these interactions shifts over time, how users frame their interactions with the system, and how steering dynamics unfold in these human-AI interactions. To examine these evolving dynamics, we gathered and analyzed a unique dataset InVivoGPT: consisting of 825K ChatGPT interactions, donated by 300 users through their GDPR data rights. Our analyses reveal three key findings. First, participants increasingly turn to ChatGPT for a broader range of purposes, including substantial growth in sensitive domains such as health and mental health. Second, interactions become more socially framed: the system anthropomorphizes itself at rising rates, participants more frequently treat it as a companion, and personal data disclosure becomes both more common and more diverse. Third, conversational steering becomes more prominent, especially after the release of GPT-4o, with conversations where the participants followed a model-initiated suggestion quadrupling over the period of our dataset. Overall, our results show that conversational AI systems are shifting from functional tools to social partners, raising important questions about their design and governance.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Self-Portrait: Deconstructing Memory in ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enable personalized and context-aware interactions, conversational AI systems have introduced a new mechanism: Memory. Memory creates what we refer to as the Algorithmic Self-portrait - a new form of personalization derived from users' self-disclosed information divulged within private conversations. While memory enables more coherent exchanges, the underlying processes of memory creation remain opaque, raising critical questions about data sensitivity, user agency, and the fidelity of the resulting portrait.
  To bridge this research gap, we analyze 2,050 memory entries from 80 real-world ChatGPT users. Our analyses reveal three key findings: (1) A striking 96% of memories in our dataset are created unilaterally by the conversational system, potentially shifting agency away from the user; (2) Memories, in our dataset, contain a rich mix of GDPR-defined personal data (in 28% memories) along with psychological insights about participants (in 52% memories); and (3)~A significant majority of the memories (84%) are directly grounded in user context, indicating faithful representation of the conversations. Finally, we introduce a framework-Attribution Shield-that anticipates these inferences, alerts about potentially sensitive memory inferences, and suggests query reformulations to protect personal information without sacrificing utility.</description>

      <title>How Notations Evolve: A Historical Analysis with Implications for Supporting User-Defined Abstractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional human-computer interaction takes place through formally-specified systems like structured UIs and programming languages. Recent AI systems promise a new set of informal interactions with computers through natural language and other notational forms. These informal interactions can then lead to formal representations, but depend upon pre-existing formalisms known to both humans and AI. What about novel formalisms and notations? How are new abstractions created, evolved, and incrementally formalized over time -- and how might new systems, in turn, be explicitly designed to support these processes? We conduct a comparative historical analysis of notation development to identify some relevant characteristics. These include three social stages of notation development: invention &amp; incubation, dispersion &amp; divergence, and institutionalization &amp; sanctification, as well as three functional stages: descriptive, generative, and evaluative. Within and across these stages, we detail several patterns, such as the role of linking and grounding metaphors, dimensions of meaningful variation, and analogical alignment. Finally, we offer some implications for design.</description>

      <title>Are Security Cues Static? Rethinking Warning and Trust Indicators for Life Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security cues, such as warnings and trust signals, are designed as stable interface elements, even though people's lives, contexts, and vulnerabilities change over time. Life transitions including migration, aging, or shifts in institutional environments reshape how risk and trust are understood and acted upon. Yet current systems rarely adapt their security cues to these changing conditions, placing the burden of interpretation on users. In this Works-in-Progress paper, we argue that the static nature of security cues represents a design mismatch with transitional human lives. We draw on prior empirical insights from work on educational migration as a motivating case, and extend the discussion to other life transitions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Transition-Aware Security Cues (TASeC) framework and present speculative design concepts illustrating how security cues might evolve across transition stages. We invite HCI to rethink security cues as longitudinal, life-centered design elements collectively.</description>

      <title>Expected Harm: Rethinking Safety Evaluation of (Mis)Aligned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current evaluations of LLM safety predominantly rely on severity-based taxonomies to assess the harmfulness of malicious queries. We argue that this formulation requires re-examination as it assumes uniform risk across all malicious queries, neglecting Execution Likelihood--the conditional probability of a threat being realized given the model's response. In this work, we introduce Expected Harm, a metric that weights the severity of a jailbreak by its execution likelihood, modeled as a function of execution cost. Through empirical analysis of state-of-the-art models, we reveal a systematic Inverse Risk Calibration: models disproportionately exhibit stronger refusal behaviors for low-likelihood (high-cost) threats while remaining vulnerable to high-likelihood (low-cost) queries. We demonstrate that this miscalibration creates a structural vulnerability: by exploiting this property, we increase the attack success rate of existing jailbreaks by up to $2\times$. Finally, we trace the root cause of this failure using linear probing, which reveals that while models encode severity in their latent space to drive refusal decisions, they possess no distinguishable internal representation of execution cost, making them "blind" to this critical dimension of risk.</description>

      <title>Mitigating loss of control in advanced AI systems through instrumental goal trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers at artificial intelligence labs and universities are concerned that highly capable artificial intelligence (AI) systems may erode human control by pursuing instrumental goals. Existing mitigations remain largely technical and system-centric: tracking capability in advanced systems, shaping behaviour through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, and designing systems to be corrigible and interruptible. Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds. In this way, IGTs offer concrete avenues for defining capability levels and for broadening how corrigibility and interruptibility are implemented, shifting attention from model properties alone to the organisational systems that enable them.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the monitoring and study of natural hazards have gained significant attention, particularly due to climate change, which exacerbates incidents like floods, droughts, storm surges, and landslides. Together with the constant risk of earthquakes, these climate-induced events highlight the critical necessity for enhanced risk assessment and mitigation strategies in susceptible areas such as Italy.
  In this work, we present a Science Gateway framework for the development of portable and fully automated post-event analysis pipelines integrating Photogrammetry techniques, Data Visualization and Artificial Intelligence technologies, applied on aerial images, to assess extreme natural events and evaluate their impact on risk-exposed assets.</description>

      <title>Risk, Data, Alignment: Making Credit Scoring Work in Kenya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit scoring is an increasingly central and contested domain of data and AI governance, frequently framed as a neutral and objective method of assessing risk across diverse economic and political contexts. Based on a nine-month ethnography of credit scoring practices in Nairobi, Kenya, we examined the sociotechnical and institutional work of data science in digital lending. While established regional telcos and banks are leveraging proprietary data to develop digital loan products, algorithmic credit scoring is being transformed by new actors, techniques, and shifting regulations. Our findings show how practitioners construct alternative data using technical and legal workarounds, formulate risk through multiple interpretations, and negotiate model performance via technical and political means. We argue that algorithmic credit scoring is accomplished through the ongoing work of alignment that stabilizes risk under conditions of persistent uncertainty, taking epistemic, modeling, and contextual forms. Extending work on alignment in HCI, we show how it operates as a two-way translation, where models are made "safe for worlds" while those worlds are reshaped to be "safe for models."</description>

      <title>When Feasibility of Fairness Audits Relies on Willingness to Share Data: Examining User Acceptance of Multi-Party Computation Protocols for Fairness Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness monitoring is critical for detecting algorithmic bias, as mandated by the EU AI Act. Since such monitoring requires sensitive user data (e.g., ethnicity), the AI Act permits its processing only with strict privacy measures, such as multi-party computation (MPC), in compliance with the GDPR. However, the effectiveness of such secure monitoring protocols ultimately depends on people's willingness to share their data. Little is known about how different MPC protocol designs shape user acceptance. To address this, we conducted an online survey with 833 participants in Europe, examining user acceptance of various MPC protocol designs for fairness monitoring. Findings suggest that users prioritized risk-related attributes (e.g., privacy protection mechanism) in direct evaluation but benefit-related attributes (e.g., fairness objective) in simulated choices, with acceptance shaped by their fairness and privacy orientations. We derive implications for deploying and communicating privacy-preserving protocols in ways that foster informed consent and align with user expectations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Integration of Nonlinear Incomplete Clinical Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal clinical data are characterized by high dimensionality, heterogeneous representations, and structured missingness, posing significant challenges for predictive modeling, data integration, and interpretability. We propose BIONIC (Bayesian Integration of Nonlinear Incomplete Clinical data), a unified probabilistic framework that integrates heterogeneous multimodal data under missingness through a joint generative-discriminative latent architecture. BIONIC uses pretrained embeddings for complex modalities such as medical images and clinical text, while incorporating structured clinical variables directly within a Bayesian multimodal formulation. The proposed framework enables robust learning in partially observed and semi-supervised settings by explicitly modeling modality-level and variable-level missingness, as well as missing labels. We evaluate BIONIC on three multimodal clinical and biomedical datasets, demonstrating strong and consistent discriminative performance compared to representative multimodal baselines, particularly under incomplete data scenarios. Beyond predictive accuracy, BIONIC provides intrinsic interpretability through its latent structure, enabling population-level analysis of modality relevance and supporting clinically meaningful insight.</description>

      <title>Provenance Verification of AI-Generated Images via a Perceptual Hash Registry Anchored on Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has made the generation of synthetic images widely accessible, increasing concerns related to misinformation, digital forgery, and content authenticity on large-scale online platforms. This paper proposes a blockchain-backed framework for verifying AI-generated images through a registry-based provenance mechanism. Each AI-generated image is assigned a digital fingerprint that preserves similarity using perceptual hashing and is registered at creation time by participating generation platforms. The hashes are stored on a hybrid on-chain/off-chain public blockchain using a Merkle Patricia Trie for tamper-resistant storage (on-chain) and a Burkhard-Keller tree (off-chain) to enable efficient similarity search over large image registries. Verification is performed when images are re-uploaded to digital platforms such as social media services, enabling identification of previously registered AI-generated images even after benign transformations or partial modifications. The proposed system does not aim to universally detect all synthetic images, but instead focuses on verifying the provenance of AI-generated content that has been registered at creation time. By design, this approach complements existing watermarking and learning-based detection methods, providing a platform-agnostic, tamper-proof mechanism for scalable content provenance and authenticity verification at the point of large-scale online distribution.</description>

Abstract: Nowadays, environmental protection has become a global consensus. At the same time, with the rapid development of science and technology, urbanisation has become a phenomenon that has become the norm. Therefore, the urban greening management system is an essential component in protecting the urban environment. The system utilises a transparent management process known as" monitoring - early warning - response - optimisation," which enhances the tracking of greening resources, streamlines maintenance scheduling, and encourages employee involvement in planning. Designed with a microservice architecture, the system can improve the utilisation of greening resources by 30%, increase citizen satisfaction by 20%, and support carbon neutrality objectives, ultimately making urban governance more intelligent and focused on the community. The Happy City Greening Management System effectively manages gardeners, trees, flowers, and green spaces. It comprises modules for gardener management, purchase and supplier management, tree and flower management, and maintenance planning. Its automation feature allows for real-time updates of greening data, thereby enhancing decision-making. The system is built using Java for the backend and MySQL for data storage, complemented by a user-friendly frontend designed with the Vue framework. Additionally, it leverages features from the Spring Boot framework to enhance maintainability and scalability.</description>

      <title>Future of Work with AI Agents: Auditing Automation and Augmentation Potential across the U.S. Workforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency, and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light" Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&amp;D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone. This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development. Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing workers for evolving workplace dynamics.</description>

      <title>Incorporating AI incident reporting into telecommunications law and policy: Insights from India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into telecommunications infrastructure introduces novel risks, such as algorithmic bias and unpredictable system behavior, that fall outside the scope of traditional cybersecurity and data protection frameworks. This paper introduces a precise definition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents, establishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond conventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their recognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for jurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's key digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal instruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data breaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational incidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also examines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI incident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted policy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into India's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting for high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal agency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting frameworks. These recommendations aim to enhance regulatory clarity and strengthen long-term resilience, offering a pragmatic and replicable blueprint for other nations seeking to govern AI risks within their existing sectoral frameworks.</description>

      <title>How Similar Are Grokipedia and Wikipedia? A Multi-Dimensional Textual and Structural Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26899v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The launch of Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk's xAI, was presented as a response to perceived ideological and structural biases in Wikipedia, aiming to produce "truthful" entries using the Grok large language model. Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases and limitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study conducts a large-scale computational comparison of 17,790 matched article pairs from the 20,000 most-edited English Wikipedia pages. Using metrics spanning lexical richness, readability, reference density, structural features, and semantic similarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and substance. We find that Grokipedia articles are substantially longer and contain significantly fewer references per word. Moreover, Grokipedia's content divides into two distinct groups: one that remains semantically and stylistically aligned with Wikipedia, and another that diverges sharply. Among the dissimilar articles, we observe a systematic rightward shift in the political bias of cited sources, concentrated primarily in entries related to politics, history, and religion. More broadly, the findings indicate that AI-generated encyclopedic content departs from established editorial norms, favoring narrative expansion over citation-based verification, raising questions about transparency, provenance, and the governance of knowledge in automated information systems.</description>

      <title>AI Failure Loops in Devalued Work: The Confluence of Overconfidence in AI and Underconfidence in Worker Expertise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing body of literature has focused on understanding and addressing workplace AI design failures. However, past work has largely overlooked the role of the devaluation of worker expertise in shaping the dynamics of AI development and deployment. In this paper, we examine the case of feminized labor: a class of devalued occupations historically misnomered as ``women's work,'' such as social work, K-12 teaching, and home healthcare. Drawing on literature on AI deployments in feminized labor contexts, we conceptualize AI Failure Loops: a set of interwoven, socio-technical failure modes that help explain how the systemic devaluation of workers' expertise negatively impacts, and is impacted by, AI design, evaluation, and governance practices. These failures demonstrate how misjudgments on the automatability of workers' skills can lead to AI deployments that fail to bring value to workers and, instead, further diminish the visibility of workers' expertise. We discuss research and design implications for workplace AI, especially for devalued occupations.</description>

      <title>Measuring Agents in Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based agents already operate in production across many industries, yet we lack an understanding of what technical methods make deployments successful. We present the first systematic study of Measuring Agents in Production, MAP, using first-hand data from agent developers. We conducted 20 case studies via in-depth interviews and surveyed 306 practitioners across 26 domains. We investigate why organizations build agents, how they build them, how they evaluate them, and their top development challenges. Our study finds that production agents are built using simple, controllable approaches: 68% execute at most 10 steps before human intervention, 70% rely on prompting off-the-shelf models instead of weight tuning, and 74% depend primarily on human evaluation. Reliability (consistent correct behavior over time) remains the top development challenge, which practitioners currently address through systems-level design. MAP documents the current state of production agents, providing the research community with visibility into deployment realities and under-explored research avenues.</description>

      <title>Position: Universal Aesthetic Alignment Narrows Artistic Expression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over-aligning image generation models to a generalized aesthetic preference conflicts with user intent, particularly when "anti-aesthetic" outputs are requested for artistic or critical purposes. This adherence prioritizes developer-centered values, compromising user autonomy and aesthetic pluralism. We test this bias by constructing a wide-spectrum aesthetics dataset and evaluating state-of-the-art generation and reward models. This position paper finds that aesthetic-aligned generation models frequently default to conventionally beautiful outputs, failing to respect instructions for low-quality or negative imagery. Crucially, reward models penalize anti-aesthetic images even when they perfectly match the explicit user prompt. We confirm this systemic bias through image-to-image editing and evaluation against real abstract artworks.</description>

      <title>The Language You Ask In: Language-Conditioned Ideological Divergence in LLM Analysis of Contested Political Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as analytical tools across multilingual contexts, yet their outputs may carry systematic biases conditioned by the language of the prompt. This study presents an experimental comparison of LLM-generated political analyses of a Ukrainian civil society document, using semantically equivalent prompts in Russian and Ukrainian. Despite identical source material and parallel query structures, the resulting analyses varied substantially in rhetorical positioning, ideological orientation, and interpretive conclusions. The Russian-language output echoed narratives common in Russian state discourse, characterizing civil society actors as illegitimate elites undermining democratic mandates. The Ukrainian-language output adopted vocabulary characteristic of Western liberal-democratic political science, treating the same actors as legitimate stakeholders within democratic contestation. These findings demonstrate that prompt language alone can produce systematically different ideological orientations from identical models analyzing identical content, with significant implications for AI deployment in polarized information environments, cross-lingual research applications, and the governance of AI systems in multilingual societies.</description>

      <title>AI-generated data contamination erodes pathological variability and diagnostic reliability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly populating medical records with synthetic content, creating a feedback loop where future models are increasingly at risk of training on uncurated AI-generated data. However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI assistance produces significant productivity gains across professional domains, particularly for novice workers. Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.</description>

Abstract: As Large Language Models become ubiquitous sources of health information, understanding their capacity to accurately represent stigmatized conditions is crucial for responsible deployment. This study examines whether leading AI systems perpetuate or challenge misconceptions about Autism Spectrum Disorder, a condition particularly vulnerable to harmful myths. We administered a 30-item instrument measuring autism knowledge to 178 participants and three state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini. Contrary to expectations that AI systems would leverage their vast training data to outperform humans, we found the opposite pattern: human participants endorsed significantly fewer myths than LLMs (36.2% vs. 44.8% error rate; z = -2.59, p = .0048). In 18 of the 30 evaluated items, humans significantly outperformed AI systems. These findings reveal a critical blind spot in current AI systems and have important implications for human-AI interaction design, the epistemology of machine knowledge, and the need to center neurodivergent perspectives in AI development.</description>

Abstract: Trajectory computing is a pivotal domain encompassing trajectory data management and mining, garnering widespread attention due to its crucial role in various practical applications such as location services, urban traffic, and public safety. Traditional methods, focusing on simplistic spatio-temporal features, face challenges of complex calculations, limited scalability, and inadequate adaptability to real-world complexities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the development and recent advances in trajectory computing, from deep learning to the more recent large language models. We first define trajectory data and provide a brief overview of widely-used deep learning models. Systematically, we explore deep learning applications in trajectory management (pre-processing, storage, analysis, and visualization) and mining (trajectory-related forecasting, trajectory-related recommendation, trajectory classification, travel time estimation, anomaly detection, and mobility generation). Furthermore, we discuss emerging research directions and recent advancements in large models (represented by foundation models and large language models) for trajectory computing, which promise to reshape the next generation of trajectory computing. Additionally, we summarize application scenarios, public datasets, and toolkits. Finally, we outline current challenges in trajectory computing research and propose future directions. Relevant papers and open-source resources have been collated and are continuously updated at: https://github.com/yoshall/Awesome-Trajectory-Computing.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Assessing Wiktionary's Crowd-Sourced Linguistic Knowledge on Morphological Gaps in Two Related Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Morphological defectivity is an intriguing and understudied phenomenon in linguistics. Addressing defectivity, where expected inflectional forms are absent, is essential for improving the accuracy of NLP tools in morphologically rich languages. However, traditional linguistic resources often lack coverage of morphological gaps as such knowledge requires significant human expertise and effort to document and verify. For scarce linguistic phenomena in under-explored languages, Wikipedia and Wiktionary often serve as among the few accessible resources. Despite their extensive reach, their reliability has been a subject of controversy. This study customizes a novel neural morphological analyzer to annotate Latin and Italian corpora. Using the massive annotated data, crowd-sourced lists of defective verbs compiled from Wiktionary are validated computationally. Our results indicate that while Wiktionary provides a highly reliable account of Italian morphological gaps, 7% of Latin lemmata listed as defective show strong corpus evidence of being non-defective. This discrepancy highlights potential limitations of crowd-sourced wikis as definitive sources of linguistic knowledge, particularly for less-studied phenomena and languages, despite their value as resources for rare linguistic features. By providing scalable tools and methods for quality assurance of crowd-sourced data, this work advances computational morphology and expands linguistic knowledge of defectivity in non-English, morphologically rich languages.</description>

      <title>Digital Simulations to Enhance Military Medical Evacuation Decision-Making</title>

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and operations across the joint force.</description>

Abstract: This study explores how different modes of digital interaction -- namely, computers versus smartphones -- affect attention, frustration, and creative performance in adolescents. Using a combination of digital task logs, webcam-based gaze estimation, and expert evaluation of task outcomes, we analyzed data from a diverse sample of 824 students aged 11-17. Participants were assigned to device groups in a randomized and stratified design to control for age, gender, and prior experience. Results suggest moderate but statistically significant differences in sustained attention, perceived frustration, and creative output. These findings indicate that the nature of digital interaction -- beyond mere screen time -- may influence cognitive and behavioral outcomes relevant to educational design. Practical implications for user interface development and learning environments are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bilevel subsidy-enabled mobility hub network design with perturbed utility coalitional choice-based assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban mobility is undergoing rapid transformation with the emergence of new services. Mobility hubs (MHs) have been proposed as physical-digital convergence points, offering a range of public and private mobility options in close proximity. By supporting Mobility-as-a-Service, these hubs can serve as focal points where travel decisions intersect with operator strategies. We develop a bilevel MH platform design model that treats MHs as control levers. The upper level (platform) maximizes revenue or flow by setting subsidies to incentivize last-mile operators; the lower level captures joint traveler-operator decisions with a link-based Perturbed Utility Route Choice (PURC) assignment, yielding a strictly convex quadratic program. We reformulate the bilevel problem to a single-level program via the KKT conditions of the lower level and solve it with a gap-penalty method and an iterative warm-start scheme that exploits the computationally cheap lower-level problem. Numerical experiments on a toy network and a Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) case (244 nodes, 469 links, 78 ODs) show that the method attains sub-1% optimality gaps in minutes. In the base LIRR case, the model allows policymakers to quantify the social surplus value of a MH, or the value of enabling subsidy or regulating the microtransit operator's pricing. Comparing link-based subsidies to hub-based subsidies, the latter is computationally more expensive but offers an easier mechanism for comparison and control.</description>

      <title>Mental Health Impacts of AI Companions: Triangulating Social Media Quasi-Experiments, User Perspectives, and Relational Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-powered companion chatbots (AICCs) such as Replika are increasingly popular, offering empathetic interactions, yet their psychosocial impacts remain unclear. We examined how engaging with AICCs shaped wellbeing and how users perceived these experiences. First, we conducted a large-scale quasi-experimental study of longitudinal Reddit data, applying stratified propensity score matching and Difference-in-Differences regression. Findings revealed mixed effects -- greater grief expression and interpersonal focus, alongside increases in language about loneliness, depression, and suicidal ideation. Second, we complemented these results with 18 semi-structured interviews, which we thematically analyzed and contextualized using Knapp's relationship development model. We identified trajectories of initiation, escalation, and bonding, wherein AICCs provided emotional validation and social rehearsal but also carried risks of over-reliance and withdrawal. Triangulating across methods, we offer design implications for AI companions that scaffold healthy boundaries, support mindful engagement, support disclosure without dependency, and surface relationship stages -- maximizing psychosocial benefits while mitigating risks.</description>

      <title>From Birdwatch to Community Notes, from Twitter to X: four years of community-based content moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community Notes (formerly known as Birdwatch) is the first large-scale crowdsourced content moderation initiative that was launched by X (formerly known as Twitter) in January 2021. As the Community Notes model gains momentum across other social media platforms, there is a growing need to assess its underlying dynamics and effectiveness. This resource paper provides (a) a systematic review of the literature on Community Notes, and (b) a major curated dataset and accompanying source code to support future research on Community Notes. We parsed Notes and Ratings data from the first four years of the program and conducted language detection across all Notes. Focusing on English-language Notes, we extracted embedded URLs and identified discussion topics in each Note. Additionally, we constructed monthly interaction networks among the Contributors. Together with the literature review, these resources offer a robust foundation for advancing research on the Community Notes system.</description>

      <title>Surfacing Subtle Stereotypes: A Multilingual, Debate-Oriented Evaluation of Modern LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed for open-ended communication, yet most bias evaluations still rely on English, classification-style tasks. We introduce DebateBias-8K, a new multilingual, debate-style benchmark designed to reveal how narrative bias appears in realistic generative settings. Our dataset includes 8,400 structured debate prompts spanning four sensitive domains: women's rights, socioeconomic development, terrorism, and religion, across seven languages ranging from high-resource (English, Chinese) to low-resource (Swahili, Nigerian Pidgin). Using four flagship models (GPT-4o, Claude 3, DeepSeek, and LLaMA 3), we generate and automatically classify over 100,000 responses. Results show that all models reproduce entrenched stereotypes despite safety alignment: Arabs are overwhelmingly linked to terrorism and religion (&gt;=95%), Africans to socioeconomic "backwardness" (up to &lt;=77%), and Western groups are consistently framed as modern or progressive. Biases grow sharply in lower-resource languages, revealing that alignment trained primarily in English does not generalize globally. Our findings highlight a persistent divide in multilingual fairness: current alignment methods reduce explicit toxicity but fail to prevent biased outputs in open-ended contexts. We release our DebateBias-8K benchmark and analysis framework to support the next generation of multilingual bias evaluation and safer, culturally inclusive model alignment.</description>

      <title>Stable Signer: Hierarchical Sign Language Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the process of converting the complex input text into a real video. Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages. However, this field has made slow progress due to the inaccuracy of text conversion, pose generation, and the rendering of poses into real human videos in these stages, resulting in gradually accumulating errors. Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos. SLUL is trained using the newly developed Semantic-Aware Gloss Masking Loss (SAGM Loss). Its performance has improved by 48.6% compared to the current SOTA generation methods.</description>

      <title>Breaking Up with Normatively Monolithic Agency with GRACE: A Reason-Based Neuro-Symbolic Architecture for Safe and Ethical AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, widely deployed in consequential contexts, and efficacious in bringing about real-world impacts, ensuring that their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned has become critical. We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.</description>

      <title>Aesthetics as Structural Harm: Algorithmic Lookism Across Text-to-Image Generation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines algorithmic lookism-the systematic preferential treatment based on physical appearance-in text-to-image (T2I) generative AI and a downstream gender classification task. Through the analysis of 26,400 synthetic faces created with Stable Diffusion 2.1 and 3.5 Medium, we demonstrate how generative AI models systematically associate facial attractiveness with positive attributes and vice-versa, mirroring socially constructed biases rather than evidence-based correlations. Furthermore, we find significant gender bias in three gender classification algorithms depending on the attributes of the input faces. Our findings reveal three critical harms: (1) the systematic encoding of attractiveness-positive attribute associations in T2I models; (2) gender disparities in classification systems, where women's faces, particularly those generated with negative attributes, suffer substantially higher misclassification rates than men's; and (3) intensifying aesthetic constraints in newer models through age homogenization, gendered exposure patterns, and geographic reductionism. These convergent patterns reveal algorithmic lookism as systematic infrastructure operating across AI vision systems, compounding existing inequalities through both representation and recognition.
  Disclaimer: This work includes visual and textual content that reflects stereotypical associations between physical appearance and socially constructed attributes, including gender, race, and traits associated with social desirability. Any such associations found in this study emerge from the biases embedded in generative AI systems-not from empirical truths or the authors' views.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biometric payment, i.e., biometric authentication implemented in digital payment systems, can reduce memory demands and streamline payment for older adults. However, older adults' perceptions and practices regarding biometric payment remain underexplored. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 Chinese older adults, including both users and non-users. Participants were motivated to use biometric payment due to convenience and perceived security. However, they also worried about loss of control due to its password-free nature and expressed concerns about biometric data security. Participants also identified desired features for biometric payment, such as lightweight and context-aware cognitive confirmation mechanisms to enhance user control. Based on these findings, we outline recommendations for more controllable and informative digital financial services that better support older adults.</description>

      <title>Experiencer, Helper, or Observer: Online Fraud Intervention for Older Adults Through Role-based Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online fraud is a critical global threat that disproportionately targets older adults. Prior anti-fraud education for older adults has largely relied on static, traditional instruction that limits engagement and real-world transfer, whereas role-based simulation offers realistic yet low-risk opportunities for practice. Moreover, most interventions situate learners as victims, overlooking that fraud encounters often involve multiple roles, such as bystanders who witness scams and helpers who support victims. To address this gap, we developed ROLESafe, an anti-fraud educational intervention in which older adults learn through different learning roles, including Experiencer (experiencing fraud), Helper (assisting a victim), and Observer (witnessing fraud). In a between-subjects study with 144 older adults in China, we found that the Experiencer and Helper roles significantly improved participants' ability to identify online fraud. These findings highlight the promise of role-based, multi-perspective simulations for enhancing fraud awareness among older adults and provide design implications for future anti-fraud education.</description>

      <title>TraceRouter: Robust Safety for Large Foundation Models via Path-Level Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.</description>

      <title>Under-Canopy Terrain Reconstruction in Dense Forests Using RGB Imaging and Neural 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mapping the terrain and understory hidden beneath dense forest canopies is of great interest for numerous applications such as search and rescue, trail mapping, forest inventory tasks, and more. Existing solutions rely on specialized sensors: either heavy, costly airborne LiDAR, or Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), which uses thermal synthetic aperture photography and is tailored for person detection.
  We introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of canopy-free, photorealistic ground views using only conventional RGB images. Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.
  To validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images). Additionally, we show the potential of our approach for forest inventory tasks like tree counting. These results position our approach as a cost-effective, high-resolution alternative to specialized sensors for SAR, trail mapping, and forest-inventory tasks.</description>
