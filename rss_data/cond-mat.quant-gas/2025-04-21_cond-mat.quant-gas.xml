      <title>Rabi Oscillations of Strongly Driven Bose Polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical behavior of quasiparticles is essential for uncovering novel quantum many-body phenomena. Among these phenomena, the polaron in ultracold atomic gases has attracted considerable interest due to its precise controllability. By engineering the underlying Hamiltonian, polarons serve as a versatile platform for studying both equilibrium properties and non-equilibrium dynamics. In this work, we investigate the quantum dynamics of strongly driven Bose polarons, where minority atoms are described as mobile impurities with spin-1/2, and majority atoms are bosons. The spin-$\uparrow$ impurity interacts with majority atoms through a tunable scattering length $a$, while the spin-$\downarrow$ impurity remains non-interacting. After turning on the Rabi coupling, we calculate the evolution of the total magnetization using a trial wavefunction. We identify the exhibition of anomalous Rabi oscillation and steady-state magnetization for $a&gt;0$, due to the interplay between attractive and repulsive polarons. Our results provide a concrete example that illustrates how Rabi oscillations are dressed by system-environment coupling.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory for 2D abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional abelian anyons are, in the magnetic gauge picture, represented as fermions coupled to magnetic flux tubes. For the ground state of such a system in a trapping potential, we theoretically and numerically investigate a Hartree approximate model, obtained by restricting trial states to Slater determinants and introducing a self-consistent magnetic field, locally proportional to matter density. This leads to a fermionic variant of the Chern-Simons-Schr{\"o}dinger system. We find that for dense systems, a semi-classical approximation yields qualitatively good results. Namely, we derive a density functional theory of magnetic Thomas-Fermi type, which correctly captures the trends of our numerical results. In particular, we explore the subtle dependence of the ground state with respect to the fraction of magnetic flux units attached to particles.</description>

      <title>Metrology of open quantum systems from emitted radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the task of learning about the dynamics of a Markovian open quantum system by monitoring the information it radiates into its environment. For an open system with Hilbert space dimension $D$, the quantum state of the emitted radiation can be described as a temporally ordered matrix-product state (MPS). We provide simple analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the radiation state, which asymptotically scales linearly with the sensing time unless the open system has multiple steady states. We characterize the crossovers in QFI near dynamical phase transitions, emphasizing the role of temporal correlations in setting the asymptotic rate at which QFI increases. We discuss when optimal sensing is possible with instantaneously measured radiation.</description>

      <title>Magnetization induced skyrmion dynamics of a spin-orbit-coupled spinor condensate under sinusoidally varying magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the spin texture dynamics of a harmonically trapped spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and ferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions under a sinusoidally varying magnetic field along the $x$-direction. This interplay yields an intrinsic spin texture in the ground state, forming a linear chain of alternating skyrmions at the saddle points. Our study analyzes the spin-mixing dynamics for both a freely evolving and a controlled longitudinal magnetization. The spin-1 system exhibits the Einstein-de Hass effect for the first case, for which an exchange between the total orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum is observed, resulting in minimal oscillations about the initial position of the skyrmion chain. However, for the fixed magnetization dynamics, the skyrmion chain exhibits ample angular oscillations about the equilibrium position, with the temporary formation of new skyrmions and anti-skyrmions to facilitate the oscillatory motion. Keeping the magnetization constant, this contrast now stems from the exchange between the canonical and spin-dependent contribution to the orbital angular momentum. The variation in canonical angular momentum is linked to the angular oscillations, while the spin-dependent angular momentum accounts for the creation or annihilation of skyrmions. We confirm the presence of scissor mode excitations in the spin texture due to the angular skyrmion oscillations.</description>

      <title>Derivation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and quantum Boltzmann equations in an interacting Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our previous work [37] presented a rigorous derivation of quantum Boltzmann equations near a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here, we extend it with a complete characterization of the leading order fluctuation dynamics. For this purpose, we correct the latter via an appropriate Bogoliubov rotation, in partial analogy to the approach by Grillakis-Machedon et al. [59], in addition to the Weyl transformation applied in [37]. Based on the analysis of the third order expansion of the BEC wave function, and the second order expansions of the pair-correlations, we show that through a renormalization strategy, various contributions to the effective Hamiltonian can be iteratively eliminated by an appropriate choice of the Weyl and Bogoliubov transformations. This leads to a separation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations and quantum Boltzmann equations. A multitude of terms that were included in the error term in [37] are now identified as contributions to the HFB renormalization terms. Thereby, the error bound in the work at hand is improved significantly. To the given order, it is now sharp, and matches the order or magnitude expected from scaling considerations. Consequently, we extend the time of validity to $t\sim (\log N)^2$ compared to $t\sim (\log N/\log \log N)^2$ before. We expect our approach to be extensible to smaller orders in $\frac1N$.</description>

      <title>Anomalous current fluctuations from Euler hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic origin of anomalous current fluctuations in a family of stochastic charged cellular automata. Using ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study both typical and large fluctuations of the charge current and reproduce microscopic results which are available for the deterministic single-file limit of the models. Our results indicate that in general initial fluctuations propagated by Euler equations fully characterize both scales of anomalous fluctuations. For stochastic dynamics, we find an additional contribution to typical fluctuations and conjecture the functional form of the typical probability distribution, which we confirm by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum adiabatic optimization with Rydberg arrays: localization phenomena and encoding strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic optimization seeks to solve combinatorial problems using quantum dynamics, requiring the Hamiltonian of the system to align with the problem of interest. However, these Hamiltonians are often incompatible with the native constraints of quantum hardware, necessitating encoding strategies to map the original problem into a hardware-conformant form. While the classical overhead associated with such mappings is easily quantifiable and typically polynomial in problem size, it is much harder to quantify their overhead on the quantum algorithm, e.g., the transformation of the adiabatic timescale. In this work, we address this challenge on the concrete example of the encoding scheme proposed in [Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023)], which is designed to map optimization problems on arbitrarily connected graphs into Rydberg atom arrays. We consider the fundamental building blocks underlying this encoding scheme and determine the scaling of the minimum gap with system size along adiabatic protocols. Even when the original problem is trivially solvable, we find that the encoded problem can exhibit an exponentially closing minimum gap. We show that this originates from a quantum coherent effect, which gives rise to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wavefunction. On the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose quantum-aware modifications of the encoding scheme that avoid this quantum bottleneck and lead to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance. This highlights the crucial importance of accounting for quantum effects when designing strategies to encode classical problems onto quantum platforms.</description>
