      <title>Dissecting coupled orders in a terahertz-driven electron-doped cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and charge density wave has often been studied from an equilibrium point of view. For example, using static tuning knobs such as doping, magnetic field and pressure, superconductivity can be enhanced or suppressed. The resulting effect on the co-existing charge density wave order, if any, is judged by variations in its ground state properties such as the ordering temperature or the spatial correlation. Such an approach can be understood as coordinated static displacements of two coupled order parameters within a Ginzburg-Landau description, evincing their interplay as either co-operative or competing but does not provide further microscopic information about the interaction. In order to assess such information, we dynamically perturb both orders from equilibrium and observe their coupling directly in the time-domain. We show that high-field multicycle terahertz pulses drive both the Higgs amplitude fluctuations of the superconducting order as well as collective fluctuations of the charge order in an electron-doped cuprate, resulting in characteristic third harmonic generation. A notable time delay is manifested between their respective driven dynamics. We propose that this may signify the important energy scale describing their coupling or imply a terahertz field-depinned charge density wave that destroys macroscopic superconductivity. Our work demonstrates a holistic approach for investigating coupled superconducting and charge density wave orders, which may shed novel light on their intertwined presence and widespread fluctuations in many classes of unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Impact of spin correlations on resistivity and microwave absorption of Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of studies of BaFe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals doped with cobalt by means of resistivity and microwave absorption measurement are reported. A theoretical description of the behavior of the microwave absorption amplitude is made taking into account the temperature dependence of resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and the lifetime of spin fluctuations. An assumption has been made that the deviation from the linear dependence of resistivity on temperature at $T&lt;100$ K is not related to the electron-electron scattering mechanism, but it is due to the appearance of nematic fluctuations. Estimates of the rate of scattering by spin fluctuations indicate their nematic nature at temperatures near the structural transition.</description>

      <title>Resonant x-ray scattering study of charge-density wave correlations in YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+x}$ under uniaxial stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of the uniaxial stress response of charge-density-wave (CDW) correlations in detwinned single crystals of the high temperature superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ (YBCO$_{6+x}$) with $0.40 \leq x \leq 0.93$ (hole-doping levels $0.072 \leq p \leq 0.168$) by means of Cu $L_3$-edge resonant energy-integrated x-ray scattering (REXS). We show that the influence of uniaxial stress is strongly doping dependent: the quasi-two-dimensional CDW is enhanced by in-plane uniaxial stress in a wide hole doping range ($0.45 \leq x \leq 0.80$), but only barely affected in the most underdoped and optimally doped samples ($x = 0.40$ and 0.93), where the CDW correlation length is minimal. A stress-induced three-dimensionally long-range ordered (3D) CDW was observed only in YBCO$_{6.50}$ and YBCO$_{6.67}$. The temperature dependence of the 3D CDW clearly indicates a strong competition with superconductivity. Based on the systematic strain-, doping-, and temperature-dependent REXS measurements reported here, we discuss the relationship between charge order and superconductivity in YBCO$_{6+x}$ and other cuprates.</description>

      <title>Unconventional and anomalous magnetic field distribution in a bilayer superconductor with geometric constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic field distribution in multi-component superconductors. We examine a layered superconductor and a two-component one-layer superconductor. We evaluate the field distribution in the presence of a half-flux quantum vortex with a kink structure in the phase space of gap functions. We also examine the magnetic field distribution of a knot soliton which is formulated in a two-component superconductor. We investigate the effect of geometric constraints for multi-component superconductors, where the geometric constraint means that the system is compactified in one direction so that the current in this direction becomes vanishingly small. This corresponds to the gauge fixing in this direction. An unconventional magnetic field distribution takes place; here the unconventional means that the magnetic field is screened incompletely which would be called the anomalous Meissner effect. We argue that this anomalous behavior creates a massless gauge field.</description>

      <title>Coincident onset of charge order and pseudogap in a homogeneous high-temperature superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates requires knowledge of the metallic phase it evolves from, particularly the pseudogap profoundly affecting the electronic properties at low carrier densities. A key question is the influence of chemical disorder, which is ubiquitous but exceedingly difficult to model. Using resonant x-ray scattering, we identified two-dimensional charge order in stoichiometric YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ ($T_c$ = 80 K), which is nearly free of chemical disorder. The charge order amplitude shows a concave temperature dependence and vanishes sharply at $T^*$ = 200 K, the onset of a prominent pseudogap previously determined by spectroscopy, suggesting a causal link between these phenomena. The gradual onset of charge order in other cuprates is thus likely attributable to an inhomogeneous distribution of charge ordering temperatures due to disorder induced by chemical substitution. The relationship between the pseudogap and the disorder-induced gradual freeze-out of charge carriers remains a central issue in research on high-$T_c$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>A Strong-Coupling-Limit Study on the Pairing Mechanism in the Pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been reported to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity (SC) near $80$K under a moderate pressure of about $14$GPa. To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance SC within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens SC by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens SC. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional SC of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</description>

      <title>Infinite Stability in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quenched disordered systems, the existence of ordering is generally believed to be only possible in the weak disorder regime (disregarding models of spin-glass type). In particular, sufficiently large random fields is expected to prohibit any finite temperature ordering. Here, we prove that this is not necessarily true, and show rigorously that for physically relevant systems in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\ge 3$, disorder can induce ordering that is \textit{infinitely stable}, in the sense that (1) there exists ordering at arbitrarily large disorder strength and (2) the transition temperature is asymptotically nonzero in the limit of infinite disorder. Analogous results can hold in 2 dimensions provided that the underlying graph is non-planar (e.g., $\mathbb{Z}^2$ sites with nearest and next-nearest neighbor interactions).</description>

      <title>The Frequency Shift and Q of Disordered Superconducting RF Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Niobium superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities for high energy accelerator applications have been greatly improved in terms of the quality factor $Q$ by techniques such as Nitrogen doping. However, the mechanisms leading improvement in $Q$ are still not fully understood. Quite recently the SRF group at Fermilab measured anomalies in the frequency shift of N-doped SRF Niobium cavities near the transition temperature. Here we report our theoretical analysis of these results based on the microscopic theory of superconductivity that incorporates anisotropy of the superconducting gap and inhomogeneous disorder in the screening region of the SRF cavities. We are able to account for frequency shift anomalies very close to $T_c$ of the order of fractions of a kHz. Our results for the frequency shift and Q are in good agreement with the experimental data reported for all four N-doped Nb SRF cavities by Bafia et al. We also compare our theory with an earlier report of on a Nb sample measured at 60 GHz. We also show that the quality factor calculated theoretically has a peak of upper convexity with the largest $Q$ at intermediate levels of disorder. For strong disorder, i.e. the dirty limit, pair breaking in the presence of disorder and screening currents limits the $Q$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced nonlinear Hall effect by Cooper pairs near superconductor criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike the linear Hall effect that requires broken time-reversal symmetry, the nonlinear Hall effect may occur in time-reversal symmetric systems as long as there exists a non-zero Berry curvature dipole in the absence of inversion symmetry. Interestingly, the presence of time-reversal symmetry is consistent with and thus allows a direct transition into a superconducting phase. Indeed, superconductivity has been established in various nonlinear Hall materials, such as WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$, at sufficiently low temperatures. We find that the nonlinear Hall response should be significantly enhanced near the superconducting criticality, dominated by the Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) contributions augmented by superconducting fluctuations, which we attribute to the Berry curvature dipole and a divergent lifetime $\tau\sim (T-T_c)^{-1}$ of the Cooper pairs, instead of the single electrons. Such a controlled enhancement brings the nonlinear Hall effect into various simple experimental observations and practical applicational potentials.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity, Anomalous Hall Effect, and Stripe Order in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconducting phases are distinguished by broken symmetries in their order parameters. Here, we report the discovery of an exotic superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene at high displacement fields, marked by its coexistence with both a stripe charge order and the anomalous Hall effect. In angle-resolved transport measurements, the onset of stripe order is manifested as thermally activated insulating behavior along one axis, with highly conductive transport along the orthogonal direction. Upon cooling, superconductivity emerges exclusively along the high-conductivity axis, forming one-dimensional-like superconducting channels. This anisotropic superconducting phase exhibits multiple first-order hysteretic transitions. Pronounced thermal hysteresis-between warming and cooling across the superconducting transition-suggests a melting transition of the underlying stripe phase. Additionally, magnetic-field-induced switching-similar to phenomena reported in tetra- and pentalayer graphene-supports the chiral nature of the superconducting state. Together, these findings identify a previously unrecognized quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within a stripy Hall crystal.</description>
