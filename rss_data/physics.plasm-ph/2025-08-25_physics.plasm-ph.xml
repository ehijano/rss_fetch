      <title>QED cascade initiation via reflection of a multipetawatt laser pulse from a self-organized parabolic plasma mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-sustained or avalanche-type cascade is an intriguing prediction of strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED) that has yet to be observed in laboratories. It is accompanied by the conversion of electromagnetic energy into gamma photons and electron-positron ($e^-e^+$) pairs, whose number increases exponentially over time. We investigate a simple configuration to initiate a QED cascades: it is based on the superposition of an incident multipetawatt laser pulse and its reflection from a solid target. The incident laser pulse &lt;&lt;deforms&gt;&gt; the initially flat target surface, creating a parabolic mirror that focuses the reflected radiation. For the considered setup the threshold laser power is about $7\,\text{PW}$. With a $27\,\text{PW}$ laser pulse, positron production exhibits clear signatures of an avalanche-type cascade, including exponential growth and more than 15 positron generations with similar energy spectra. Therefore, observing an avalanche-type QED cascade does not require the use of multiple laser channels with precise spatio-temporal synchronization, as previously supposed.</description>

      <title>Resonantly Driven Electron Bernstein Waves in Magnetized Low-Pressure Capacitive Discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) discharges is investigated in a mildly magnetized regime, defined by $1 \le f_{ce}/f_{rf} &lt; 2$, where $f_{ce}$ and $f_{rf}$ denote the electron cyclotron frequency and the applied radio-frequency (RF), respectively. A distinctive feature of this regime is the excitation of electron Bernstein waves (EBWs) that propagate into the bulk plasma. As the applied magnetic field increases, notable changes in the discharge characteristics occur, with EBWs observed to propagate along the plasma density gradient inside the bulk. The underlying physics of CCP operation in this regime is analyzed in detail using particle-in-cell Monte Carlo collisions (PIC-MCC) simulations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimisation of Breit-Wheeler Pair Production in Simulated Laser Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High laser intensities enable the production of electron-positron pairs from bright gamma rays passing through strong fields. Potentially the most promising approach for all-optical experiments in the near term uses dense but higher divergence electron beams from laser wakefield acceleration to produce gamma rays through inverse Compton scattering. Achieving many-photon collisions between these gamma rays and the high intensity laser pulse in practice is extremely difficult, however, due to significant shot-to-shot jitter in laser pointing and timing.
  We model these practical difficulties using simulated Monte-Carlo experiments. By using a more efficient algorithm for sampling infrequent pair production with particle splitting, we enable the exploration of a multi-dimensional parameter space. Using Gaussian Process Regression we then efficiently find optimal conditions for maximising pair production by changing the laser spot size, the energy in the colliding beam, and the stand-off distance between the laser wakefield accelerator and the focus of the colliding laser pulse. We find that the optimal stand-off distance increases with the degree of laser jitter and that the best conditions for producing electron-positron pairs are not the same as the best conditions for maximising the energy in the gamma rays. With \unit[100]{J} of laser energy, we estimate rates of pair production of around 1 pair per 100 electrons are achievable even with jitter of 10s of microns and 10s of femtoseconds.</description>

      <title>On the hypothesis of a bi-isotropic plasma permeating the interstellar space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a magnetized chiral plasma that pervades the interstellar space. The Maxwell equations, supplemented by bi-isotropic constitutive relations, are rewritten to describe a cold, uniform, and collisionless plasma model that yields new collective electromagnetic modes for distinct pairs of refractive indices associated with right- and left-handed circularly polarized waves. We have investigated the optical behavior through the rotatory power (RP) and dichroism coefficient, reporting that the finite chiral parameter induces double RP sign reversal, an exotic optical signature that takes place in chiral dielectrics and rotating plasmas. In the low-frequency regime, a modified propagating helicon with right-handed circular polarization is obtained. Next, supposing that the interstellar medium behaves as a bi-isotropic cold plasma, we employ Astrophysical data of radio pulsars to achieve upper limits on the magnetoelectric parameters magnitude. In particular, by using dispersion measure and rotation measure data from five pulsars, we constrain the magnitude of the chiral parameter to the order of $10^{-16}$ and $10^{-22}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Generating Cylindrical Vector {\gamma} Rays via Beam-Target Interactions: Towards Structured Light at High Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured {\gamma} rays, particularly cylindrical vector {\gamma} rays, offer promising tools for sub-nuclear imaging and polarization-sensitive probes in fundamental research and applications, but conventional optical methods face great challenges at such photon energy. Here, we put forward a novel method generating such {\gamma} rays through relativistic beam-target interactions. For instance, radially polarized {\gamma} rays can be generated by using a dense electron beam striking a multifoil target. We find that the radial polarization is transferred from the generated coherent transition radiation (CTR) fields to $\gamma$ photons through nonlinear Compton scattering, with the high polarization preserved by phase matching. Three-dimensional spin-resolved simulations demonstrate radial polarization degrees approaching 60\%. Furthermore, these {\gamma} rays can decay into azimuthally spin-polarized positrons via the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process, with their spins aligning along the CTR magnetic field. Our work extends the concept of structured light into the {\gamma}-ray regime, offering new prospects for broad fields such as nuclear structure probing, fundamental symmetries tests, polarization-sensitive studies in extreme conditions, and laboratory astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Identification of Nonlinear Damping of Transverse Loop Oscillations by KHI-induced Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kink oscillations in coronal loops have been extensively studied for their potential contributions to coronal heating and their role in plasma diagnostics through coronal seismology. A key focus is the strong damping of large-amplitude kink oscillations, which observational evidence suggests is nonlinear. However, directly identifying the nonlinearity is a challenge. This work presents an analytic formula describing nonlinear standing kink oscillations dissipated by turbulence, characterised by a time-varying damping rate and period drift. We investigate how the damping behaviour depends on the driving amplitude and loop properties, showing that the initial damping time $\tau$ is inversely proportional to the velocity disturbance over the loop radius, $V_i/R$. Using MCMC fitting with Bayesian inference, the nonlinear function better fits an observed decaying kink oscillation than traditional linear models, including exponential damping, suggesting its nonlinear nature. By applying a Bayesian model comparison, we establish regimes in which nonlinear and linear resonant absorption mechanisms dominate based on the relationship between the damping rate $\tau/P$ and $V_i/R$. Additionally, analysis of two specific events reveals that while one favours the nonlinear model, the other is better explained by the linear model. Our results suggest that this analytical approximation of nonlinear damping due to turbulence provides a valid and reliable description of large-amplitude decaying kink oscillations in coronal loops.</description>

      <title>Trapping of electrons and $^{40}\textrm{Ca}^+$ ions in a dual-frequency Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the operation of a dual-frequency Paul trap and characterize its performance by storing either electrons or calcium ions while applying two quadrupole fields simultaneously which oscillate at $\Omega_\textrm{fast} = 2\pi \times 1.6$ GHz and $\Omega_\textrm{slow} = 2\pi \times 2$ MHz. The particles are loaded and stored in the trap under various conditions followed by detection employing an electron multiplier tube. We find that tens of electrons or ions can be trapped for up to ten milliseconds and a small fraction remains trapped even after hundreds of milliseconds. During dual-frequency operation we find that while the number of trapped electrons rapidly decreases with increase of the $\Omega_\textrm{slow}$ field amplitude, the number of trapped ions shows no dependence on the $\Omega_\textrm{fast}$ field amplitude as supported by our extensive numerical simulations. We aim to use a similar trap for synthesising antihydrogen from antiprotons and positrons. Accordingly, we discuss open challenges such as the co-trapping of oppositely charged species and particle trap duration.</description>

      <title>Semi-Lagrangian methods for a plasma hybrid model with multi-species kinetic ions and massless electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semi-Lagrangian methods with the improved number of one-dimensional advections are proposed for a plasma hybrid model with kinetic ions and mass-less electrons. Two subsystems with mass, momentum, and energy conservation are obtained by a Poisson bracket-based splitting method. For the subsystem in which the distribution functions and the fields are coupled, the second order and reversible modified implicit mid-point rule is used in time with the specially designed mean velocity. The distribution functions are not involved in the iterations and are solved by exact splittings with only one dimensional advections, which makes the proposed schemes efficient. The cancellation problem is overcome by the numerical schemes constructed. Moreover, for the case with a periodic boundary condition, the magnetic field obtained is divergence free, mass, momentum, and energy are conserved. The methods can be extended to cases with multiple ion species.</description>

      <title>Neural-Network solver of ideal MHD equilibria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo simulation on the scattering coefficients of solar radio wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio waves undergo scattering by small-scale density fluctuations during propagation through the solar-terrestrial environment, substantially affecting the observed characteristics of solar radio bursts. This scattering process can be effectively modeled as photon diffusion in phase space. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison between the quasilinear diffusion coefficients and those calculated by ray-tracing the photon trajectories in numerically generated, broadband, isotropic density fluctuation fields in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that for weak scattering, the simulated diffusion coefficients agree well with the quasilinear theoretical predictions. However, when the radio frequency approaches the electron plasma frequency and/or the density fluctuation amplitude becomes significant, photons experience strong scattering. Under such conditions, the quasilinear theory tends to underestimate the scattering strength of photons induced by 2D density fluctuations while overestimating the scattering strength in 3D cases. Furthermore, we implement a group velocity correction to the theoretical diffusion coefficients, based on the effective propagation speed averaged over all test photons. The corrected coefficients provide an accurate quantification of the scattering strength for radio waves propagating through 3D density fluctuations. The physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena are elucidated in the discussion.</description>
