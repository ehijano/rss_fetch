      <title>Pattern Formation in Robotic Mechanical Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal patterns emerging from an initial quiescent, uniform state is a phenomenon observed in many dynamical systems sustained far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the practical application of which has only recently begun to be explored. As the underlying dynamics are typically complex, pattern formation is often theoretically analyzed and understood via phenomenological models, which effectively represent the causal mechanisms, but obscure the link between the small-scale interactions/processes and the observed macroscopic behavior. Moreover, efforts to prescribe the patterning response are often undercut by the experimental inaccessibility of the small-scale constituents/processes. This article demonstrates an artificial system (i.e., a robotic mechanical metamaterial) as an accessible and versatile platform within which to explore and prescribe the patterning response of non-equilibrium systems. Specifically, in varying a feedback parameter within the prescribed reaction kinetics, the robotic mechanical metamaterial alternately develops spatial and temporal oscillations in the displacement field following a perturbation of the initial quiescent, uniform state. The platform is amenable to a first-principles analytical description so that corresponding theoretical results possess qualitative and quantitative significance, and maintain connection to the specific system parameters.</description>

      <title>Spectral-filtering-induced phase transition in passively mode-locked fiber lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a tunable spectral filter on the dynamics of a passively mode-locked fiber laser in the anomalous dispersion regime. The results show that noise-like pulse emission evolves toward bound-state regime as the filter bandwidth is reduced. Thanks to the Shannon entropy applied to dispersive Fourier transform signals, it is demonstrated that the system undergoes a phase transition.</description>

      <title>Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs), driven by periodic modulation of the $s$-wave scattering length. Linear stability analysis of the driven Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations reveals that parametric instability follows a Mathieu-like equation, with Faraday waves emerging resonantly when half the driving frequency matches the collective excitation frequency of the SGBEC. This framework yields a stability phase diagram demonstrating the coexistence and interplay between the intrinsic Jeans instability of self-gravitating systems and the unstable tongues of parametric resonance. The phase diagram shows that reducing the driving frequency fragments and narrows parametric resonance structures while expanding the Jeans-dominated regime. We further identify a thermal-gravity competition in the Faraday wavevector, manifested as a sharp transition when thermal energy balances mean-field interaction at low driving frequencies. We numerically simulate Faraday wave formation and dynamics within the SGBEC, including the effects of dissipation; simulations reveal that Faraday wave patterns exhibit high sensitivity to Jeans frequency, transitioning from parametric resonance to Jeans collapse as gravitational strength increases.</description>

      <title>External charged debris in a flowing plasma : charge fluctuation induced complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the response of a flowing e-i plasma to embedded external charged debris, focusing on the periodic debris charge fluctuations that can trigger complex phenomena such as chaos and nonlinear Landau damping. We employ both kinetic and fluid simulations to analyse the plasma response to the time-dependent debris charge. Our findings indicate that the nature of the nonlinear response can be considerably different for fluctuating positively charged external debris from negatively charged debris. The simulations show that the debris charge fluctuation causes damping of the ion-acoustic wave as the debris velocity nears the ion-acoustic speed through nonlinear Landau damping and wave-wave interactions. We also present a theoretical framework to support the simulation findings. Our findings provide critical insights into debris-plasma interactions, which may be useful in applications involving space debris management.</description>

      <title>Magnon Nesting in Driven Two-Dimensional Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</description>
