      <title>Eigenvalue Asymptotics near a flat band in presence of a slowly decaying potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide eigenvalue asymptotics for a Dirac-type operator on $\mathbb Z^n$, $n\geq 2$, perturbed by multiplication operators that decay as $|\mu|^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma&lt;n$. We show that the eigenvalues accumulate near the value of the flat band at a ''semiclassical'' rate with a constant that encodes the structure of the flat band. Similarly, we show that this behaviour can be obtained also for a Laplace operator on a periodic graph.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation for the Robin eigenvalue problem on manifolds and flexibility of optimal Schr\"odinger potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the spectrum of a Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem posed on a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ with non-negative potential can be approached by that of Robin eigenvalue problems with constant positive boundary parameter posed on a sequence of domains in $M$. We construct these Robin problems by means of a homogenisation procedure. We show a similar result for compact manifolds with non-empty boundary and sign-indefinite potential; in this case the Robin boundary parameter can be taken to be constant on each boundary component and to have constant magnitude. As an application, we prove a flexibility result for optimal Schr\"odinger potentials: for certain problems where it is known that there exists some potential $V$ which extremises some Schr\"odinger eigenvalue, we show that this extremal eigenvalue is also approached by the corresponding eigenvalues for a sequence of smooth potentials which remain bounded away from $V$ in some dual Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>Refined $L^p$ restriction estimate for eigenfunctions on Riemannian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine the $L^p$ restriction estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions on a Riemannian surface, originally established by Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov. First, we establish estimates for the restriction of eigenfunctions to arbitrary Borel sets on the surface, following the formulation of Eswarathasan and Pramanik. We achieve this by proving a variable coefficient version of a weighted Fourier extension estimate of Du and Zhang. Our results naturally unify the $L^p(M)$ estimates of Sogge and the $L^p(\gamma)$ restriction bounds of Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov, and are sharp for all $p \geq 2$, up to a $\lambda^\varepsilon$ loss. Second, we derive sharp estimates for the restriction of eigenfunctions to tubular neighborhoods of a curve with non-vanishing geodesic curvature. These estimates are closely related to a variable coefficient version of the Mizohata--Takeuchi conjecture, providing new insights into eigenfunction concentration phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of star domains and the spectra of Hodge-Laplace operators under domain approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the eigenvalues of Hodge--Laplace operators over bounded convex domains. Generalizing contributions by Guerini and Savo, we show that the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constants of the Sobolev de~Rham complexes increase with the degree of the forms. We establish that the spectra of Hodge--Laplace operators converge when the domain is approximated by a sequence of convex domains up to a bi-Lipschitz deformation of the boundary. As preparatory work with independent relevance, we study the gauge function and the reciprocal radial function of convex sets, providing new proofs for Lipschitz estimates by Vre\'{c}ica and Toranzos for the reciprocal radial function and improving a Lipschitz estimate for the gauge function due to Beer.</description>

      <title>Functions of self-adjoint operators under relatively bounded and relatively trace class perturbations. Relatively operator Lipschitz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of functions of self-adjoint operators under relatively bounded and relatively trace class perturbation We introduce and study the class of relatively operator Lipschitz functions. An essential role is played by double operator integrals. We also consider study the class of resolvent Lipschitz functions. Then we obtain a trace formula in the case of relatively trace class perturbations and show that the maximal class of function for which the trace formula holds in the case of relatively trace class perturbations coincides with the class of relatively operator Lipschitz functions. Our methods also gives us a new approach to the inequality $\int|\boldsymbol{\xi}(t)|(1+|t|)^{-1}\,{\rm d}t&lt;\infty$ for the spectral shift function $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ in the case of relatively trace class perturbations.</description>

      <title>Stability of spectral partitions with corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spectral minimal partition of a manifold is a decomposition into disjoint open sets that minimizes a spectral energy functional. While it is known that bipartite minimal partitions correspond to nodal partitions of Courant-sharp Laplacian eigenfunctions, the non-bipartite case is much more challenging. In this paper, we unify the bipartite and non-bipartite settings by defining a modified Laplacian operator and proving that the nodal partitions of its eigenfunctions are exactly the critical points of the spectral energy functional. Moreover, we prove that the Morse index of a critical point equals the nodal deficiency of the corresponding eigenfunction. Some striking consequences of our main result are: 1) in the bipartite case, every local minimum of the energy functional is in fact a global minimum; 2) in the non-bipartite case, every local minimum of the energy functional minimizes within a certain topological class of partitions. Our results are valid for partitions with non-smooth boundaries; this introduces considerable technical challenges, which are overcome using delicate approximation arguments in the Sobolev space $H^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via combinatorial expansion I: Perturbation of eigenspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. The key idea is to exploit the skewness between the leading eigenvectors of the ground matrix and the noise matrix. We will do this by combining the classical contour integration method with combinatorial ideas, resulting in a new machinery, which has a wide range of applications. Our new bounds are optimal under mild assumptions, with direct applications to central problems in many different areas. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new, optimal, results concerning covariance estimator of the spiked model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, and somewhat unexpectedly, we can use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>Uniform enclosures for the phase and zeros of Bessel functions and their derivatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove explicit uniform two-sided bounds for the phase functions of Bessel functions and of their derivatives. As a consequence, we obtain new enclosures for the zeros of Bessel functions and their derivatives in terms of inverse values of some elementary functions. These bounds are valid, with a few exceptions, for all zeros and all Bessel functions with non-negative indices. We provide numerical evidence showing that our bounds either improve or closely match the best previously known ones.</description>
