      <title>All-order splits and multi-soft limits for particle and string amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most important aspects of scattering amplitudes have long been thought to be associated with their poles. But recently a very different sort of "split" factorizations for a wide range of particle and string tree amplitudes have been discovered away from poles. In this paper, we give a simple, conceptual origin for these splits arising from natural properties of the binary geometry of the curve integral formulation for scattering amplitudes for Tr$(\Phi^3)$ theory. The most natural way of "joining" smaller surfaces to build larger ones directly produces a choice of kinematics for which higher amplitudes factor into lower ones. This gives a generalization of splits to all orders in the topological expansion. These splits allow us to access and compute loop-integrated multi-soft limits for particle and string amplitudes, at all loop orders. This includes split factorizations and multi-soft limits for pion and gluon amplitudes, that are related to Tr$(\Phi^3)$ theory by a simple kinematical shift.</description>

      <title>Positivity bounds on electromagnetic properties of media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the constraints imposed on the electromagnetic response of general media by microcausality (commutators of local fields vanish outside the light cone) and positivity of the imaginary parts (the medium can only absorb energy from the external field). The equations of motion for the average electromagnetic field in a medium -- the macroscopic Maxwell equations -- can be derived from the in-in effective action and the effect of the medium is encoded in the electric and magnetic permeabilities $\varepsilon(\omega,|\boldsymbol{k}|)$ and $\mu(\omega,|\boldsymbol{k}|)$. Microcausality implies analyticity of the retarded Green's functions when the imaginary part of the $4$-vector $(\omega,\boldsymbol{k})$ lies in forward light cone. With appropriate assumptions about the behavior of the medium at high frequencies one derives dispersion relations, originally studied by Leontovich. In the case of dielectrics these relations, combined with the positivity of the imaginary parts, imply bounds on the low-energy values of the response, $\varepsilon(0,0)$ and $\mu(0,0)$. In particular the quantities $\varepsilon(0,0)-1$ and $\varepsilon(0,0) - 1/\mu(0,0)$ are constrained to be positive and equal to integrals over the imaginary parts of the response. We discuss various improvements of these bounds in the case of non-relativistic media and with additional assumptions about the UV behavior.</description>

      <title>Fermionic and bosonic partition functions at imaginary chemical potential as Bloch functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that the phase transitions of the $d+1$ Gross-Neveu and $CP^{N-1}$ models at finite temperature and imaginary chemical potential can be mapped to transformations of Hubbard-like regular hexagonal to square lattice with the intermediate steps to be specific surfaces (irregular hexagonal kind) with an ordered construction based on the even indexed Bloch-Wigner-Ramakrishnan polylogarithm function. The zeros and extrema of the Clausen $Cl_d(\theta) $ function play an important role to the analysis since they allow us not only to study the fermionic and bosonic theories and their phase transitions but also the possibility to explore the existence of conductors arising from the correspondence between the partition functions of the two models and the Bloch and Wannier functions that play a crucial role in the tight-binding approximation in solid state physics.</description>

      <title>Scattering and bound observables for spinning particles in Kerr spacetime with generic spin orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the radial action of a spinning probe particle in Kerr spacetime from the worldline formalism in the first-order form, focusing on linear in spin effects. We then develop a novel covariant Dirac bracket formalism to compute the impulse and the spin kick directly from the radial action, generalizing some conjectural results in the literature and providing ready-to-use expressions for amplitude calculations with generic spin orientations. This allows, for the first time, to find new covariant expressions for scattering observables in the probe limit up to $\mathcal{O}(G^6 s_1 s_2^4)$. Finally, we use the action-angle representation to compute the fundamental frequencies for generic bound orbits, including the intrinsic spin precession, the periastron advance and the precession of the orbital plane.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentropy sum rule by analytical continuation of the superposition parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a sum rule that connects the pseudoentropy and entanglement entropy of a superposition state. Through analytical continuation of the superposition parameter, we demonstrate that the transition matrix and density matrix of the superposition state can be treated in a unified manner. Within this framework, we naturally derive sum rules for the (reduced) transition matrix, pseudo R\'enyi entropy, and pseudoentropy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the close relationship between the sum rule for pseudoentropy and the singularity structure of the entropy function for the superposition state after analytical continuation. We also explore potential applications of the sum rule, including its relevance to understanding the gravity dual of non-Hermitian transition matrices and establishing upper bounds for the absolute value of pseudoentropy.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Non-Invertible Symmetries in (1+1)d: Gapped and Gapless Phases, Transitions, and Symmetry TFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fermionic non-invertible symmetries in (1+1)d, which are generalized global symmetries that mix fermion parity symmetry with other invertible and non-invertible internal symmetries. Such symmetries are described by fermionic fusion supercategories, which are fusion $\pi$-supercategories with a choice of fermion parity. The aim of this paper is to flesh out the categorical Landau paradigm for fermionic symmetries. We use the formalism of Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to study possible gapped and gapless phases for such symmetries, along with possible deformations between these phases, which are organized into a Hasse phase diagram. The phases can be characterized in terms of sets of condensed, confined and deconfined generalized symmetry charges, reminiscent of notions familiar from superconductivity. Many of the gapless phases also serve as phase transitions between gapped phases. The associated fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) can be obtained by performing generalized fermionic Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations on bosonic CFTs describing simpler transitions. The fermionic non-invertible symmetries along with their charges and phases discussed here can be obtained from those of bosonic non-invertible symmetries via fermionization or Jordan-Wigner transformation, which is discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Quantum $\mathfrak{hs}$-Yang-Mills from the IKKT matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-loop effective action of the higher-spin gauge theory induced by the IKKT matrix model on a $\mathcal{M}^{1,3}\times \mathcal{K}$ background, where $\mathcal{M}^{1,3}$ is an FLRW cosmological spacetime brane and $\mathcal{K}$ are compact fuzzy extra dimensions. In particular, we show that all non-abelian ($\mathfrak{hs}$-valued) gauge fields in this model acquire mass via quantum effects, thus avoiding no-go theorems. This leads to a massive non-abelian quantum $\mathfrak{hs}$-Yang-Mills theory, whose detailed structure depends on $\mathcal{K}$. The stabilization of $\mathcal{K}$ at one loop is understood as a result of the coupling between $\mathcal{K}$ and the $U(1)$-flux bundle on space-time. This flux stabilization induces the KK scale into the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM sector of the model, which break superconformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum cosmology as automorphic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit pure quantum cosmology in three dimensions. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation can be solved perturbatively and the dynamics reduces to a particle on moduli space. Its time evolution is equivalent to the $T\overline{T}$ deformation. Focusing on spacetimes with torus slices, we show that inflationary cosmologies correspond to particle trajectories in Artin's billiard. The resulting automorphic dynamics is developed both from a first and second quantized perspectives. Our main application is to give an interpretation for the Hartle-Hawking state which is here the analytic continuation of the Maloney-Witten partition function. We obtain its spectral decomposition and an exact representation as an average involving the M\"obius function.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking in the pseudo-quantum electrodynamics with non-Abelian four-fermion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of 2+1 dimensional Dirac materials, we consider electromagnetic interactions alongside a type of spin-dependent Hubbard interaction. The former is described by PQED theory, while the latter corresponds to an effective theory represented by the $SU(N_c)$ Thirring model. Employing Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and large N expansion in the model yields a non-local $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills action. Subsequently, we solve Schwinger-Dyson equations to obtain the self-energy function of the fermion propagator, from which we determine the critical fermion flavor number $N^c_f$ and critical fine structure constant $\alpha_c$ indicative of chiral symmetry breaking. Our findings suggest that as the non-Abelian color number $N_c$ increases, the minimum value of the critical fermion flavor number monotonically increases, while the maximum value of the critical fine structure constant decreases accordingly, rendering the system more susceptible to chiral symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>The bosonic string spectrum and the explicit states up to level $10$ from the lightcone and the chaotic behavior of certain string amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the irreps and their multiplicities of bosonic string spectrum up to level 10 and we give explicitly the on shell lightcone states which make the irreps. For scalars and vectors we compute the multiplicity up to level 22 and 19 respectively. The first scalar at odd level appears at level 11. For the bosonic string in non critical dimensions we argue that at level $N$ there are always states transforming as tensors with $ s\ge N/2$ indices. Only in critical dimensions there are states with $s\le N/2$. Looking at the explicit coefficients of the combinations needed to make the irreps from the lightcone states we trace the origin of the chaotic behavior of certain cubic amplitudes considered in literature to the extremely precise and sensitive mixtures of states. For example the vectors at level $N=19$ are a linear combinations of states and when the coefficients are normalized to be integer some of them have more than 1200 figures.</description>

      <title>Learning BPS Spectra and the Gap Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore statistical properties of BPS q-series for 3d N=2 strongly coupled supersymmetric theories that correspond to a particular family of 3-manifolds Y. We discover that gaps between exponents in the q-series are statistically more significant at the beginning of the q-series compared to gaps that appear in higher powers of q. Our observations are obtained by calculating saliencies of q-series features used as input data for principal component analysis, which is a standard example of an explainable machine learning technique that allows for a direct calculation and a better analysis of feature saliencies.</description>

      <title>Toward double copy on arbitrary backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double copy relates scattering amplitudes in a web of gravitational and gauge theories. Although it has seen great success when applied to amplitudes in vacuum, far less is known about double copy in arbitrary gravitational and gauge backgrounds. Focussing on the simplest pair production amplitudes of scalar QCD in a background gauge field, we construct, at next-to-leading order in perturbation theory, a double copy map to particle production in general metrics (and associated axio-dilatons) constructed from the gauge background. We connect our results to convolutional and classical double copy and, turning to examples, identify a class of gauge fields which generate FRW spacetimes via double copy. For this case we are able to conjecture the all-orders form of the double copy map.</description>

      <title>Warped CFT duals of the Pleba\'{n}ski-Demia\'{n}ski family of solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the symmetry properties of the complete family of type D spacetimes generalized form the Pleba\'{n}ski-Demia\'{n}ski solution in four dimensions holographically in terms of a warped CFT. The generalized Pleba\'{n}ski-Demia\'{n}ski solutions are black hole-like spacetimes characterized by seven physical parameters. Most of the black holes in four dimensions are included within this family. Generically consider a solution with horizon in this family, we figure out the possible warped conformal symmetry attached to the horizon. The horizon can be either extremal or non-extremal. In the extremal case, the near horizon region can be mapped to an infinite spacetime with geometry given by a warped and twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$. The new boundary conditions for AdS$_2$ as well as their higher dimensional uplifts are applied here to manifest the asymptotic symmetry as the warped conformal symmetry. In the non-extremal case, the global warped conformal symmetry is singled out by analyzing the scalar wave equation with constant frequency. The local warped conformal symmetries are represented by the charge algebra associated to the vector fields which preserve the scalar wave equation as well as its frequency. In defining the variation of the covariant charges, a proper counterterm is introduced for consistency conditions which is supposed to be suitable for all the solutions within the family. As a consistency check, the horizon entropy is reproduced by the entropy formula of the warped CFT by using its modular covariance and the central terms derived in the bulk spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the Classical Regge Growth conjecture (CRG) in the 4d effective field theory that results from compactifying $D$-dimensional General Relativity on a compact, Ricci-flat manifold. While the higher dimensional description is given in terms of pure Einstein gravity and the conjecture is automatically satisfied, it imposes several non-trivial constraints in the 4d spectrum. Namely, there must be either none or an infinite number of massive spin-2 modes, and the mass ratio between consecutive KK spin-2 replicas is bounded by the 4d coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime Approach to the Backreaction of Dynamical Casimir Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate the dynamical Casimir effect, the creation of particles from vacuum by dynamical boundary conditions or dynamical background, and its backreaction to the motion of the boundary. The backreaction of particle creation to the boundary motion is studied using quantum field theory in curved spacetime technique, in 1+1 dimension and 3+1 dimension. The relevant quantities in these quantum field processes are carefully analyzed, including regularization of the UV and IR divergent of vacuum energy, and estimation of classical backreaction effects like radiation pressure. We recovered the qualitative result of backreaction in 1+1 dimensions. In the 3+1 dimension, we find that the backreaction tends to slow down the system to suppress the further particle creation, similar to the case of cosmological particle creation.</description>

      <title>Light-ray sum rules and the c-anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a four-dimensional quantum field theory that flows between two fixed points under the renormalization group, the change in the conformal anomaly $\Delta a$ has been related to the average null energy. We extend this result to derive a sum rule for the other anomaly coefficient, $\Delta c$, in terms of the stress tensor three-point function. While the sum rule for $\Delta a$ is an expectation value of the averaged null energy operator, and therefore positive, the result for $\Delta c$ involves the off-diagonal matrix elements, so it does not have a fixed sign.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate invariants of torus knots to the counts of a class of lattice paths, which we call generalized Schr\"oder paths. We determine generating functions of such paths, located in a region determined by a type of a torus knot under consideration, and show that they encode colored HOMFLY-PT polynomials of this knot. The generators of uncolored HOMFLY-PT homology correspond to a basic set of such paths. Invoking the knots-quivers correspondence, we express generating functions of such paths as quiver generating series, and also relate them to quadruply-graded knot homology. Furthermore, we determine corresponding A-polynomials, which provide algebraic equations and recursion relations for generating functions of generalized Schr\"oder paths. The lattice paths of our interest explicitly enumerate BPS states associated to knots via brane constructions.</description>

      <title>On fusing matrices associated with conformal boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look at the fusing matrices that arise when a topological defect is attached to a conformal boundary condition. We call such junctions open topological defects. One type of fusing matrices arises when two open defects fuse while another arises when an open defect passes through a boundary operator. We use the topological field theory approach to RCFTs based on Frobenius algebra objects in modular tensor categories to describe the general structure associated with such matrices and how to compute them from a given Frobenius algebra object and its representation theory. We illustrate the computational process on the rational free boson theories. Applications to boundary renormalisation group flows are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Large-$N$ integrated correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM: when resurgence meets modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact expressions for certain integrated correlators of four half-BPS operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ have been recently obtained thanks to a beautiful interplay between supersymmetric localisation and modular invariance. The large-$N$ expansion at fixed Yang-Mills coupling of such integrated correlators produces an asymptotic series of perturbative terms, holographically related to higher derivative interactions in the low energy expansion of the type IIB effective action, as well as exponentially suppressed corrections at large $N$, interpreted as contributions from coincident $(p,q)$-string world-sheet instantons. In this work we define a manifestly modular invariant Borel resummation of the perturbative large-$N$ expansion of these integrated correlators, from which we extract the exact non-perturbative large-$N$ sectors via resurgence analysis. Furthermore, we show that in the 't Hooft limit such modular invariant non-perturbative completions reduce to known resurgent genus expansions. Finally, we clarify how the same non-perturbative data is encoded in the decomposition of the integrated correlators based on $\rm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ spectral theory.</description>

      <title>On the lapse contour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral is usually implemented with a covariant action by analogy with other gauge field theories, but the gravitational case is different in important ways. A key difference is that the integrand has an essential singularity, which occurs at zero lapse where the spacetime metric degenerates. The lapse integration contour required to impose the local time reparametrization constraints must run from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, yet must not pass through zero. This raises the question: what is the correct integration contour, and why? We study that question by starting with the reduced phase space path integral, which involves no essential singularity. We observe that if the momenta are to be integrated before the lapse, to obtain a configuration space path integral, the lapse contour should pass below the origin in the complex lapse plane. This contour is also consistent with the requirement that quantum field fluctuation amplitudes have the usual short distance vacuum form, and with obtaining the Bekenstein-Hawking horizon entropy from a Lorentzian path integral. We close with a discussion of related issues, including potential obstacles to deriving a nonperturbative covariant gravitational path integral.</description>

Abstract: Toric Ricci--flat metrics in dimension four correspond to certain holomorphic vector bundles over a twistor space. We construct these bundles explicitly, by exhibiting and characterising their patching matrices, for the five--parameter family of Riemannian ALF metrics constructed by Chen and Teo. The Chen--Teo family contains a two--parameter family of asymptotically flat gravitational instantons. The patching matrices for these instantons take a simple rational form.</description>

      <title>Constraining $f({\cal R})$ gravity by Pulsar {\textit SAX J1748.9-2021} observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss spherically symmetric dynamical systems in the framework of a general model of $f({\cal R})$ gravity, i.e. $f({\cal R})={\cal R}e^{\zeta {\cal R}}$, where $\zeta$ is a dimensional quantity in squared length units [L$^2$]. We initially assume that the internal structure of such systems is governed by the Krori-Barua ansatz, alongside the presence of fluid anisotropy. By employing astrophysical observations obtained from the pulsar {\textit SAX J1748.9-2021}, derived from bursting X-ray binaries located within globular clusters, we determine that $\zeta$ is approximately equal to $\pm 5$ km$^2$. In particular, the model can create a stable configuration for {\textit SAX J1748.9-2021}, encompassing its geometric and physical characteristics. In $f({\cal R})$ gravity, the Krori-Barua approach links $p_r$ and $p_t$, which represent the components of the pressures, to ($\rho$), representing the density, semi-analytically. These relations are described as $p_r\approx v_r^2 (\rho-\rho_{I})$ and $p_t\approx v_t^2 (\rho-\rho_{II})$. Here, the expression $v_r$ and $v_t$ represent the radial and tangential sound speeds, respectively. Meanwhile, $\rho_I$ pertains to the surface density and $\rho_{II}$ is derived using the parameters of the model. Notably, within the frame of $f({\cal R})$ gravity where $\zeta$ is negative, the maximum compactness, denoted as $C$, is inherently limited to values that do not exceed the Buchdahl limit. This contrasts with general relativity or with $f({\cal R})$ with positive $\zeta$, where $C$ has the potential to reach the limit of the black hole asymptotically. The predictions of such model suggest a central energy density which largely exceeds the saturation of nuclear density, which has the value $\rho_{\text{nuc}} = 3\times 10^{14}$ g/cm$^3$. Also, the density at the surface $\rho_I$ surpasses $\rho_{\text{nuc}}$.</description>

      <title>Learning 3-Manifold Triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real 3-manifold triangulations can be uniquely represented by isomorphism signatures. Databases of these isomorphism signatures are generated for a variety of 3-manifolds and knot complements, using SnapPy and Regina, then these language-like inputs are used to train various machine learning architectures to differentiate the manifolds, as well as their Dehn surgeries, via their triangulations. Gradient saliency analysis then extracts key parts of this language-like encoding scheme from the trained models. The isomorphism signature databases are taken from the 3-manifolds' Pachner graphs, which are also generated in bulk for some selected manifolds of focus and for the subset of the SnapPy orientable cusped census with $&lt;8$ initial tetrahedra. These Pachner graphs are further analysed through the lens of network science to identify new structure in the triangulation representation; in particular for the hyperbolic case, a relation between the length of the shortest geodesic (systole) and the size of the Pachner graph's ball is observed.</description>

      <title>Fermionic quantum criticality through the lens of topological holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize the topological holographic framework to characterize and gain insights into the nature of quantum critical points and gapless phases in fermionic quantum systems. Topological holography is a general framework that describes the generalized global symmetry and the symmetry charges of a local quantum system in terms of a slab of a topological order, termed as the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), in one higher dimension. In this work, we consider a generalization of the topological holographic picture for $(1+1)d$ fermionic quantum phases of matter. We discuss how spin structures are encoded in the SymTFT and establish the connection between the formal fermionization formula in quantum field theory and the choice of fermionic gapped boundary conditions of the SymTFT. We demonstrate the identification and the characterization of the fermionic gapped phases and phase transitions through detailed analysis of various examples, including the fermionic systems with $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\mathbb{Z}_{4}^{F}$, and the fermionic version of the non-invertible $\text{Rep}(S_{3})$ symmetry. Our work uncovers many exotic fermionic quantum critical points and gapless phases, including two kinds of fermionic symmetry enriched quantum critical points, a fermionic gapless symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, and a fermionic gapless spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase that breaks the fermionic non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics in Krylov Space: Methods and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide a compact and computationally efficient description of quantum evolution, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.</description>

      <title>Open Effective Field Theories for cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When energy is not conserved, imprints of new physics on observable cosmology might not follow the rules of local effective actions. By capturing dissipative and diffusive effects, open effective field theories account for the possibly non-Hamiltonian evolution of cosmological inhomogeneities interacting with an unspecified environment. In this proceeding, we briefly discuss recent progress made towards their implementation in primordial cosmology. Our approach recovers the usual effective field theory of inflation in a certain limit and extends it to account for local dissipation and noises. Non-Gaussianities are generated that peak in the equilateral configuration for large dissipation and in the folded configurations for small dissipation. The construction provides an embedding for local dissipative models of inflation and a framework to study quantum information aspects of the inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Black bounces in conformal Killing gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyse black bounce solutions in the recently proposed ``Conformal Killing gravity'' (CKG), by coupling the theory to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields. The original motivation of the theory was essentially to fulfil specific criteria that are absent in existing gravitational theories, namely, to obtain the cosmological constant as an integration constant, derive the energy-momentum conservation law as a consequence of the gravitational field equations, rather than assuming it, and not necessarily considering conformally flat metrics as vacuum solutions. In this work, we extend the static and spherically symmetric solutions obtained in the literature, and explore the possibility of black bounces in CKG, coupled to NLED and scalar fields. We find novel NLED Lagrangian densities and scalar potentials, and extend the class of black bounce solutions found in the literature. Furthermore, within black bounce geometries, we find generalizations of the Bardeen-type and Simpson-Visser geometries and explore the regularity conditions of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Landscapes of integrable long-range spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify how the elliptic integrable spin chain recently found by Matushko and Zotov (MZ) relates to various other known long-range spin chains.
  We evaluate various limits. More precisely, we tweak the MZ chain to allow for a short-range limit, and show it is the XX model with q-deformed antiperiodic boundary conditions. Taking $q\to 1$ gives the elliptic spin chain of Sechin and Zotov (SZ), whose trigonometric case is due to Fukui and Kawakami. It, too, can be adjusted to admit a short-range limit, which we demonstrate to be the antiperiodic XX model. By identifying the translation operator of the MZ chain, which is nontrivial, we show that antiperiodicity is a persistent feature.
  We compare the resulting (vertex-type) landscape of the MZ chain with the (face-type) landscape containing the Heisenberg XXX and Haldane--Shastry chains. We find that the landscapes only share a single point: the rational Haldane--Shastry chain. Using wrapping we show that the SZ chain is the antiperiodic version of the Inozemtsev chain in a precise sense, and expand both chains around their nearest-neighbour limits to facilitate their interpretations as long-range deformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal coupling of massless fermions to gravity does not allow for their gravitational production solely based on the expansion of the Universe. We argue that this changes in presence of realistic and potentially detectable stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We compute the resulting energy density of Weyl fermions at 1-loop using in--in formalism. If the initially massless fermions eventually acquire mass, this mechanism can explain the dark matter abundance in the Universe. Remarkably, it may be more efficient than conventional gravitational production of superheavy fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the field equations in a five-dimensional spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric in the context of a Gauss-Bonnet-Scalar field theory where the quintessence scalar field is coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. Contrary to the four-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet theory, where the Gauss-Bonnet term does not contribute to the field equations, in this five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model, the Gauss-Bonnet term contributes to the field equations even when the coupling function is a constant. Additionally, we consider a more general coupling described by a power-law function. For the scalar field potential, we consider the exponential function. For each choice of the coupling function, we define a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics for both systems and classify the stability of the equilibrium points. We determine the presence of scaling and super-collapsing solutions using the cosmological deceleration parameter. This means that our models can explain the Universe's early and late-time acceleration phases. Consequently, this model can be used to study inflation or as a dark energy candidate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate chaos in the dynamics of outgoing massless particles near the horizon of static spherically symmetric (SSS) black holes in two well-motivated models of $f(R)$ gravity. In both these models, we probe chaos in the particle trajectories (under suitable harmonic confinement) in the vicinity of the black hole horizons, for a set of initial conditions. The particle trajectories, associated Poincar$\acute{e}$ sections, and Lyapunov exponents clearly illustrate the role played by the black hole horizon in the growth of chaos within a specific energy range. We demonstrate how this energy range is controlled by the parameters of the modified gravity theory under consideration. The growth of chaos in such a classical setting is known to respect a surface gravity bound arising from universal aspects of particle dynamics close to the black hole horizon [K. Hashimoto and N. Tanahashi, Phys. Rev. D 95, 024007 (2017)], analogous to the quantum MSS bound [J. Maldacena, S.H. Shenker and D. Stanford, JHEP 08 (2016) 106]. Interestingly, both models studied in our work respect the bound, in contrast to some of the other models of $f(R)$ gravity in the existing literature. The work serves as a motivation to use chaos as an additional tool to probe Einstein gravity in the strong gravity regime in the vicinity of black hole horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fine-structure constant dependence of the rates of some selected radiative capture reactions within the framework of so-called Halo Effective Field Theory in order to assess the adequacy of some assumptions made on the Coulomb penetrability. We find that this dependence deviates from that implied by a parameterization of the cross sections of this effect via a simple penetration factor. Some features of this fine-structure dependence are discussed, in particular its potential impact on the abundances of the light elements in primordial nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a family of charged rotating wormhole solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations, supported by anisotropic matter fields. We first revisit the charged static cases and analyze the conditions for the solution to represent a wormhole geometry. The rotating geometry is obtained by applying the Newman-Janis algorithm to the static geometry. We show the solutions to Maxwell equations in detail. We believe that our wormhole geometry offers a geometric realization corresponding to the concept of 'charge without charge'.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Topology in Hermitian Topological Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity leads to distinctive topological phenomena absent in Hermitian systems. However, connection between such intrinsic non-Hermitian topology and Hermitian topology has remained largely elusive. Here, considering the bulk and boundary as an environment and system, we demonstrate that anomalous boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators exhibit non-Hermitian topology. We study the self-energy capturing the particle exchange between the bulk and boundary, and demonstrate that it detects Hermitian topology in the bulk and induces non-Hermitian topology at the boundary. As an illustrative example, we show the non-Hermitian topology and concomitant skin effect inherently embedded within chiral edge states of Chern insulators. We also find the emergence of hinge states within effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians at surfaces of three-dimensional topological insulators. Furthermore, we comprehensively classify our correspondence across all the tenfold symmetry classes of topological insulators and superconductors. Our work uncovers a hidden connection between Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology, and provides an approach to identifying non-Hermitian topology in quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review a number of unimodular no-scale supergravity models with F-term SUSY breaking which support technically natural de Sitter vacua. A variant of these models develops a stage of inflection-point inflation which can be realized for subplanckian field values consistently with the observational data. For central value of the spectral index ns, the necessary tuning is of the order of 10^-6, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is tiny whereas the running of ns is around -3x10^-3. Our proposal is compatible with high-scale SUSY and the results of LHC on the Higgs boson mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $U(3)^5$ symmetry within the SMEFT framework restricts the inclusion of only fully flavor-conserving operators at dimension six. This proceeding presents a global analysis of the SMEFT under this assumption. We provide global constraints on all 41 Wilson coefficients, utilizing leading-order and next-to-leading-order SMEFT predictions for various experiments including parity-violating experiments, Electroweak Precision Observables (EWPO), Higgs physics, top quark interactions, flavor observables, dijet production, and lepton scatterings. We address issues concerning the constraints of specific four-quark operators, investigate correlations between observables at different energy scales, and assess the impact of next-to-leading-order contributions on the global fit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy conditions are crucial for understanding why exotic phenomena such as traversable wormholes and closed timelike curves remain elusive. In this paper, we prove the Double Smeared Null Energy Condition (DSNEC) for the fermionic free theory in 4-dimensional flat Minkowski space-time, extending previous work on the same energy condition for the bosonic case [1][2] by adapting Fewster and Mistry's method [3] to the energy-momentum tensor $T_{++}$. A notable difference from previous works lies in the presence of the $\gamma_0 \gamma_+$ matrix in $T_{++}$, causing a loss of symmetry. This challenge is addressed by making use of its square-root matrix. We provide explicit analytic results for the massless case as well as numerical insights for the mass-dependence of the bound in the case of Gaussian smearing.</description>

      <title>Interacting chiral fermions on the lattice with matrix product operator norms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for simulating one-dimensional interacting chiral fermions on the lattice without breaking any local symmetries by defining a Fock space endowed with a semi-definite norm defined in terms of matrix product operators. This formalism can be understood as a second-quantized form of Stacey fermions, hence providing a possible solution for the fermion doubling problem and circumventing the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We prove that the emerging theory is hermitian by virtue of the fact that it gives rise to a hermitian generalized eigenvalue problem and that it has local features as it can be simulated using tensor network methods similar to the ones used for simulating local quantum Hamiltonians. We also show that the scaling limit of the free model recovers the chiral fermion field. As a proof of principle, we consider a single Weyl fermion on a periodic ring with Hubbard-type nearest-neighbor interactions and construct a variational generalized DMRG code demonstrating that the ground states of the system for large system sizes can be determined efficiently.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we discuss the effect of light, non-gauge, bosonic degrees of freedom on the exterior spacetime of an exotic compact object. We show that such fields generically introduce large deviations from spacetimes of vacuum General Relativity near and outside the surfaces of ultra-compact exotic objects unless one assumes they totally decouple from the standard model or new heavy fields. Hence, using solutions of vacuum General Relativity to model ultra-compact exotic objects and their perturbations relies implicitly on this assumption or on the absence of such fields.</description>

      <title>Top Down Approach to Topological Duality Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09743v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological duality defects arise as codimension one generalized symmetry operators in quantum field theories (QFTs) with a duality symmetry. Recent investigations have shown that in the case of 4D $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, an appropriate choice of (complexified) gauge coupling and global form of the gauge group can lead to a rather rich fusion algebra for the associated defects, leading to examples of non-invertible symmetries. In this work we present a top down construction of these duality defects which generalizes to QFTs with lower supersymmetry, where other 0-form symmetries are often present. We realize the QFTs of interest via D3-branes probing $X$ a Calabi-Yau threefold cone with an isolated singularity at the tip of the cone. The IIB duality group descends to dualities of the 4D worldvolume theory. Non-trivial codimension one topological interfaces arise from configurations of 7-branes "at infinity" which implement a suitable $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ transformation when they are crossed. Reduction on the boundary topology $\partial X$ results in a 5D symmetry TFT. Different realizations of duality defects, such as the gauging of 1-form symmetries with certain mixed anomalies and half-space gauging constructions, simply amount to distinct choices of where to place the branch cuts in the 5D bulk.</description>

      <title>Holographic RG from ERG: Locality and General Coordinate Invariance in the Bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07442v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In earlier papers it was shown that the correct kinetic term for scalar, vector gauge field and the spin two field in $AdS_{D+1}$ space is obtained starting from the ERG equation for a $CFT_D$ perturbed by scalar composite, conserved vector current and conserved traceless energy momentum tensor respectively. In this paper interactions are studied and it is shown that a flipped version of Polchinski ERG equation that evolves towards the UV can be written down and is useful for making contact with the usual AdS/CFT prescriptions for correlation function calculations. The scalar-scalar-spin-2 interaction in the bulk is derived from the ERG equation in the large $N$ semiclasical approximation.
  It is also shown that after mapping to AdS the interaction is local on a scale of the bare cutoff rather than the moving cutoff (which would have corresponded to the AdS scale). The map to $AdS_{D+1}$ plays a crucial role in this locality. The local nature of the coupling ensures that this interaction term in the bulk action is obtained by gauge fixing a general coordinate invariant scalar kinetic term in the bulk action. A wave function renormalization of the scalar field is found to be required for a mutually consistent map of the two fields to $AdS_{D+1}$.</description>

      <title>The Dilaton Improves Goldstones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The free scalar field is only conformally invariant when non-minimally coupled to gravity. In flat space this amounts to amending, or improving, the energy momentum tensor. A no-go theorem prohibits the improvement for Goldstone bosons, originating from global internal spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is shown that the no-go theorem can be circumvented in the presence of a dilaton. The latter is a (pseudo) Goldstone boson originating from spontaneous conformal symmetry breaking in a theory with an infrared fixed point. Specifically, the tracelessness of the energy momentum tensor is demonstrated for a generic $d$-dimensional curved space. Additionally, the Goldstone gravitational form factors are shown to obey conformality constraints in the soft limit. The crucial point is that the remainder term of the soft theorem is non-zero due to the presence of the dilaton pole. For Goldstone systems with a trivial infrared fixed point the leading order analysis of this paper ought to be sufficient. Loop effects govern the improvement term outside the fixed point and are scheme-dependent as briefly discussed towards the end of the paper.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new elliptic integrable $\sigma$-model in the form of a two-parameter deformation of the Principal Chiral Model on the group $\text{SL}_{\mathbb{R}}(N)$, generalising a construction of Cherednik for $N=2$ (up to reality conditions). We exhibit the Lax connection and $\mathcal{R}$-matrix of this theory, which depend meromorphically on a spectral parameter valued in the torus. Furthermore, we explain the origin of this model from an equivariant semi-holomorphic 4-dimensional Chern-Simons theory on the torus. This approach opens the way for the construction of a large class of elliptic integrable $\sigma$-models, with the deformed Principal Chiral Model as the simplest example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider 't Hooft anomalies of four-dimensional gauge theories whose fermion matter content admits $Spin_G(4)$ generalized spin structure, with $G$ either gauged or a global symmetry. We discuss methods to directly compute $w_2\cup w_3$ 't Hooft anomalies involving Stiefel-Whitney classes of gauge and flavor symmetry bundles that such theories can have on non-spin manifolds, e.g. $M_4=\mathbb{CP}^2$. Such anomalies have been discussed for $SU(2)$ gauge theory with adjoint fermions, where they were shown to give an effect that was originally found in the Donaldson-Witten topological twist of ${\cal N}=2$ SYM theory. We directly compute these anomalies for a variety of theories, including general $G$ gauge theories with adjoint fermions, $SU(2)$ gauge theory with fermions in general representations, and $Spin(N)$ gauge theories with fundamental matter. We discuss aspects of matching these and other 't Hooft anomalies in the IR phase where global symmetries are spontaneously broken, in particular for general $G_{\rm gauge}$ theory with $N_f$ adjoint Weyl fermions. For example, in the case of $N_f=2$ we discuss anomaly matching in the IR phase consisting of $h^\vee _{G_{\rm gauge}}$ copies of a $\mathbb{CP}^1$ non-linear sigma model, including for the $w_2w_3$ anomalies when formulated with $Spin_{SU(2)_{\rm global}}(4)$ structure.</description>

Abstract: We study geometries occurring in Feynman integrals that contribute to the scattering of black holes in the post-Minkowskian expansion. These geometries become relevant to gravitational-wave production during the inspiralling phase of binary black hole mergers through the classical conservative potential. At fourth post-Minkowskian order, a K3 surface is known to occur in a three-loop integral, leading to elliptic integrals in the result. In this letter, we identify a Calabi-Yau three-fold in a four-loop integral, contributing at fifth post-Minkowskian order. The presence of this Calabi-Yau geometry indicates that completely new functions occur in the full analytical results at this order.</description>

      <title>Boundary Overlaps from Functional Separation of Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show how the Functional Separation of Variables (FSoV) method can be applied to the problem of computing overlaps with integrable boundary states in integrable systems. We demonstrate our general method on the example of a particular boundary state, a singlet of the symmetry group, in an su(3) rational spin chain in an alternating fundamental--anti-fundamental representation. The FSoV formalism allows us to compute in determinant form not only the overlaps of the boundary state with the eigenstates of the transfer matrix, but in fact with any factorisable state. This includes off-shell Bethe states, whose overlaps with the boundary state have been out of reach with other methods. Furthermore, we also found determinant representations for insertions of so-called Principal Operators (forming a complete algebra of all observables) between the boundary and the factorisable state as well as certain types of multiple insertions of Principal Operators. Concise formulas for the matrix elements of the boundary state in the SoV basis and su(N) generalisations are presented. Finally, we managed to construct a complete basis of integrable boundary states by repeated action of conserved charges on the singlet state. As a result, we are also able to compute the overlaps of all of these states with integral of motion eigenstates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive gravitational backgrounds that are asymptotically Anti-de Sitter, have a regular black hole horizon and which deep in the interior exhibit mixmaster chaotic dynamics. The solutions are obtained by coupling gravity with a negative cosmological constant to three massive vector fields, within an Ansatz that reduces to ordinary differential equations. At late interior times the equations are identical to those analysed in depth by Misner and by Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz fifty years ago. We review and extend known classical and semiclassical results on the interior chaos, formulated as both a dynamical system of `Kasner eras' and as a hyperbolic billiards problem. The volume of the universe collapses doubly-exponentially over each Kasner era. A remarkable feature is the emergence of a conserved energy, and hence a `time-independent' Hamiltonian, at asymptotically late interior times. A quantisation of this Hamiltonian exhibits arithmetic chaos associated with the principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(2)$ of the modular group. We compute a large number of eigenvalues numerically to obtain the spectral form factor. While the spectral statistics is anomalous for a chaotic system, the eigenfunctions themselves display random matrix behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the notion of fractional derivatives, we introduce a class of massless Lifshitz scalar field theory in (1+1)-dimension with an arbitrary anisotropy index $z$. The Lifshitz scale invariant ground state of the theory is constructed explicitly and takes the form of Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK). We show that there is a continuous family of ground states with degeneracy parameterized by the choice of solution to the equation of motion of an auxiliary classical system. The quantum mechanical path integral establishes a 2d/1d correspondence with the equal time correlation functions of the Lifshitz scalar field theory. We study the entanglement properties of the Lifshitz theory for arbitrary $z$ using the path integral representation. The entanglement measures are expressed in terms of certain cross ratio functions we specify, and satisfy the $c$-function monotonicity theorems. We also consider the holographic description of the Lifshitz theory. In order to match with the field theory result for the entanglement entropy, we propose a $z$-dependent radius scale for the Lifshitz background. This relation is consistent with the $z$-dependent scaling symmetry respected by the Lifshitz vacuum. Furthermore, the time-like entanglement entropy is determined using holography. Our result suggests that there should exist a fundamental definition of time-like entanglement other than employing analytic continuation as performed in relativistic field theory.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the spectral parameter and renormalisation of integrable $\sigma$-models</title>

Abstract: In the past few years, the unifying frameworks of 4-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and affine Gaudin models have allowed for the systematic construction of a large family of integrable $\sigma$-models. These models depend on the data of a Riemann surface $C$ (here of genus 0 or 1) and of a meromorphic 1-form $\omega$ on $C$, which encodes the geometry of their spectral parameter and the analytic structure of their Lax connection. The main subject of this paper is the renormalisation of these theories and in particular two conjectures describing their 1-loop RG-flow in terms of the 1-form $\omega$. These conjectures were put forward in [2010.07879] and [2106.09781] and were proven in a variety of cases. After extending the proposal of [2010.07879] to the elliptic setup (with $C$ of genus 1), we establish the equivalence of these two conjectures and discuss some of their applications. Moreover, we check their veracity on an explicit example, namely an integrable elliptic deformation of the Principal Chiral Model on $\text{SL}_N(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Classical Observables using Exponentiated Spin factors: Electromagnetic Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [arXiv:1906.10100], the authors argued that the Newman-Janis algorithm on the space of classical solutions in general relativity and electromagnetism could be used in the space of scattering amplitudes to map an amplitude with external scalar states to an amplitude associated to the scattering of "infinite spin particles". The minimal coupling of these particles to the gravitational or Maxwell field is equivalent to the classical coupling of the Kerr black hole with linearized gravity or the so-called $\sqrt{\text{Kerr}}$ charged state with the electromagnetic field. The action of the Newman-Janis mapping on scattering amplitudes was then used to compute the linear impulse at first post-Minkowskian (1PM) order, via the Kosower, Maybee, O'Connell (KMOC) formalism. In this paper, we continue with the idea of using the Newman-Janis mapping on the space of scalar QED amplitudes to compute classical observables such as the radiative gauge field and the angular impulse. We show that for tree-level amplitudes, the Newman-Janis action can be reinterpreted as a dressing of the photon propagator. This turns out to be an efficient way to compute these classical observables. Along the way, we highlight a subtlety that arises in proving the conservation of angular momentum for scalar -$\sqrt{\text{Kerr}}$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Ward Identities for Superamplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Ward identities for superamplitudes in D-dimensional N-extended supergravities. These identities help to clarify the relation between linearized superinvariants and superamplitudes. The solutions of these Ward identities for an $n$-partice superamplitude take a simple universal form for half-BPS and non-BPS amplitudes. These solutions involve arbitrary functions of spinor helicity and Grassmann variables for each of the $n$ superparticles. The dimension of these functions at a given loop order is exactly the same as the dimension of the relevant superspace Lagrangians depending on half-BPS or non-BPS superfields, given by $(D-2) L +2- N$ or $(D-2) L +2- 2 N$, respectively. This explains why soft limits predictions from superamplitudes and from superspace linearized superinvariants agree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing the quantum sine-Gordon and sausage models, we construct exact S-matrices for higher spin representations with quantum U_q(su(2)) symmetry, which satisfy unitarity, crossing-symmetry, and the Yang-Baxter equations with minimality assumption, i.e. without any unnecessary CDD factor. The deformation parameter q is related to a coupling constant. Based on these S-matrices, we derive the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations for q a root of unity in terms of a universal kernel where the nodes are connected by graphs of non-Dynkin type. We solve these equations numerically to find out Hagedorn-like singularities in the free energies at some critical scales and find a universality in the critical exponents, all near 0.5 for different values of the spin and the coupling constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay between magic and entanglement in quantum many-body systems. We show that non-local magic, which is supported by the quantum correlations is lower bounded by the non-flatness of entanglement spectrum and upper bounded by the amount of entanglement in the system. We then argue that a smoothed version of non-local magic bounds the hardness of classical simulations for incompressible states. In conformal field theories, we conjecture that the non-local magic should scale linearly with entanglement entropy but sublinearly when an approximation of the state is allowed. We support the conjectures using both analytical arguments based on unitary distillation and numerical data from an Ising CFT. If the CFT has a holographic dual, then we prove that the non-local magic vanishes if and only if there is no gravitational back-reaction. Furthermore, we show that non-local magic is approximately equal to the rate of change of the minimal surface area in response to the change of cosmic brane tension in the bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a simplified model of double scaled SYK (DSSYK) in which the Hamiltonian is the position operator of the Harmonic oscillator. This model captures the high temperature limit of DSSYK but could also be defined as a quantum theory in its own right. We study properties of the emergent geometry including its dynamics in response to inserting matter particles. In particular, we find that the model displays de Sitter-like properties such as that infalling matter reduces the rate of growth of geodesic slices between the two boundaries. The simplicity of the model allows us to compute the full generating functional for correlation functions of the length mode or any number of matter operators. We provide evidence that the effective action of the geodesic length between boundary points is non-local. Furthermore, we use the on-shell solution for the geodesic lengths between any two boundary points to reconstruct an effective bulk metric and reverse engineer the dilaton gravity theory that generates this metric as a solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore compactifications of the form of three tori with general genus and one circle in the framework of 11D supergravity. By imposing suitable gauge conditions and boundary conditions, we find that the four-dimensional FRW universe emerges as a solution representing cosmological D3-branes in the eleven-dimensional bulk. These specific compactification methods can produce cosmological inflation that aligns with the observational constraints set by the 2021 BICEP/Keck and Planck 2018 results. In the cosmological inflation models we construct, the inflaton can be interpreted as the conformal vibrations of extra dimensions with a size around 10^5 times the reduced Planck length. Additionally, we offer the theoretical predictions for the mass of the inflaton, and the tree-level Newton's gravity law between two massive point particles surrounded by a spherically symmetric distribution of the inflaton, which can reproduce the Tully-Fisher relation and explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an off-shell $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal cubic vertex for the hypermultiplet coupled to an arbitrary integer higher spin ${\bf s}$ gauge $\mathcal{N}=2$ supermultiplet % in flatfour-dimensional space. in a general $\mathcal{N}=2$ conformal supergravity background. We heavily use $\mathcal{N}=2, 4D$ harmonic superspace that provides an unconstrained superfield Lagrangian description. We start with $\mathcal{N}=2$ global superconformal symmetry transformations of the free hypermultiplet model and require invariance of the cubic vertices of general form under these transformations and their gauged version. As a result, we deduce $\mathcal{N}=2, 4D$ unconstrained analytic superconformal gauge potentials for an arbitrary integer ${\bf s}$. These are the basic ingredients of the approach under consideration. We describe the properties of the gauge potentials, derive the corresponding superconformal and gauge transformation laws, and inspect the off-shell contents of the thus obtained $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin ${\bf s}$ multiplets in the Wess-Zumino gauges. The spin ${\bf s}$ multiplet involves $8(2{\bf s} -1)_B + 8(2{\bf s}-1)_F$ essential off-shell degrees of freedom. The cubic vertex has the generic structure higher spin gauge superfields $\times$ hypermultiplet supercurrents. We present the explicit form of the relevant supercurrents.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Family of Integrable Sigma Models Using Auxiliary Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of sigma models in two spacetime dimensions which are parameterized by an interaction function of one real variable. In addition to the physical group-valued field $g$, these models include an auxiliary vector field $v_\alpha$ which mediates interactions in a prescribed way. We prove that every model in this family is weakly integrable, in the sense that the classical equations of motion are equivalent to flatness of a Lax connection for any value of a spectral parameter. We also show that these models are strongly integrable, in the sense that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, which guarantees the existence of an infinite set of conserved charges in involution. This class of theories includes the principal chiral model (PCM) and all deformations of the PCM by functions of the energy-momentum tensor, such as $T \overline{T}$ and root-$T \overline{T}$.</description>

Abstract: We study various aspects of capacity of entanglement in the squeezed states of a scalar field theory. This quantity is a quantum informational counterpart of heat capacity and characterizes the width of the eigenvalue spectrum of the reduced density matrix. In particular, we carefully examine the dependence of capacity of entanglement and its universal terms on the squeezing parameter in the specific regimes of the parameter space. Remarkably, we find that the capacity of entanglement obeys a volume law in the large squeezing limit. We discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including entanglement and Renyi entropies. We also comment on the existence of consistent holographic duals for a family of Gaussian states with generic squeezing parameter based on the ratio of entanglement entropy and the capacity of entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the decoherence caused by photon emission for a charged particle travelling through an interferometer; the decoherence rate gives a quantitative measure of how much "which-path" quantum information is gained by the electromagnetic field. We isolate the quantum information content of both leading and sub-leading soft photons, and show that it can be extracted entirely from information about the endpoints of the particle's paths. When infrared dressing is used to cure the infrared divergences in the theory, the leading order soft photons then give no contribution to decoherence, and carry no quantum information. The sub-leading soft photons in contrast may carry finite which-path information, and the sub-leading contribution to decoherence takes an extremely simple, time-independent form depending only on the size of the interferometer. An interesting open question is whether or not dressing should also be applied at sub-leading order; we discuss the possibility of answering this question experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16709v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models have been proposed to address various shortcomings of the standard cosmological model, such as the ``Hubble tension.'' These models often have an impact on the discrepancy in the amplitude of matter clustering, the ``$\sigma_8$-tension.'' To explore the interplay between the two tensions, we suggest a simple method to visualize the relation between the two parameters: $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$. For a given extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model and dataset, we plot the relation between $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ for different amplitudes of the beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics. In this work, we use this visualization method to illustrate the trend of selected cosmological models, including nonminimal Higgs-like inflation, early dark energy, a varying effective electron mass, an extra number of relativistic species and modified dark energy models. Although already studied in the literature, some of these models have not been analyzed in view of the two joint tensions. We stress that the method used here could be a useful diagnostic tool to illustrate the behavior of complex cosmological models with many parameters in the context of the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The novel concept of entanglement renormalization and its corresponding tensor network renormalization technique have been highly successful in developing a controlled real space renormalization group (RG) scheme. Numerically approximate fixed-point (FP) tensors are widely used to extract the conformal data of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT) describing critical phenomena. In this paper, we present an explicit analytical construction of the FP tensor for 2D rational CFT. We define it as a correlation function between the "boundary-changing operators" on triangles. Our construction fully captures all the real-space RG conditions. We also provide a concrete example using the Ising model to compute the scaling dimensions explicitly based on the corresponding FP tensor. Interestingly, our construction of FP tensors is closely related to a strange correlator, where the holographic picture naturally emerges. Our results also open a new door towards understanding CFT in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate production of non-thermal dark matter particles and heavy sterile neutrinos from inflaton during the reheating era, which is preceded by a slow-roll inflationary epoch with a quartic potential and non-minimal coupling ($\xi$) between inflaton and gravity. We compare our analysis between metric and Palatini formalism. For the latter, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, decreases with $\xi$. We find that for $\xi=0.5$ and number of $e$-folds $\sim 60$, $r$ can be as small as $\sim {\cal O}\left(10^{-3}\right)$ which may be validated at future reaches of upcoming CMB observation such as CMB-S4 etc. We identify the permissible range of Yukawa coupling $y_\chi$ between inflaton and fermionic DM $\chi$, to be ${\cal O}\left(10^{-3.5}\right)\gtrsim y_\chi \gtrsim {\cal O}\left(10^{-20}\right)$ for metric formalism and ${\cal O}\left(10^{-4}\right)\gtrsim y_\chi \gtrsim {\cal O}\left(10^{-11}\right)$ for Palatini formalism which is consistent with current PLANCK data and also within the reach of future CMB experiments. For the scenario of leptogenesis via the decay of sterile neutrinos produced from inflaton decay, we also investigate the parameter space involving heavy neutrino mass $M_{N_1}$ and Yukawa coupling $y_{N_1}$ of sterile neutrino with inflaton, which are consistent with current CMB data and successful generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis. In contrast to metric formalism, in the case of Palatini formalism, for successful leptogenesis to occur, we find that $y_{N_1}$ has a very narrow allowable range and is severely constrained from the consistency with CMB predictions.</description>

      <title>Blackbody heat capacity at constant pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At first glance, the title of this work seems to be improper. And the reason is well known. Since blackbody pressure depends only on temperature, one cannot take the derivative of the thermodynamic quantities with respect to one of them, keeping the other constant. That is, the heat capacity at constant pressure, $C_{P}$, as well as, the coefficient of thermal expansion, $\alpha$, and the isothermal compressibility, $\kappa_{T}$, are ill-defined quantities. This work will show that when the perfect conducting nature of the walls of a blackbody cavity is taken into account, $C_{P}$, $\alpha$ and $\kappa_{T}$ are in fact well defined, and they are related by the usual thermodynamic relations, as expected. Two geometries will be considered, namely, a spherical shell and a cubic box. It will be shown that $C_{P}$, $\alpha$ and $\kappa_{T}$ depend very much on the geometry of the cavity. Issues regarding thermodynamic stability will be addressed, revealing that they also depend on the cavity's geometry. It is argued that these findings may be amenable to experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous reweighting of Transverse Momentum Dependent distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bayesian reweighting procedure is extended to the case of multiple independent extractions of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs). By exploiting the data on transverse single spin asymmetries, $A_N$, for inclusive pion production in polarized proton-proton collisions measured at RHIC, we perform a simultaneous reweighting of the quark Sivers, transversity and Collins TMD functions extracted from semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and $e^+ e^-$ annihilation into hadron pairs. The impact of the implementation of the Soffer bound, as well as the differences between older and newer $A_N$ data, are investigated. The agreement with $A_N$ data at large-$x_F$ values, a kinematical region complementary to those explored in SIDIS measurements, is enhanced, improving the knowledge of the polarized quark TMDs in the large-$x$ region.</description>

      <title>Introductory visual lecture on QCD at large-$N_{c}$: bound states, chiral models, and phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these lectures, we present the behavior of conventional $\bar{q}q$ mesons, glueballs, and hybrids in the large-$N_{c}$ limit of QCD. To this end, we use an approach based on rather simple NJL-like bound-state equations. The obtained large-$N_{c}$ scaling laws are general and coincide with the known results. A series of consequences, such as the narrowness of certain mesons and the smallness of some interaction types, the behavior of chiral and dilaton models at large-$N_{c},$ and the relation to the compositeness condition and the standard derivation of large-$N_{c}$ results, are explained. The bound-state formalism shows also that mesonic molecular and dynamically generated states do not form in the large-$N_{c}$ limit. The same fate seems to apply also for tetraquark states, but here further studies are needed. Next, following the same approach, baryons are studied as bound states of a generalized diquark ($N_{c}-1$ antisymmetric object) and a quark. Similarities and differences with regular mesons are discussed. All the standard scaling laws for baryons and their interaction with mesons are correctly reproduced. The behavior of chiral models involving baryons and describing chirally invariant mass generation is investigated. Finally, properties of QCD in the medium at large-$N_{c}$ are studied: the deconfinement phase transition is investigated along the temperature and the chemical potential directions, respectively. Within the QCD phase diagrams, the features of different models at large-$N_{c}$ are reviewed and the location of the critical endpoint is discussed. In the end, the very existence of nuclei and the implications of large-$N_{c}$ arguments for neutron stars are outlined.</description>

      <title>Is the effective potential, effective for dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We critically examine the applicability of the effective potential within dynamical situations and find, in short, that the answer is negative. An important caveat of the use of an effective potential in dynamical equations of motion is an explicit violation of energy conservation.
  An \emph{adiabatic} effective potential is introduced in a consistent quasi-static approximation, and its narrow regime of validity is discussed. Two ubiquitous instances in which even the adiabatic effective potential is not valid in dynamics are studied in detail: parametric amplification in the case of oscillating mean fields, and spinodal instabilities associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. In both cases profuse particle production is directly linked to the failure of the effective potential to describe the dynamics. We introduce a consistent, renormalized, energy conserving dynamical framework that is amenable to numerical implementation. Energy conservation leads to the emergence of asymptotic highly excited, entangled stationary states from the dynamical evolution. As a corollary, decoherence via dephasing of the density matrix in the adiabatic basis is argued to lead to an emergent entropy, formally equivalent to the entanglement entropy. The results suggest novel characterization of asymptotic equilibrium states in terms of order parameter vs. energy density.</description>

      <title>Illustrating the Categorical Landau Paradigm in Lattice Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the concept of global symmetry extended to non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries, for which composition of symmetry generators is not necessarily invertible. Such non-invertible symmetries lead to a generalization of the standard Landau paradigm. In this work we substantiate this framework by providing a (1+1)d lattice model, whose gapped phases and phase transitions can only be explained by symmetry breaking of non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Alleviating $H_0$ and $S_8$ Tensions Simultaneously in K-essence Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work begins by examining the early-Universe inflationary epoch of a special K-essence model, which incorporates a linear coupling term between the scalar field potential and the canonical Lagrangian. For the power law potential, we both numerically and analytically prove that the inflationary parameters such as the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are compatible with the recent BICEP/Keck observations. Continuing this work, our analysis based on comparing early-Universe observations with late-Universe measurements indicates that the tension on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the growth of structure parameter $S_8$ can be alleviated simultaneously. More precisely, compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, our model can reduce $H_0$ tension to roughly $2.2 \sigma$ and the $S_8$ discrepancy diminishes to $0.82\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing in the IR limit these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</description>
