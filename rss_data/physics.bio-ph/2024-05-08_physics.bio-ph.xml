      <title>Mathematical Modeling of $^{18}$F-Fluoromisonidazole ($^{18}$F-FMISO) Radiopharmaceutical Transport in Vascularized Solid Tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $^{18}$F-Fluoromisonidazole ($^{18}$F-FMISO) is a highly promising positron emission tomography radiopharmaceutical for identifying hypoxic regions in solid tumors. This research employs spatiotemporal multi-scale mathematical modeling to explore how different levels of angiogenesis influence the transport of radiopharmaceuticals within tumors. In this study, two tumor geometries with heterogeneous and uniform distributions of capillary networks were employed to incorporate varying degrees of microvascular density. The synthetic image of the heterogeneous and vascularized tumor was generated by simulating the angiogenesis process. The proposed multi-scale spatiotemporal model accounts for intricate physiological and biochemical factors within the tumor microenvironment, such as the transvascular transport of the radiopharmaceutical agent, its movement into the interstitial space by diffusion and convection mechanisms, and ultimately its uptake by tumor cells. Results showed that both quantitative and semi-quantitative metrics of $^{18}$F-FMISO uptake differ spatially and temporally at different stages during tumor growth. The presence of a high microvascular density in uniformly vascularized tumor increases cellular uptake, as it allows for more efficient release and rapid distribution of radiopharmaceutical molecules. This results in enhanced uptake compared to the heterogeneous vascularized tumor. In both heterogeneous and uniform distribution of microvessels in tumors, the diffusion transport mechanism has a more pronounced than convection. The findings of this study shed light on the transport phenomena behind $^{18}$F-FMISO radiopharmaceutical distribution and its delivery in the tumor microenvironment, aiding oncologists in their routine decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Homeostasis in Input-Output Networks: Structure, Classification and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homeostasis is concerned with regulatory mechanisms, present in biological systems, where some specific variable is kept close to a set value as some external disturbance affects the system. Mathematically, the notion of homeostasis can be formalized in terms of an input-output function that maps the parameter representing the external disturbance to the output variable that must be kept within a fairly narrow range. This observation inspired the introduction of the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis, namely, the derivative of the input-output function is zero at an isolated point. This point of view allows for the application of methods from singularity theory to characterize infinitesimal homeostasis points (i.e. critical points of the input-output function). In this paper we review the infinitesimal approach to the study of homeostasis in input-output networks. An input-output network is a network with two distinguished nodes `input' and `output', and the dynamics of the network determines the corresponding input-output function of the system. This class of dynamical systems provides an appropriate framework to study homeostasis and several important biological systems can be formulated in this context. Moreover, this approach, coupled to graph-theoretic ideas from combinatorial matrix theory, provides a systematic way for classifying different types of homeostasis (homeostatic mechanisms) in input-output networks, in terms of the network topology. In turn, this leads to new mathematical concepts, such as, homeostasis subnetworks, homeostasis patterns, homeostasis mode interaction. We illustrate the usefulness of this theory with several biological examples: biochemical networks, chemical reaction networks (CRN), gene regulatory networks (GRN), Intracellular metal ion regulation and so on.</description>

      <title>Exact calculation of the probabilities of rare events in cluster-cluster aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an action formalism to calculate probabilities of rare events in cluster-cluster aggregation for arbitrary collision kernels and establish a pathwise large deviation principle with total mass being the rate. As an application, the rate function for the number of surviving particles as well as the optimal evolution trajectory are calculated exactly for the constant, sum and product kernels. For the product kernel, we argue that the second derivative of the rate function has a discontinuity. The theoretical results agree with simulations tailored to the calculation of rare events.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity by Strong Electron Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity is a spin-splitting phenomenon from a helical structure with a considerably effective spin-orbit coupling. This unexpectedly large spin-splitting phenomenon has been experimentally observed in chiral organic molecules, which typically show a weak spin-orbit coupling. To understand this, we use the renormalized mean-field theory and Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formulas to study the transport properties of single-stranded DNA in the presence of strong electron correlation. It shows a significant spin polarization of 46.5% near the Coulomb repulsion limit, which explains the extremely high spin polarization observed in experiments. Compared to systems without electron correlation, the averaged spin polarization in this case is 2 to 4 times greater across various system sizes. Furthermore, the parameter dependence of the spin polarization and the underlying Metal-Insulator transition are studied.</description>

      <title>Statistical estimation theory detection limits for label-free imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of label-free microscopy techniques has significantly improved our ability to precisely characterize biochemical targets, enabling non-invasive visualization of cellular organelles and tissue organization. Each label-free method has specific benefits, drawbacks, and varied varied sensitivity under measurement conditions across different types of specimens. To link all these disparate label-free optical interactions together and to compare detection sensitivity of these modalities, we investigate their sensitivity within the framework of statistical estimation theory. This paper introduces a comprehensive unified framework for evaluating the bounds for signal detection with label-free microscopy methods, including second harmonic generation (SHG), third harmonic generation (THG), coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), coherent Stokes Raman scattering (CSRS), stimulated Raman loss (SRL), stimulated Raman gain (SRG), stimulated emission (SE), impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS), transient absorption (TA), and photothermal effect (PTE). A general model for signal generation induced by optical scattering is developed. Based on this model, the information obtained is quantitatively analyzed using Fisher information, and the fundamental constraints on estimation precision are evaluated through the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB).</description>

      <title>In silico reproduction of the pathophysiology of in-stent restenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of in-stent restenosis following percutaneous coronary intervention highlights the need for the creation of computational tools that can extract pathophysiological insights and optimize interventional procedures on a patient-specific basis. In light of this, a comprehensive framework encompassing multiple physical phenomena is introduced in this work. This framework effectively captures the intricate interplay of chemical, mechanical, and biological factors. In addition, computational approaches for the extraction of hemodynamic indicators that modulate the severity of the restenotic process are devised. Thus, this marks a significant stride towards facilitating computer-assisted clinical methodologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Decoherence and Memory Effects in Green Fluorescent Proteins by Dielectric Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the dynamical decoherence of the chromophores within a green fluorescent protein when coupled to a finite-temperature dielectric environment. Such systems are of significant interest due to their anomalously long coherence lifetimes compared to other biomolecules. We work within the spin-boson model and employ the Hierarchical Equations of Motion formalism which allows for the accounting of the full non-perturbative and non-Markovian characteristics of the system dynamics. We analyse the level coherence of independent green fluorescent protein chromophores and the energy transfer dynamics in homo-dimer green fluorescent proteins, focusing on the effect of dielectric relaxation on the timescales of these systems. Using the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem, we generate spectral densities from local electric susceptibility generated from Poisson's equation and employ a Debye dielectric model for the solvent environment. For different system architectures, we identify a number of very striking features in the dynamics of the chromophore induced by the dielectric relaxation of the environment, resulting in strong memory effects that extend the coherence lifetime of the system. Remarkably, the complex architecture of the green fluorescent protein, which includes a cavity-like structure around the atomic system, is well suited to preserving the coherences in the homo-dimer system. The system dynamics generate a dynamical correlation between the coherent energy transfer between its sub-systems and the entropy production, which can lead to transient reductions in entropy, a unique feature of the non-Markovian nature of the system-environment interaction.</description>

      <title>Cooling down and waking up: feedback cooling switches an unconsciousness neural computer into a conscious quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02708v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theory of how feedback cooling in the brain reduces thermal noise to the point where macroscale quantum phenomena - crucially Bose-Einstein condensation - can operate at body temperature. It takes the core idea from Stapp that mind and brain interact via some sort of oscillator and identifies a likely candidate, neuronal arrays identified by Stapp as cortical minicolumns. Feedback cooling allows amplifiers to act like refrigerators, and when applied to minicolumns it is suggested they perform as quantum accelerators, solid-state devices able to supercharge standard computers. When the accelerator is idle, as in sleep, we have a neural computer operating unconsciously, but feedback cooling produces a Bose-Einstein condensate, quantum computation, and consciousness. The model explains how macroscale quantum phenomena can operate in a warm and noisy brain, how and why consciousness evolved, and gives insight into unconscious states like sleepwalking. The model is testable, predicting that cold states in the brain are detectable by magnetic resonance thermometry.</description>

      <title>Emergence of multiphase condensates from a limited set of chemical building blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecules composed of a limited set of chemical building blocks can co-localize into distinct, spatially segregated compartments known as biomolecular condensates. While many condensates are known to form spontaneously via phase separation, it has been unclear how immiscible condensates with precisely controlled molecular compositions assemble from a small number of chemical building blocks. We address this question by establishing a connection between the specificity of biomolecular interactions and the thermodynamic stability of coexisting condensates. By computing the minimum interaction specificity required to assemble condensates with target molecular compositions, we show how to design heteropolymer mixtures that produce compositionally complex condensates using only a small number of monomer types. Our results provide insight into how compositional specificity arises in naturally occurring multicomponent condensates and demonstrate a rational algorithm for engineering complex artificial condensates from simple chemical building blocks.</description>
