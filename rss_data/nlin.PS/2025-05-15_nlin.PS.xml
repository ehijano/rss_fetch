      <title>Subskin modes in a nonlinear non-Hermitian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subskin modes are distinct from conventional skin modes as they localize not at the system's edge but rather below the edge. Unlike skin modes, where a substantial number of them can accumulate at the boundaries of a system due to the non-Hermitian skin effect, subskin modes are typically limited to one or a few and emerge only when the size of the system and the couplings are related in a very specific way. The nonlinear interaction can lift the restrictions on the couplings for the formation of these modes. The findings reveal the potential of subskin modes for practical applications and new research in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider coherent states of weakly interacting bosons under the conditions of external resonant excitation, with a focus on a two-dimensional polariton fluid driven by a plane electromagnetic wave near the ground state. The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction.</description>

      <title>A bound state attractor in optical turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerically the nonintegrable dynamics of coherent, solitonic, nonlinear waves, in a spatially nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation relevant to realistic modelling of optical systems: the Schrodinger-Helmholtz equation. We observe a single oscillating, coherent solitary wave emerging from a variety of initial conditions. Using the direct scattering transform of the (integrable) cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation, we find that this structure is a bound state, comprising of a primary and secondary soliton whose amplitudes oscillate out of phase. We interpret this as the solitons periodically exchanging mass. We observe this bound state self-organising from a state of incoherent turbulence, and from solitonic structures launched into the system. When a single (primary) solitonic structure is launched, a resonance process between it and waves in the system generates the secondary soliton, resulting in the bound state. Further, when two solitons are initially launched, we show that they can merge if their phases are synchronised when they collide. When the system is launched from a turbulent state comprised of many initial solitons, we propose that the bound state formation is preceded a sequence of binary collisions, in which the mass is transferred on average from the weak soliton to the strong one, with occasional soliton mergers. Both processes lead to increasingly stronger and fewer dominant solitons. The final state -- a solitary double-solitonic bound state surrounded by weakly nonlinear waves -- is robust and ubiquitous. We propose that for nonlocal media, it is a more typical statistical attractor than a single-soliton attractor suggested in previous literature.</description>
