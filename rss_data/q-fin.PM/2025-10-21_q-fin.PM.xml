      <title>Spiking Neural Network for Cross-Market Portfolio Optimization in Financial Markets: A Neuromorphic Computing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-market portfolio optimization has become increasingly complex with the globalization of financial markets and the growth of high-frequency, multi-dimensional datasets. Traditional artificial neural networks, while effective in certain portfolio management tasks, often incur substantial computational overhead and lack the temporal processing capabilities required for large-scale, multi-market data. This study investigates the application of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for cross-market portfolio optimization, leveraging neuromorphic computing principles to process equity data from both the Indian (Nifty 500) and US (S&amp;P 500) markets. A five-year dataset comprising approximately 1,250 trading days of daily stock prices was systematically collected via the Yahoo Finance API. The proposed framework integrates Leaky Integrate-andFire neuron dynamics with adaptive thresholding, spike-timingdependent plasticity, and lateral inhibition to enable event-driven processing of financial time series. Dimensionality reduction is achieved through hierarchical clustering, while populationbased spike encoding and multiple decoding strategies support robust portfolio construction under realistic trading constraints, including cardinality limits, transaction costs, and adaptive risk aversion. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the SNN-based framework delivers superior risk-adjusted returns and reduced volatility compared to ANN benchmarks, while substantially improving computational efficiency. These findings highlight the promise of neuromorphic computation for scalable, efficient, and robust portfolio optimization across global financial markets.</description>

      <title>Aligning Language Models with Investor and Market Behavior for Financial Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most financial recommendation systems often fail to account for key behavioral and regulatory factors, leading to advice that is misaligned with user preferences, difficult to interpret, or unlikely to be followed. We present FLARKO (Financial Language-model for Asset Recommendation with Knowledge-graph Optimization), a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to generate asset recommendations that are both profitable and behaviorally aligned. FLARKO encodes users' transaction histories and asset trends as structured KGs, providing interpretable and controllable context for the LLM. To demonstrate the adaptability of our approach, we develop and evaluate both a centralized architecture (CenFLARKO) and a federated variant (FedFLARKO). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of combining KTO for fine-tuning of LLMs for financial asset recommendation. We also present the first use of structured KGs to ground LLM reasoning over behavioral financial data in a federated learning (FL) setting. Evaluated on the FAR-Trans dataset, FLARKO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines on behavioral alignment and joint profitability, while remaining interpretable and resource-efficient.</description>

      <title>3S-Trader: A Multi-LLM Framework for Adaptive Stock Scoring, Strategy, and Selection in Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained popularity in stock trading for their ability to process multimodal financial data. However, most existing methods focus on single-stock trading and lack the capacity to reason over multiple candidates for portfolio construction. Moreover, they typically lack the flexibility to revise their strategies in response to market shifts, limiting their adaptability in real-world trading. To address these challenges, we propose 3S-Trader, a training-free framework that incorporates scoring, strategy, and selection modules for stock portfolio construction. The scoring module summarizes each stock's recent signals into a concise report covering multiple scoring dimensions, enabling efficient comparison across candidates. The strategy module analyzes historical strategies and overall market conditions to iteratively generate an optimized selection strategy. Based on this strategy, the selection module identifies and assembles a portfolio by choosing stocks with higher scores in relevant dimensions. We evaluate our framework across four distinct stock universes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) constituents and three sector-specific stock sets. Compared with existing multi-LLM frameworks and time-series-based baselines, 3S-Trader achieves the highest accumulated return of 131.83% on DJIA constituents with a Sharpe ratio of 0.31 and Calmar ratio of 11.84, while also delivering consistently strong results across other sectors.</description>

      <title>ESG Signaling on Wall Street in the AI Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I identify a new signaling channel in ESG research by empirically examining whether environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing remains valuable as large institutional investors increasingly shift toward artificial intelligence (AI). Using winsorized ESG scores of S&amp;P 500 firms from Yahoo Finance and controlling for market value of equity, I conduct cross-sectional regressions to test the signaling mechanism. I demonstrate that Environmental, Social, Governance, and composite ESG scores strongly and positively signal higher debt-to-total-capital ratio, both individually and in various combinations. My findings contribute to the growing literature on ESG investing, offering economically meaningful signaling channel with implications for long-term portfolio management amid the rise of AI.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Black-Litterman Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Black-Litterman model addresses the sensitivity issues of tra- ditional mean-variance optimization by incorporating investor views, but systematically generating these views remains a key challenge. This study proposes and validates a systematic frame- work that translates return forecasts and predictive uncertainty from Large Language Models (LLMs) into the core inputs for the Black-Litterman model: investor views and their confidence lev- els. Through a backtest on S&amp;P 500 constituents, we demonstrate that portfolios driven by top-performing LLMs significantly out- perform traditional baselines in both absolute and risk-adjusted terms. Crucially, our analysis reveals that each LLM exhibits a dis- tinct and consistent investment style which is the primary driver of performance. We found that the selection of an LLM is therefore not a search for a single best forecaster, but a strategic choice of an investment style whose success is contingent on its alignment with the prevailing market regime.

      <title>Sharp Large Deviations and Gibbs Conditioning for Threshold Models in Portfolio Credit Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain sharp large deviation estimates for exceedance probabilities in dependent triangular array threshold models with a diverging number of latent factors. The prefactors quantify how latent-factor dependence and tail geometry enter at leading order, yielding three regimes: Gaussian or exponential-power tails produce polylogarithmic refinements of the Bahadur-Rao $n^{-1/2}$ law; regularly varying tails yield index-driven polynomial scaling; and bounded-support (endpoint) cases lead to an $n^{-3/2}$ prefactor. We derive these results through Laplace-Olver asymptotics for exponential integrals and conditional Bahadur-Rao estimates for the triangular arrays. Using these estimates, we establish a Gibbs conditioning principle in total variation: conditioned on a large exceedance event, the default indicators become asymptotically i.i.d., and the loss-given-default distribution is exponentially tilted (with the boundary case handled by an endpoint analysis). As illustrations, we obtain second-order approximations for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, clarifying when portfolios operate in the genuine large-deviation regime. The results provide a transferable set of techniques-localization, curvature, and tilt identification-for sharp rare-event analysis in dependent threshold systems.</description>
