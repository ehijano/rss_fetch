      <title>On strong sharp phase transition in the random connection model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random connection model (RCM) $\xi$ driven by a Poisson process $\eta$. We derive exponential moment bounds for an arbitrary cluster, provided that the intensity $t$ of $\eta$ is below a certain critical intensity $t_T$. The associated subcritical regime is characterized by a finite mean cluster size, uniformly in space. Under an exponential decay assumption on the connection function, we also show that the cluster diameters are exponentially small as well. In the important stationary marked case and under a uniform moment bound on the connection function, we show that $t_T$ coincides with $t_c$, the largest $t$ for which $\xi$ does not percolate. In this case, we also derive some percolation mean field bounds. These findings generalize some of the recent results. Even in the classical unmarked case, our results are more general than what has been previously known. Our proofs are partially based on some stochastic monotonicity properties, which might be of interest in their own right.</description>

      <title>Moderate Deviation Principles for Stochastic Differential Equations in Fast-Varying Markovian Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we proved moderate deviation principles for a fully coupled two-time-scale stochastic systems, where the slow process is given by stochastic differential equations with small noise, while the fast process is a rapidly changing purely jump process on finite state space. The system is fully coupled in that the drift and diffusion coefficients of the slow process, as well as the jump distribution of the fast process, depend on states of both processes. Moreover, the diffusion component in the slow process can be degenerate. Our approach is based on the combination of the weak convergence method from [A. Budhiraja, P. Dupuis, and A. Ganguly, Electron. J. Probab. 23 (2018), pp. 1-33; Ann. Probab. 44 (2016), pp. 1723-1775] with Poisson equation for the fast-varying purely jump process.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Reflected Langevin Diffusion for Constrained Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the Langevin diffusion confined to a closed, convex domain $D\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, represented as a reflected stochastic differential equation. We introduce a sequence of penalized stochastic differential equations and prove that their invariant measures converge, in Wasserstein-2 distance and with explicit polynomial rate, to the invariant measure of the reflected Langevin diffusion. We also analyze a time-discretization of the penalized process obtained via the Euler-Maruyama scheme and demonstrate the convergence to the original constrained measure. These results provide a rigorous approximation framework for reflected Langevin dynamics in both continuous and discrete time.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a form of master loop equations for the lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with structure group $SO(N)$, $U(N)$ or $SU(N)$. Compared to the pure Yang-Mills setting, several new operations arise. In fact, to obtain a closed recursion we must broaden the class of observables to include open Wilson lines. Our approach is based on the conditional Langevin dynamic and yields a concise proof via It\^o's formula.</description>

      <title>Rough differential equations and reduced rough paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the existence and uniqueness of solutions for rough differential equations driven by reduced rough paths with low regularity, specifically in the roughness regime $\frac{1}{3} &lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$. While the well-posedness of rough differential equations driven by classical rough paths in this regime is known, the reduced structure presents unique analytical challenges that fall outside the scope of classical theories. By formulating the problem within a suitably constructed Banach space of controlled paths, we implement a fixed point argument based on the Banach contraction principle. This approach provides a direct and self-contained proof, offering a clear and concise alternative to the more intricate machinery of the classical theory of rough differential equations. Our work thus provides a streamlined framework for analyzing this important class of rough equations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of the critical density of activated random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the critical density of the activated random walk model as the sleep rate $\lambda$ tends to $0$ and $\infty$. For large $\lambda$, we prove new lower bounds in dimensions 1 and 2, showing that in one dimension the critical density approaches $1$ superpolynomially fast. For small $\lambda$, we prove a new lower bound in two dimensions for how fast the critical density vanishes. We also obtain the first-order approximation for transient walks in both regimes.</description>

      <title>Peng's Maximum Principle for Stochastic Delay Differential Equations of Mean-Field Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Peng's maximum principle to the case of stochastic delay differential equations of mean-field type. More precisely, the coefficients of our control problem depend on the state, on the past trajectory and on its expected value. Moreover, the control enters the noise coefficient and the control domain may be non-convex. Our approach is based on a lifting of the state equation to an infinite dimensional Hilbert space that removes the explicit delay in the state equation. The main ingredient in the proof of the maximum principle is a precise asymptotic for the expectation of the first order variational process, which allows us to neglect the corresponding second order terms in the expansion of the cost functional.</description>

      <title>Fractional Diffusion Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider ``stochastic differential equations" driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H (1/4 &lt;H&lt; 1). Their solutions are sometimes called fractional diffusion processes. The main purpose of this paper is conditioning these processes to reach a given terminal point. We call the conditioned processes fractional diffusion bridges. Our main tool for mathematically rigorous conditioning is quasi-sure analysis, which is a potential theoretic part of Malliavin calculus. We also prove a small-noise large deviation principle of Freidlin-Wentzell type for scaled fractional diffusion bridges under a mild ellipticity assumption on the coefficient vector fields.</description>

      <title>Inversions of stochastic processes from ergodic measures of Nonlinear SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a novel class of inverse problems for stochastic dynamics: Given the ergodic invariant measure of a stochastic process governed by a nonlinear stochastic ordinary or partial differential equation (SODE or SPDE), we investigate the unique identifiability of the underlying process--specifically, the recovery of its drift and diffusion terms. This stands in contrast to the classical problem of statistical inference from trajectory data. We establish unique identifiability results under several key scenarios, including cases with both multiplicative and additive noise, for both finite- and infinite-dimensional systems. Our analysis leverages the intrinsic structure of the governing equations and their quantitative relationship with the ergodic measure, thereby transforming the identifiability problem into a uniqueness issue for the solutions to the associated stationary Fokker-Planck equations. This approach reveals fundamental differences between drift and diffusion inversion problems and provides counterexamples where unique recovery fails. This work lays the theoretical foundation for a new research direction with significant potential for practical application.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic stochastic areas on quaternionic full flag manifolds and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a Brownian motion on the quaternionic full flag manifold can be represented as a matrix-valued diffusion obtained in a simple way from a symplectic Brownian motion. By relating its radial dynamics to the Brownian motion on the quaternionic sphere, an explicit formula for the characteristic function of the joint distribution of the quaternionic stochastic areas is obtained. The limit law of these quaternionic stochastic areas is shown to be a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean and non-diagonal covariance matrix. These results are subsequently applied to establish new results about simultaneous quaternionic windings on the quaternionic spheres.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limits of Line Models in Degenerate Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a 2-dimensional model of random walk in random environment known as line model. The environment is described by two independent families of i.i.d. random variables dictating rates of jumps in vertical, respectively horizontal directions, and whose values are constant along vertical, respect. horizontal lines. When jump rates are heavy-tailed in one of the directions, we prove that the random walk becomes superdiffusive in that direction, with an explicit scaling limit written as a two-dimensional Brownian motion time-changed (in one of the components) by a process introduced by Kesten and Spitzer in 1979. In the case of a fully degenerate environment, a sufficient condition for non-explosion is provided, and conjectures on the associated scaling limit are formulated.</description>

      <title>The Klebanov theorem for the group $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{Z}(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L. Klebanov proved the following theorem. Let $\xi_1, \dots, \xi_n$ be independent random variables. Consider linear forms $L_1=a_1\xi_1+\cdots+a_n\xi_n,$ $L_2=b_1\xi_1+\cdots+b_n\xi_n,$ $L_3=c_1\xi_1+\cdots+c_n\xi_n,$ $L_4=d_1\xi_1+\cdots+d_n\xi_n,$ where the coefficients $a_j, b_j, c_j, d_j$ are real numbers. If the random vectors $(L_1,L_2)$ and $(L_3,L_4)$ are identically distributed, then all $\xi_i$ for which $a_id_j-b_ic_j\neq 0$ for all $j=\overline{1,n}$ are Gaussian random variables. The present article is devoted to an analogue of the Klebanov theorem in the case when random variables take values in the group $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{Z}(2)$ and the coefficients of the linear forms are topological endomorphisms of this group.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study solutions of the heterogeneous diffusion process with power-law nonlinearity governed by the stochastic differential equation $\mathrm{d}X_t= |X_t|^\alpha\,\mathrm{d}B_t + \alpha\lambda |X_t|^{2\alpha-1}\operatorname{sign}(X_t)\,\mathrm{d}t$, where $\alpha\in (0,1)$ and $\lambda\in[0,1]$. The parameter $\alpha$ controls the nonlinear power-law profile of the diffusion coefficient, while the parameter $\lambda$ specifies the interpretation of the stochastic integral in the pre-equation $\dot X=|X|^\alpha\dot B$. We demonstrate that the solutions of this equation can be represented as nonlinear transformations of a skew Bessel process with dimension $\delta \in \mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Iterated sampling importance resampling with adaptive number of proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iterated sampling importance resampling (i-SIR) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm which is based on $N$ independent proposals. As $N$ grows, its samples become nearly independent, but with an increased computational cost. We discuss a method which finds an approximately optimal number of proposals $N$ in terms of the asymptotic efficiency. The optimal $N$ depends on both the mixing properties of the i-SIR chain and the (parallel) computing costs. Our method for finding an appropriate $N$ is based on an approximate asymptotic variance of the i-SIR, which has similar properties as the i-SIR asymptotic variance, and a generalised i-SIR transition having fractional `number of proposals.' These lead to an adaptive i-SIR algorithm, which tunes the number of proposals automatically during sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that our approximate efficiency and the adaptive i-SIR algorithm have promising empirical behaviour. We also present new theoretical results regarding the i-SIR, such as the convexity of asymptotic variance in the number of proposals, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Network Curvature as a Structural Driver of Dengue Spread: A Bayesian Spatial Analysis of Recife (2015-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the structural connectivity of urban road networks helps explain dengue incidence in Recife, Brazil (2015--2024). For each neighborhood, we compute the average \emph{communicability curvature}, a graph-theoretic measure capturing the ability of a locality to influence others through multiple network paths. We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($\phi \approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of McKean--Vlasov Branching Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an optimal control problem of McKean--Vlasov branching diffusion processes, in which the interaction term is determined by the marginal measure induced by all alive particles in the system. Accordingly, the value function is defined on the space of finite nonnegative measures over the Euclidean space. Within the framework of Lipschitz continuous closed-loop controls, and by using the uniqueness of solution to the associated nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation, we establish the dynamic programming principle. Further, under the regularity assumptions, we show that the value function satisfies a Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) master equation defined on the space of finite nonnegative measures. We next provide a corresponding verification theorem. Finally, we study a linear--quadratic controlled branching processes problem, for which explicit solutions are derived in terms of Riccati-type equations.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of an acceleration corrected diffusion approximation of Langevin dynamics with background flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00685v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the Langevin dynamics of inertial particles being transported by a background flow. In particular, we study an acceleration corrected advection-diffusion approximation to the Langevin dynamics, a popular approximation in the study of turbulent transport. We prove error estimates in the averaging regime in which the dimensionless relaxation timescale $\varepsilon$ is the small parameter. We show that for any finite time interval, the approximation error is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ in the strong sense and $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$ in the weak sense, whose optimality is checked against computational experiment. Furthermore, we present numerical evidence suggesting that this approximation also captures the long-time behavior of the Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Infinitely divisible privacy and beyond I: resolution of the $s^2=2k$ conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy is increasingly formalized through the lens of hypothesis testing via the robust and interpretable $f$-DP framework, where privacy guarantees are encoded by a baseline Blackwell trade-off function $f_{\infty} = T(P_{\infty}, Q_{\infty})$ involving a pair of distributions $(P_{\infty}, Q_{\infty})$. The problem of choosing the right privacy metric in practice leads to a central question: what is a statistically appropriate baseline $f_{\infty}$ given some prior modeling assumptions? The special case of Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) showed that, under compositions of nearly perfect mechanisms, these trade-off functions exhibit a central limit behavior with a Gaussian limit experiment. Inspired by Le Cam's theory of limits of statistical experiments, we answer this question in full generality in an infinitely divisible setting.
  We show that suitable composition experiments $(P_n^{\otimes n}, Q_n^{\otimes n})$ converge to a binary limit experiment $(P_{\infty}, Q_{\infty})$ whose log-likelihood ratio $L = \log(dQ_{\infty} / dP_{\infty})$ is infinitely divisible under $P_{\infty}$. Thus any limiting trade-off function $f_{\infty}$ is determined by an infinitely divisible law $P_{\infty}$, characterized by its Levy--Khintchine triplet, and its Esscher tilt defined by $dQ_{\infty}(x) = e^{x} dP_{\infty}(x)$. This characterizes all limiting baseline trade-off functions $f_{\infty}$ arising from compositions of nearly perfect differentially private mechanisms. Our framework recovers GDP as the purely Gaussian case and yields explicit non-Gaussian limits, including Poisson examples. It also positively resolves the empirical $s^2 = 2k$ phenomenon observed in the GDP paper and provides an optimal mechanism for count statistics achieving asymmetric Poisson differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Uniform measure attractors of the distribution-dependent 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by nonlinear noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uniform measure attractors of the distribution-dependent nonautonomous 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by nonlinear noise and subject to almost periodic external forcing. Owing to the distribution-dependent structure and the almost periodicity of the external forcing, the resulting solution process becomes an inhomogeneous Markov process, presenting significant analytical challenges. To overcome these difficulties, we propose sufficient conditions on the time-dependent external forcing and distribution-dependent nonlinear terms, and develop novel analytical estimates. As a result, we establish the existence and uniqueness of uniform measure attractors for the system. Notably, the joint continuity of the family of processes is achieved without relying on the Feller property of $\{P^{(g,h)}{(\tau,t)}\}_{\tau\leq t}$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Distributionally Robust Merton Problem with Nonlinear Wasserstein Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Merton's continuous-time portfolio selection through a data-driven, distributionally robust lens. Our aim is to tap the benefits of frequent trading over short horizons while acknowledging that drift is hard to pin down, whereas volatility can be screened using realized or implied measures for appropriately selected assets. Rather than time-rectangular distributional robust control -- which replenishes adversarial power at every instant and induces over-pessimism -- we place a single ambiguity set on the drift prior within a Bayesian Merton model. This prior-level ambiguity preserves learning and tractability: a minimax swap reduces the robust control to optimizing a nonlinear functional of the prior, enabling Karatzas and Zhao \cite{KZ98}-type's closed-form evaluation for each candidate prior. We then characterize small-radius worst-case priors under Wasserstein uncertainty via an explicit asymptotically optimal pushforward of the nominal prior, and we calibrate the ambiguity radius through a nonlinear Wasserstein projection tailored to the Merton functional. Synthetic and real-data studies demonstrate reduced pessimism relative to DRC and improved performance over myopic DRO-Markowitz under frequent rebalancing.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds for expected propagation time of probabilistic zero forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the probabilistic zero forcing process, a probabilistic variant of the classical zero forcing process. We show that for every connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, there exists an initial set consisting of a single vertex such that the expected propagation time is $n/2 + O(1)$. This result is tight and confirms a conjecture posed by Narayanan and Sun. Additionally, we show tight bounds on the probabilistic throttling number, which captures the trade-off between the size of the initial set and the speed of propagation. Namely, we show that for every connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, there exists an initial set consisting of $O(\sqrt{n})$ vertices such that the expected propagation time is $O(\sqrt{n})$. This improves upon previous results by Geneson and Hogben, and confirms another conjecture by Narayanan and Sun.</description>

      <title>Around the semi-classical limit of boundary Liouville conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liouville conformal field theory describes a random geometry that fluctuates around a deterministic one: the unique solution of the problem of finding, within a given conformal class, a Riemannian metric with prescribed scalar and geodesic curvatures as well as conical singularities and corners. The level of randomness in Liouville theory is measured by the coupling constant $\gamma\in(0,2)$, the semi-classical limit corresponding to taking $\gamma\to0$.
  Based on the probabilistic definition of Liouville theory, we prove that this semi-classical limit exists and does give rise to this deterministic geometry. At second order this limit is described in terms of a massive Gaussian free field with Robin boundary conditions.
  This in turn allows to implement CFT-inspired techniques in a deterministic setting: in particular we define the classical stress-energy tensor, show that it can be expressed in terms of accessory parameters (written as regularized derivatives of the Liouville action), and that it gives rise to classical higher equations of motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the path-integral representation of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by Riemann-Liouville fractional Gaussian noise, for both the subdiffusive and superdiffusive regimes. We express the corresponding action, which is a quadratic functional of individual trajectories of the process, in two alternative but equivalent forms: either as a fractional integral or as a double integral with a nonlocal kernel. Moreover, we determine in closed form the optimal (action-minimizing) paths conditioned to reach a prescribed point at a fixed time moment and discuss their behavior, which appears to be non-intuitive for subdiffusive processes in the presence of a strong confining potential.</description>

Abstract: We show that every nearly spherical manifold can be realized as the volume-preserving image of a round sphere, via the Brenier-McCann optimal transport map. This theorem extends Caffarelli's contraction theorem to nearly spherical manifolds and yields, as a corollary, a proof of a perturbative form of Milman's conjecture. The proof is based on a novel stability result for optimal transport maps on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning for Sparse Historical Data: A Framework Integrating Bayesian Inference, Causal Models, and Game-Theoretic Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling historical events poses fundamental challenges for machine learning: extreme data scarcity (N &lt;&lt; 100), heterogeneous and noisy measurements, missing counterfactuals, and the requirement for human interpretable explanations. We present HistoricalML, a probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework that addresses these challenges through principled integration of (1) Bayesian uncertainty quantification to separate epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, (2) structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning under confounding, (3) cooperative game theory (Shapley values) for fair allocation modeling, and (4) attention based neural architectures for context dependent factor weighting. We provide theoretical analysis showing that our approach achieves consistent estimation in the sparse data regime when strong priors from domain knowledge are available, and that Shapley based allocation satisfies axiomatic fairness guarantees that pure regression approaches cannot provide. We instantiate the framework on two historical case studies: the 19th century partition of Africa (N = 7 colonial powers) and the Second Punic War (N = 2 factions). Our model identifies Germany's +107.9 percent discrepancy as a quantifiable structural tension preceding World War I, with tension factor 36.43 and 0.79 naval arms race correlation. For the Punic Wars, Monte Carlo battle simulations achieve a 57.3 percent win probability for Carthage at Cannae and 57.8 percent for Rome at Zama, aligning with historical outcomes. Counterfactual analysis reveals that Carthaginian political support (support score 6.4 vs Napoleon's 7.1), rather than military capability, was the decisive factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a second-order stochastic algorithm for solving large-scale binary classification problems. We propose to make use of a new hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm that includes two weighted components in the Hessian matrix estimation: the first one coming from the natural Hessian estimate and the second associated with the stochastic gradient information. Our motivation comes from the fact that both parts evaluated at the true parameter of logistic regression, are equal to the Hessian matrix. This new formulation has several advantages and it enables us to prove the almost sure convergence of our stochastic algorithm to the true parameter. Moreover, we significantly improve the almost sure rate of convergence to the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, we establish the central limit theorem for our hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm. Finally, we show a surprising result on the almost sure convergence of the cumulative excess risk.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free error estimate for diffusion model and optimal scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion generative models have emerged as powerful tools for producing synthetic data from an empirically observed distribution. A common approach involves simulating the time-reversal of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process initialized at the true data distribution. Since the score function associated with the OU process is typically unknown, it is approximated using a trained neural network. This approximation, along with finite time simulation, time discretization and statistical approximation, introduce several sources of error whose impact on the generated samples must be carefully understood. Previous analyses have quantified the error between the generated and the true data distributions in terms of Wasserstein distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, both metrics present limitations: KL divergence requires absolute continuity between distributions, while Wasserstein distance, though more general, leads to error bounds that scale poorly with dimension, rendering them impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we derive an explicit, dimension-free bound on the discrepancy between the generated and the true data distributions. The bound is expressed in terms of a smooth test functional with bounded first and second derivatives. The key novelty lies in the use of this weaker, functional metric to obtain dimension-independent guarantees, at the cost of higher regularity on the test functions. As an application, we formulate and solve a variational problem to minimize the time-discretization error, leading to the derivation of an optimal time-scheduling strategy for the reverse-time diffusion. Interestingly, this scheduler has appeared previously in the literature in a different context; our analysis provides a new justification for its optimality, now grounded in minimizing the discretization bias in generative sampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention continuous on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of KPZ limits arising from directed random walk models in random media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalized model of random walk in dynamical random environment, and we show that the multiplicative-noise stochastic heat equation (SHE) describes the fluctuations of the quenched density at a certain precise location in the tail. The distribution of transition kernels is fixed rather than changing under the diffusive rescaling of space-time, i.e., there is no critical tuning of the model parameters when scaling to the stochastic PDE limit. The proof is done by pushing the methods developed in [arxiv 2304.14279, arXiv 2311.09151] to their maximum, substantially weakening the assumptions and obtaining fairly sharp conditions under which one expects to see the SHE arise in a wide variety of random walk models in random media. In particular we are able to get rid of conditions such as nearest-neighbor interaction as well as spatial independence of quenched transition kernels. Moreover, we observe an entire hierarchy of moderate deviation exponents at which the SHE can be found, confirming a physics prediction of J. Hass.</description>

Abstract: We consider interacting systems particle driven by i.i.d. fractional Brownian motions, subject to irregular, possibly distributional, pairwise interactions. We show propagation of chaos and mean field convergence to the law of the associated McKean--Vlasov equation, as the number of particles $N\to\infty$, with quantitative sharp rates of order $N^{-1/2}$. Our results hold for a wide class of possibly time-dependent interactions, which are only assumed to satisfy a Besov-type regularity, related to the Hurst parameter $H\in (0,+\infty)\setminus \mathbb{N}$ of the driving noises. In particular, as $H$ decreases to $0$, interaction kernels of arbitrary singularity can be considered, a phenomenon frequently observed in regularization by noise results. Our proofs rely on a combinations of Sznitman's direct comparison argument with stochastic sewing techniques.</description>

      <title>Extending the noise of splitting to its completion and stability of Brownian maxima</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic noise of splitting, defined initially on the (basic) algebra of finite unions of intervals of the real line, is extended to a largest class of domains. The $\sigma$-fields of this largest extension constitute the completion, in the sense of noise-type Boolean algebras, of the range of the unextended (basic) noise. The basic noise extends to a given measurable domain precisely when a certain stability property is met: the times at which a Brownian motion has local maxima which fall inside the domain must remain unaffected under resampling of the Brownian increments outside the domain; together with the same being true for the complement of the domain. A set that is equal to an open set modulo a Lebesgue negligible one, with the same holding of its complement, has this stability property, but others have it too: the extension is non-trivial. Some domains are totally unstable with respect to the indicated resampling, and to them the extension cannot be made.</description>

      <title>Diffusions and random walks with prescribed sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given suitable functions $V, \Psi:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on $V,\Psi$ for the existence of a metric measure space and a symmetric diffusion process that satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates with volume growth profile $V$ and escape time profile $\Psi$. We prove sufficiency by constructing a new family of diffusions. Special cases of this construction also leads to a new family of infinite graphs whose simple random walks satisfy sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates with prescribed volume growth and escape time profiles. In particular, these random walks on graphs generalizes earlier results of Barlow who considered the case $V(r)=r^\alpha$ and $\Psi(r)=r^\beta$ (Rev Mat Iberoam 2004). The family of diffusions we construct have martingale dimension one but can have arbitrarily high spectral dimension. Therefore our construction shows the impossibility of obtaining non-trivial lower bounds on martingale dimension in terms of spectral dimension which is in contrast with upper bounds on martingale dimension using spectral dimension obtained by Hino (Probab Theory Relat Fields 2013).</description>

      <title>The circular law for random band matrices: improved bandwidth for general models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the convergence of the ESD for non-Hermitian random band matrices with independent entries to the circular law, which is the uniform measure on the unit disk in the center of the complex plane. We assume that the bandwidth of the matrix scales like $n^\gamma$ for some $\gamma\in(0,1]$, where $n$ is the matrix size, and the variance profile of the matrix is only assumed to be doubly stochastic with no additional assumption on its specific mixing properties. We prove that the circular law limit holds either (1) when $\gamma&gt;\frac{5}{6}$ and the entries are independent Gaussians, (2) or when $\gamma&gt;\frac{8}{9}$ and the entries are independent subgaussian random variables. This new threshold improves the previous threshold $\gamma&gt;\frac{32}{33}$ which was only proven for block band matrices and periodic band matrices. After the initial version of this paper, the author further extended the range of circular law for much smaller values of $\gamma$ in 2508.18143 and 2511.01744 when the variance profile has specific mixing properties, but not for an arbitrary doubly stochastic variance profile. Thus the main contribution of this paper is the circular law for a genuine power law bandwidth for any doubly stochastic variance profile. We also prove an extended form of product circular law with a growing number of matrices. Weak delocalization estimates on eigenvectors are also derived. The new technical input is new polynomial lower bounds on some intermediate small singular values, and this estimate does not depend on the specific structure of the variance profile beyond the fact that it is doubly stochastic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) for a class of exactly solvable models in the setting of a chain with left and right reservoirs. Inspired by recent results on the harmonic model, we focus on models in which the NESS is a mixture of equilibrium product measures, and where the probability measure which describes the mixture has a spatial Markovian property. We completely characterize the structure of such mixture measures, and show that under natural scaling and translation invariance properties, the only possible mixture measures are coinciding with the Dirichlet process found earlier in the context of the harmonic model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally Markov walks are natural generalizations of classical Markov chains, where instead of a particle moving independently of the past, it decides where to move next depending on the last action performed at the current location. We introduce the concept of locally Markov walks and we describe their stationary distribution and recurrent states, and we prove several properties such as irreducibility and ergodicity. For a particular locally Markov walk - the uniform unicycle walk on the complete graph - we investigate the mixing time and we prove that it exhibits cutoff.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To what extent is the underlying distribution of a finitely supported unbiased random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ determined by the sequence of times at which the walk returns to the origin? The main result of this paper is that, in various senses, most unbiased random walks on $\mathbb{Z}$ are determined up to equivalence by the sequence $I_1,I_2,I_3,\ldots$, where $I_n$ denotes the probability of being at the origin after $n$ steps. We also give an application to an inverse problem from asymptotic representation theory. The proof uses Laplace's method and a delicate Galois-theoretic analysis which ultimately depends on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Relaxation equations with stretched non-local operators: renewal and time-changed processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study renewal processes defined by means of extensions of the standard relaxation equation through ``stretched" non-local operators (of order $\alpha$ and with parameter $\gamma$). In a first case we obtain a generalization of the fractional Poisson process, which displays either infinite or finite expected waiting times between arrivals, depending on the parameter $\gamma$. Therefore, the introduction in the operator of the non-homogeneous term driven by $\gamma$ allows us to regulate the transition between different regimes of our renewal process. We then consider a second-order relaxation-type equation involving the same operator, under different sets of conditions on the constants involved; for a particular choice of these constants, we prove that the corresponding renewal process is linked to the first one by convex combination of its distributions. We also discuss alternative models related to the same equations and their time-changed representation, in terms of the inverse of a non-decreasing process which generalizes the $\alpha$-stable L\'evy subordinator.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of Euler-Maruyama scheme to the invariant probability measure under total variation distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article shows the geometric decay rate of Euler-Maruyama scheme for one-dimensional stochastic differential equation towards its invariant probability measure under total variation distance. Firstly, the existence and uniqueness of invariant probability measure and the uniform geometric ergodicity of the chain are studied through introduction of non-atomic Markov chains. Secondly, the equivalent conditions for uniform geometric ergodicity of the chain are discovered, by constructing a split Markov chain based on the original Euler-Maruyama scheme. It turns out that this convergence rate is independent with the step size under total variation distance.</description>

We first present a mathematical proof before exposing the difficulties which arise when trying to formalize it, and how they were overcome. We then build on this work to formalize the construction of the product of an arbitrary family of probability measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a new class of non-linear expectations from first-principles deterministic chaotic dynamics. The homogenization of the system's skew-adjoint microscopic generator is achieved using the spectral theory of transfer operators for uniformly hyperbolic flows. We prove convergence in the viscosity sense to a macroscopic evolution governed by a fully non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Our central result establishes that the HJB Hamiltonian possesses a rigid structure: affine in the Hessian but demonstrably non-convex in the gradient. This defines a new $\theta$-expectation and constructively establishes a class of non-convex stochastic control problems fundamentally outside the sub-additive framework of G-expectations.</description>

      <title>Infinite Interacting Brownian Motions and EVI Gradient Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition under which the time-marginal law of $\mu$-reversible infinite interacting Brownian motions is characterised as the steepest gradient descent of the relative entropy in the Wasserstein space in the sense of evolution variational inequality (EVI). This is an infinite-dimensional generalisation of Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto/Ambrosio-Gigli-Savar\'e theory. Consequently, the configuration space (the space of locally finite point measures) endowed with the reversible measure $\mu$ is an RCD space and the time-marginal law is identified to the heat flow on this space. Our result covers the infinite-dimensional Dyson Brownian motion with bulk and soft-edge limits; the latter yields Airy line ensemble as its stationary process, a central object in KPZ universality. Our result therefore provides an optimal transport characterisation of these models as Wasserstein gradient flows, and establishes a range of new functional inequalities (HWI, distorted Brunn-Minkowski, dimension-free Harnack and many others) as a corollary. As an application, we discover the new phenomena, dynamical number rigidity and dynamical tail triviality, that the time-marginal law possesses number rigidity and tail triviality for every time $t&gt;0$, revealing a propagation of random crystal and extremal structures by the Dyson Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>The Fourth-Moment Theorem on Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we establish conditions ensuring convergence in distribution of a sequence admitting a Wiener-It\^o chaos representation to a nondegenerate Gaussian measure on a separable Hilbert space. Our first main result shows that, assuming convergence of the associated covariance operators in the trace-class norm, a sequence lying in a fixed Wiener-It\^o chaos converges in distribution if and only if its fourth weak moments converge to the corresponding Gaussian moments. For general sequences with infinite chaos expansions, we derive analogous sufficient conditions for convergence in distribution. A key ingredient in our approach is a Stein-Malliavin bound formulated with respect to a distance that metrizes weak convergence of probability measures on separable Hilbert spaces. The results are infinite-dimensional extensions of the classical real-valued Fourth-Moment Theorem of Nualart and Peccati [Ann. Probab. 33, 177-193 (2005)]. Our work builds upon the work by Bourguin and Campese [Electron. J. Probab. 25, 1-30 (2020)] who claimed a Fourth-Moment Theorem in separable Hilbert spaces. However, a recent work by Bassetti, Bourguin, Campese, and Peccati [arXiv:2509.13427 (2025)] showed that the distance employed in the former article does not metrize weak convergence of probability measures on separable Hilbert spaces. Consequently, the conditions stated in Bourguin and Campese are not sufficient to recover a valid Fourth-Moment Theorem in the Hilbert-space setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We treat success runs of independent identically distributed Bernoulli trials (with success parameter $p$) distributed according to the Type II binomial distribution of order $k$. However, the success runs are separated by a gap $g\ge1$ (a failure followed by $g-1$ arbitrary outcomes). Most of the literature treats the case $g=1$ only. Our main results are expressions for the probability mass function (we present two derivations) and the distribution of the longest success run. We also present more concise expressions for previously published results for the factorial moments. We present results for the mean, variance, probability mass function and factorial moments for $\textrm{NB}_{\rm II}(k,g,r)$, the Type II negative binomial distribution of order $k$, where the number of success runs $r$ is fixed and the number of trials $n$ is variable. Let $L$ denote the length of the longest success run. We present a recurrence and generating function for the distribution of $L$ and derive expressions for the mean, variance and factorial moments of $L$.</description>

Abstract: We prove quantitative estimates on the the parabolic Green function and the stationary invariant measure in the context of stochasic homogenization of elliptic equations in nondivergence form. We consequently obtain a quenched, local CLT for the corresponding diffusion process and a quantitative ergodicity estimate for the environmental process. Each of these results are characterized by deterministic (in terms of the environment) estimates which are valid above a random, ``minimal'' length scale, the stochastic moments of which we estimate sharply.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13797v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for the martingale analogue of the Benamou-Brenier optimal transport problem, which seeks a martingale interpolating two prescribed marginals which is closest to the Brownian motion. Recent contributions have established existence and uniqueness for the optimal martingale under finite second moment assumptions on the marginals, but numerical methods exist only in the one-dimensional setting. We introduce an iterative scheme, a martingale analogue of the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm, and prove its convergence in arbitrary dimension under minimal assumptions. In particular, we show that convergence holds when the marginals have finite moments of order $p &gt; 1$, thereby extending the known theory beyond the finite-second-moment regime. The proof relies on a strict descent property for the dual value of the martingale Benamou--Brenier problem. While the descent property admits a direct verification in the case of compactly supported marginals, obtaining uniform control on the iterates without assuming compact support is substantially more delicate and constitutes the main technical challenge.</description>

Abstract: We exhibit various restrictions about the wellposedness of the Schr{\''o}dinger product $$\cl:z \longmapsto -\imath \int\_0^t e^{\imath s {\cop \partial^2\_x}}\big( z\_s\cdot \Psi\_s\big) ds $$ where $\Psi$ refers to the so-called linear solution of the stochastic Schr{\''o}dinger problem. We focus more specifically on the case where $\Psi$ satisfies \begin{equation}\label{starting-equation-abstract} (\imath \partial\_t-\partial^2\_x)\Psi=\dot{B}, \quad \Psi\_0=0,\quad \quad t\in \R, \ x\in \mathbb{T}, \end{equation} where $\dot{B}$ is a white noise in space with fractional time covariance of index $H&gt;\frac12$. \smallskip As an consequence of our analysis, we obtain that if $H$ is close to $\frac12$ (that is $\dot{B}$ is close to a space-time white noise), then it is essentially impossible to treat the stochastic NLS problem \begin{equation*} (\imath \partial\_t-\partial^2\_x)u= |u|^2+\dot{B}, \quad u\_0=0,\quad \quad t\in \R, \ x\in \mathbb{T}, \end{equation*} using only a first-order expansion of the solution (\enquote{$u=\Psi+z$}).</description>

      <title>Optimistic Estimation of Convergence in Markov Chains with the Average-Mixing Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence rate of a Markov chain to its stationary distribution is typically assessed using the concept of total variation mixing time. However, this worst-case measure often yields pessimistic estimates and is challenging to infer from observations. In this paper, we advocate for the use of the average-mixing time as a more optimistic and demonstrably easier-to-estimate alternative. We further illustrate its applicability across a range of settings, from two-point to countable spaces, and discuss some practical implications.</description>

      <title>On the Eldan-Gross inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent discovery of Eldan and Gross states that there exists a universal $C&gt;0$ such that for all Boolean functions $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to \{-1,1\}$,
  $$
  \int_{\{-1,1\}^n}\sqrt{s_f(x)}d\mu(x) \ge C\text{Var}(f)\sqrt{\log \left(1+\frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{Inf}_j(f)^2}\right)}
  $$
  where $s_f(x)$ is the sensitivity of $f$ at $x$, $\text{Var}(f)$ is the variance of $f$, $\text{Inf}_j(f)$ is the influence of $f$ along the $j$-th variable, and $\mu$ is the uniform probability measure. In this note, we give an alternative proof that applies to biased discrete hypercube, and spaces having positive Ricci curvature lower bounds in the sense of Bakry and \'Emery.</description>

      <title>The Performance Of The Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm Without Smoothness Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03458v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of sampling from distributions whose densities are not necessarily smooth nor logconcave. We propose a simple Langevin-based algorithm that does not rely on popular but computationally challenging techniques, such as the Moreau-Yosida envelope or Gaussian smoothing, and show consequently that the performance of samplers like ULA does not necessarily degenerate arbitrarily with low regularity. In particular, we show that the Lipschitz or H\"older continuity assumption can be replaced by a geometric one-sided Lipschitz condition that allows even for discontinuous log-gradients. We derive non-asymptotic guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm to the target distribution in Wasserstein distances. Non-asymptotic bounds are also provided for the performance of the algorithm as an optimizer, specifically for the solution of associated excess risk optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Control with Poissonian Common Noise: A Pathwise Compactification Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the compactification approach to study mean-field control problems with Poissonian common noise. To overcome the lack of compactness and continuity issues caused by common noise, we exploit the point process representation of the Poisson random measure with finite intensity and propose a pathwise formulation in a two-step procedure by freezing a sample path of the common noise. In the first step, we establish the existence of the optimal relaxed control in the pathwise formulation as if common noise is absent, but with finite deterministic jumping times. The second step plays the key role in our approach, which is to aggregate the optimal solutions in the pathwise formulation over all sample paths of common noise and show that it yields an optimal solution in the original model. To this end, with the help of concatenation techniques, we first develop a pathwise superposition principle in the model with deterministic jumping times, drawing a relationship between the pathwise relaxed control problem and the pathwise measure-valued control problem. As a result, we can further bridge the equivalence among different problem formulations and verify that the constructed solution under aggregation is indeed optimal in the original problem. We also extend the methodology to solve mean-field games with Poissonian common noise, confirming the existence of a strong mean field equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Approximate polymorphisms of predicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalized polymorphism of a predicate $P \subseteq \{0,1\}^m$ is a tuple of functions $f_1,\dots,f_m\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ satisfying the following property: If $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(m)} \in \{0,1\}^n$ are such that $(x^{(1)}_i,\dots,x^{(m)}_i) \in P$ for all $i$, then also $(f_1(x^{(1)}),\dots,f_m(x^{(m)})) \in P$.
  We show that if $f_1,\dots,f_m$ satisfy this property for most $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(m)}$ (as measured with respect to an arbitrary full support distribution $\mu$ on $P$), then $f_1,\dots,f_m$ are close to a generalized polymorphism of $P$ (with respect to the marginals of $\mu$).
  Our main result generalizes several results in the literature: linearity testing, quantitative Arrow theorems, approximate intersecting families, AND testing, and more generally $f$-testing.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Stochastic Approach to Quantum Advantages in Ground State and Quantum State Preparation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problems of state preparation, ground state preparation and quantum state preparation. We propose an analytic approach to a stochastic quantum algorithm which prepares the ground state for $n$-qubit Hamiltonian that is represented by $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli operators and has an inverse-polynomial gap, requiring only $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli rotations, measurements, and classical time complexity when $n$ exceeds a threshold, to inverse-polynomial precision given the initial overlap being lower bounded by $\frac{1}{2^n}$. Extending this result, we prove that any $n$-qubit quantum state can be prepared in two regimes: (1) with a constant number of Pauli rotations to constant precision, or (2) with a polynomial number of rotations to inverse-polynomial precision. Our results improve over previous approaches to quantum state preparation in terms of gate complexity, thereby yielding quantum space advantage. As an application, we identify a practical condition under which quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems can be solved with exponential quantum speedups.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the large deviations principle (which concerns sequences of exponentially small sets) for the isoperimetric problem on product Riemannian manifolds $M^{n}$ equipped with product probability measures $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $M$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying curvature-dimension bound $\mathrm{CD}(0,\infty)$. When the probability measure ${\nu}$ admits a finite moment generating function for squared distance, we establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics for the isoperimetric profile, which shows a precise equivalence between these asymptotic isoperimetric inequalities and nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities. It is observed that the product of two relative entropy typical sets (or empirically typical sets) forms an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. The proofs in this paper integrate tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

      <title>Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo and Importance Sampling for Super-Fast Growing Functions with Applications to Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many problems can be formulated as high-dimensional integrals of discontinuous functions that exhibit significant boundary growth, challenging the error analysis and applications of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods. This paper studies RQMC methods for super-fast growing functions satisfying generalized exponential growth conditions, with a special focus on financial derivative pricing. The main contribution of this paper is threefold. First, by combining RQMC with importance sampling (IS), we derive a new error bound for a class of integrands, whose values and derivatives are bounded by the critical growth function $e^{A|\boldsymbol{x}|^2}$ with $A = 1/2$. This result extends the existing results in the literature, which are limited to the case $A &lt; 1/2$. We demonstrate that by imposing a light-tailed condition on the proposal distribution of IS, RQMC can achieve an error rate of $O(n^{-1 + \epsilon})$ with a sample size n and an arbitrarily small $\epsilon &gt;0$. Second, we verify that the Gaussian proposals used in Optimal Drift Importance Sampling (ODIS) satisfy the required light-tailed condition, providing a rigorous theoretical guarantees for RQMC-ODIS in critical growth scenarios. Third, for discontinuous integrands from finance, we prove that the integrands after preintegration satisfy the exponential growth condition. This ensures that the preintegrated functions can be seamlessly incorporated into our RQMC-IS framework. Numerical experiments on financial derivative pricing validate our theory, showing that the RQMC-IS with preintegration is effective in handling problems with discontinuous payoffs, successfully achieving the expected convergence rates.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Phase Transition in Correlated Spiked Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06040v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computational task of detecting and estimating correlated signals in a pair of spiked matrices $$ X=\tfrac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}} xu^{\top}+W, \quad Y=\tfrac{\mu}{\sqrt{n}} yv^{\top}+Z $$ where the spikes $x,y$ have correlation $\rho$. Specifically, we consider two fundamental models: (1) Correlated spiked Wigner model with signal-to-noise ratio $\lambda,\mu$; (2) Correlated spiked $n*N$ Wishart (covariance) model with signal-to-noise ratio $\sqrt\lambda,\sqrt\mu$.
  We propose an efficient detection and estimation algorithm based on counting a specific family of edge-decorated cycles. The algorithm's performance is governed by the function $$ F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,\gamma)=\max\Big\{ \frac{ \lambda^2 }{ \gamma }, \frac{ \mu^2 }{ \gamma }, \frac{ \lambda^2 \rho^2 }{ \gamma-\lambda^2+\lambda^2 \rho^2 } + \frac{ \mu^2 \rho^2 }{ \gamma-\mu^2+\mu^2 \rho^2 } \Big\} \,. $$ We prove our algorithm succeeds for the correlated spiked Wigner model whenever $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,1)&gt;1$, and succeeds for the correlated spiked Wishart model whenever $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,\tfrac{n}{N})&gt;1$. Our result shows that an algorithm can leverage the correlation between the spikes to detect and estimate the signals even in regimes where efficiently recovering either $x$ from ${X}$ alone or $y$ from ${Y}$ alone is believed to be computationally infeasible.
  We complement our algorithmic results with evidence for a matching computational lower bound. In particular, we prove that when $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,1)&lt;1$ for the correlated spiked Wigner model and when $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,\tfrac{n}{N})&lt;1$ for the spiked Wishart model, all algorithms based on low-degree polynomials fails to distinguish $({X},{Y})$ with two independent noise matrices. This strongly suggests that $F=1$ is the precise computation threshold for our models.</description>

      <title>The fastest way through a traffic light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a rigorous solution of an optimisation problem of minimizing the expected delay caused by encountering a red traffic light on a road journey. The problem incorporates simple constraints on maximum speed, acceleration and braking rates, and depends on the assumed distribution of the remaining time until the traffic light will turn green, after it is first noticed. We assume that this distribution has a bounded and non-increasing density, which is natural since this holds for the law of the excess time in any stationary renewal process. In two special cases, where this distribution is either Uniform or Exponential, we give a complete characterisation of all possible combinations of phases of maximum acceleration, maximum speed, maximum braking, following an Euler--Lagrange curve, and standing stationary at the traffic light, which can make up an optimal solution. The key technique is to write the problem in terms of a two-dimensional pressure integral, so that the problem becomes analogous to filling a tank with a given quantity of liquid.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm towards multimodal distributions on Rd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an earlier joint work, we studied a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the Gibbs measure supported on torus with a non-convex energy function at a low temperature, where we proved that the time complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the inverse temperature. However, the analysis in that torus setting relied crucially on compactness and does not directly extend to unbounded domains. This work introduces a new approach that resolves this issue and establishes a similar result for sampling from Gibbs measures supported on Rd.
  In particular, our main result shows that when the energy function is double-well with equal depth, the time complexity scales as seventh power of the inverse temperature, and quadratically in both the inverse allowed absolute error and probability error.</description>
