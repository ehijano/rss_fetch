      <title>Expected biases in the distribution of consecutive primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2016 Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan examined the gaps between the first hundred million primes and observed biases in their distributions modulo 10. Given our work on the evolution of the populations of various gaps across stages of Eratosthenes sieve, the observed biases are totally expected.
  The biases observed by Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan are a wonderful example for contrasting the computational range with the asymptotic range for the populations of the gaps between primes. The observed biases are the combination of two phenomena: (a) very small gaps, say $2 \le g \le 30$, get off to quick starts and over the first 100 million primes larger gaps are too early in their evolution; and (b) the assignment of small gaps across the residue classes disadvantages some of those classes - until enormous primes, far beyond the computational range.
  For modulus 10 and a few other bases, we aggregate the gaps by residue class and track the evolution of these teams as Eratosthenes sieve continues. The relative populations across these teams start with biases across the residue classes. These initial biases fade as the sieve continues. The OS enumeration strongly agrees with a uniform sampling at the corresponding stage of the sieve. The biases persist well beyond the computational range, but they are ultimately transient.</description>

      <title>Discrete Linear Canonical Transform on Graphs: Uncertainty Principle and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With an increasing influx of classical signal processing methodologies into the field of graph signal processing, approaches grounded in discrete linear canonical transform have found application in graph signals. In this paper, we initially propose the uncertainty principle of the graph linear canonical transform (GLCT), which is based on a class of graph signals maximally concentrated in both vertex and graph spectral domains. Subsequently, leveraging the uncertainty principle, we establish conditions for recovering bandlimited signals of the GLCT from a subset of samples, thereby formulating the sampling theory for the GLCT. We elucidate interesting connections between the uncertainty principle and sampling. Further, by employing sampling set selection and experimental design sampling strategies, we introduce optimal sampling operators in the GLCT domain. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our methods through simulations and numerical experiments across applications.</description>
