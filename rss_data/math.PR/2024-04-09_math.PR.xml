      <title>On the size of temporal cliques in subcritical random temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \emph{random temporal graph} is an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$, together with a random ordering of its edges. A path in the graph is called \emph{increasing} if the edges on the path appear in increasing order. A set $S$ of vertices forms a \emph{temporal clique} if for all $u,v \in S$, there is an increasing path from $u$ to $v$. \cite{Becker2023} proved that if $p=c\log n/n$ for $c&gt;1$, then, with high probability, there is a temporal clique of size $n-o(n)$. On the other hand, for $c&lt;1$, with high probability, the largest temporal clique is of size $o(n)$. In this note we improve the latter bound by showing that, for $c&lt;1$, the largest temporal clique is of \emph{constant} size with high probability.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence between Fourier-based and Wasserstein distances for probability measures on $\mathbb N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we investigate the equivalence of Fourier-based metrics on discrete state spaces with the well-known Wasserstein distances. While the use of Fourier-based metrics in continuous state spaces is ubiquitous since its introduction by Giuseppe Toscani and his colleagues [9, 14, 16] in the study of kinetic-type partial differential equations, the introduction of its discrete analog is recent [2] and seems to be far less studied. In this work, various relations between Fourier-based metrics and Wasserstein distances are shown to hold when the state space is the set of non-negative integers $\mathbb N$. Lastly, we also describe potential applications of such equivalence of metrics in models from econophysics which motivate the present work.</description>

      <title>The convergence of the EM scheme in empirical approximation of invariant probability measure for McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the assumption of the existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDEs), a self-interacting process that depends only on the current and historical information of the solution is constructed for MV-SDEs. The convergence rate of the weighted empirical measure of the self-interacting process and the invariant measure of MV-SDEs is obtained in the W2-Wasserstein metric. Furthermore, under the condition of linear growth, an EM scheme whose uniformly 1/2-order convergence rate with respect to time is obtained is constructed for the self-interacting process. Then, the convergence rate between the weighted empirical measure of the EM numerical solution of the self-interacting process and the invariant measure of MV-SDEs is derived. Moreover, the convergence rate between the averaged weighted empirical measure of the EM numerical solution of the corresponding multi-particle system and the invariant measure of MV-SDEs in the W2-Wasserstein metric is also given. In addition, the computational cost of the two approximation methods is compared, which shows that the averaged weighted empirical approximation of the particle system has a lower cost. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Convolution powers of unbounded measures on the positive half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a right-continuous nondecreasing and unbounded function $V$ of at most exponential growth, which vanishes on the negative halfline, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the Lebesgue-Stieltjes convolution powers $V^{\ast(j)}(t)$ as both $j$ and $t$ tend to infinity. We obtain a comprehensive asymptotic formula for $V^{\ast(j)}(t)$, which is valid across different regimes of simultaneous growth of $j$ and $t$. Our main technical tool is an exponential change of measure, which is a standard technique in the large deviations theory. Various applications of our result are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concentrates on the general birth-death processes with two different types of catastrophes. The Laplace transform of transition probability function for birth-death processes with two-type catastrophes are is successfully expressed with the Laplace transform of transition probability function of the birth-death processes without catastrophe. The first effective catastrophe occurrence time is considered. The Laplace transform of its probability density function, expectation and variance are obtained.</description>

      <title>Mean field equations arising from random vortex dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Mckean-Vlasov type stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise arising from the random vortex method. Such an equation can be viewed as the mean-field limit of interacting particle systems with singular interacting kernels such as the Biot-Savart kernel. A new estimate for the transition probability density of diffusion processes will be formulated to handle the singularity of the interacting kernel. The existence and uniqueness of the weak solution of such SDEs will be established as the main result.</description>

      <title>Numerical schemes for radial Dunkl processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the numerical approximation for a class of radial Dunkl processes corresponding to arbitrary (reduced) root systems in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. This class contains some well-known processes such as Bessel processes, Dyson's Brownian motions, and Wishart processes. We propose some semi--implicit and truncated Euler--Maruyama schemes for radial Dunkl processes, and study their rate of convergence with respect to the $L^{p}$-sup norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the derivative of the intersection and self-intersection local times of alpha-stable processes are exponentially integrable for certain parameter values. This includes the Brownian motion case. We also discuss related results present in the literature for fractional Brownian motion, and in particular give a counter-example to a result in [Guo, J., Hu, Y., and Xiao, Y., Higher-order derivative of intersection local time for two independent fractional Brownian motions, Journal of Theoretical Probability 32, (2019), pp. 1190-1201] related to this question.</description>

      <title>Local sparse limit of a particle coalescence model under environmental noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of diffusions subject to common (environmental) noise is investigated. Due to the scaling limit assumptions on the common noise, a deterministic PDE limit is obtained. Particles interact by coalescence and the sparse regime of Hammond and Rezakhanlou is imposed, so that a nontrivial cell equation comes into play to determine the average coalescence rate. The corrector to the mean coalescence rate provided by that theory explains the role of turbulence in the enhancement of coalescence. Notice that classical models of particle coalescence in turbulent fluids are of inertial type, so it is a striking fact that a non-inertial model allows one to get meaningful physical results, thanks to the information contained in the corrector.</description>

      <title>Regular occupation measures of Volterra processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we give a local non-determinism condition applicable to general Volterra Ito processes that allow us to obtain the space-time regularity of the occupation measure and the self-intersection measure. For the particular case of solutions to a stochastic Volterra equation, we also obtain the regularity of the one-dimensional distributions and study the absolute continuity of the finite-dimensional distributions. Finally, based on the previously shown regularity of the self-intersection measure, we prove the existence, uniqueness and stability of Volterra equations with distributional drifts of "self-intersection" type in terms of corresponding nonlinear Young equations.</description>

      <title>New lower bounds for the (near) critical Ising and $\varphi^4$ models' two-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nearest-neighbour Ising and $\varphi^4$ models on $\mathbb Z^d$ with $d\geq 3$ and obtain new lower bounds on their two-point functions at (and near) criticality. Together with the classical infrared bound, these bounds turn into up-to constant estimates when $d\geq 5$. When $d=4$, we obtain an ''almost'' sharp lower bound corrected by a logarithmic factor. As a consequence of these results, we show that $\eta=0$ and $\nu=1/2$ when $d\geq 4$, where $\eta$ is the critical exponent associated with the decay of the model's two-point function at criticality and $\nu$ is the critical exponent of the correlation length $\xi(\beta)$. When $d=3$, we improve previous results and obtain that $\eta\leq 1/2$. As a byproduct of our proofs, we also derive the blow-up at criticality of the so-called bubble diagram when $d=3,4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that every bivariate copula induces a positive measure on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $[0,1]^2$, but there exist bivariate quasi-copulas that do not induce a signed measure on the same $\sigma$-algebra. In this paper we show that a signed measure induced by a bivariate quasi-copula can always be expressed as an infinite combination of measures induced by copulas. With this we are able to give the first characterization of measure-inducing quasi-copulas in the bivariate setting.</description>

      <title>Entropic curvature not comparable to other curvatures -- or is it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider global $\theta$-curvatures of finite Markov chains with associated means $\theta$ in the spirit of the entropic curvature (based on the logarithmic mean) by Erbar-Maas and Mielke. As in the case of Bakry-\'Emery curvature, we also allow for a finite dimension parameter by making use of an adapted $\Gamma$ calculus for $\theta$-curvatures. We prove explicit positive lower curvature bounds (both finite- and infinite-dimensional) for finite abelian Cayley graphs. In the case of cycles, we provide also an upper curvature bound which shows that our lower bounds are asymptotically sharp (up to a logarithmic factor). Moreover, we prove new universal lower curvature bounds for finite Markov chains as well as curvature perturbation results (allowing, in particular, to compare entropic and Bakry-\'Emery curvatures). Finally, we present examples where entropic curvature differs significantly from other curvature notions like Bakry-\'Emery curvature or Ollivier Ricci and sectional curvatures.</description>

      <title>Spectral Independence Beyond Total Influence on Trees and Related Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how to establish $\textit{spectral independence}$, a key concept in sampling, without relying on total influence bounds, by applying an $\textit{approximate inverse}$ of the influence matrix. Our method gives constant upper bounds on spectral independence for two foundational Gibbs distributions known to have unbounded total influences:
  $\bullet$ The monomer-dimer model on graphs with large girth (including trees). Prior to our work, such results were only known for graphs with constant maximum degrees or infinite regular trees, as shown by Chen, Liu, and Vigoda (STOC '21).
  $\bullet$ The hardcore model on trees with fugacity $\lambda &lt; \mathrm{e}^2$. This remarkably surpasses the well-known $\lambda_r&gt;\mathrm{e}-1$ lower bound for the reconstruction threshold on trees, significantly improving upon the current threshold $\lambda &lt; 1.3$, established in a prior work by Efthymiou, Hayes, \v{S}tefankovi\v{c}, and Vigoda (RANDOM '23).
  Consequently, we establish optimal $\Omega(n^{-1})$ spectral gaps of the Glauber dynamics for these models on arbitrary trees, regardless of the maximum degree $\Delta$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent seminal work of Chernozhukov, Chetverikov and Kato has shown that bootstrap approximation for the maximum of a sum of independent random vectors is justified even when the dimension is much larger than the sample size. In this context, numerical experiments suggest that third-moment match bootstrap approximations would outperform normal approximation even without studentization, but the existing theoretical results cannot explain this phenomenon. In this paper, we first show that Edgeworth expansion, if justified, can give an explanation for this phenomenon. Second, we obtain valid Edgeworth expansions in the high-dimensional setting when the random vectors have Stein kernels. Finally, we prove the second-order accuracy of a double wild bootstrap method in this setting. As a byproduct, we find an interesting blessing of dimensionality phenomenon: The single third-moment match wild bootstrap is already second-order accurate in high-dimensions if the covariance matrix is spherical.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of controlled particle systems arising in deep learning: from finite to infinite sample size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with a class of neural SDEs and studies the limiting behavior of the associated sampled optimal control problems as the sample size grows to infinity. The neural SDEs with N samples can be linked to the N-particle systems with centralized control. We analyze the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation corresponding to the N-particle system and establish regularity results which are uniform in N. The uniform regularity estimates are obtained by the stochastic maximum principle and the analysis of a backward stochastic Riccati equation. Using these uniform regularity results, we show the convergence of the minima of objective functionals and optimal parameters of the neural SDEs as the sample size N tends to infinity. The limiting objects can be identified with suitable functions defined on the Wasserstein space of Borel probability measures. Furthermore, quantitative algebraic convergence rates are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Non-concave distributionally robust stochastic control in a discrete time finite horizon setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we present a general framework for non-concave distributionally robust stochastic control problems in a discrete time finite horizon setting. Our framework allows to consider a variety of different path-dependent ambiguity sets of probability measures comprising, as a natural example, the ambiguity set defined via Wasserstein-balls around path-dependent reference measures, as well as parametric classes of probability distributions. We establish a dynamic programming principle which allows to derive both optimal control and worst-case measure by solving recursively a sequence of one-step optimization problems. As a concrete application, we study the robust hedging problem of a financial derivative under an asymmetric (and non-convex) loss function accounting for different preferences of sell- and buy side when it comes to the hedging of financial derivatives. As our entirely data-driven ambiguity set of probability measures, we consider Wasserstein-balls around the empirical measure derived from real financial data. We demonstrate that during adverse scenarios such as a financial crisis, our robust approach outperforms typical model-based hedging strategies such as the classical Delta-hedging strategy as well as the hedging strategy obtained in the non-robust setting with respect to the empirical measure and therefore overcomes the problem of model misspecification in such critical periods.</description>

      <title>Maximum likelihood estimation in continuous affine Volterra processes in the ergodic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study statistical inference of the drift parameters for the Volterra Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on R and the Volterra Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process on R+ in the ergodic regime. For continuous-time observations, we derive the corresponding maximum likelihood estimators and show that they are strongly consistent and asymptotically normal locally uniformly in the parameters. For the case of discrete high-frequency observations, we prove similar results by discretization of the continuous-time maximum likelihood estimator. Finally, for discrete low-frequency observations, we show that the method of moments is consistent. Our proofs are crucially based on the law of large numbers. To prove the latter, we introduce the notion of asymptotic independence which has the advantage that it can be effectively verified by the affine transformation formula and convergence of the characteristic function. As a side product of our results, we show that the stationary processes are ergodic.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for the finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for the finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>

      <title>BFS versus DFS for random targets in ordered trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a search from the root of an ordered tree with $n$ edges to some target node at a fixed distance $\ell$ from that root. We compare the average time complexity of the breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms, when the target node is selected uniformly at random among all nodes at level $\ell$ in the ordered trees with $n$ edges. Intuition suggests that BFS should have better average performance when $\ell$ is small, while DFS must have an advantage when $\ell$ is large. But where exactly is the threshold, as a function of $n$, and is it unique? We obtain explicit formulas for the expected number of steps of both BFS and DFS, by using results on the occupation measure of Brownian excursions, as well as a combinatorial proof of an identity related to lattice paths. This allows us to show that there exists a unique constant $\lambda\approx 0.789004$, such that in expectation BFS is asymptotically faster than DFS if and only if $\ell\leq \lambda\sqrt{n}$. Furthermore, we find the asymptotic average time complexity of BFS in the given setting for any class of Galton$\unicode{x2013}$Watson trees, including binary trees and ordered trees. Finally, we introduce the truncated DFS algorithm, which performs better than both BFS and DFS when $\ell$ is known in advance, and we find a formula evaluating the average time complexity of this algorithm.</description>

      <title>Percolation of strongly correlated Gaussian fields I. Decay of subcritical connection probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the decay of connectivity of the subcritical excursion sets of a class of strongly correlated Gaussian fields. Our main result shows that, for smooth isotropic Gaussian fields whose covariance kernel $K(x)$ is regularly varying at infinity with index $\alpha \in [0, 1)$, the probability that $\{f \le \ell\}$, $\ell &lt; \ell_c$, connects the origin to distance $R$ decays sub-exponentially in $R$ at log-asymptotic rate $c_\alpha (\ell_c-\ell)^2 / K(R)$ for an explicit $c_\alpha &gt; 0$. If $\alpha = 1$ and $\int_0^\infty K(x) dx = \infty$ then the log-asymptotic rate is $c_1 (\ell_c-\ell)^2 R (\int_0^R K(x) dx)^{-1}$, and if $\alpha &gt; 1$ the decay is exponential.
  Our findings extend recent results on the Gaussian free field (GFF) on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \ge 3$, and can be interpreted as showing that the subcritical behaviour of the GFF is universal among fields with covariance $K(x) \sim c|x|^{d-2}$. Our result is also evidence in support of physicists' predictions that the correlation length exponent is $\nu = 2/\alpha$ if $\alpha \le 1$, and in $d=2$ we establish rigorously that $\nu \ge 2/\alpha$. More generally, our approach opens the door to the large deviation analysis of a wide variety of percolation events for smooth Gaussian fields.
  This is the first in a series of two papers studying subcritical level-set percolation of strongly correlated Gaussian fields, which can be read independently.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet Heat kernel estimates for a large class of anisotropic Markov processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Z=(Z^{1}, \ldots, Z^{d})$ be the d-dimensional L\'evy {process} where {$Z^i$'s} are independent 1-dimensional L\'evy {processes} with identical jumping kernel $ \nu^1(r) =r^{-1}\phi(r)^{-1}$. Here $\phi$ is {an} increasing function with weakly scaling condition of order $\underline \alpha, \overline \alpha\in (0, 2)$. We consider a symmetric function $J(x,y)$ comparable to \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases} \nu^1(|x^i - y^i|)\qquad&amp;\text{ if $x^i \ne y^i$ for some $i$ and $x^j = y^j$ for all $j \ne i$}\\ 0\qquad&amp;\text{ if $x^i \ne y^i$ for more than one index $i$}. \end{cases} \end{align*} Corresponding to the jumping kernel $J$, there exists an anisotropic Markov process $X$, see \cite{KW22}. In this article, we establish sharp two-sided Dirichlet heat kernel estimates for $X$ in $C^{1,1}$ open set, under certain regularity conditions. As an application of the main results, we derive the Green function estimates.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the logarithmic energy for random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the semi-circle law, which is the limiting distribution in the Wigner theorem, is the minimizer of the logarithmic energy penalized by the second moment. A very similar fact holds for the Girko and Marchenko--Pastur theorems. In this work, we shed the light on an intriguing phenomenon suggesting that this functional is monotonic along the mean empirical spectral distribution in terms of the matrix dimension. This is reminiscent of the monotonicity of the Boltzmann entropy along the Boltzmann equation, the monotonicity of the free energy along ergodic Markov processes, and the Shannon monotonicity of entropy or free entropy along the classical or free central limit theorem. While we only verify this monotonicity phenomenon for the Gaussian unitary ensemble, the complex Ginibre ensemble, and the square Laguerre unitary ensemble, numerical simulations suggest that it is actually more universal. We obtain along the way explicit formulas of the logarithmic energy of the mentioned models which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces the CIR3 model, a three-factor model characterized by stochastic and correlated trends and volatilities. The paper focuses on establishing the Wasserstein ergodicity of this model, a task not achievable through conventional means such as the Dobrushin theorem. Instead, alternative mathematical approaches are employed, including considerations of topological aspects of Wasserstein spaces and Kolmogorov equations for measures. Remarkably, the methodology developed here can also be applied to prove the Wasserstein ergodicity of the widely recognized three-factor Chen model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate scaling limits of trees built by uniform attachment with freezing, which is a variant of the classical model of random recursive trees introduced in a companion paper. Here vertices are allowed to freeze, and arriving vertices cannot be attached to already frozen ones. We identify a phase transition when the number of non-frozen vertices roughly evolves as the total number of vertices to a given power. In particular, we observe a critical regime where the scaling limit is a random compact real tree, closely related to a time non-homogenous Kingman coalescent process identified by Aldous. Interestingly, in this critical regime, a condensation phenomenon can occur.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness in law of Leray solutions to 3D forced stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the forced stochastic Navier-Stokes equation driven by additive noise in the three dimensional Euclidean space. By constructing an appropriate forcing term, we prove that there exist distinct Leray solutions in the probabilistically weak sense. In particular, the joint uniqueness in law fails in the Leray class. The non-uniqueness also displays in the probabilistically strong sense in the local time regime, up to stopping times. Furthermore, we discuss the optimality from two different perspectives: sharpness of the hyper-viscous exponent and size of the external force. These results in particular yield that the Lions exponent is the sharp viscosity threshold for the uniqueness/non-uniqueness in law of Leray solutions. Our proof utilizes the self-similarity and instability programme developed by Jia \v{S}ver\'{a}k [42,43] and Albritton-Bru\'{e}-Colombo [1], together with the theory of martingale solutions including stability for non-metric spaces and gluing procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15438v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In each step of the overlapping cycles shuffle on $n$ cards, a fair coin is flipped which determines whether the $m$th card or the $n$th card is moved to the top of the deck. Angel, Peres, and Wilson showed the following interesting fact: If $m = \lfloor \alpha n \rfloor$ where $\alpha$ is rational, then the relaxation time of a single card in the overlapping cycles shuffle is $\theta(n^2)$. However if $\alpha$ is the golden ratio, then the relaxation time of a single card is $\theta(n^\frac{3}{2})$. We show that the mixing time of the entire deck under the overlapping cycles shuffle matches these bounds up to a factor of $\log(n)^3$. That is, the mixing time of the entire deck is $O(n^2 \log(n)^3)$ if $\alpha$ is rational and $O(n^\frac{3}{2} \log(n)^3)$ if $\alpha$ is the golden ratio.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we improve the best known constant for the discrepancy formulated in the Komlos Conjecture. The result is based on the improvement of the subgaussian bound for the random vector constructed in the Gram-Schmidt Random Walk algorithm. Moreover, we present detailed argument for the smoothed analysis of this random vector. The analysis concerns a modification of a given matrix in the conjecture by a Gaussian type perturbation. Our result improves the recent paper in this direction.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the numerical sign problem in the Wigner dynamics via adaptive particle annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.05161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The infamous numerical sign problem poses a fundamental obstacle to particle-based stochastic Wigner simulations in high dimensional phase space. Although the existing particle annihilation via uniform mesh significantly alleviates the sign problem when dimensionality D $\le$ 4, the mesh size grows dramatically when D $\ge$ 6 due to the curse of dimensionality and consequently makes the annihilation very inefficient. In this paper, we propose an adaptive particle annihilation algorithm, termed Sequential-clustering Particle Annihilation via Discrepancy Estimation (SPADE), to overcome the sign problem. SPADE follows a divide-and-conquer strategy: Adaptive clustering of particles via controlling their number-theoretic discrepancies and independent random matching in each group, and it may learn the minimal amount of particles that can accurately capture the non-classicality of the Wigner function. Combining SPADE with the variance reduction technique based on the stationary phase approximation, we attempt to simulate the proton-electron couplings in 6-D and 12-D phase space. A thorough performance benchmark of SPADE is provided with the reference solutions in 6-D phase space produced by a characteristic-spectral-mixed scheme under a $73^3 \times 80^3$ uniform grid, which fully explores the limit of grid-based deterministic Wigner solvers.</description>

      <title>Computable Bounds and Monte Carlo Estimates of the Expected Edit Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The edit distance is a metric of dissimilarity between strings, widely applied in computational biology, speech recognition, and machine learning. Let $e_k(n)$ denote the average edit distance between random, independent strings of $n$ characters from an alphabet of size $k$. For $k \geq 2$, it is an open problem how to efficiently compute the exact value of $\alpha_{k}(n) = e_k(n)/n$ as well as of $\alpha_{k} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \alpha_{k}(n)$, a limit known to exist.
  This paper shows that $\alpha_k(n)-Q(n) \leq \alpha_k \leq \alpha_k(n)$, for a specific $Q(n)=\Theta(\sqrt{\log n / n})$, a result which implies that $\alpha_k$ is computable. The exact computation of $\alpha_k(n)$ is explored, leading to an algorithm running in time $T=\mathcal{O}(n^2k\min(3^n,k^n))$, a complexity that makes it of limited practical use.
  An analysis of statistical estimates is proposed, based on McDiarmid's inequality, showing how $\alpha_k(n)$ can be evaluated with good accuracy, high confidence level, and reasonable computation time, for values of $n$ say up to a quarter million. Correspondingly, 99.9\% confidence intervals of width approximately $10^{-2}$ are obtained for $\alpha_k$.
  Combinatorial arguments on edit scripts are exploited to analytically characterize an efficiently computable lower bound $\beta_k^*$ to $\alpha_k$, such that $ \lim_{k \to \infty} \beta_k^*=1$. In general, $\beta_k^* \leq \alpha_k \leq 1-1/k$; for $k$ greater than a few dozens, computing $\beta_k^*$ is much faster than generating good statistical estimates with confidence intervals of width $1-1/k-\beta_k^*$.
  The techniques developed in the paper yield improvements on most previously published numerical values as well as results for alphabet sizes and string lengths not reported before.</description>

      <title>A new notion of subharmonicity on locally smoothing spaces, and a conjecture by Braverman, Milatovic, Shubin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a strongly local Dirichlet space and $\lambda\geq 0$, we introduce a new notion of $\lambda$--subharmonicity for $L^1_\loc$--functions, which we call \emph{local $\lambda$--shift defectivity}, and which turns out to be equivalent to distributional $\lambda$--subharmonicity in the Riemannian case. We study the regularity of these functions on a new class of strongly local Dirichlet, so called locally smoothing spaces, which includes Riemannian manifolds (without any curvature assumptions), finite dimensional RCD spaces, Carnot groups, and Sierpinski gaskets. As a byproduct of this regularity theory, we obtain in this general framework a proof of a conjecture by Braverman, Milatovic, Shubin on the positivity of distributional $L^q$-solutions of $\Delta f\leq f$ for complete Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Graph Convex Hull Bounds as generalized Jensen Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jensen's inequality is ubiquitous in measure and probability theory, statistics, machine learning, information theory and many other areas of mathematics and data science. It states that, for any convex function $f\colon K \to \mathbb{R}$ defined on a convex domain $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}$ and any random variable $X$ taking values in $K$, $\mathbb{E}[f(X)] \geq f(\mathbb{E}[X])$. In this paper, sharp upper and lower bounds on $\mathbb{E}[f(X)]$, termed ``graph convex hull bounds'', are derived for arbitrary functions $f$ on arbitrary domains $K$, thereby extensively generalizing Jensen's inequality. The derivation of these bounds necessitates the investigation of the convex hull of the graph of $f$, which can be challenging for complex functions. On the other hand, once these inequalities are established, they hold, just like Jensen's inequality, for \emph{any} $K$-valued random variable $X$. Therefore, these bounds are of particular interest in cases where $f$ is relatively simple and $X$ is complicated or unknown. Both finite- and infinite-dimensional domains and codomains of $f$ are covered as well as analogous bounds for conditional expectations and Markov operators.</description>

      <title>New Lower Bounds for the Schur-Siegel-Smyth Trace Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive and implement a new way to find lower bounds on the smallest limiting trace-to-degree ratio of totally positive algebraic integers and improve the previously best-known bound to 1.798249. Our method adds new constraints to Smyth's linear programming method to decrease the variables required in the new problem of interest. This allows for faster convergence recovering Schur's bound in the simplest case and Siegel's bound in the second simplest case of our new family of bounds.
  We also prove the existence of a unique optimal solution to our newly phrased problem and express the optimal solution in terms of polynomials. Lastly, we solve this new problem numerically with a gradient descent algorithm to attain the new bound 1.798249.</description>

      <title>A spectral approach to the narrow escape problem in the disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the narrow escape problem in the disk, which consists in identifying the first exit time and first exit point distribution of a Brownian particle from the ball in dimension 2, with reflecting boundary conditions except on small disjoint windows through which it can escape. This problem is motivated by practical questions arising in various scientific fields (in particular cellular biology and molecular dynamics). We apply the quasi-stationary distribution approach to metastability, which requires to study the eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the small absorbing part of the boundary, and Neumann boundary conditions on the remaining reflecting part. We obtain rigorous asymptotic estimates of the first eigenvalue and of the normal derivative of the associated eigenfunction in the limit of infinitely small exit regions, which yield asymptotic estimates of the first exit time and first exit point distribution starting from the quasi-stationary distribution within the disk.</description>

      <title>Randomized matrix computations: Themes and variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This short course offers a new perspective on randomized algorithms for matrix computations. It explores the distinct ways in which probability can be used to design algorithms for numerical linear algebra. Each design template is illustrated by its application to several computational problems. This treatment establishes conceptual foundations for randomized numerical linear algebra, and it forges links between algorithms that may initially seem unrelated.</description>
