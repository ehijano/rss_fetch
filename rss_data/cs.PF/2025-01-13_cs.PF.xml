      <title>MLKAPS: Machine Learning and Adaptive Sampling for HPC Kernel Auto-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many High-Performance Computing (HPC) libraries rely on decision trees to select the best kernel hyperparameters at runtime,depending on the input and environment. However, finding optimized configurations for each input and environment is challengingand requires significant manual effort and computational resources. This paper presents MLKAPS, a tool that automates this task usingmachine learning and adaptive sampling techniques. MLKAPS generates decision trees that tune HPC kernels' design parameters toachieve efficient performance for any user input. MLKAPS scales to large input and design spaces, outperforming similar state-of-the-artauto-tuning tools in tuning time and mean speedup. We demonstrate the benefits of MLKAPS on the highly optimized Intel MKLdgetrf LU kernel and show that MLKAPS finds blindspots in the manual tuning of HPC experts. It improves over 85% of the inputswith a geomean speedup of x1.30. On the Intel MKL dgeqrf QR kernel, MLKAPS improves performance on 85% of the inputs with ageomean speedup of x1.18.</description>

      <title>TakuNet: an Energy-Efficient CNN for Real-Time Inference on Embedded UAV systems in Emergency Response Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient neural networks for embedded devices is a critical challenge, particularly in applications requiring real-time performance, such as aerial imaging with drones and UAVs for emergency responses. In this work, we introduce TakuNet, a novel light-weight architecture which employs techniques such as depth-wise convolutions and an early downsampling stem to reduce computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. It leverages dense connections for fast convergence during training and uses 16-bit floating-point precision for optimization on embedded hardware accelerators. Experimental evaluation on two public datasets shows that TakuNet achieves near-state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying aerial images of emergency situations, despite its minimal parameter count. Real-world tests on embedded devices, namely Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi, confirm TakuNet's efficiency, achieving more than 650 fps on the 15W Jetson board, making it suitable for real-time AI processing on resource-constrained platforms and advancing the applicability of drones in emergency scenarios. The code and implementation details are publicly released.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Received Adaptive Spatial Modulation for Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06894v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel wireless transmission scheme, as named the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted received adaptive spatial modulation (RASM) scheme, is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation (ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio at specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers. Besides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped into the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver through the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher spectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical performance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off selection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the satisfactory error performance. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the better performance and exhibit more potential to apply in practical wireless communication.</description>
