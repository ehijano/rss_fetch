      <title>Multistate ferroelectric diodes with high electroresistance based on van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit ferroelectricity, making them promising for novel non-volatile memories (NVMs) such as ferroelectric diodes (FeDs). CuInP2S6 (CIPS) is a well-known vdW ferroelectric that has been integrated with graphene for memory devices. Here we demonstrate FeDs with self-rectifying, hysteretic current-voltage characteristics based on vertical heterostructures of 10-nm-thick CIPS and graphene. By using vdW indium-cobalt top electrodes and graphene bottom electrodes, we achieve high electroresistance (on- and off-state resistance ratios) of ~10^6, on-state rectification ratios of ~2500 for read/write voltages of 2 V/0.5 V and maximum output current densities of 100 A/cm^2. These metrics compare favourably with state-of-the-art FeDs. Piezoresponse force microscopy measurements show that stabilization of intermediate net polarization states in CIPS leads to stable multi-bit data retention at room temperature. The combination of two-terminal design, multi-bit memory, and low-power operation in CIPS-based FeDs is potentially interesting for compute-in-memory and neuromorphic computing applications.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Side Entry Laser System for Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a side entry laser system designed for an ultra-high vacuum scanning transmission electron microscope. This system uses a versatile probe design enclosed in a vacuum envelope such that parts can be easily aligned, modified, or exchanged without disturbing the vacuum. The system uses a mirror mounted on the sample holder such that the sample can be illuminated without being tilted. Notably the mirror can be removed and replaced with an ablation target and a higher power laser used to ablate material directly onto the sample. We argue that new capabilities hold the potential to transform the electron microscope from an analysis tool towards a more flexible synthesis system, where atomic scale fabrication and atom-by-atom experiments can be performed.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of low-loss lithium niobate on insulator waveguides on the wafer scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the wafer scale fabrication of single mode low-loss lithium niobate on insulator waveguides utilizing a chemically amplified resist and an optimized dry etching method. The fabricated single mode waveguides are free of residuals and re-deposition, with measured losses for straight waveguides around 2 dB/m (0.02 dB/cm). We present on a method offering advantages for large-scale production due to its cost-effectiveness, faster writing time, and simplified processes. This work holds promise for advancing integrated photonics and optical communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous integration of amorphous silicon carbide on thin film lithium niobate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, lithium niobate (LiNbO3 or LN) photonics, thanks to its heat-free and fast electro-optical modulation, second-order non-linearities and low loss, has been extensively investigated. Despite numerous demonstrations of high-performance LN photonics, processing lithium niobate remains challenging and suffers from incompatibilities with standard complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication lines, limiting its scalability. Silicon carbide (SiC) is an emerging material platform with a high refractive index, a large non-linear Kerr coefficient, and a promising candidate for heterogeneous integration with LN photonics. Current approaches of SiC/LN integration require transfer-bonding techniques, which are time-consuming, expensive, and lack precision in layer thickness. Here we show that amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), deposited using inductively coupled plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (ICPCVD) at low temperatures (&lt; 165 C), can be conveniently integrated with LiNbO3 and processed to form high-performance photonics. Most importantly, the fabrication only involves a standard, silicon-compatible, reactive ion etching step and leaves the LiNbO3 intact, hence its compatibility with standard foundry processes. As a proof-of-principle, we fabricated waveguides and ring resonators on the developed a-SiC/LN platform and achieved intrinsic quality factors higher than 106,000 and resonance electro-optic tunability of 3.4 pm/V with 3 mm tuning length. We showcase the possibility of dense integration by fabricating and testing ring resonators with 40um radius without a noticeable loss penalty. Our platform offers a CMOS-compatible and scalable approach for implementation of future fast electro-optic modulators and reconfigurable photonic circuits as well as nonlinear processes which can benefit from involving both second and third-order nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Second-Harmonic Generation in Sub-wavelength Periodically Poled Thin Film Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second harmonic generation (SHG) extensively employs periodically poled nonlinear crystals through forward quasi-phase-matching to achieve efficient frequency conversion. As poling periods approach sub-micrometers, backward quasi-phase-matching has also been demonstrated, albeit by utilizing pulsed laser drives. The realization of symmetric second harmonic generation, characterized by counterpropagating pumps, however, has remained elusive despite theoretical predictions. The main challenge lies in achieving strong nonlinear coupling with poling period below half the wavelength of the second-harmonic light. The recent emergence of high-quality ferroelectric lithium niobate thin films provides an opportunity for achieving precise domain control at submicron dimensions. In this article, we demonstrate reliable control of ferroelectric domains in thin film lithium niobate waveguide with a poling period down to 370nm, thereby realizing highly efficient continuous-wave pumped symmetric SHG. This demonstration not only validates the feasibility of achieving subwavelength periodic poling on waveguides but also opens new avenues for leveraging submicron ferroelectric domain structures in integrated photonics and nonlinear optics research.</description>

      <title>A Computational Framework Integrating Physics-based Model and Equivalent Circuit Network Model to Simulate Li-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Battery models generally fall into two categories: physics-based models and ECM models. Physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) models can accurately simulate the battery internal electrochemical processes, but to properly account for thermal effects requires a strong coupling between a DFN model and a 3D thermal model, which is computationally unaffordable. Distributed Equivalent Circuit Network (ECN) models can perform simulations with high speed and reasonable accuracy. However, these models rely heavily on the characterisation experiments for ECN parameter identification, which is resource-intensive and can lead to inaccurate parametrisation outcomes due to internal thermal inhomogeneity. To harness the strengths of both models, we propose a computational framework to integrate electrochemical DFN model and 3D distributed ECN model together. Using this framework, we simulate constant current discharge experiments of Kokam 7.5 Ah pouch cell (Model SLPB75106100) and compare the simulations with the commonly-used lumped DFN-thermal model. The computational model outperforms the lumped DFN model at low-temperature and/or high C-rate scenarios significantly. The largest predicting error of the framework at 3 C-rate &amp;Tam = 25oC and at 1 C-rate &amp;Tam = 0 oC is approximately 1/3 of that for DFN model. At 3 C-rate &amp;Tam = 5oC, the difference between these two can rise to 377 mV. By integrating DFN and 3D-distributed ECN together, the computational framework can simulate the complicated interplay between electrochemistry, thermal process, and electricity within a cell fast and accurately. We anticipate this computational framework to be a valuable toolset to assist researchers and engineers in the design and control of Li-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Resonant Solitary States in Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partially synchronized solitary states occur frequently when a synchronized system of networked oscillators is perturbed locally. Several asymptotic states of different frequencies can coexist at the same node. Here, we reveal the mechanism behind this multistability: additional solitary frequencies arise from the coupling between network modes and the solitary oscillator's frequency, leading to significant energy transfer. This can cause the solitary node's frequency to resonate with a Laplacian eigenvalue. We analyze which network structures enable this resonance and explain longstanding numerical observations. Another solitary state is characterized by the effective decoupling of the synchronized network and the solitary node at the natural frequency. Our framework unifies the description of solitary states near and far from resonance, allowing to predict the behavior of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Photonic-Electronic Integrated Circuits for High-Performance Computing and AI Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, the demand for computational power has surged, particularly with the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI). As we navigate the post-Moore's law era, the limitations of traditional electrical digital computing, including process bottlenecks and power consumption issues, are propelling the search for alternative computing paradigms. Among various emerging technologies, integrated photonics stands out as a promising solution for next-generation high-performance computing, thanks to the inherent advantages of light, such as low latency, high bandwidth, and unique multiplexing techniques. Furthermore, the progress in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), which are equipped with abundant photoelectronic components, positions photonic-electronic integrated circuits as a viable solution for high-performance computing and hardware AI accelerators. In this review, we survey recent advancements in both PIC-based digital and analog computing for AI, exploring the principal benefits and obstacles of implementation. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive analysis of photonic AI from the perspectives of hardware implementation, accelerator architecture, and software-hardware co-design. In the end, acknowledging the existing challenges, we underscore potential strategies for overcoming these issues and offer insights into the future drivers for optical computing.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a graphene-hBN superlattice field effect transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene provides a unique platform for hosting high quality 2D electron systems. Encapsulating graphene with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to shield it from noisy environments offers the potential to achieve ultrahigh performance nanodevices, such as photodiodes and transistors. However, the absence of a bandgap at the Dirac point presents challenges for using this system as a useful transistor. In this study, we investigated the functionality of hBN-aligned monolayer graphene as a field effect transistor (FET). By precisely aligning the hBN and graphene, bandgaps open at the first Dirac point and at the hole-doped induced Dirac point via an interfacial moir\'e potential. To characterize this as a submicrometer scale FET, we fabricated a global bottom gate to tune the density of a conducting channel and a local top gate to switch off this channel. This demonstrated that the system could be tuned to an optimal on/off ratio regime by separately controlling the gates. These findings provide a valuable reference point for the further development of FETs based on graphene heterostructures.</description>
