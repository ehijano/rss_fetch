      <title>Averaging principle for rough slow-fast systems of level 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The averaging principle for slow-fast systems of various kind of stochastic (partial) differential equations has been extensively studied. An analogous result was shown for slow-fast systems of rough differential equations driven by random rough paths a few years ago and the study of ``rough slow-fast systems" seems to be gaining momentum now. In all known results, however, the driving rough paths are of level 2. In this paper we formulate rough slow-fast systems driven by random rough paths of level 3 and prove the strong averaging principle of Khas'minskii-type.</description>

      <title>Entropy and functional forms of the dimensional Brunn--Minkowski inequality in Gauss space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given even strongly log-concave random vectors $X_{0}$ and $X_{1}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we show that a natural joint distribution $(X_{0},X_{1})$ satisfies, \begin{equation}
  e^{ - \frac{1}{n}D ((1-t)X_{0} + t X_{1} \Vert Z)} \geq (1-t) e^{ - \frac{1}{n}D (X_{0} \Vert Z)} + t e^{ - \frac{1}{n}D ( X_{1} \Vert Z)}, \end{equation} where $Z$ is distributed according to the standard Gaussian measure $\gamma$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, $t \in [0,1]$, and $D(\cdot \Vert Z)$ is the Gaussian relative entropy. This extends and provides a different viewpoint on the corresponding geometric inequality proved by Eskenazis and Moschidis, namely that \begin{equation} \gamma \left( (1-t) K_{0} + t K_{1} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} \geq (1-t) \gamma (K_{0})^{\frac{1}{n}} + t \gamma (K_{1})^{\frac{1}{n}}, \end{equation} when $K_{0}, K_{1} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ are origin-symmetric convex bodies. As an application, using Donsker--Varadhan duality, we obtain Gaussian Borell--Brascamp--Lieb inequalities applicable to even log-concave functions, which serve as functional forms of the Eskenazis--Moschidis inequality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider matrix products of the form $A_1(A_2A_2)^\top\ldots(A_{m}A_{m}^\top)A_{m+1}$, where $A_i$ are normalized random Fourier-Walsh matrices. We identify an interesting polynomial scaling regime when the operator norm of the expected matrix product tends to zero as the dimension tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>On the parabolic $\Phi_3^4$ model for the harmonic oscillator: diagrams and local existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the local wellposedness of the (renormalized) parabolic $\Phi^4_3$ model associated with the harmonic oscillator on $\mathbb{R}^3$, that is, the equation formally written as \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t X + HX= -X^3+\infty\cdot X + \xi, \quad t&gt;0, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^3, \end{equation*} where $H:=-\Delta_{\mathbb{R}^3} +|x|^2$ and $\xi$ denotes a space-time white noise. This model is closely related to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation which is used in the description of Bose-Einstein condensation.
  Our overall formulation of the problem, based on the so-called paracontrolled calculus, follows the strategy outlined by Mourrat and Weber for the $\Phi^4_3$ model on the three-dimensional torus. Significant effort is then required to adapt, within the framework imposed by the harmonic oscillator, the key tools that contribute to the success of this method-particularly the construction of stochastic diagrams at the core of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic ordering, attractiveness and couplings in non-conservative particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the stochastic comparison of interacting particle systems allowing for multiple arrivals, departures and non-conservative jumps of individuals between sites. That is, if $k$ individuals leave site $x$ for site $y$, a possibly different number $l$ arrive at destination. This setting includes new models, when compared to the conservative case, such as metapopulation models with deaths during migrations. It implies a sharp increase of technical complexity, given the numerous changes to consider. Known results are significantly generalised, even in the conservative case, as no particular form of the transition rates is assumed.
  We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on the rates for the stochastic comparison of the processes and prove their equivalence with the existence of an order-preserving Markovian coupling. As a corollary, we get necessary and sufficient conditions for the attractiveness of the processes. A salient feature of our approach lies in the presentation of the coupling in terms of solutions to network flow problems.
  We illustrate the applicability of our results to a flexible family of population models described as interacting particle systems, with a range of parameters controlling births, deaths, catastrophes or migrations. We provide explicit conditions on the parameters for the stochastic comparison and attractiveness of the models, showing their usefulness in studying their limit behaviour. Additionally, we give three examples of constructing the coupling.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-existence of consistent estimators in supercritical controlled branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a supercritical controlled branching process consistently from a single observed trajectory of population size counts. Our goal is to establish which parameters can and cannot be consistently estimated. When a parameter can be consistently estimated, we derive an explicit expression for the estimator. We address these questions in three scenarios: when the distribution of the control function distribution is known, when it is unknown, and when progenitor numbers are observed alongside population size counts. Our results offer a theoretical justification for the common practice in population ecology of estimating demographic and environmental stochasticity using separate observation schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the Wigner distribution of a tempered generalized stochastic process that is complex-valued symmetric Gaussian. This gives a time-frequency generalized stochastic process defined on the phase space. We study its covariance and our main result is a formula for the Weyl symbol of the covariance operator, expressed in terms of the Weyl symbol of the covariance operator of the original generalized stochastic process.</description>

      <title>The height of the infection tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the geometry of the ``infection tree'' in a stochastic SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model, starting with a single infectious individual. This tree is constructed by drawing an edge between two individuals when one infects the other. We focus on the regime where the infectious period before recovery follows an exponential distribution with rate $1$, and infections occur at a rate $\lambda_{n} \sim \frac{\lambda}{n}$ where $n$ is the initial number of healthy individuals with $\lambda&gt;1$. We show that provided that the infection does not quickly die out, the height of the infection tree is asymptotically $\kappa(\lambda) \log n$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, where $\kappa(\lambda)$ is a continuous function in $\lambda$ that undergoes a second-order phase transition at $\lambda_{c}\simeq 1.8038$. Our main tools include a connection with the model of uniform attachment trees with freezing and the application of martingale techniques to control profiles of random trees.</description>

      <title>Richardson's model and the contact process with stirring: long time behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two famous interacting particle systems, the so-called Richardson's model and the contact process, when we add a stirring dynamics to them. We prove that they both satisfy an asymptotic shape theorem, as their analogues without stirring, but only for high enough infection rates, using couplings and restart techniques. We also show that for Richardson's model with stirring, for high enough infection rates, each site is forever infected after a certain time almost surely. Finally, we study weak and strong survival for both models on a homogeneous infinite tree, and show that there are two phase transitions for certain values of the parameters and the dimension, which is a result similar to what is proved for the contact process.</description>

      <title>Nudged Particle Filter with Optimal Resampling Applied to the Duffing Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently solving the continuous-time signal and discrete-time observation filtering problem for chaotic dynamical systems presents unique challenges in that the advected distribution between observations may encounter a separatrix structure that results in the prior distribution being far from the observation or the distribution may become split into multiple disjoint components. In an attempt to sense and overcome these dynamical issues, as well as approximate a non-Gaussian distribution, a nudged particle filtering approach has been introduced. In the nudged particle filter method a control term is added, but has the potential drawback of degenerating the weights of the particles. To counter this issue, we introduce an intermediate resampling approach based on the modified Cram\'er-von Mises distance. The new method is applied to a challenging scenario of the non-chaotic, unforced nonlinear Duffing oscillator, which possesses a separatrix structure. Our results show that it consistently outperforms the standard particle filter with resampling and original nudged particle filter.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Optimization with Complex Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization problems involving complex variables, when solved, are typically transformed into real variables, often at the expense of convergence rate and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel formalism for a prominent problem in stochastic optimization involving complex random variables, termed the Complex Chance-Constrained Problem (CCCP). The study specifically examines the linear CCCP under complex normal distributions for two scenarios: one with individual probabilistic constraints and the other with joint probabilistic constraints. For the individual case, the core methodology reformulates the CCCP into a deterministic Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem, ensuring equivalence to the original CCCP. For the joint case, an approximation is achieved by deriving suitable upper and lower bounds, which also leads to a SOCP formulation. Finally, numerical experiments on a signal processing application, specifically the Minimum Variance Beamforming problem with mismatch using MVDR, demonstrate that the proposed formalism outperforms existing approaches in the literature. A comparative analysis between the joint and individual CCCP cases is also included.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional ridge regression with random features for non-identically distributed data with a variance profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of the random feature model in the high-dimensional regression framework has become a popular issue of interest in the machine learning literature}. This model is generally considered for feature vectors $x_i = \Sigma^{1/2} x_i'$, where $x_i'$ is a random vector made of independent and identically distributed (iid) entries, and $\Sigma$ is a positive definite matrix representing the covariance of the features.
  In this paper, we move beyond {\CB this standard assumption by studying the performances of the random features model in the setting of non-iid feature vectors}. Our approach is related to the analysis of the spectrum of large random matrices through random matrix theory (RMT) {\CB and free probability} results. We turn to the analysis of non-iid data by using the notion of variance profile {\CB which} is {\CB well studied in RMT.} Our main contribution is then the study of the limits of the training and {\CB prediction} risks associated to the ridge estimator in the random features model when its dimensions grow. We provide asymptotic equivalents of these risks that capture the behavior of ridge regression with random features in a {\CB high-dimensional} framework. These asymptotic equivalents, {\CB which prove to be sharp in numerical experiments}, are retrieved by adapting, to our setting, established results from operator-valued free probability theory. Moreover, {\CB for various classes of random feature vectors that have not been considered so far in the literature}, our approach allows to show the appearance of the double descent phenomenon when the ridge regularization parameter is small enough.</description>

      <title>A Lanczos-Based Algorithmic Approach for Spike Detection in Large Sample Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for estimating the number of spikes in a general class of spiked covariance models without directly computing the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix. This approach is based on the Lanczos algorithm and the asymptotic properties of the associated Jacobi matrix and its Cholesky factorization. A key aspect of the analysis is interpreting the eigenvector spectral distribution as a perturbation of its asymptotic counterpart. The specific exponential-type asymptotics of the Jacobi matrix enables an efficient approximation of the Stieltjes transform of the asymptotic spectral distribution via a finite continued fraction. As a consequence, we also obtain estimates for the density of the asymptotic distribution and the location of outliers. We provide consistency guarantees for our proposed estimators, proving their convergence in the high-dimensional regime. We demonstrate that, when applied to standard spiked covariance models, our approach outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency and runtime, while still maintaining robustness to exotic population covariances.</description>

      <title>A computational transition for detecting multivariate shuffled linear regression by low-degree polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of multivariate shuffled linear regression, where the correspondence between predictors and responses in a linear model is obfuscated by a latent permutation. Specifically, we investigate the model $Y=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{1+\sigma^2}}(\Pi_* X Q_* + \sigma Z)$, where $X$ is an $n*d$ standard Gaussian design matrix, $Z$ is an $n*m$ Gaussian noise matrix, $\Pi_*$ is an unknown $n*n$ permutation matrix, and $Q_*$ is an unknown $d*m$ on the Grassmanian manifold satisfying $Q_*^{\top} Q_* = \mathbb I_m$.
  Consider the hypothesis testing problem of distinguishing this model from the case where $X$ and $Y$ are independent Gaussian random matrices of sizes $n*d$ and $n*m$, respectively. Our results reveal a phase transition phenomenon in the performance of low-degree polynomial algorithms for this task. (1) When $m=o(d)$, we show that all degree-$D$ polynomials fail to distinguish these two models even when $\sigma=0$, provided with $D^4=o\big( \tfrac{d}{m} \big)$. (2) When $m=d$ and $\sigma=\omega(1)$, we show that all degree-$D$ polynomials fail to distinguish these two models provided with $D=o(\sigma)$. (3) When $m=d$ and $\sigma=o(1)$, we show that there exists a constant-degree polynomial that strongly distinguish these two models. These results establish a smooth transition in the effectiveness of low-degree polynomial algorithms for this problem, highlighting the interplay between the dimensions $m$ and $d$, the noise level $\sigma$, and the computational complexity of the testing task.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Option Pricing with an Extended Black-Scholes Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates enhancing option pricing by extending the Black-Scholes model to include stochastic volatility and interest rate variability within the Partial Differential Equation (PDE). The PDE is solved using the finite difference method. The extended Black-Scholes model and a machine learning-based LSTM model are developed and evaluated for pricing Google stock options. Both models were backtested using historical market data. While the LSTM model exhibited higher predictive accuracy, the finite difference method demonstrated superior computational efficiency. This work provides insights into model performance under varying market conditions and emphasizes the potential of hybrid approaches for robust financial modeling.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mixing on Random Regular Graphs beyond Uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hardcore model is a fundamental probabilistic model extensively studied in statistical physics, probability theory, and computer science. For graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, a well-known computational phase transition occurs at the tree-uniqueness threshold $\lambda_c(\Delta) = \frac{(\Delta-1)^{\Delta-1}}{(\Delta-2)^\Delta}$, where the mixing behavior of the Glauber dynamics (a simple Markov chain) undergoes a sharp transition.
  It is conjectured that random regular graphs exhibit different mixing behavior, with the slowdown occurring far beyond the uniqueness threshold. We confirm this conjecture by showing that, for the hardcore model on random $\Delta$-regular graphs, the Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly with high probability when $\lambda = O(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$, which is significantly beyond the uniqueness threshold $\lambda_c(\Delta) \approx e/\Delta$. Our result establishes a sharp distinction between the hardcore model on worst-case and beyond-worst-case instances, showing that the worst-case and average-case complexities of sampling and counting are fundamentally different.
  This result of rapid mixing on random instances follows from a new criterion we establish for rapid mixing of Glauber dynamics for any distribution supported on a downward closed set family. Our criterion is simple, general, and easy to check. In addition to proving new mixing conditions for the hardcore model, we also establish improved mixing time bounds for sampling uniform matchings or $b$ matchings on graphs, the random cluster model on matroids with $q \in [0,1)$, and the determinantal point process. Our proof of this new criterion for rapid mixing combines and generalizes several recent tools in a novel way, including a trickle down theorem for field dynamics, spectral/entropic stability, and a new comparison result between field dynamics and Glauber dynamics.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness results of a nonlinear stochastic diffusion-convection equation with reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the uniqueness of solutions of a nonlinear, pseudomonotone, stochastic diffusion evolution problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions with reflection, where the noise term is additive and given by a stochastic It\^{o} integral with respect to a Hilbert space valued cylindrical Wiener process. In fact, since there is no It\^{o} formula available for a solution in general, a general uniqueness result seems not to be available. Nevertheless, assuming more regularity for the solutions or the reflection, we may show some comparison principles.</description>

      <title>On empirical Hodge Laplacians under the manifold hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given i.i.d. observations uniformly distributed on a closed submanifold of the Euclidean space, we study higher-order generalizations of graph Laplacians, so-called Hodge Laplacians on graphs, as approximations of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on differential forms. Our main result is a high-probability error bound for the associated Dirichlet forms. This bound improves existing Dirichlet form error bounds for graph Laplacians in the context of Laplacian Eigenmaps, and it provides insights into the Betti numbers studied in topological data analysis and the complementing positive part of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Martingale approach for first-passage problems of time-additive observables in Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method based on martingales to study first-passage problems of time-additive observables exiting an interval of finite width in a Markov process. In the limit that the interval width is large, we derive generic expressions for the splitting probability and the cumulants of the first-passage time. These expressions relate first-passage quantities to the large deviation properties of the time-additive observable. We find that there are three qualitatively different regimes depending on the properties of the large deviation rate function of the time-additive observable. These regimes correspond to exponential, super-exponential, or sub-exponential suppression of events at the unlikely boundary of the interval. Furthermore, we show that the statistics of first-passage times at both interval boundaries are in general different, even for symmetric thresholds and in the limit of large interval widths. While the statistics of the times to reach the likely boundary are determined by the cumulants of the time-additive observables in the original process, those at the unlikely boundary are determined by a dual process. We obtain these results from a one-parameter family of positive martingales that we call Perron martingales, as these are related to the Perron root of a tilted version of the transition rate matrix defining the Markov process. Furthermore, we show that each eigenpair of the tilted matrix has a one-parameter family of martingales. To solve first-passage problems at finite thresholds, we generally require all one-parameter families of martingales, including the non-positive ones. We illustrate this by solving the first-passage problem for run-and-tumble particles exiting an interval of finite width.</description>

      <title>A stochastic volatility approximation for a tick-by-tick price model with mean-field interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a tick-by-tick model of price formation, in which buy and sell orders are modeled as self-exciting point processes (Hawkes process), similar to the one in [El Euch, Fukasawa, Rosenbaum, The microstructural foundations of leverage effect and rough volatility, Finance and Stochastics, 2018]. We adopt an agent based approach by studying the aggregation of a large number of these point processes, mutually interacting in a mean-field sense.
  The financial interpretation is that of an asset on which several labeled agents place buy and sell orders following these point processes, influencing the price. The mean-field interaction introduces positive correlations between order volumes coming from different agents that reflect features of real markets such as herd behavior and contagion. When the large scale limit of the aggregated asset price is computed, if parameters are set to a critical value, a singular phenomenon occurs: the aggregated model converges to a stochastic volatility model with leverage effect and faster-than-linear mean reversion of the volatility process.
  The faster-than-linear mean reversion of the volatility process is supported by econometric evidence, and we have linked it in [Dai Pra, Pigato, Multi-scaling of moments in stochastic volatility models, Stochastic Processes and their Applications, 2015] to the observed multifractal behavior of assets prices and market indices. This seems connected to the Statistical Physics perspective that expects anomalous scaling properties to arise in the critical regime.</description>

      <title>Conditioning Diffusions Using Malliavin Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In stochastic optimal control and conditional generative modelling, a central computational task is to modify a reference diffusion process to maximise a given terminal-time reward. Most existing methods require this reward to be differentiable, using gradients to steer the diffusion towards favourable outcomes. However, in many practical settings, like diffusion bridges, the reward is singular, taking an infinite value if the target is hit and zero otherwise. We introduce a novel framework, based on Malliavin calculus and path-space integration by parts, that enables the development of methods robust to such singular rewards. This allows our approach to handle a broad range of applications, including classification, diffusion bridges, and conditioning without the need for artificial observational noise. We demonstrate that our approach offers stable and reliable training, outperforming existing techniques.</description>

      <title>evalprob4cast: An R-package for evaluation of ensembles as probabilistic forecasts or event forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any forecasting application, evaluation of forecasts is an important task. For example, in the field of renewable energy sources there is high variability and uncertainty of power production, which makes forecasting and the evaluation hereof crucial both for power trading and power grid balancing. In particular, probabilistic forecasts represented by ensembles are popular due to their ability to cover the full range of scenarios that can occur, thus enabling forecast users to make more informed decisions than what would be possible with simple deterministic forecasts. The selection of open source software that supports evaluation of ensemble forecasts, and especially event detection, is currently limited. As a solution, evalprob4cast is a new R-package for probabilistic forecast evaluation that aims to provide its users with all the tools needed for the assessment of ensemble forecasts, in the form of metrics and visualization methods. Both univariate and multivariate probabilistic forecasts as well as event detection are covered. Furthermore, it offers a user-friendly design where all of the evaluation methods can be applied in a fast and easy way, as long as the input data is organized in accordance with the format defined by the package. While its development is motivated by forecasting of renewables, the package can be used for any application with ensemble forecasts.</description>

      <title>Concentration and fluctuation phenomena in the localized phase of the pinning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the localized phase of pinning models with i.i.d. site disorder on which we assume only that the moment generating function is bounded in a neighborhood of the origin. We develop quantitative correlation functions estimates for local observables that entail quantitative $C^\infty$ estimates on the free energy density, showing in particular that its regularity class is at least Gevrey-3 in the whole localized phase. We then explain how a quenched concentration bound and the quenched Central Limit Theorem (CLT) on the number of the pinned sites, i.e., the 'contact number', can be extracted from the regularity estimates on the free energy: this identifies the thermal fluctuations of the contact number. But the centering sequence in the quenched CLT is random in the sense that it is disorder dependent: we show that the (disorder induced) fluctuations of the centering are on the same scale of the thermal fluctuations by establishing a CLT, with a non degenerate variance, also for the centering. For what concerns the correlation and $C^\infty$ estimates, our work
  substantially generalizes and expands the analysis in [Giacomin and F. L. Toninelli, Lat. Am. J. Probab. 1 (2006), 149-180] that dealt with pinning models with restrictive conditions on the disorder distributions and in which less explicit, non uniform bounds were obtained.</description>

      <title>Self-Exciting Random Evolutions (SEREs) and their Applications (Version 2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of a new class of random evolutions (RE), so-called self-exciting random evolutions (SEREs), and their applications. We also introduce a new random process $x(t)$ such that it is based on a superposition of a Markov chain $x_n$ and a Hawkes process $N(t),$ i.e., $x(t):=x_{N(t)}.$ We call this process self-walking imbedded semi-Hawkes process (Swish Process or SwishP). Then the self-exciting REs (SEREs) can be constructed in similar way as, e.g., semi-Markov REs, but instead of semi-Markov process $x(t)$ we have SwishP. We give classifications and examples of self-exciting REs (SEREs). Then we consider two limit theorems for SEREs such as averaging (Theorem 1) and diffusion approximation (Theorem 2). Applications of SEREs are devoted to the so-called self-exciting traffic/transport process and self-exciting summation on a Markov chain, which are examples of continuous and discrete SERE. From these processes we can construct many other self-exciting processes, e.g., such as impulse traffic/transport process, self-exciting risk process, general compound Hawkes process for a stock price, etc. We present averaged and diffusion approximation of self-exciting processes. The novelty of the paper associated with new models, such as $x(t)$ and SERE, and also new features of SEREs and their many applications, namely, self-exciting and clustering effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a distributional fixed-point equation related to a multi-type branching process that is key in the cluster sizes analysis of multivariate heavy-tailed Hawkes processes. Specifically, we explore the tail behavior of its solution and demonstrate the emergence of a form of multivariate hidden regular variation. Large values of the cluster size vector result from one or several significant jumps. A discrete optimization problem involving any given rare event set of interest determines the exact configuration of these large jumps and the degree of hidden regular variation. Our proofs rely on a detailed probabilistic analysis of the spatiotemporal structure of multiple large jumps in multi-type branching processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In branching process theory, linear-fractional distributions are commonly used to model individual reproduction, especially when the goal is to obtain more explicit formulas than those derived under general model assumptions. In this article, we explore a generalization of these distributions, first introduced by Sagitov and Lindo, which offers similar advantages. We refer to these as power-fractional distributions, primarily because, as we demonstrate, they exhibit power-law behavior. Along with a discussion of their additional properties, we present several results related to the Galton-Watson branching process in both constant and randomly varying environments, illustrating these advantages. The use of power-fractional distributions in continuous time, particularly within the framework of Markov branching processes, is also briefly addressed.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Sparsity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02672v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel approach to solving the sparsity-constrained Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SCONMF) problem, which requires decomposing a non-negative data matrix into the product of two lower-rank non-negative matrices, X=WH, where the mixing matrix H has orthogonal rows HH^T=I, while also satisfying an upper bound on the number of nonzero elements in each row. By reformulating SCONMF as a capacity-constrained facility-location problem (CCFLP), the proposed method naturally integrates non-negativity, orthogonality, and sparsity constraints. Specifically, our approach integrates control-barrier function (CBF) based framework used for dynamic optimal control design problems with maximum-entropy-principle-based framework used for facility location problems to enforce these constraints while ensuring robust factorization. Additionally, this work introduces a quantitative approach for determining the ``true" rank of W or H, equivalent to the number of ``true" features - a critical aspect in ONMF applications where the number of features is unknown. Simulations on various datasets demonstrate significantly improved factorizations with low reconstruction errors (as small as by 150 times) while strictly satisfying all constraints, outperforming existing methods that struggle with balancing accuracy and constraint adherence.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for a finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>

Abstract: This work is devoted to the homogenization of elliptic equations in high-contrast media in the so-called 'double-porosity' resonant regime, for which we solve two open problems of the literature. First, we prove qualitative stochastic homogenization under very weak conditions, which cover the case of inclusions that are not uniformly bounded or separated. Second, under stronger assumptions, we provide sharp error estimates for the two-scale expansion. The main difficulty is related to the loss of integrability of the control in the resonant zones.</description>

Abstract: For linear inverse problems with Gaussian priors and Gaussian observation noise, the posterior is Gaussian, with mean and covariance determined by the conditioning formula. Using the Feldman-Hajek theorem, we analyse the prior-to-posterior update and its low-rank approximation for infinite-dimensional Hilbert parameter spaces and finite-dimensional observations. We show that the posterior distribution differs from the prior on a finite-dimensional subspace, and construct low-rank approximations to the posterior covariance, while keeping the mean fixed. Since in infinite dimensions, not all low-rank covariance approximations yield approximate posterior distributions which are equivalent to the posterior and prior distribution, we characterise the low-rank covariance approximations which do yield this equivalence, and their respective inverses, or `precisions'. For such approximations, a family of measure approximation problems is solved by identifying the low-rank approximations which are optimal for various losses simultaneously. These loss functions include the family of R\'enyi divergences, the Amari $\alpha$-divergences for $\alpha\in(0,1)$, the Hellinger metric and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our results extend those of Spantini et al. (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 2015) to Hilbertian parameter spaces, and provide theoretical underpinning for the construction of low-rank approximations of discretised versions of the infinite-dimensional inverse problem, by formulating discretization independent results.</description>
