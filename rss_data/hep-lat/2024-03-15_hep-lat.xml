      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars for Arbitrary Integer Spin in $2+1$D~Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars, high-energy eigenstates that evade the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, has been established across different quantum many-body systems, including gauge theories corresponding to spin-1/2 Quantum Link Models. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, concretely for Truncated Link Models, where the electric field is restricted to $2S+1$ states per link. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread in $2+1$D gauge theories for arbitrary integer spin. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ Quantum Link Models. The proposed analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Curvature of the chiral phase transition line from the magnetic equation of state of (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dependence of the chiral phase transition temperature on baryon number and strangeness chemical potentials by calculating the leading order curvature coefficients in the light and strange quark flavor basis as well as in the conserved charge ($B, S$) basis. Making use of scaling properties of the magnetic equation of state (MEoS) and including diagonal as well as off-diagonal contributions in the expansion of the energy-like scaling variable that enters the parametrization of the MEoS, allows to explore the variation of $T_c(\mu_B,\mu_S) = T_c ( 1 - (\kappa_2^B \hat{\mu}_B^2 + \kappa_2^S \hat{\mu}_S^2 + 2\kappa_{11}^{BS} \hat{\mu}_B \hat{\mu}_S))$ along different lines in the $(\mu_B,\mu_S)$ plane. On lattices with fixed cut-off in units of temperature, $aT=1/8$, we find $\kappa_2^B=0.015(1)$, $\kappa_2^S=0.0124(5)$ and $\kappa_{11}^{BS}=-0.0050(7)$. We show that the chemical potential dependence along the line of vanishing strangeness chemical potential is about 10\% larger than along the strangeness neutral line. The latter differs only by about $3\%$ from the curvature on a line of vanishing strange quark chemical potential, $\mu_s=0$. We also show that close to the chiral limit the strange quark mass contributes like an energy-like variable in scaling relations for pseudo-critical temperatures. The chiral phase transition temperature decreases with decreasing strange quark mass, $T_c(m_s)= T_c(m_s^{\rm phy}) (1 - 0.097(2) (m_s-m_s^{\rm phys})/m_s^{\rm phy}+{\cal O}((\Delta m_s)^2)$.</description>

      <title>QCD at 50: Golden Anniversary, Golden Insights, Golden Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk of this paper centers around the tension between confinement and freedom in QCD. I discuss how it can be understood heuristically as a manifestation of self-adhesive glue and how it fits within the larger contexts of energy-time uncertainty and $\textit{real virtuality}$. I discuss the possible emergence of $\textit{treeons}$ as a tangible ingredient of (at least) pure gluon $SU(3)$. I propose $\textit{flux channeling}$ as a method to address that and allied questions about triality flux numerically, and indicate how to implement it for electric and magnetic flux in material systems. That bulk is framed with broad-stroke, necessarily selective sketches of the past and possible future of strong interaction physics. At the end, I've added an expression of gratitude for my formative experience at the Erice school, in 1973.</description>

      <title>On the resolution of the sign of gluon polarization in the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the possible existence of negative gluon helicity, $\Delta g$, has been observed to be compatible with existing empirical constraints, including from jet production in polarized proton-proton collisions at RHIC, and lattice QCD data on polarized gluon Ioffe time distributions. We perform a new global analysis of polarized parton distributions in the proton with new constraints from the high-$x$ region of deep-inelastic scattering (DIS). A dramatic reduction in the quality of the fit for the negative $\Delta g$ replicas compared to those with positive $\Delta g$ suggest that the negative $\Delta g$ solution cannot simultaneously account for high-$x$ polarized DIS data along with lattice and polarized jet data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in $2+1$D Gauge Theories with Dynamical Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) has emerged as an intriguing paradigm of weak ergodicity breaking in nonintegrable quantum many-body models, particularly lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions. However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial dimension tend to vanish in $d{&gt;}1$, it is important to probe this question. Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM), as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic. Our results further shed light on the intimate connection between gauge invariance and QMBS, and highlight the persistence of scarring in higher spatial dimensions. Our findings can be tested in near-term analog and digital quantum simulators, and we demonstrate their accessibility on a recently proposed cold-atom analog quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Solving lattice gauge theories using the quantum Krylov algorithm and qubitization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</description>

      <title>Hybrid analysis of radiative corrections to neutron decay with current algebra and effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a useful framework for high-precision studies of the neutron beta decay by merging the current algebra description and the fixed-order effective field theory calculation of the electroweak radiative corrections to the neutron axial form factor. We discuss the advantages of this hybrid method and show that it only requires a minimal amount of lattice QCD inputs to achieve a $10^{-4}$ theory accuracy for the Standard Model prediction of the neutron lifetime and the axial-to-vector coupling ratio $\lambda$, both important to the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on the Variation of the Weak Scale from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the recent EMPRESS data on the $^4$He abundance in Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ and compare our calculation to the recently published work of Burns et al.~[1]. The EMPRESS result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $0.03 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.07$. However, as first noted in~[1], a Higgs VEV in this range would worsen the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the deuterium abundance significantly.</description>

      <title>Chiral gauge theory at the boundary between topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I demonstrate how chiral fermions with an exact gauge symmetry can appear on the d-dimensional boundary of a finite volume (d+1)-dimensional manifold, without any light mirror partners. The condition for the d-dimensional boundary theory to be local is that gauge anomalies cancel and that the volume be large. This can likely be achieved on a lattice and provides a new paradigm for the lattice regularization of chiral gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Weyl fermions on a finite lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenon of unpaired Weyl fermions appearing on the sole 2n-dimensional boundary of a (2n+1)-dimensional manifold with massive Dirac fermions was recently analyzed in a companion paper by one of the authors. In this Letter we show that similar unpaired Weyl edge states can be seen on a finite lattice. In particular, we consider the discretized Hamiltonian for a Wilson fermion in (2+1) dimensions with a 1+1 dimensional boundary and continuous time. We demonstrate that the low lying boundary spectrum is indeed Weyl-like: it has a linear dispersion relation and definite chirality and circulates in only one direction around the boundary. We comment on how our results are consistent with Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. This work removes one potential obstacle facing the program for regulating chiral gauge theories recently proposed by one of the authors.</description>

      <title>Nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions: flavour separation and zeroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>
