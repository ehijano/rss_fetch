      <title>Solution to a problem on isolation of cliques in uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A copy of a hypergraph $F$ is called an $F$-copy. Let $K_k^r$ denote the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph whose vertex set is $[k] = \{1, \dots, k\}$ (that is, the edges of $K_k^r$ are the $r$-element subsets of $[k]$). Given an $r$-uniform $n$-vertex hypergraph $H$, the $K_k^r$-isolation number of $H$, denoted by $\iota(H, K_k^r)$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set of $H$ such that the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$ of $D$ intersects the vertex sets of the $K_k^r$-copies contained by $H$ (equivalently, $H-N[D]$ contains no $K_k^r$-copy). In this note, we show that if $2 \leq r \leq k$ and $H$ is connected, then $\iota(H, K_k^r) \leq \frac{n}{k+1}$ unless $H$ is a $K_k^r$-copy or $k = r = 2$ and $H$ is a $5$-cycle. This solves a recent problem of Li, Zhang and Ye. The result for $r = 2$ (that is, $H$ is a graph) was proved by Fenech, Kaemawichanurat and the author, and is used to prove the result for any $r$. The extremal structures for $r = 2$ were determined by various authors. We use this to determine the extremal structures for any $r$.</description>

      <title>Tight paths in fully directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that every tournament has a spanning path. We consider hypergraph analogues. In an \emph{$r$-uniform fully directed hypergraph}, or \emph{$r$-digraph}, every edge is a list or $r$ distinct vertices. An $(r,k)$-tournament is an $r$-digraph $G$ such that for every $r$-set $S$ of vertices in $G$, exactly $k$ of the orderings of $S$ are edges in $G$. A \emph{directed tight path} is an $r$-digraph $G$ whose vertices can be ordered so that the intervals of size $r$ are the edges in $G$. Let $f(n,r,k)$ be the maximum $s$ such that every $n$-vertex $(r,k)$-tournament contains a tight path on $s$ vertices. Since every tournament has a spanning path, we have $f(n,2,1)=n$.
  In this paper, we show that the minimum $k$ such that $f(n,r,k)$ tends to infinity with $n$ is in the interval $\left[\left(1-\frac{1}{r}-O(\frac{\log r}{r^2\log\log r})\right)r!, ~\left(1-\frac{1}{r} - \frac{\varphi(r)-1}{r!}\right)r!\right]$ where $\varphi(r)$ is the Euler Totient Function, and we find the exact value when $r\le 5$. We also show that $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n/\log \log n}) \le f(n,3,3) \le O(\log n)$ and $f(n,3,4)\ge \Omega(n^{1/5})$.</description>

      <title>Grid designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a grid graph as a Cartesian product of path-graphs $P_n$ or cycle-graphs $C_n$, and define a grid design as a $G$-design where the graph $G$ is a grid graph, that is, a decomposition of a complete graph into edge-disjoint subgraphs isomorphic to $G$. We show that when $n$ is an odd prime or the square of an odd prime, the toroidal grid-graph $G = C_n \square C_n$ admits a $G$-design. In the less symmetrical case of products of path-graphs, we prove that $G = P_3 \square P_3$ does not admit a $G$-design but that $G = P_4 \square P_4$ does. This last result is the special case that motivated the present paper: a $P_4 \square P_4$-design corresponds to a way of successively scrambling a Connections puzzle so that each pair of words occurs adjacently exactly once. Our constructions use the arithmetic of finite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This text contains some notes on the Griesmer bound. In particular, we give a geometric proof of the Griesmer bound for the generalized weights and show that a Solomon--Stiffler type construction attains it if the minimum distance is sufficiently large. We also determine the parameters of optimal binary codes for dimensions at most seven and the optimal ternary codes for dimensions at most five.</description>

      <title>On the Largest Convexity Number of Co-Finite Sets in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convexity number of a set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is the minimum number of convex subsets required to cover it. We study the following question: what is the largest possible convexity number $f(n)$ of $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus S$, where $S$ is a set of $n$ points in general position in the plane? We prove that for all $n \geq 4$, $\lfloor\frac{n+5}{2}\rfloor \leq f(n) \leq \frac{7n+44}{11}$. We also show that for every $n \geq 4$, if the points of $S$ are in convex position then the convexity number of $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus S$ is $\lfloor\frac{n+5}{2}\rfloor$. This solves a problem of Lawrence and Morris [Finite sets as complements of finite unions of convex sets, Disc. Comput. Geom. 42 (2009), 206-218].</description>

      <title>Algebraic Study of Discrete Imsetal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of imsets, introduced by Studen\'y, provides a geometric and combinatorial description of conditional independence statements. Elementary conditional independence statements over a finite set of discrete random variables correspond to column vectors of a matrix generating a polyhedral cone, and the associated toric ideals encode algebraic relations among these statements. In this paper, we study discrete probability distributions on sets of three and four random variables, including both binary variables and combinations of binary and ternary variables. We investigate the structure of conditional independence ideals arising from elementary and non-elementary CI relations and analyze the algebraic properties of imsetal models induced by faces of the elementary imset cone. Our results highlight connections between combinatorial CI relations, their associated ideals, and the geometry of imset cones.</description>

      <title>The Mattila-Sj\"olin problem for the k-distance over a finite field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ be a $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements. For $x\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$, let $\|x\| = x_1^2+\dots+x_d^2$. By abuse of terminology, we shall call $\|\cdot\|$ a norm on $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. For a subset $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$, let $\Delta(E)$ be the distance set on $E$ defined as $\Delta(E):=\{\|x-y\| : x, y \in E \}$. The Mattila-Sj\"olin problem seeks the smallest exponent $\alpha&gt;0$ such that $\Delta(E) =\mathbb{F}_q$ for all subsets $E \subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $|E| \geq Cq^\alpha$. In this article, we consider this problem for a variant of this norm, which generates a smaller distance set than the norm $\|\cdot\|.$ Namely, we replace the norm $\|\cdot\|$ by the so-called $k$-norm $(1 \leq k \leq d)$, which can be viewed as a kind of deformation of $\|\cdot\|$. To derive our result on the Mattila-Sj\"olin problem for the $k$-norm, we use a combinatorial method to analyze various summations arising from the discrete Fourier machinery. Even though our distance set is smaller than the one in the Mattila-Sj\"olin problem, for some $k$ we still obtain the same result as that of Iosevich and Rudnev (2007), which deals with the Mattila-Sj\"olin problem. Furthermore, our result is sharp in all odd dimensions.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Design and Graph-Based Classification for Rectilinear-Shaped Modules in Floor Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graph-theoretic framework for constructing floor plans that support non-rectangular modules, with particular emphasis on L-shaped and T-shaped geometries. Unlike traditional approaches that primarily focus on rectangular modules and outer boundary constraints, our method explicitly incorporates structural restrictions that arise when realizing more complex module shapes within rectangular floor-plan representations. The framework is based on triangulated graphs and investigates how algorithmic graph theory techniques can be used to embed L and T-shaped modules while preserving prescribed adjacencies.
  We show that not every triangulated graph admits such realizations and identify structural limitations that prevent the existence of the desired module geometries. To capture these limitations, we introduce a shape-preservation constraint that ensures module geometries cannot be altered through boundary deformation, as such changes would either increase the combinatorial complexity of neighboring modules or violate adjacency relationships.
  We propose a linear-time construction algorithm based on a prioritized canonical ordering that realizes L and T-shaped modules in graphs containing at least one internal K4, or two internal K4 subgraphs satisfying specific existence conditions. The algorithm is simple, constructive, and directly implementable, making it suitable for practical floor-plan generation workflows. We conclude by discussing extensions to additional module shapes and broader classes of supporting graph structures.</description>

      <title>Towards a conjecture on long induced rainbow paths in triangle-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a triangle-free graph $G$ with chromatic number $k$ and a proper vertex coloring $\phi$ of $G$, it is conjectured that $G$ contains an induced rainbow path on $k$ vertices under $\phi$. Scott and Seymour proved the existence of an induced rainbow path on $(\log \log \log k)^{\frac{1}{3}- o(1)}$ vertices. We improve this to $(\log k)^{\frac{1}{2}- o(1)}$ vertices. Further, we prove the existence of an induced path that sees $\frac{k}{2}$ colors.</description>

      <title>A Reduction of the Reconstruction Conjecture using Domination and Vertex Pair Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is reconstructible if it is determined up to isomorphism from the collection of all its one-vertex-deleted subgraphs, known as the deck of G. The Reconstruction Conjecture (RC) posits that every finite simple graph with at least three vertices is reconstructible. In this paper, we prove that the class of graphs with domination number $\gamma(G)=2$ is recognizable from the deck $D(G)$. We also establish a new reduction of the RC: it holds if and only if all $2$-connected graphs $G$ with $\gamma(G)=2$ or $\operatorname{diam}(G)=\operatorname{diam}(\overline{G})=2$ are reconstructible. To aid reconstruction, we introduce two new parameters: $dv(G,k_1,k_2,k_3)$, which counts the number of non-adjacent vertex pairs in $G$ with $k_1$ common neighbours, $k_2$ neighbours exclusive to the first vertex, and $k_3$ exclusive to the second; and $dav(G,k_1,k_2,k_3)$, defined analogously for adjacent pairs. For connected graphs with at least $12$ vertices and $\gamma(G)\geq 3$, we show these parameters are reconstructible from $D(G)$ via recursive equations and induction. Finally, we prove that $k$-geodetic graphs of diameter two with $\gamma(G),\gamma(\overline{G})\geq 3$ are reconstructible under conditions where a vertex degree matches the size of a specific subset derived from these parameters.</description>

      <title>Rational codegree Tur\'an density of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a $k$-graph (i.e. a $k$-uniform hypergraph). Its minimum codegree $\delta_{k-1}(H)$ is the largest integer $t$ such that every $(k-1)$-subset of $V(H)$ is contained in at least $t$ edges of~$H$. The \emph{codegree Tur\'an density} $\gamma(\mathcal{F})$ of a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-graphs is the infimum of $\gamma &gt; 0$ such that every $k$-graph $H$ on $n\to\infty$ vertices with $\delta_{k-1}(H) \ge (\gamma+o(1))\, n$ contains some member of $\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph.
  We prove that, for every integer $k\ge3$ and every rational number $\alpha \in [0,1)$, there exists a finite family of $k$-graphs $\mathcal{F}$ such that $\gamma(\mathcal{F})=\alpha$.
  Also, for every $k \ge 3$, we establish a strong version of non-principality, namely that there are two $k$-graphs $F_1$ and $F_2$ such that the codegree Tur\'an density of $\{F_1,F_2\}$ is strictly smaller than that of each $F_i$. This answers a question of Mubayi and Zhao [J Comb Theory (A) 114 (2007) 1118--1132].</description>

      <title>Set mappings for general graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of extremal problems for set mappings has a long history. It was introduced in 1958 by Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal, who considered the case of cliques in graphs and hypergraphs. Recently, Caro, Patk\'os, Tuza and Vizer revisited this subject, and initiated the systematic study of set mapping problems for general graphs. In this paper, we prove the following result, which answers one of their questions. Let $G$ be a graph with $m$ edges and no isolated vertices and let $f : E(K_N) \rightarrow E(K_N)$ such that $f(e)$ is disjoint from $e$ for all $e \in E(K_N)$. Then for some absolute constant $C$, as long as $N \geq C m$, there is a copy $G^*$ of $G$ in $K_N$ such that $f(e)$ is disjoint from $V(G^*)$ for all $e \in E(G^*)$. The bound $N = O(m)$ is tight for cliques and is tight up to a logarithmic factor for all $G$.</description>

      <title>Existence of Strong Lefschetz algebras with Chow polynomials as Hilbert series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study Chow polynomials of weakly ranked posets and prove the existence of Gorenstein algebras with the strong Lefschetz property such that their Hilbert-Poincar\'e series agrees with the Chow polynomial, providing evidence in support of a conjecture by Ferroni, Matherne and the second author. This allows us to show strong inequalities for the coefficients of Chow polynomials; we prove log-concavity for all posets of weak rank at most six and provide counterexamples to log-concavity for any higher rank. For ranked posets we recover an even stronger condition, showing that the differences between consecutive coefficients constitute a pure O-sequence.</description>

      <title>The largest common subtree of two random trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the size and structure of the largest common subtree (LCS) between two independent Bienaym\'e trees conditioned to have size $n$. When the trees are critical with finite $2$nd and $(2+\kappa)$th moment respectively for some $\kappa&gt;0$, we prove that the LCS has size of order $\sqrt{n}$, and is approximated by the length of three paths meeting at a central node. Moreover, we show that the largest common subtree between two critical independent Bienaym\'e trees with size $n$ and finite second moments may be much larger than $\sqrt{n}$, implying that our result is tight. We also pose a number of open questions and suggestions for future research.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Integration of Differential Forms: From Abel to Zeilberger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on symbolic integration of differential forms, with a particular emphasis on historical and modern developments, from Abel's addition theorems for Abelian integrals to Zeilberger's creative telescoping for parameterized integrals. It explores closed rational $p$-forms and provides algorithmic approaches for their integration, extending classical results like Hermite reduction and Liouville's theorem. The integration of closed differential forms with parameters is further examined through telescopers, offering a unified framework for handling both algebraic and transcendental cases.</description>

Abstract: We completely characterize the conditions under which a complex unitary number is an eigenvalue of the non-backtracking matrix of an undirected graph. Further, we provide a closed formula to compute its geometric multiplicity and describe an algorithm to compute this multiplicity without making a single matrix computation.

      <title>A sufficient condition for a hypergraph to have a Berge-$k$-factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any graph (hypergraph) $G$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$, we define its incidence bipartite graph $\mathcal{I}(G)$ as the bipartite graph with bipartition $(E, V)$, where an edge $e \in E$ is adjacent to a vertex $v \in V$ in $\mathcal{I}(G)$ if and only if $e$ is incident to $v$ in $G$. This representation allows all concepts and properties of $G$ to be reformulated in terms of those of $\mathcal{I}(G)$. In this paper, we investigate the notions of graph toughness and $k$-factors in bipartite graphs through this incidence perspective. As an application, our result implies the classic theorem of Enomoto, Jackson, Katerinis, and Saito: for any integer $k \geq 1$, a $k$-tough graph $G$ has a $k$-factor if $k |V(G)|$ is even and $|V(G)| \geq k+1$. Furthermore, we extend this result to hypergraphs, without requiring uniformity.</description>

      <title>More on the number of distinct values of a class of functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous article the authors determined the best-known upper bound for the cardinality of the image set for several classes of functions, including planar functions. Here, we show that the upper bound cannot be tight for planar functions over finite fields. This follows from a more general result proving that the upper bound cannot be tight for a much larger class of functions over an abelian group of order $y^n$ with $n&gt;1$. Moreover, the tightness of the upper bound for the larger class of functions is equivalent to the existence of planar difference sets.
  To obtain better upper bounds, we first completely resolve an optimization problem involving the partitioning of a number into triangular parts. Our solution, which is algorithmic and constructive, allows us to determine tight upper bounds provided the relevant parameters are given explicitly. We also provide a suite of upper bounds which can be applied across a range of parameters. These are established via a well-studied Diophantine equation and are related to class numbers of quadratic number fields.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the realizations of zero-nonzero patterns and sign conditions of polynomials restricted to varieties and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain upper bounds, independent of the ambient dimension, for the number of realizable zero-nonzero patterns and (over ordered fields) sign conditions of a finite family of polynomials $\mathcal P$ restricted to an algebraic subset $V$ of affine or projective space. The bounds depend only on $\mathrm{card}(\mathcal P)$ and the degrees of the polynomials in $\mathcal P$, together with $\mathrm{deg}(V)$ and $\dim(V)$, and not on the dimension of the space in which $V$ is embedded. This feature is particularly useful when $V$ has small intrinsic dimension but is presented in a very high-dimensional ambient space.
  We describe several applications. First, we extend existing results on bounding the $\varepsilon$-entropy of real algebraic varieties. Second, we derive lower bounds (in terms of the number of connected components) for membership testing in semi-algebraic sets in the algebraic computation tree model. Finally, motivated by quantum complexity theory, we introduce additive and multiplicative notions of \emph{relative rank} in finite-dimensional vector spaces and algebras with respect to a fixed algebraic subset, generalizing the classical notion of tensor rank. We prove a general lower bound on the maximum relative rank of finite subsets with respect to algebraic sets of bounded degree and dimension that is again independent of the ambient dimension. As an illustration, we obtain a quantum analogue of Shannon's classical lower bound: almost all Boolean functions require classical circuits of size $\Omega(2^n/n)$, even in the presence of a quantum oracle specified by an algebraic subset of fixed degree and dimension.</description>

      <title>On large Sidon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Sidon set $M$ is a subset of $\mathbb{F}_2^t$ such that the sum of four distinct elements of $M$ is never 0. The goal is to find Sidon sets of large size. In this note we show that the graphs of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions with high linearity can be used to construct large Sidon sets. Thanks to recently constructed APN functions $\mathbb{F}_2^8\to \mathbb{F}_2^8$ with high linearity, we can construct Sidon sets of size 192 in $\mathbb{F}_2^{15}$, where the largest sets so far had size 152. Using the inverse and the Dobbertin function also gives larger Sidon sets as previously known. Each of the new large Sidon sets $M$ in $\mathbb{F}_2^t$ yields a binary linear code with $t$ check bits, minimum distance 5, and a length not known so far. Moreover, we improve the upper bound for the linearity of arbitrary APN functions.</description>

      <title>A note on the maximum diversity of intersecting families in the symmetric group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{S}_n$ be the symmetric group on the set $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. A family $\mathcal{F}\subset \mathcal{S}_n$ is called intersecting if for every $\sigma,\pi\in \mathcal{F}$ there exists some $i\in [n]$ such that $\sigma(i)=\pi(i)$. Deza and Frankl proved that the largest intersecting family of permutations is the full star, that is, the collection of all permutations with a fixed position. The diversity of an intersecting family $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as the minimum number of permutations in $\mathcal{F}$, whose deletion results in a star. In the present paper, by applying the spread approximation method developed recently by Kupavskii and Zakharov, we prove that for $n\geq 500$ the diversity of an intersecting subfamily of $\mathcal{S}_n$ is at most $(n-3)(n-3)!$, which is best possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a forest. We study polynomially high-chromatic pure pairs in graphs with no $T$ as an induced subgraph ($T$-free graphs in other words), with applications to the polynomial Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture. In addition to reproving several known results in the literature, we deduce:
  $\bullet$ If $T=P_5$ is the five-vertex path, then every $T$-free graph $G$ with clique number $w\ge2$ contains a complete pair $(A,B)$ of induced subgraphs with $\chi(A)\ge w^{-d}\chi(G)$ and $\chi(B)\ge 2^{-d}\chi(G)$, for some universal $d\ge1$. The proof uses the recent Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal result for $P_5$-free graphs. Via the classical Gy\'arf\'as path argument, such a ``polynomial versus linear high-$\chi$ complete pairs'' result can be viewed as further supporting evidence for the polynomial Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture for $P_5$. In particular, it implies
  \[\chi(G)\le w^{O(\log w/\log\log w)}\]
  which asymptotically improves the bound $\chi(G)\le w^{\log w}$ of Scott, Seymour, and Spirkl.
  $\bullet$ If $T$ and a broom satisfy the polynomial Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture, then so does their disjoint union. Unifying earlier results of Chudnovsky, Scott, Seymour, and Spirkl, and of Scott, Seymour, and Spirkl, this gives new instances of $T$ for which the conjecture holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an analogue of the shortest-path distance for graphons. The proposed method is rooted on the extension to graphons of Varadhan's formula, a result that links the solution of the heat equation on a Riemannian manifold to its geodesic distance. The resulting metric is integer-valued, and for step graphons obtained from finite graphs it is essentially equivalent to the usual shortest-path distance. We further draw a link between the Varadhan distance and the communicability distance, that contains information from all paths, not just shortest-paths, and thus provides a finer distance on graphons along with a natural isometric embedding into a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>New Sufficient Conditions for Linear-Sized Epsilon-Nets and $(p,2)$-Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $\epsilon$-net theorem for a hypergraph upper bounds the minimum size of a vertex set that pierces all $\epsilon$-heavy hyperedges. A $(p,2)$-theorem bounds from above the minimum size of a vertex set that pierces all hyperedges, in terms of the maximum size of a set of pairwise disjoint hyperedges. Numerous works studied $\epsilon$-net theorems and $(p,2)$-theorems that guarantee the existence of small-sized piercing sets.
  We focus on the question: In which settings the asymptotically smallest possible piercing sets -- i.e., $\epsilon$-nets of size $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ and piercing sets of size $O(p)$ in $(p,2)$-theorems, are guaranteed? We obtain several sufficient criteria for the existence of such linear $\epsilon$-net theorems and $(p,2)$-theorems that unveil interesting connections to graph theory and improve and generalize several previous results. Most notably, we exhibit an unexpected relation of $\epsilon$-nets to the classical Zarankiewicz's problem in graph theory. We show that a linear bound in the Zarankiewicz-type problem that asks for the maximum size of a bipartite graph with no copy of $K_{2,t}$, implies a linear $\epsilon$-net theorem for the corresponding neighborhood hypergraph. We also show that hypergraphs with a hereditarily linear-sized Delaunay graph admit an almost linear $(p,2)$-theorem, and deduce that incidence hypergraphs of non-piercing regions in the plane admit a linear $(p,2)$-theorem, significantly improving previous results on such hypergraphs.
  Our work presents a landscape of sufficient conditions for the existence of linear $\epsilon$-net theorems and $(p,2)$-theorems, with complex interrelations between them. Many of the interrelations are still unknown and call for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero forcing is an iterative graph coloring process studied for its wide array of applications. In this process, the vertices of the graph are initially designated as blue or white, and a zero forcing set is a set of initially blue vertices that results in all vertices becoming blue after repeated application of a color change rule. The zero forcing number of a graph is the minimum cardinality of a zero forcing set. The zero forcing number has motivated the introduction of a host of variants motivated by linear-algebraic or graph-theoretic contexts. We define a variant we term the $k$-fault tolerant zero forcing number, which is the minimum cardinality of a set $B$ such that every subset of $B$ of cardinality $|B|-k$ is a zero forcing set. We study the values of this parameter on various graph families, the behavior under several graph operations, and characterize the 1-fault tolerant zero forcing number of trees.</description>

Abstract: We obtain some $d\ge2$ such that every graph $G$ with no induced copy of the five-vertex path $P_5$ has at most $\alpha(G)\omega(G)^d$ vertices. This ``off-diagonal Ramsey'' statement implies that every such graph $G$ has fractional chromatic number at most $\omega(G)^d$, and is another step towards the polynomial Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture for $P_5$. The proof uses the recent Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal result for $P_5$ and adapts a decomposition argument for $P_5$-free graphs developed by the author in an earlier paper.</description>

We prove that for any graph $G$ in this class, $\chi(G)\le 4$ when $\omega(G)=2$, $\chi(G)\le 6$ when $\omega(G)=3$, and $\chi(G)=\omega(G)$ when $\omega(G)\ge 4$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$, respectively. This result extends the known chromatic bounds for $(P_2\cup P_3,\text{ diamond})$-free graphs by showing that $(P_2\cup P_4,\text{ diamond})$-free graphs admit the same $\chi$-binding function. It also refines the chromatic bound obtained by Angeliya, Karthick and Huang [arXiv:2501.02543v3 [math.CO], 2025] for $(P_2\cup P_4,\text{ diamond})$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Tiling Triangles with $2\pi/3$ Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a question of Erd\"{o}s and inquiries by Beeson and Laczkovich, we explore the possible $N$ for which a triangle $T$ can tile into $N$ congruent copies of a triangle $R$. The \emph{reptile} cases (where $T$ is similar to $R$) and the \emph{commensurable-angles} cases (where all angles of $R$ are rational multiples of $\pi$) are well-understood. We tackle the most interesting remaining case, which is when $R$ contains an angle of $2\pi/3$ and when $T$ is one of $6$ ``sporadic'' specific triangles, of which only $2$ were known to have constructions. For each of these, we create a family of constructions and conjecture that they are the only possible $N$ that occur for these triangles.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonicity of Step-graphon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A step-graphon has the strong (resp., weak) $H$-property if a directed, random graph sampled from it has a Hamilton cycle (resp., a node-wise disjoint cycle cover) asymptotically almost surely. The weak/strong $H$-property is essentially a zero-one property. We identify key objects associated with the step-graphon that matter for the zero-one law and provide a complete characterization.</description>

      <title>Stability phenomena in Deligne--Mumford compactifications via Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the rational homology of the Deligne--Mumford compactification $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$ of the moduli space of stable curves via a family of Morse functions, namely the $\text{sys}_T$ functions. Exploiting the geometric and Morse properties of $\text{sys}_T$, including the existence of an index gap and additivity of the Morse index upon gluing maps, we reprove that in low degrees the homology of $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$ is supported entirely on the boundary $\partial \overline{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$, providing a geometric perspective complementary to Harer's classical result on the virtual cohomological dimension.
  Furthermore, we establish finite generation and stability phenomena for the rational homology across all genera and numbers of marked points. We show that for each degree $k$, a finite set of homology elements generates all $k$-th homology classes via attaching copies of thrice-marked $\mathbb{P}^1$. This result also recovers previously known stability in the number of marked points, such as Tosteson's theorem.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal moments in free and c-free probability and Motzkin paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinitesimal moments associated with infinitesimal freeness and infinitesimal conditional freeness are studied. For free random variables, we consider continuous deformations of moment functionals associated with Motzkin paths $w$, which provide a decomposition of their moments, and we compute their derivatives at zero. We show that the first-order derivative of each functional vanishes unless the path has exactly one local maximum. Geometrically, this means that $w$ is a pyramid path, which is consistent with the characteristic formula for alternating moments of infinitesimally free centered random variables. In this framework, infinitesimal Boolean independence is also obtained and it corresponds to flat paths. A similar approach is developed for infinitesimal conditional freeness, for which we show that the only moment functionals that have a non-zero first-order derivative are associated with concatenations of a pyramid path and a flat path. This charaterization leads to a Leibniz-type definition of infinitesimal conditional freeness at the level of moments.</description>
