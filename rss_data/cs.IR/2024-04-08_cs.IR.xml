      <title>GenQREnsemble: Zero-Shot LLM Ensemble Prompting for Generative Query Reformulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query Reformulation(QR) is a set of techniques used to transform a user's original search query to a text that better aligns with the user's intent and improves their search experience. Recently, zero-shot QR has been shown to be a promising approach due to its ability to exploit knowledge inherent in large language models. By taking inspiration from the success of ensemble prompting strategies which have benefited many tasks, we investigate if they can help improve query reformulation. In this context, we propose an ensemble based prompting technique, GenQREnsemble which leverages paraphrases of a zero-shot instruction to generate multiple sets of keywords ultimately improving retrieval performance. We further introduce its post-retrieval variant, GenQREnsembleRF to incorporate pseudo relevant feedback. On evaluations over four IR benchmarks, we find that GenQREnsemble generates better reformulations with relative nDCG@10 improvements up to 18% and MAP improvements upto 24% over the previous zero-shot state-of-art. On the MSMarco Passage Ranking task, GenQREnsembleRF shows relative gains of 5% MRR using pseudo-relevance feedback, and 9% nDCG@10 using relevant feedback documents.</description>

      <title>Understanding Language Modeling Paradigm Adaptations in Recommender Systems: Lessons Learned and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved tremendous success in the field of Natural Language Processing owing to diverse training paradigms that empower LLMs to effectively capture intricate linguistic patterns and semantic representations. In particular, the recent "pre-train, prompt and predict" training paradigm has attracted significant attention as an approach for learning generalizable models with limited labeled data. In line with this advancement, these training paradigms have recently been adapted to the recommendation domain and are seen as a promising direction in both academia and industry. This half-day tutorial aims to provide a thorough understanding of extracting and transferring knowledge from pre-trained models learned through different training paradigms to improve recommender systems from various perspectives, such as generality, sparsity, effectiveness and trustworthiness. In this tutorial, we first introduce the basic concepts and a generic architecture of the language modeling paradigm for recommendation purposes. Then, we focus on recent advancements in adapting LLM-related training strategies and optimization objectives for different recommendation tasks. After that, we will systematically introduce ethical issues in LLM-based recommender systems and discuss possible approaches to assessing and mitigating them. We will also summarize the relevant datasets, evaluation metrics, and an empirical study on the recommendation performance of training paradigms. Finally, we will conclude the tutorial with a discussion of open challenges and future directions.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Methods for Evaluating Generative IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information retrieval systems increasingly incorporate generative components. For example, in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system, a retrieval component might provide a source of ground truth, while a generative component summarizes and augments its responses. In other systems, a large language model (LLM) might directly generate responses without consulting a retrieval component. While there are multiple definitions of generative information retrieval (Gen-IR) systems, in this paper we focus on those systems where the system's response is not drawn from a fixed collection of documents or passages. The response to a query may be entirely new text never. Since traditional IR evaluation methods break down under this model, we explore various methods that extend traditional offline evaluation approaches to the Gen-IR context. Offline IR evaluation traditionally employs paid human assessors, but increasingly LLMs are replacing human assessment, demonstrating capabilities similar or superior to crowdsourced labels. Given that Gen-IR systems do not generate responses from a fixed set, we assume that methods for Gen-IR evaluation must largely depend on LLM-generated labels. Along with methods based on binary and graded relevance, we explore methods based on explicit subtopics, pairwise preferences, and embeddings. We first validate these methods against human assessments on several TREC Deep Learning Track tasks; we then apply these methods to evaluate the output of several purely generative systems. For each method we consider both its ability to act autonomously, without the need for human labels or other input, and its ability to support human auditing. To trust these methods, we must be assured that their results align with human assessments. In order to do so, evaluation criteria must be transparent, so that outcomes can be audited by human assessors.</description>

      <title>Dwell in the Beginning: How Language Models Embed Long Documents for Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the existence of positional biases in Transformer-based models for text representation learning, particularly in the context of web document retrieval. We build on previous research that demonstrated loss of information in the middle of input sequences for causal language models, extending it to the domain of representation learning. We examine positional biases at various stages of training for an encoder-decoder model, including language model pre-training, contrastive pre-training, and contrastive fine-tuning. Experiments with the MS-MARCO document collection reveal that after contrastive pre-training the model already generates embeddings that better capture early contents of the input, with fine-tuning further aggravating this effect.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Robustness of Counterfactual Learning to Rank Models: A Reproducibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) has attracted extensive attention in the IR community for its ability to leverage massive logged user interaction data to train ranking models. While the CLTR models can be theoretically unbiased when the user behavior assumption is correct and the propensity estimation is accurate, their effectiveness is usually empirically evaluated via simulation-based experiments due to a lack of widely-available, large-scale, real click logs. However, the mainstream simulation-based experiments are somewhat limited as they often feature a single, deterministic production ranker and simplified user simulation models to generate the synthetic click logs. As a result, the robustness of CLTR models in complex and diverse situations is largely unknown and needs further investigation.
  To address this problem, in this paper, we aim to investigate the robustness of existing CLTR models in a reproducibility study with extensive simulation-based experiments that (1) use both deterministic and stochastic production rankers, each with different ranking performance, and (2) leverage multiple user simulation models with different user behavior assumptions. We find that the DLA models and IPS-DCM show better robustness under various simulation settings than IPS-PBM and PRS with offline propensity estimation. Besides, the existing CLTR models often fail to outperform the naive click baselines when the production ranker has relatively high ranking performance or certain randomness, which suggests an urgent need for developing new CLTR algorithms that work for these settings.</description>

      <title>Large language models as oracles for instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes andproperties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multi- ple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is semi-automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>RAT: Retrieval-Augmented Transformer for Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting click-through rates (CTR) is a fundamental task for Web applications, where a key issue is to devise effective models for feature interactions. Current methodologies predominantly concentrate on modeling feature interactions within an individual sample, while overlooking the potential cross-sample relationships that can serve as a reference context to enhance the prediction. To make up for such deficiency, this paper develops a Retrieval-Augmented Transformer (RAT), aiming to acquire fine-grained feature interactions within and across samples. By retrieving similar samples, we construct augmented input for each target sample. We then build Transformer layers with cascaded attention to capture both intra- and cross-sample feature interactions, facilitating comprehensive reasoning for improved CTR prediction while retaining efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness of RAT and suggest its advantage in long-tail scenarios. The code has been open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/YushenLi807/WWW24-RAT}.</description>

      <title>Generalized Rainbow Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new framework for designing differentially private (DP) mechanisms via randomized graph colorings, called rainbow differential privacy. In this framework, datasets are nodes in a graph, and two neighboring datasets are connected by an edge. Each dataset in the graph has a preferential ordering for the possible outputs of the mechanism, and these orderings are called rainbows. Different rainbows partition the graph of connected datasets into different regions. We show that if a DP mechanism at the boundary of such regions is fixed and it behaves identically for all same-rainbow boundary datasets, then a unique optimal $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP mechanism exists (as long as the boundary condition is valid) and can be expressed in closed-form. Our proof technique is based on an interesting relationship between dominance ordering and DP, which applies to any finite number of colors and for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP, improving upon previous results that only apply to at most three colors and for $\epsilon$-DP. We justify the homogeneous boundary condition assumption by giving an example with non-homogeneous boundary condition, for which there exists no optimal DP mechanism.</description>

      <title>Survey of Computerized Adaptive Testing: A Machine Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) provides an efficient and tailored method for assessing the proficiency of examinees, by dynamically adjusting test questions based on their performance. Widely adopted across diverse fields like education, healthcare, sports, and sociology, CAT has revolutionized testing practices. While traditional methods rely on psychometrics and statistics, the increasing complexity of large-scale testing has spurred the integration of machine learning techniques. This paper aims to provide a machine learning-focused survey on CAT, presenting a fresh perspective on this adaptive testing method. By examining the test question selection algorithm at the heart of CAT's adaptivity, we shed light on its functionality. Furthermore, we delve into cognitive diagnosis models, question bank construction, and test control within CAT, exploring how machine learning can optimize these components. Through an analysis of current methods, strengths, limitations, and challenges, we strive to develop robust, fair, and efficient CAT systems. By bridging psychometric-driven CAT research with machine learning, this survey advocates for a more inclusive and interdisciplinary approach to the future of adaptive testing.</description>

      <title>BanglaAutoKG: Automatic Bangla Knowledge Graph Construction with Semantic Neural Graph Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have proven essential in information processing and reasoning applications because they link related entities and give context-rich information, supporting efficient information retrieval and knowledge discovery; presenting information flow in a very effective manner. Despite being widely used globally, Bangla is relatively underrepresented in KGs due to a lack of comprehensive datasets, encoders, NER (named entity recognition) models, POS (part-of-speech) taggers, and lemmatizers, hindering efficient information processing and reasoning applications in the language. Addressing the KG scarcity in Bengali, we propose BanglaAutoKG, a pioneering framework that is able to automatically construct Bengali KGs from any Bangla text. We utilize multilingual LLMs to understand various languages and correlate entities and relations universally. By employing a translation dictionary to identify English equivalents and extracting word features from pre-trained BERT models, we construct the foundational KG. To reduce noise and align word embeddings with our goal, we employ graph-based polynomial filters. Lastly, we implement a GNN-based semantic filter, which elevates contextual understanding and trims unnecessary edges, culminating in the formation of the definitive KG. Empirical findings and case studies demonstrate the universal effectiveness of our model, capable of autonomously constructing semantically enriched KGs from any text.</description>
