      <title>Simultaneous approximation of multiple degenerate states using a single neural network quantum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network quantum states (NQS) excel at approximating ground states of quantum many-body systems, but approximating all states of a degenerate manifold is nevertheless computationally expensive. We propose a single-trunk multi-head (ST-MH) NQS ensemble that share a feature extracting trunk while attaching lightweight heads for each target state. Using a cost function which also has an orthogonality term, we derive exact analytic gradients and overlap derivatives needed to train ST-MH within standard variational Monte Carlo (VMC) workflows. We prove that ST-MH can represent every degenerate eigenstate exactly whenever the feature map of latent width $h$, augmented with a constant, has column space containing the linear span of the targets' log-moduli and (chosen) phase branches together with the constant on the common support where all states are non-vanishing. Under this condition, ST-MH reduces the parameter count and can reduce the leading VMC cost by a factor equal to the degeneracy $K$ relative to other algorithms when $K$ is modest and in trunk dominated regimes. As a numerical proof-of-principle, we validate and benchmark the ST-MH approach on the frustrated spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model at the Majumdar-Ghosh point on periodic ring lattices of up to 8 sites. By obtaining the momentum eigenstates, we demonstrate that ST-MH attains high fidelity and energy accuracy across degenerate ground state manifolds while using significantly lower computing resources. Lastly we provide a qualitative computational cost analysis which incentivise the applicability of the ST-MH ensemble under certain criteria on the latent width.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Wavelet Method for Linear Boundary-Value Problems in Sylvester Matrix Equation Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-order spacetime numerical method for discretizing and solving linear initial-boundary value problems using wavelet-based techniques with user-prescribed error estimates. The spacetime wavelet discretization yields a system of algebraic equations resulting in a Sylvester matrix equation. We solve this system with a Global Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method in conjunction with a wavelet-based recursive algorithm to improve convergence. We perform rigorous verification studies using linear partial differential equations (PDEs) with both convective and diffusive terms. The results of these simulations show the high-order convergence rates for the solution and derivative approximations predicted by wavelet theory. We demonstrate the utility of solving the Sylvester equation through comparisons to the commonly-used Kronecker product formulation. We show that our recursive wavelet-based algorithm that generates initial guesses for the iterative Global GMRES method improves the performance of the solver.</description>

      <title>Towards Reasoning for PDE Foundation Models: A Reward-Model-Driven Inference-Time-Scaling Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking" strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational workflows in physics and engineering.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear and Meta-Stable Dynamics in Financial Markets: Evidence from High Frequency Crypto Currency Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work builds upon the long-standing conjecture that linear diffusion models are inadequate for complex market dynamics. Specifically, it provides experimental validation for the author's prior arguments that realistic market dynamics are governed by higher-order (cubic and higher) non-linearities in the drift. As the diffusion drift is given by the negative gradient of a potential function, this means that a non-linear drift translates into a non-quadratic potential. These arguments were based both on general theoretical grounds as well as a structured approach to modeling the price dynamics which incorporates money flows and their impact on market prices. Here, we find direct confirmation of this view by analyzing high-frequency crypto currency data at different time scales ranging from minutes to months. We find that markets can be characterized by either a single-well or a double-well potential, depending on the time period and sampling frequency, where a double-well potential may signal market uncertainty or stress.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Complexity in Many-body Systems from Positivity Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Area laws describe how entanglement entropy scales and thus provide important necessary conditions for efficient quantum many-body simulation, but they do not, by themselves, yield a direct measure of computational complexity. Here we introduce a complementary framework based on $p$-particle positivity conditions from reduced density matrix (RDM) theory. These conditions form a hierarchy of $N$-representability constraints for an RDM to correspond to a valid $N$-particle quantum system, becoming exact when the Hamiltonian can be expressed as a convex combination of positive semidefinite $p$-particle operators. We prove a general complexity bound: if a quantum system is solvable with level-$p$ positivity independent of its size, then its entanglement complexity scales polynomially with order $p$. This theorem connects structural constraints on RDMs with computational tractability and provides a rigorous framework for certifying when many-body methods including RDM methods can efficiently simulate correlated quantum matter and materials.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Induced Orbital-Angular-Momentum Selectivity in Electron Transmission and Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality-induced orbital-angular-momentum selectivity (CIOAMS) in electron transmission and scattering processes is investigated. Polarization of the OAM of an electron traversing chiral media is first studied via electronic wavepacket propagation using the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. Next, spatial resolution of wavepackets carrying opposite OAM, following scattering from a corrugated surface is demonstrated. This suggests that OAM may play a significant role in the mechanisms underlying chirality induced spin selectivity, measured for electrons crossing chiral media in setups involving Mott polarimetry. Our results highlight the potential to exploit CIOAMS in innovative emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Theory of dynamical superradiance in organic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network Approach to Multi-radionuclide TDCR Beta Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability, and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$ spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions (mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error = 0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998), validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization, real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is required.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Galactic Cosmic Ray Modulation in the Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) penetration through the heliosphere to the vicinity of the Sun is considered. Galactic cosmic rays are charged particles with energies exceeding 10 MeV/nucl., originating from far beyond the boundaries of our Solar System. As they penetrate through the heliosphere - the region of space filled by the solar wind - they interact strongly with the interplanetary magnetic field. In this paper, we present numerical approaches to solving the so-called Parker transport equation for the isotropic velocity distribution function of GCRs. This equation includes a convective term, anisotropic diffusion, adiabatic cooling, and drifts. Additionally, the diffusion coefficient is spatially and energy-dependent, varying by several orders of magnitude. Our numerical approaches are based on the finite-difference method (Crank-Nicolson scheme) and the stochastic differential equations (SDE) method. The numerical methods were validated against a known analytical solution under simplified conditions. For the general problem formulation, which involves anisotropic diffusion and the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field configuration, we used the most efficient and flexible SDE method and compared the numerical results with the data from the works of Kota &amp; Jokipii (1983) and Burger (2012). Special attention was devoted to incorporating drift along the heliospheric current sheet in the model.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Flow Matching for Symmetry-Breaking Bifurcation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking. Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity, averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>The frustrated Ising model on the honeycomb lattice: Metastability and universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Ising model with competing ferromagnetic nearest- and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions of strengths $J_1 &gt; 0$ and $J_2 &lt; 0$, respectively, on the honeycomb lattice. For $J_2 &gt; - J_1 / 4$ it has a ferromagnetic ground state, and previous work has shown that at least for $J_2 \gtrsim -0.2 J_1$ the transition is in the Ising universality class. For even lower $J_2$ some indicators pointing towards a first-order transition were reported. By utilizing population annealing Monte Carlo simulations together with a rejection-free and adaptive update, we can equilibrate systems with $J_2$ as low as $-0.23 J_1$. By means of a finite-size scaling analysis we show that the system undergoes a second-order phase transition within the Ising universality class at least down to $J_2 =-0.23 J_1$ and, most likely, for all $J_2 &gt; - J_1 / 4$. As we show here, there exist very long-lived metastable states in this system explaining the first-order like behavior seen in only partially equilibrated systems.</description>

      <title>Very High-order Compact Gas-kinetic Scheme With Discontinuity Feedback Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust and efficient very high-order scheme for compressible flow simulation, addressing critical limitations of existing high-order methods. The proposed scheme combines the compact gas-kinetic scheme (CGKS) with an adaptive stencil extension reconstruction with discontinuity feedback factor (ASE-DFF), achieving significant improvements in both robustness and computational efficiency. Traditional weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes suffer from reduced robustness at higher order and require costly smoothness indicators for large stencils. Meanwhile, compact methods based on Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and Flux Reconstruction (FR) struggle with poor time-marching efficiency. In contrast, the ASE-DFF-CGKS introduces two key innovations: (1) a unified framework enabling arbitrarily high-order compact gas-kinetic scheme without sacrificing large CFL number, and (2) a discontinuity feedback factor that eliminates the need for expensive smoothness indicator calculations while essentially keeping first-order robustness near discontinuities. The scheme's advantages are demonstrated through benchmark simulations. It maintains a CFL number above 0.5 for up to 9th-order case, unlike conventional compact methods that restrict a CFL less than 0.05. Also it delivers high-resolution results for flow involving strong shock and rarefaction wave. This work provides a practically impactful solution for high-fidelity compressible flow simulation, balancing computational efficiency, high-order accuracy and robustness in challenging flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup for Nonreversible Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms can potentially solve a handful of problems more efficiently than their classical counterparts. In that context, it has been discussed that Markov chains problems could be solved significantly faster using quantum computing. Indeed, previous work suggests that quantum computers could accelerate sampling from the stationary distribution of reversible Markov chains. However, in practice, certain physical processes of interest are nonreversible in the probabilistic sense and reversible Markov chains can sometimes be replaced by more efficient nonreversible chains targeting the same stationary distribution. This study constructs Markov chain reversibilizations and develops quantum algorithmic techniques to accelerate nonreversible processes. Such an up-to-exponential quantum speedup goes beyond the predicted quadratic quantum acceleration for reversible chains and is likely to have a decisive impact on many applications ranging from statistics and machine learning to computational modeling in physics, chemistry, biology and finance.</description>

      <title>Parallel Collisionless Shocks in strongly Magnetized Electron-Ion Plasma. I. Temperature anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless electron-ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter $\sigma_i$ in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ($\sigma_i &gt; 1$) exhibit lower density compression ratios ($R \sim 2$), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration, while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the transition region, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a supra-thermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in weakly and strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) behavior in strongly magnetized cases. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Dynamics of Hard Spheres in the Fluid, Crystalline, and Glassy Regimes</title>

Abstract: We investigate the response of a system of hard spheres to two classes of perturbations over a range of densities spanning the fluid, crystalline, and glassy regimes within a molecular dynamics framework. Firstly, we consider the relaxation of a "thermal inhomogeneity," in which a central region of particles is given a higher temperature than its surroundings and is then allowed to evolve under Newtonian dynamics. In this case, the hot central "core" of particles expands and collides with the cold surrounding material, creating a transient radially-expanding "compression wave," which is rapidly dissipated by particle-particle collisions and interaction with periodic images at the boundary, leading to a rapid relaxation to equilibrium. Secondly, we consider a rapid compression of the spheres into a disordered glassy state at high densities. Such rapidly compressed systems exhibit very slow structural relaxation times, many orders of magnitude longer than thermalization times for simple temperature inhomogeneities. We find that thermal relaxation of the velocity distribution is determined simply by the total collision rate, whereas structural relaxation requires coordinated collective motion, which is strongly suppressed at high density, although some particle rearrangement nevertheless occurs. We further find that collisions propagate significantly faster through glassy systems than through crystalline systems at the same density, which leads to very rapid relaxation of velocity perturbations, although structural relaxation remains very slow. These results extend the validity of previous observations that glassy systems exhibit a hybrid character, sharing features with both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we introduce the hard sphere causal graph, a network-based characterization of the dynamical history of a hard sphere system, which encapsulates several useful...</description>

      <title>Reentrant localization in a quasiperiodic chain with correlated hopping sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02716</link>

Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems are known to exhibit localization transitions in low dimensions, wherein all electronic states become localized beyond a critical disorder strength. Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered a reentrant localization (RL) phenomenon: upon further increasing the quasiperiodic modulation strength beyond the localization threshold, a subset of previously localized states can become delocalized again within a specific parameter window. While RL transitions have been primarily explored in systems with simple periodic modulations, such as dimerized or long-range hopping integrals, the impact of more intricate or correlated hopping structures on RL behavior remains largely elusive. In this work, we investigate the localization behavior in a one-dimensional lattice featuring staggered, correlated on-site potentials following the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, along with off-diagonal hopping modulations structured according to quasiperiodic Fibonacci and Bronze Mean sequences. By systematically analyzing the fractal dimension, inverse participation ratio, and normalized participation ratio, we demonstrate the occurrence of RL transitions induced purely by the interplay between quasiperiodic on-site disorder and correlated hopping. We further examine the parameter space to determine the specific regimes that give rise to RL. Our findings highlight the crucial role of underlying structural correlations in governing localization-delocalization transitions in low-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, where the correlated disorder manifests in both diagonal and off-diagonal terms.</description>

      <title>Equivariant U-Shaped Neural Operators for the Cahn-Hilliard Phase-Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation, plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries. Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics, achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.</description>
