      <title>Surrogate Models for Linear Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear response theory is a well-established method in physics and chemistry for exploring excitations of many-body systems. In particular, the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) provides a powerful microscopic framework by building excitations on top of the mean-field vacuum; however, its high computational cost limits model calibration and uncertainty quantification studies. Here, we present two complementary QRPA surrogate models and apply them to study response functions of finite nuclei. One is a reduced-order model that exploits the underlying QRPA structure, while the other utilizes the recently developed parametric matrix model algorithm to construct a map between the system's Hamiltonian and observables. Our benchmark applications, the calculation of the electric dipole polarizability of ${}^{180}$Yb and the $\beta$-decay half-life of ${}^{80}$Ni, show that both emulators can achieve 0.1\%--1\% accuracy while offering a six to seven orders of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art QRPA solvers. These results demonstrate that the developed QRPA emulators are well-positioned to enable Bayesian calibration and large-scale studies of computationally expensive physics models describing the properties of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Anti-Interference Communication Using Computational Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel anti-interference communication method leveraging computational antennas, utilizing time averaging and 1-bit reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to achieve robust signal modulation with minimal hardware complexity. We develop a communication model for computational antennas and propose an efficient signal processing algorithm optimized for temporal modulation. A USRP-based experimental platform is established to validate the approach under strong interference conditions (e.g., 5 dB jamming-to-signal ratio). Experimental results reveal up to an 80.9\% reduction in bit error rate (BER) and effective restoration of distorted images in transmission tests. Compared to conventional techniques like spread spectrum or frequency hopping, which require significant spectral resources, our method offers superior anti-interference performance without additional spectral overhead. This research provides valuable insights for radar detection, military communications, and next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Search in Superposed Quantum Lattice Gas Automata and Lattice Boltzmann Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the scope of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) grows to encompass ever larger problem scales, so does the interest in whether quantum computing can provide an advantage. In recent years, Quantum Lattice Gas Automata (QLGA) and Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Methods (QLBM) have emerged as promising candidates for quantum-native implementations of CFD solvers. Though the progress in developing QLGA and QLBM algorithms has been significant, it has largely focused on the development of models rather than applications. As a result, the zoo of QLGA and QLBM algorithms has grown to target several equations and to support many extensions, but the practical use of these models is largely limited to quantum state tomography and observable measurement. This limitation is crucial in practice, because unless very specific criteria are met, such measurements may cancel out any potential quantum advantage. In this paper, we propose an application based on discrete optimization and quantum search, which circumvents flow field measurement altogether. We propose methods for simulating many different lattice configurations simultaneously and describe how the usage of amplitude estimation and quantum search can provide an asymptotic quantum advantage. Throughout the paper, we provide detailed complexity analyses of gate-level implementations of our circuits and consider the benefits and costs of several encodings.</description>

      <title>Breaking gyrochronology through the collapse of coronal winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gyrochronology, a method for dating aged field stars ($\gtrsim$ a few Gyr) based on their rotation rate, has recently been shown to fail for many stars older than the sun. The explanation most often put forth is that a shutdown or mode change in the stellar dynamo leads to a sharp decrease in angular momentum loss in magnetized coronal winds. In this paper, we explore an alternate possibility, namely a collapse of the wind itself through a reduction of coronal heating. We show that in the low coronal temperature ($T_0$) limit, even at solar-like low rotation rates ($\Omega$) and coronal magnetic field strength ($B_{r0}$), magnetocentrifugal effects are important and preclude expression of the mass and angular momentum loss rates as power-laws of $T_0$ or $\Omega$ when $T_0$ drops below $\simeq 1.5\,$MK. Mass loss is found to scale linearly with power input into the wind at all coronal temperatures. Introducing an ad hoc power law relationship $T_0\propto B_{r0}^\sigma$ while retaining the ``standard'' dynamo relationship $B_{r0}\propto\Omega$, we show that reproducing the observed break in gyrochronology requires an exponent $\sigma\gtrsim 1.5$, with which is associated a drop by over 3 orders of magnitude in power input into the quiet corona. This appears physically unrealistic, given current observations of chromospheric and coronal non-thermal emission in aged solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Ehrenfest Dynamics with Topological and Geometric Phase Effects and the curious case of Elliptical intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational framework for simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics with explicit inclusion of geometric phase (GP) effects. Our approach is based on a generalized two-level Hamiltonian model that can represent various electronic state crossings - conical intersections, avoided crossings, and elliptic intersections - through appropriate parameterization. We introduce a novel prelooping trajectory initialization scheme, allowing us to encode the memory as an initial phase accumulated due to the adiabatic evolution over the potential energy surface. This is a unified framework to handle different types of level crossings by incorporating Berry curvature-based force corrections to Ehrenfest dynamics, ensuring accurate representation of topological effects. For conical intersections, our method incorporates the theoretically expected phase pi, while for elliptic intersections, it yields a parametrically tunable but loop radius (energy) independent phase different from pi. We also include an eccentricity parameter (e) in the diabatic coupling to model more realistic molecular systems. Numerical simulations demonstrate the consistency of our approach with theoretical predictions for mixing of states and inhibition from mixing due to geometric phase effects. This framework provides a valuable tool for studying quantum-classical interactions in molecular systems where geometric phase effects play a significant role. The elliptical intersection and geometric phase effect opens avenue for the design and discovery of degenerate materials. It produces a fresh look to help develop a new kind of spectroscopy and potential qubit applications. This simple Hamiltonian reveals a pathological phase protection effect E = kr, where k is real, that has great utility in a new spectroscopy design.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric integrable turbulence and rogue wave statistics for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric integrable turbulence and rogue waves (RWs) emerging from the modulation instability (MI) of plane waves for the DNLS equation. The \(n\)-th moments and ensemble-averaged kinetic and potential energy exhibit oscillatory convergence towards their steady-state values. Specifically, the amplitudes of oscillations for these indexes decay asymptotically with time as \(t^{-1.36}\), while the phase shifts demonstrate a nonlinear decay with a rate of \(t^{-0.78}\). The frequency of these oscillations is observed to be twice the maximum growth rate of MI. These oscillations can be classified into two distinct types: one is in phase with ensemble-averaged potential energy modulus $|\langle H_4\rangle|$, and the other is anti-phase. At the same time, this unity is also reflected in the wave-action spectrum \( S_k(t) \) for a given \( k \), the auto-correlation function \( g(x,t) \) for a given \( x \), as well as the PDF \( P(I,t) \). The critical feature of the turbulence is the wave-action spectrum, which follows a power-law distribution of \( |k+3|^{-\alpha} \) expect for $k=-3$. Unlike the NLS equation, the turbulence in the DNLS setting is asymmetric, primarily due to the asymmetry between the wave number of the plane wave from the MI and the perturbation wave number.. As the asymptotic peak value of \( S_k \) is observed at \( k = -3 \), the auto-correlation function exhibits a nonzero level as \( x \to \pm L/2 \). The PDF of the wave intensity asymptotically approaches the exponential distribution in an oscillatory manner. However, during the initial stage of the nonlinear phase, MI slightly increases the occurrence of RWs. This happens at the moments when the potential modulus is at its minimum, where the probability of RWs occurring in the range of \( I\in [12, 15] \) is significantly higher than in the asymptotic steady state.</description>

      <title>Resonate-and-Fire Photonic-Electronic Spiking Neurons for Fast and Efficient Light-Enabled Neuromorphic Processing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the spiking dynamics of biological neurons for brain-inspired computation. While electronic implementations of artificial spiking neurons have dominated to date, photonic approaches are attracting increasing research interest as they promise ultrafast, energy-efficient operation with low-crosstalk and high bandwidth. Nevertheless, existing photonic neurons largely mimic integrate-and-fire models, but neuroscience shows that neurons also encode information through richer mechanisms, such as the frequency and temporal patterns of spikes. Here, we present a photonic-electronic resonate-and-fire (R-and-F) spiking neuron that responds to the temporal structure of high-speed optical inputs. This is based on a light-sensitive resonant tunnelling diode that produces excitable spikes in response to nanosecond, low-power (100 microwatt) optical signals at infrared telecom wavelengths. We experimentally demonstrate control of R-and-F dynamics through inter-pulse timing of the optical stimuli and applied bias voltage, achieving bandpass filtering of both analogue and digital inputs. The R-and-F neuron also supports optical fan-in via wavelength-division multiplexed inputs from four vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). This electronic-photonic neuron exhibits key functionalities - including spike-frequency filtering, temporal pattern recognition, and digital-to-spiking conversion - critical for neuromorphic optical processing. Our approach establishes a pathway toward low-power, high-speed temporal information processing for light-enabled neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Loss functions arising from the index of agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the theoretical properties of the index of agreement loss function $L_W$, the negatively oriented counterpart of Willmott's index of agreement, a common metric in environmental sciences and engineering. We prove that $L_W$ is bounded within [0, 1], translation and scale invariant, and estimates the parameter $\Bbb{E}_{F}[\underline{y}] \pm \Bbb{V}_{F}^{1/2}[\underline{y}]$ when fitting a distribution. We propose $L_{\operatorname{NR}_2}$ as a theoretical improvement, which replaces the denominator of $L_W$ with the sum of Euclidean distances, better aligning with the underlying geometric intuition. This new loss function retains the appealing properties of $L_W$ but also admits closed-form solutions for linear model parameter estimation. We show that as the correlation between predictors and the dependent variable approaches 1, parameter estimates from squared error, $L_{\operatorname{NR}_2}$ and $L_W$ converge. This behavior is mirrored in hydrologic model calibration (a core task in water resources engineering), where performance becomes nearly identical across these loss functions. Finally, we suggest potential improvements for existing $L_p$-norm variants of the index of agreement.</description>

      <title>Grain volume distribution alters the critical phenomena in complex granular systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The grain size distribution (GSD) plays an important role in the mechanical properties of amorphous disordered systems and complex granular materials. Varying GSD causes segregation issues and alters critical behaviors. This work used the discrete element method (DEM) to investigate the rheological and critical behaviors of sheared granular flows with various GSDs. The results show that, while a unified rheological relation can be obtained, a characteristic length scale, which is associated with the contact probability and can be obtained from any GSD, is embedded within such a polydisperse disordered system. We further acquire a correlation function between critical solid fractions and dimensionless grain volume distributions. This work elucidates the effect of particle volumes on the rheology and micromechanics of dry granular systems and provides further insights in better incorporating the influence of other particle properties into a unified framework, which is helpful and critical for the corresponding engineering and geophysical problems.</description>

      <title>Domain decomposition of the modified Born series approach for large-scale wave propagation simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modified Born series (MBS) is a fast and accurate method for simulating wave propagation in complex structures. In the current implementation of the MBS, the simulation size is limited by the working memory of a single computer or graphics processing unit (GPU). Here, we present a domain decomposition method that enhances the scalability of the MBS by distributing the computations over multiple GPUs, while maintaining its accuracy, memory efficiency, and guaranteed monotonic convergence. With this new method, the computations can be performed in parallel, and a larger simulation size is possible as it is no longer limited to the memory size of a single computer or GPU. We show how to decompose large problems over subdomains and demonstrate our approach by solving the Helmholtz problem for a complex structure of $3.28\cdot 10^7$ cubic wavelengths ($320 \times 320 \times 320$ wavelengths) in just $45$ minutes with a dual-GPU simulation.</description>

      <title>Rippled Moire Superlattices for Decoupled Ferroelectric Bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry considerations suggest that moire superlattices formed by twisted two-dimensional materials should preserve overall inversion symmetry. However, experiments consistently report robust ferroelectricity in systems such as twisted bilayer h-BN, posing a fundamental discrepancy between theory and experiment regarding its microscopic origin. Here, using large-scale finite-field molecular dynamics simulations, we challenge the prevailing defect-pinning hypothesis and instead identify an out-of-plane bending field, induced by in-plane compressive strain, as the key symmetry-breaking mechanism. This strain-induced rippling drives spatially heterogeneous interlayer sliding and distorts the moire domain wall network, resulting in a four-state ferroelectric system. Remarkably, we show this mechanism can be harnessed at the nanoscale, where localized nanobubbles designate the moire lattice's fundamental hexagonal domain clusters as the smallest individually addressable ferroelectric bits, thereby imposing local control on an otherwise globally defined structure. Our findings establish a geometry-driven framework for understanding and engineering moire ferroelectrics, offering not only a route toward ultra-high-density, rewritable memory, but also a strategy for locally tuning the moire potential itself, a critical step for manipulating emergent correlated and topological quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Localized fermions on the triangular lattice with Ising-like interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model of localized fermions on the triangular lattice is analyzed in means of the Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The Hamiltonian of the system has a form of the extended Hubbard model (at the atomic limit) with nearest-neighbor Ising-like magnetic $J$ interactions and onsite Coulomb $U$ interactions. The model is investigated for both signs of $J$, arbitrary $U$ interaction and arbitrary chemical potential $\mu$ (or, equivalently, arbitrary particle concentration $n$). Based on the specific heat capacity and sublattice magnetization analyses, the phase diagrams of the model are determined. For ferromagnetic case ($J&lt;0$), the transition from the ordered phase (which is a standard ferromagnet and can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.61$) is found to be second-order (for sufficiently large temperatures $k_{B}T/|J| \gtrsim 0.2$) or first-order (for $-1&lt;U/|J|&lt;-0.65$ at the half-filling, i.e., $n=1$). In the case of $J&gt;0$, the ordered phase occurs in a range of $-1/2&lt;U/|J|&lt;0$ (for $n=1$), while for larger $U$ the state with short-range order is also found (also for $n \neq 1$). The ordered phase is characterized by an antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments in two sublattices forming the hexagonal lattice. The transition from this ordered phase, which is found also for $\mu \neq 0$ ($n \neq 1$) and $U/|J|&gt;-1/2$ is always second-order for any model parameters. The ordered phase for $J&gt;0$ can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.06$.</description>

Abstract: Reservoir computers can be used to predict time series generated by spatio-temporal chaotic systems. Using multiple reservoirs in parallel has shown improved performances for these predictions, by effectively reducing the input dimensionality of each reservoir. Similarly, one may further reduce the dimensionality of the input data by transforming to a lower-dimensional latent space. Combining both approaches, we show that using dimensionality-reduced latent space predictions for parallel reservoir computing not only reduces computational costs, but also leads to better prediction results for small to medium reservoir sizes. In the combined approach we further demonstrate that dimensionality reduction improves small-reservoir predictions regardless of noise contaminating the training data. The benefit of dimensionality-reduced parallel reservoir computing is illustrated and evaluated on the basis of the prediction of the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <title>Particle-Hole Asymmetry and Pinball Liquid in a Triangular-Lattice Extended Hubbard Model within Mean-Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20719</link>

Abstract: Recently, triangular lattice models have received a lot of attention since they can describe a number of strongly-correlated materials that exhibit superconductivity and various magnetic and charge orders. In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The detailed analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory, allowed us to interpret the found triangular-lattice phases and provided a great insight into the mechanisms behind the phase transitions that can also be met when correlation effects are taken into account. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics from Laplacian Eigenbasis for Neural Network Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Phi-Module, a universal plugin module that enforces Poisson's equation within the message-passing framework to learn electrostatic interactions in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, each atom-wise representation is encouraged to satisfy a discretized Poisson's equation, making it possible to acquire a potential {\phi} and corresponding charges \r{ho} linked to the learnable Laplacian eigenbasis coefficients of a given molecular graph. We then derive an electrostatic energy term, crucial for improved total energy predictions. This approach integrates seamlessly into any existing neural potential with insignificant computational overhead. Our results underscore how embedding a first-principles constraint in neural interatomic potentials can significantly improve performance while remaining hyperparameter-friendly, memory-efficient, and lightweight in training.
