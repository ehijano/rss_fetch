      <title>Muographic Image Upsampling with Machine Learning for Built Infrastructure Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The civil engineering industry faces a critical need for innovative non-destructive evaluation methods, particularly for ageing critical infrastructure, such as bridges, where current techniques fall short. Muography, a non-invasive imaging technique, constructs three-dimensional density maps by detecting interactions of naturally occurring cosmic-ray muons within the scanned volume. Cosmic-ray muons provide deep penetration and inherent safety due to their high momenta and natural source. However, the technology's reliance on this source results in constrained muon flux, leading to prolonged acquisition times, noisy reconstructions and image interpretation challenges. To address these limitations, we developed a two-model deep learning approach. First, we employed a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (cWGAN-GP) to perform predictive upsampling of undersampled muography images. Using the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), 1-day sampled images matched the perceptual qualities of a 21-day image, while the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) indicated noise improvement equivalent to 31 days of sampling. A second cWGAN-GP model, trained for semantic segmentation, quantitatively assessed the upsampling model's impact on concrete sample features. This model achieved segmentation of rebar grids and tendon ducts, with Dice-S{\o}rensen accuracy coefficients of 0.8174 and 0.8663. Notably, it could mitigate or remove z-plane smearing artifacts caused by muography's inverse imaging problem. Both models were trained on a comprehensive Geant4 Monte-Carlo simulation dataset reflecting realistic civil infrastructure scenarios. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in acquisition speed and image quality, marking a substantial step toward making muography more practical for reinforced concrete infrastructure monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Blood Flow Parameters in the Left Atrial Appendage from 4DCT Dynamic Contrast Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac CT is often used clinically in electrophysiology to evaluate cardiac morphology. One such case is to evaluate patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF). AF can cause regions of slow blood flow and blood stasis through the left atrial appendage (LAA), and therefore, it may be preferable to evaluate blood flow through the LAA in addition to morphology. Although CT cannot measure flow directly, CT data has been used to estimate flow using modeling approaches such as Computational Fluid Dynamics, which take into account the cardiac geometry to simulate flow. Advances in CT technology now enable high-resolution imaging of the whole heart with low radiation doses. With multi-heartbeat imaging during a contrast injection, we can obtain 4-dimentional CT (4DCT) images to measure dynamic contrast enhancement directly. In this study, we use high-resolution 4DCT to acquire images of contrast enhancement across the LAA over multiple heartbeats. The CT contrast signal at each voxel over time is used to create dynamic contrast enhancement maps of parameters derived from a gamma-variate fit. These contrast enhancement maps enable quantification and visualization of spatial-temporal characteristics of flow parameters across the LAA.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Voxel-Weighted Loss Using L1 Norms in Deep Neural Networks for Detection and Segmentation of Prostate Cancer Lesions in PET/CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a new loss function for deep neural networks, L1-weighted Dice Focal Loss (L1DFL), that leverages L1 norms for adaptive weighting of voxels based on their classification difficulty, towards automated detection and segmentation of metastatic prostate cancer lesions in PET/CT scans. We obtained 380 PSMA [18-F] DCFPyL PET/CT scans of patients diagnosed with biochemical recurrence metastatic prostate cancer. We trained two 3D convolutional neural networks, Attention U-Net and SegResNet, and concatenated the PET and CT volumes channel-wise as input. The performance of our custom loss function was evaluated against the Dice and Dice Focal Loss functions. For clinical significance, we considered a detected region of interest (ROI) as a true positive if at least the voxel with the maximum standardized uptake value falls within the ROI. We assessed the models' performance based on the number of lesions in an image, tumour volume, activity, and extent of spread. The L1DFL outperformed the comparative loss functions by at least 13% on the test set. In addition, the F1 scores of the Dice Loss and the Dice Focal Loss were lower than that of L1DFL by at least 6% and 34%, respectively. The Dice Focal Loss yielded more false positives, whereas the Dice Loss was more sensitive to smaller volumes and struggled to segment larger lesions accurately. They also exhibited network-specific variations and yielded declines in segmentation accuracy with increased tumour spread. Our results demonstrate the potential of L1DFL to yield robust segmentation of metastatic prostate cancer lesions in PSMA PET/CT images. The results further highlight potential complexities arising from the variations in lesion characteristics that may influence automated prostate cancer tumour detection and segmentation.

      <title>Learning Generalizable Features for Tibial Plateau Fracture Segmentation Using Masked Autoencoder and Limited Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate automated segmentation of tibial plateau fractures (TPF) from computed tomography (CT) requires large amounts of annotated data to train deep learning models, but obtaining such annotations presents unique challenges. The process demands expert knowledge to identify diverse fracture patterns, assess severity, and account for individual anatomical variations, making the annotation process highly time-consuming and expensive. Although semi-supervised learning methods can utilize unlabeled data, existing approaches often struggle with the complexity and variability of fracture morphologies, as well as limited generalizability across datasets. To tackle these issues, we propose an effective training strategy based on masked autoencoder (MAE) for the accurate TPF segmentation in CT. Our method leverages MAE pretraining to capture global skeletal structures and fine-grained fracture details from unlabeled data, followed by fine-tuning with a small set of labeled data. This strategy reduces the dependence on extensive annotations while enhancing the model's ability to learn generalizable and transferable features. The proposed method is evaluated on an in-house dataset containing 180 CT scans with TPF. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms semi-supervised methods, achieving an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 95.81%, average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 1.91mm, and Hausdorff distance (95HD) of 9.42mm with only 20 annotated cases. Moreover, our method exhibits strong transferability when applying to another public pelvic CT dataset with hip fractures, highlighting its potential for broader applications in fracture segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Poisson Flow Joint Model for Multiphase contrast-enhanced CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In clinical practice, multiphase contrast-enhanced CT (MCCT) is important for physiological and pathological imaging with contrast injection, which undergoes non-contrast, venous, and delayed phases. Inevitably, the accumulated radiation dose to a patient is higher for multiphase scans than for a plain CT scan. Low-dose CECT is thus highly desirable, but it often leads to suboptimal image quality due to reduced radiation dose. Recently, a generalized Poisson flow generative model (PFGM++) was proposed to unify the diffusion model and the Poisson flow generative models (PFGM), and outperform either of them with an optimized dimensionality of the augmentation data space, holding a significant promise for generic or conditional image generation. In this paper, we propose a Poisson flow joint model (PFJM) for low-dose MCCT to suppress image noise and preserve clinical features. Our model is built on the PFGM++ architecture to transform the multiphase imaging problem into learning the joint distribution of routine-dose MCCT images by optimizing a task-specific generation path with respect to the dimensionality D of the augmented data space. Then, our PFJM model takes the joint low-dose MCCT images as the condition and robustly drives the generative trajectory towards the solution in the routine-dose MCCT domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model is favorably compared with competing models, with MAE of 8.99 HU, SSIM of 98.75% and PSNR of 48.24db, as averaged over all the phases.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Pipeline for Fully Automated Myocardial Infarct Segmentation from Clinical Cardiac MR Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a deep learning-based method that allows to perform myocardial infarct segmentation in a fully-automated way.
  Materials and Methods: For this retrospective study, a cascaded framework of two and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specialized on identifying ischemic myocardial scars on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images, was trained on an in-house training dataset consisting of 144 examinations. On a separate test dataset from the same institution, including images from 152 examinations obtained between 2021 and 2023, a quantitative comparison between artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentations and manual segmentations was performed. Further, qualitative assessment of segmentation accuracy was evaluated for both human and AI-generated contours by two CMR experts in a blinded experiment.
  Results: Excellent agreement could be found between manually and automatically calculated infarct volumes ($\rho_c$ = 0.9). The qualitative evaluation showed that compared to human-based measurements, the experts rated the AI-based segmentations to better represent the actual extent of infarction significantly (p &lt; 0.001) more often (33.4% AI, 25.1% human, 41.5% equal). On the contrary, for segmentation of microvascular obstruction (MVO), manual measurements were still preferred (11.3% AI, 55.6% human, 33.1% equal).
  Conclusion: This fully-automated segmentation pipeline enables CMR infarct size to be calculated in a very short time and without requiring any pre-processing of the input images while matching the segmentation quality of trained human observers. In a blinded experiment, experts preferred automated infarct segmentations more often than manual segmentations, paving the way for a potential clinical application.</description>

      <title>A Beam's Eye View to Fluence Maps 3D Network for Ultra Fast VMAT Radiotherapy Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) revolutionizes cancer treatment by precisely delivering radiation while sparing healthy tissues. Fluence maps generation, crucial in VMAT planning, traditionally involves complex and iterative, and thus time consuming processes. These fluence maps are subsequently leveraged for leaf-sequence. The deep-learning approach presented in this article aims to expedite this by directly predicting fluence maps from patient data. We developed a 3D network which we trained in a supervised way using a combination of L1 and L2 losses, and RT plans generated by Eclipse and from the REQUITE dataset, taking the RT dose map as input and the fluence maps computed from the corresponding RT plans as target. Our network predicts jointly the 180 fluence maps corresponding to the 180 control points (CP) of single arc VMAT plans. In order to help the network, we pre-process the input dose by computing the projections of the 3D dose map to the beam's eye view (BEV) of the 180 CPs, in the same coordinate system as the fluence maps. We generated over 2000 VMAT plans using Eclipse to scale up the dataset size. Additionally, we evaluated various network architectures and analyzed the impact of increasing the dataset size. We are measuring the performance in the 2D fluence maps domain using image metrics (PSNR, SSIM), as well as in the 3D dose domain using the dose-volume histogram (DVH) on a validation dataset. The network inference, which does not include the data loading and processing, is less than 20ms. Using our proposed 3D network architecture as well as increasing the dataset size using Eclipse improved the fluence map reconstruction performance by approximately 8 dB in PSNR compared to a U-Net architecture trained on the original REQUITE dataset. The resulting DVHs are very close to the one of the input target dose.</description>

      <title>When are Diffusion Priors Helpful in Sparse Reconstruction? A Study with Sparse-view CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on image generation, and are gaining traction for sparse medical image reconstruction tasks. However, compared to classical reconstruction algorithms relying on simple analytical priors, diffusion models have the dangerous property of producing realistic looking results \emph{even when incorrect}, particularly with few observations. We investigate the utility of diffusion models as priors for image reconstruction by varying the number of observations and comparing their performance to classical priors (sparse and Tikhonov regularization) using pixel-based, structural, and downstream metrics. We make comparisons on low-dose chest wall computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification. First, we find that classical priors are superior to diffusion priors when the number of projections is ``sufficient''. Second, we find that diffusion priors can capture a large amount of detail with very few observations, significantly outperforming classical priors. However, they fall short of capturing all details, even with many observations. Finally, we find that the performance of diffusion priors plateau after extremely few ($\approx$10-15) projections. Ultimately, our work highlights potential issues with diffusion-based sparse reconstruction and underscores the importance of further investigation, particularly in high-stakes clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Tell2Reg: Establishing spatial correspondence between images by the same language prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial correspondence can be represented by pairs of segmented regions, such that the image registration networks aim to segment corresponding regions rather than predicting displacement fields or transformation parameters. In this work, we show that such a corresponding region pair can be predicted by the same language prompt on two different images using the pre-trained large multimodal models based on GroundingDINO and SAM. This enables a fully automated and training-free registration algorithm, potentially generalisable to a wide range of image registration tasks. In this paper, we present experimental results using one of the challenging tasks, registering inter-subject prostate MR images, which involves both highly variable intensity and morphology between patients. Tell2Reg is training-free, eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming data curation and labelling that was previously required for this registration task. This approach outperforms unsupervised learning-based registration methods tested, and has a performance comparable to weakly-supervised methods. Additional qualitative results are also presented to suggest that, for the first time, there is a potential correlation between language semantics and spatial correspondence, including the spatial invariance in language-prompted regions and the difference in language prompts between the obtained local and global correspondences.

      <title>Deep Learning-based Event Data Coding: A Joint Spatiotemporal and Polarity Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic vision sensors, commonly referred to as event cameras, have recently gained relevance for applications requiring high-speed, high dynamic range and low-latency data acquisition. Unlike traditional frame-based cameras that capture 2D images, event cameras generate a massive number of pixel-level events, composed by spatiotemporal and polarity information, with very high temporal resolution, thus demanding highly efficient coding solutions. Existing solutions focus on lossless coding of event data, assuming that no distortion is acceptable for the target use cases, mostly including computer vision tasks. One promising coding approach exploits the similarity between event data and point clouds, thus allowing to use current point cloud coding solutions to code event data, typically adopting a two-point clouds representation, one for each event polarity. This paper proposes a novel lossy Deep Learning-based Joint Event data Coding (DL-JEC) solution adopting a single-point cloud representation, thus enabling to exploit the correlation between the spatiotemporal and polarity event information. DL-JEC can achieve significant compression performance gains when compared with relevant conventional and DL-based state-of-the-art event data coding solutions. Moreover, it is shown that it is possible to use lossy event data coding with its reduced rate regarding lossless coding without compromising the target computer vision task performance, notably for event classification. The use of novel adaptive voxel binarization strategies, adapted to the target task, further enables DL-JEC to reach a superior performance.</description>

      <title>MAP Image Recovery with Guarantees using Locally Convex Multi-Scale Energy (LC-MUSE) Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-scale deep energy model that is strongly convex in the local neighbourhood around the data manifold to represent its probability density, with application in inverse problems. In particular, we represent the negative log-prior as a multi-scale energy model parameterized by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We restrict the gradient of the CNN to be locally monotone, which constrains the model as a Locally Convex Multi-Scale Energy (LC-MuSE). We use the learned energy model in image-based inverse problems, where the formulation offers several desirable properties: i) uniqueness of the solution, ii) convergence guarantees to a minimum of the inverse problem, and iii) robustness to input perturbations. In the context of parallel Magnetic Resonance (MR) image reconstruction, we show that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art convex regularizers, while the performance is comparable to plug-and-play regularizers and end-to-end trained methods.</description>

      <title>A Temporal Convolutional Network-Based Approach and a Benchmark Dataset for Colonoscopy Video Temporal Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following recent advancements in computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems for colonoscopy, the automated reporting of colonoscopy procedures is set to further revolutionize clinical practice. A crucial yet underexplored aspect in the development of these systems is the creation of computer vision models capable of autonomously segmenting full-procedure colonoscopy videos into anatomical sections and procedural phases. In this work, we aim to create the first open-access dataset for this task and propose a state-of-the-art approach, benchmarked against competitive models. We annotated the publicly available REAL-Colon dataset, consisting of 2.7 million frames from 60 complete colonoscopy videos, with frame-level labels for anatomical locations and colonoscopy phases across nine categories. We then present ColonTCN, a learning-based architecture that employs custom temporal convolutional blocks designed to efficiently capture long temporal dependencies for the temporal segmentation of colonoscopy videos. We also propose a dual k-fold cross-validation evaluation protocol for this benchmark, which includes model assessment on unseen, multi-center data.ColonTCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification accuracy while maintaining a low parameter count when evaluated using the two proposed k-fold cross-validation settings, outperforming competitive models. We report ablation studies to provide insights into the challenges of this task and highlight the benefits of the custom temporal convolutional blocks, which enhance learning and improve model efficiency. We believe that the proposed open-access benchmark and the ColonTCN approach represent a significant advancement in the temporal segmentation of colonoscopy procedures, fostering further open-access research to address this clinical need.</description>

      <title>Practical X-ray Gastric Cancer Diagnostic Support Using Refined Stochastic Data Augmentation and Hard Boundary Box Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08158</link>

Abstract: Endoscopy is widely used to diagnose gastric cancer and has a high diagnostic performance, but it must be performed by a physician, which limits the number of people who can be diagnosed. In contrast, gastric X-rays can be taken by radiographers, thus allowing a much larger number of patients to undergo imaging. However, the diagnosis of X-ray images relies heavily on the expertise and experience of physicians, and few machine learning methods have been developed to assist in this process. We propose a novel and practical gastric cancer diagnostic support system for gastric X-ray images that will enable more people to be screened. The system is based on a general deep learning-based object detection model and incorporates two novel techniques: refined probabilistic stomach image augmentation (R-sGAIA) and hard boundary box training (HBBT). R-sGAIA enhances the probabilistic gastric fold region and provides more learning patterns for cancer detection models. HBBT is an efficient training method that improves model performance by allowing the use of unannotated negative (i.e., healthy control) samples, which are typically unusable in conventional detection models. The proposed system achieved a sensitivity (SE) for gastric cancer of 90.2\%, higher than that of an expert (85.5%). Under these conditions, two out of five candidate boxes identified by the system were cancerous (precision = 42.5%), with an image processing speed of 0.51 seconds per image. The system also outperformed methods using the same object detection model and state-of-the-art data augmentation by showing a 5.9-point improvement in the F1 score. In summary, this system efficiently identifies areas for radiologists to examine within a practical time frame, thus significantly reducing their workload.</description>

      <title>One Model to Rule them All: Towards Universal Segmentation for Medical Images with Text Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17183v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we aim to build up a model that can Segment Anything in radiology scans, driven by medical terminologies as Text prompts, termed as SAT. Our main contributions are three folds: (i) for dataset construction, we construct the first multi-modal knowledge tree on human anatomy, including 6502 anatomical terminologies; Then, we build up the largest and most comprehensive segmentation dataset for training, by collecting over 22K 3D medical image scans from72 segmentation datasets, across 497 classes, with careful standardization on both image scans and label space; (ii) for architecture design, we propose to inject medical knowledge into a text encoder via contrastive learning, and then formulate a universal segmentation model, that can be prompted by feeding in medical terminologies in text form; (iii) As a result, we have trained SAT-Nano (110M parameters) and SAT-Pro (447M parameters), demonstrating superior or comparable performance to 72 specialist models, i.e., nnU-Nets, U-Mamba or SwinUNETR, trained on each dataset/subsets. We validate SAT as a foundational segmentation model, with better generalization on external (cross-center) datasets, and can be further improved on specific tasks after fine-tuning adaptation. Comparing with state-of-the-art interactive segmentation model MedSAM, SAT demonstrate superior performance, scalability and robustness. We further compare SAT with BiomedParse, and observe SAT is significantly superior in both internal and external evaluation. Through extensive ablation study, we validate the benefit of domain knowledge on universal segmentation, especially on tail categories. As a use case, we demonstrate that SAT can act as a powerful out-of-the-box agent for large language models, enabling visual grounding in versatile application scenarios. All the data, codes, and models in this work have been released.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bilinear Attention-based Fusion for Medical Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) has attracted growing interest at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. By interpreting medical images and providing precise answers to relevant clinical inquiries, MedVQA has the potential to support diagnostic decision-making and reduce workload across various domains, particularly radiology. While recent approaches rely heavily on unified large pre-trained Visual-Language Models, research on more efficient fusion mechanisms remains relatively limited in this domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel fusion model, OMniBAN, that integrates Orthogonality loss, Multi-head attention, and a Bilinear Attention Network to achieve high computational efficiency alongside solid performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments and provide insights into how bilinear attention fusion can approximate the performance of larger fusion models like cross-modal Transformer. Our results demonstrate that OMniBAN outperforms traditional approaches on key MedVQA benchmarks while maintaining a lower computational cost. This balance between efficiency and accuracy suggests that OMniBAN could be a viable option for real-world medical image question answering, where computational resources are often constrained.</description>

      <title>AAD-DCE: An Aggregated Multimodal Attention Mechanism for Early and Late Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Prostate MRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is a medical imaging technique that plays a crucial role in the detailed visualization and identification of tissue perfusion in abnormal lesions and radiological suggestions for biopsy. However, DCE-MRI involves the administration of a Gadolinium based (Gad) contrast agent, which is associated with a risk of toxicity in the body. Previous deep learning approaches that synthesize DCE-MR images employ unimodal non-contrast or low-dose contrast MRI images lacking focus on the local perfusion information within the anatomy of interest. We propose AAD-DCE, a generative adversarial network (GAN) with an aggregated attention discriminator module consisting of global and local discriminators. The discriminators provide a spatial embedded attention map to drive the generator to synthesize early and late response DCE-MRI images. Our method employs multimodal inputs - T2 weighted (T2W), Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), and T1 pre-contrast for image synthesis. Extensive comparative and ablation studies on the ProstateX dataset show that our model (i) is agnostic to various generator benchmarks and (ii) outperforms other DCE-MRI synthesis approaches with improvement margins of +0.64 dB PSNR, +0.0518 SSIM, -0.015 MAE for early response and +0.1 dB PSNR, +0.0424 SSIM, -0.021 MAE for late response, and (ii) emphasize the importance of attention ensembling. Our code is available at https://github.com/bhartidivya/AAD-DCE.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Data-Driven Spectral Reconstruction -- Optics-Aware Analysis and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging empowers machine vision systems with the distinct capability of identifying materials through recording their spectral signatures. Recent efforts in data-driven spectral reconstruction aim at extracting spectral information from RGB images captured by cost-effective RGB cameras, instead of dedicated hardware.
  In this paper we systematically analyze the performance of such methods, evaluating both the practical limitations with respect to current datasets and overfitting, as well as fundamental limitations with respect to the nature of the information encoded in the RGB images, and the dependency of this information on the optical system of the camera.
  We find that, the current models are not robust under slight variations, e.g., in noise level or compression of the RGB file. Without modeling underrepresented spectral content, existing datasets and the models trained on them are limited in their ability to cope with challenging metameric colors. To mitigate this issue, we propose to exploit the combination of metameric data augmentation and optical lens aberrations to improve the encoding of the metameric information into the RGB image, which paves the road towards higher performing spectral imaging and reconstruction approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards Realistic Data Generation for Real-World Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing image super-resolution (SR) techniques often fail to generalize effectively in complex real-world settings due to the significant divergence between training data and practical scenarios. To address this challenge, previous efforts have either manually simulated intricate physical-based degradations or utilized learning-based techniques, yet these approaches remain inadequate for producing large-scale, realistic, and diverse data simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce a novel Realistic Decoupled Data Generator (RealDGen), an unsupervised learning data generation framework designed for real-world super-resolution. We meticulously develop content and degradation extraction strategies, which are integrated into a novel content-degradation decoupled diffusion model to create realistic low-resolution images from unpaired real LR and HR images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDGen excels in generating large-scale, high-quality paired data that mirrors real-world degradations, significantly advancing the performance of popular SR models on various real-world benchmarks.</description>

      <title>PSC: Posterior Sampling-Based Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have transformed the landscape of image generation and now show remarkable potential for image compression. Most of the recent diffusion-based compression methods require training and are tailored for a specific bit-rate. In this work, we propose Posterior Sampling-based Compression (PSC) - a zero-shot compression method that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model as its sole neural network component, thus enabling the use of diverse, publicly available models without additional training. Our approach is inspired by transform coding methods, which encode the image in some pre-chosen transform domain. However, PSC constructs a transform that is adaptive to the image. This is done by employing a zero-shot diffusion-based posterior sampler so as to progressively construct the rows of the transform matrix. Each new chunk of rows is chosen to reduce the uncertainty about the image given the quantized measurements collected thus far. Importantly, the same adaptive scheme can be replicated at the decoder, thus avoiding the need to encode the transform itself. We demonstrate that even with basic quantization and entropy coding, PSC's performance is comparable to established training-based methods in terms of rate, distortion, and perceptual quality. This is while providing greater flexibility, allowing to choose at inference time any desired rate or distortion.</description>

      <title>PixelShuffler: A Simple Image Translation Through Pixel Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image-to-image translation is a topic in computer vision that has a vast range of use cases ranging from medical image translation, such as converting MRI scans to CT scans or to other MRI contrasts, to image colorization, super-resolution, domain adaptation, and generating photorealistic images from sketches or semantic maps. Image style transfer is also a widely researched application of image-to-image translation, where the goal is to synthesize an image that combines the content of one image with the style of another. Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on complex neural networks, including diffusion models and language models, to achieve high-quality style transfer, but these methods can be computationally expensive and intricate to implement. In this paper, we propose a novel pixel shuffle method that addresses the image-to-image translation problem generally with a specific demonstrative application in style transfer. The proposed method approaches style transfer by shuffling the pixels of the style image such that the mutual information between the shuffled image and the content image is maximized. This approach inherently preserves the colors of the style image while ensuring that the structural details of the content image are retained in the stylized output. We demonstrate that this simple and straightforward method produces results that are comparable to state-of-the-art techniques, as measured by the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) loss for content preservation and the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) score for style similarity. Our experiments validate that the proposed pixel shuffle method achieves competitive performance with significantly reduced complexity, offering a promising alternative for efficient image style transfer, as well as a promise in usability of the method in general image-to-image translation tasks.</description>

      <title>MSEG-VCUQ: Multimodal SEGmentation with Enhanced Vision Foundation Models, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Uncertainty Quantification for High-Speed Video Phase Detection Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-speed video (HSV) phase detection (PD) segmentation is crucial for monitoring vapor, liquid, and microlayer phases in industrial processes. While CNN-based models like U-Net have shown success in simplified shadowgraphy-based two-phase flow (TPF) analysis, their application to complex HSV PD tasks remains unexplored, and vision foundation models (VFMs) have yet to address the complexities of either shadowgraphy-based or PD TPF video segmentation. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods lack pixel-level reliability for critical metrics like contact line density and dry area fraction, and the absence of large-scale, multimodal experimental datasets tailored to PD segmentation further impedes progress. To address these gaps, we propose MSEG-VCUQ. This hybrid framework integrates U-Net CNNs with the transformer-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) to achieve enhanced segmentation accuracy and cross-modality generalization. Our approach incorporates systematic UQ for robust error assessment and introduces the first open-source multimodal HSV PD datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that MSEG-VCUQ outperforms baseline CNNs and VFMs, enabling scalable and reliable PD segmentation for real-world boiling dynamics.</description>

      <title>GS-LiDAR: Generating Realistic LiDAR Point Clouds with Panoramic Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LiDAR novel view synthesis (NVS) has emerged as a novel task within LiDAR simulation, offering valuable simulated point cloud data from novel viewpoints to aid in autonomous driving systems. However, existing LiDAR NVS methods typically rely on neural radiance fields (NeRF) as their 3D representation, which incurs significant computational costs in both training and rendering. Moreover, NeRF and its variants are designed for symmetrical scenes, making them ill-suited for driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose GS-LiDAR, a novel framework for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds with panoramic Gaussian splatting. Our approach employs 2D Gaussian primitives with periodic vibration properties, allowing for precise geometric reconstruction of both static and dynamic elements in driving scenarios. We further introduce a novel panoramic rendering technique with explicit ray-splat intersection, guided by panoramic LiDAR supervision. By incorporating intensity and ray-drop spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients into the Gaussian primitives, we enhance the realism of the rendered point clouds. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and nuScenes demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, as well as training and rendering efficiency.</description>
