      <title>Near-real-time design of experiments for seismic monitoring of volcanoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring the seismic activity of volcanoes is crucial for hazard assessment and eruption forecasting. The layout of each seismic network determines the information content of recorded data about volcanic earthquakes, and experimental design methods optimise sensor locations to maximise that information. We provide a code package that implements Bayesian experimental design to optimise seismometer networks to locate seismicity at any volcano, and a practical guide to make this easily and rapidly implementable by any volcano seismologist. This work is the first to optimise travel-time, amplitude and array source location methods simultaneously, making it suitable for a wide range of volcano monitoring scenarios. The code-package is designed to be straightforward to use and can be adapted to a wide range of scenarios, and automatically links to existing global databases of topography and properties of volcanoes worldwide to allow rapid deployment. Any user should be able to obtain an initial design within minutes using a combination of generic and volcano-specific information to guide the design process, and to refine the design for their specific scenario within hours, if more specific prior information is available.</description>

      <title>Diffusivity-Free Turbulence in Tabletop Rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection in planets and stars is predicted to occur in the "ultimate regime'' of diffusivity-free, rapidly rotating turbulence, in which flows are characteristically unaffected by viscous and thermal diffusion. Boundary layer diffusion, however, has historically hindered experimental study of this regime. Here, we utilize the boundary-independent oscillatory thermal-inertial mode of rotating convection to realize the diffusivity-free scaling in liquid metal laboratory experiments. This oscillatory style of convection arises in rotating liquid metals (low Prandtl number fluids) and is driven by the temperature gradient in the fluid bulk, thus remaining independent of diffusive boundary dynamics. We triply verify the existence of the diffusivity-free regime via measurements of heat transfer efficiency $Nu$, dimensionless flow velocities $Re$, and internal temperature anomalies $\theta$, all of which are in quantitative agreement with planar asymptotically-reduced models. Achieving the theoretical diffusivity-free scalings in desktop-sized laboratory experiments provides the validation necessary to extrapolate and predict the convective flows in remote geophysical and astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>The plausibility of origins scenarios requiring two impactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen cyanide delivered by cometary impactors can be concentrated as ferrocyanide salts, which may support the initial stages of prebiotic chemistry on the early Earth. One way to achieve the conditions required for a variety of prebiotic scenarios, requiring for example the formation of cyanamide and cyanoacetylene, is through the arrival of a secondary impactor. In this work, we consider the bombardment of the early Earth, and quantitatively evaluate the likelihood of origins scenarios that invoke double impacts. Such scenarios are found to be possible only at very early times ($&gt;\,$4Gya), and are extremely unlikely settings for the initial stages of prebiotic chemistry, unless (i) ferrocyanide salts are stable on 1000yr timescales in crater environments, (ii) there was a particularly high impact rate on the Hadean Earth, and (iii) environmental conditions on the Hadean Earth were conducive to successful cometary delivery (i.e., limited oceanic coverage, and low ($\lesssim 1$bar) atmospheric surface pressure). Whilst environmental conditions on the early Earth remain subject to debate, this work highlights the need to measure the typical lifetime of ferrocyanide salts in geochemically realistic environments, which will determine the plausibility of double impact scenarios.</description>

      <title>Singular Value Decomposition for Single-Phase Flow and Cluster Identification in Heterogeneous Pore Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13462v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pore networks play a key role in understanding and quantifying flow and transport processes in complex porous media. Realistic pore-spaces may be characterized by singular regions, i.e., isolated subnetworks that do not connect inlet and outlet, resulting from unconnected porosity or multiphase configurations. The robust identification of these features is critical for the characterization of network topology and the solution of the set of linear equations of flow and transport. We propose a robust method based on singular value decomposition to solve for network flow and locate isolated subnetworks simultaneously. The method's performance is demonstrated for networks of different complexity.</description>

      <title>Crack opening calculation in phase-field modeling of fluid-filled fracture: A robust and efficient strain-based method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase-field method has become popular for the numerical modeling of fluid-filled fractures, thanks to its ability to represent complex fracture geometry without algorithms. However, the algorithm-free representation of fracture geometry poses a significant challenge in calculating the crack opening (aperture) of phase-field fracture, which governs the fracture permeability and hence the overall hydromechanical behavior. Although several approaches have been devised to compute the crack opening of phase-field fracture, they require a sophisticated algorithm for post-processing the phase-field values or an additional parameter sensitive to the element size and alignment. Here, we develop a novel method for calculating the crack opening of fluid-filled phase-field fracture, which enables one to obtain the crack opening without additional algorithms or parameters. We transform the displacement-jump-based kinematics of a fracture into a continuous strain-based version, insert it into a force balance equation on the fracture, and apply the phase-field approximation. Through this procedure, we obtain a simple equation for the crack opening which can be calculated with quantities at individual material points. We verify the proposed method with analytical and numerical solutions obtained based on discrete representations of fractures, demonstrating its capability to calculate the crack opening regardless of the element size or alignment.</description>

      <title>Data Science for Geographic Information Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of data science into Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has facilitated the evolution of these tools into complete spatial analysis platforms. The adoption of machine learning and big data techniques has equipped these platforms with the capacity to handle larger amounts of increasingly complex data, transcending the limitations of more traditional approaches. This work traces the historical and technical evolution of data science and GIS as fields of study, highlighting the critical points of convergence between domains, and underlining the many sectors that rely on this integration. A GIS application is presented as a case study in the disaster management sector where we utilize aerial data from Tr\'oia, Portugal, to emphasize the process of insight extraction from raw data. We conclude by outlining prospects for future research in integration of these fields in general, and the developed application in particular.</description>
