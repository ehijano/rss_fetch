      <title>Enhancing the detection of low-energy M dwarf flares: wavelet-based denoising of CHEOPS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar flares are powerful bursts of electromagnetic radiation triggered by magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere of stars, occurring frequently and intensely on active M dwarfs. While missions like TESS and Kepler have studied regular and super-flares, their detection of flares with energies below $10^{30}$ erg remains incomplete. Extending flare studies to include these low-energy events could enhance flare formation models and provide insight into their impacts on exoplanetary atmospheres. This study investigates CHEOPS's capacity to detect low-energy flares in M dwarf light curves. Using CHEOPS's high photometric precision and observing cadence, along with a tailored wavelet-based denoising algorithm, we aim to improve detection completeness and refine flare statistics for low-energy events. We conducted a flare injection and recovery process to optimise denoising parameters, applied it to CHEOPS light curves to maximise detection rates, and used a flare breakdown algorithm to analyse complex structures. Our analysis recovered 349 flares with energies ranging from $2.2\times10^{26}$ to $8.1\times10^{30}$ erg across 63 M dwarfs, with $\sim$40% exhibiting complex, multi-peaked structures. The denoising algorithm improved flare recovery by $\sim$34%, though it marginally extended the lower boundary of detectable energies. For the full sample, the power-law index $\alpha$ was $1.92\pm0.07$, but a log-normal distribution fit better, suggesting multiple flare formation scenarios. While CHEOPS's observing mode is not ideal for large-scale surveys, it captures weaker flares than TESS or Kepler, expanding the observed energy range. Wavelet-based denoising enhances low-energy event recovery, enabling exploration of the micro-flaring regime. Expanding low-energy flare observations could refine flare generation models and improve the understanding of their role in star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>Propagation of untwisting solar jets from the low-beta corona into the super-Alfv\'enic wind: Testing a solar origin scenario for switchbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) discovery of the prevalence of switchbacks (SBs), localised magnetic deflections in the nascent solar wind, has sparked interest in uncovering their origins. A prominent theory suggests these SBs originate in the lower corona through magnetic reconnection processes, closely linked to solar jet phenomena. Jets are impulsive events, observed across scales and solar atmosphere layers, associated with the release of magnetic twist and helicity. This study examines whether self-consistent jets can form and propagate into the super-Alfv\'enic wind, assesses the impact of distinct Parker solar wind profiles on jet dynamics, and determines if jet-induced magnetic untwisting waves display signatures typical of SBs. We employed parametric 3D numerical MHD simulations using the ARMS code to model the self-consistent generation of solar jets. Our study focuses on the propagation of solar jets in distinct atmospheric plasma $\beta$ and Alfv\'en velocity profiles, including a Parker solar wind. Our findings show that self-consistent coronal jets can form and propagate into the super-Alfv\'enic wind. Notable structures such as the leading Alfv\'enic wave and trailing dense-jet region were consistently observed across diverse plasma $\beta$ atmospheres. The jet propagation dynamics are significantly influenced by atmospheric variations, with changes in Alfv\'en velocity profiles affecting the group velocity and propagation ratio of the leading and trailing structures. U-loops, prevalent at jet onset, do not persist in the low-$\beta$ corona, but magnetic untwisting waves associated with jets show SB-like signatures. However, full-reversal SBs were not observed. These findings may explain the absence of full reversal SBs in the sub-Alfv\'enic wind and illustrate the propagation of magnetic deflections through jet-like events, shedding light on possible SB formation processes.</description>

      <title>Two-Part Interplanetary Type II Solar Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two similar-looking, two-part interplanetary type II burst events from 2003 and 2012 are reported and analysed. The 2012 event was observed from three different viewing angles, enabling comparisons between the spacecraft data. In these two events, a diffuse wide-band type II radio burst was followed by a type II burst that showed emission at the fundamental and harmonic (F-H) plasma frequencies, and these emission bands were also slightly curved in their frequency-time evolution. Both events were associated with high-speed, halo-type coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In both events, the diffuse type II burst was most probably created by a bow shock at the leading front of the CME. However, for the later-appearing F-H type II burst there are at least two possible explanations. In the 2003 event there is evidence of CME interaction with a streamer, with a possible shift from a bow shock to a CME flank shock. In the 2012 event a separate white-light shock front was observed at lower heights, and it could have acted as the driver of the F-H type II burst. There is also some speculation on the existence of two separate CMEs, launched from the same active region, close in time. The reason for the diffuse type II burst being visible only from one viewing direction (STEREO-A), and the ending of the diffuse emission before the F-H type II burst appears, still need explanations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae constitute a unique laboratory for particle physics and astrophysics. They are powerful neutrino sources of all flavors, emitting essentially all the gravitational binding energy through neutrinos, at the end of their life. I will highlight how crucial is the observation of the next core-collapse supernova and of the diffuse supernova neutrino background, whose discovery might be imminent.</description>

      <title>Three new hot hydrogen-deficient pre-white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have detected three new hydrogen-deficient (H &lt; 0.001 mass fraction) pre-white dwarfs (WDs) with helium-dominated atmospheres. The first object is a relatively cool PG1159 star (effective temperature Teff = 72,000 K) that has the lowest surface gravity of any PG1159 star known (log g = 4.8). It is a PG1159 star in the earliest pre-WD phase. The second object is a hot subdwarf O (sdO) star (Teff = 50,000 K, log g = 5.3) with high carbon and oxygen abundances. It is only the third known member of the recently established CO-sdO spectral class, which comprises stars that are thought to be formed by a merger of a disrupted low-mass CO WD with a higher-mass He WD. The third object is one of the rare stars of spectral type O(He) (Teff = 90,000 K, log g = 5.5).</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the derivation of a well-defined $D\to4$ limit for 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity coupled to a scalar field, there has been considerable interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Past work has shown that this theory hosts interesting compact star solutions which are smaller in radius than a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass in general relativity (GR), though the stability of such objects has been subject to question. In this paper we solve the equations for radial perturbations of neutron stars in the 4DEGB theory with SLy/BSk class EOSs, along with the MS2 EOS, and show that the coincidence of stability and maximum mass points in GR is still present in this modified theory, with the interesting additional feature of solutions re-approaching stability near the black hole solution on the mass-radius diagram. Besides this, as expected from past work, we find that larger values of the 4DEGB coupling $\alpha$ tend to increase the mass of neutron stars of the same radius (due to a larger $\alpha$ weakening gravity) and move the maximum mass points of the solution branches closer to the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution and mass distribution of the Galactic Binary Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron stars (BNSs) detected in the Milky Way have the total masses distributing narrowly around $\sim2.6-2.7M_\odot$, while the BNS merger GW190425 detected via gravitational wave has a significantly larger mass ($\sim3.4M_\odot$). This difference is not well understood, yet. In this paper, we investigate the BNS spin evolution via an improved binary star evolution model and its effects on the BNS observability, with implementation of various relevant astrophysical processes. We find that the first-born neutron star component in low-mass BNSs can be spun up to millisecond pulsars by the accretion of Roche-lobe overflow from its companion and its radio lifetime can be comparable to the Hubble time. However, most high-mass BNSs have substantially shorter radio lifetime than the low-mass BNSs, and thus smaller probability being detected via radio emission. Adopting the star formation and metal enrichment history of the Milky Way given by observations, we obtain the survived Galactic BNSs with pulsar components from our population synthesis model and find that their distributions on the diagrams of spin period versus spin-period-time-derivative ($P-\dot{P}$) and orbital period versus eccentricity ($P_{\rm orb}-e$) can well match those of the observed Galactic BNSs. The total mass distribution of the observed Galactic BNSs can also be matched by the model. A significant fraction ($\sim19\%-22\%$) of merging BNSs at redshift $z\sim0$ have masses $\gtrsim3M_\odot$, which seems compatible with the GW observations. Future radio observations may detect many more Galactic BNSs, which will put strong constraint on the spin evolution of BNSs during their formation processes.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star properties through parity-violating electron scattering experiments and relativistic point coupling interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parity-violating electron scattering experiments on $\rm ^{48}Ca$ (CREX) and $\rm ^{208}Pb$ (PREX-II) offer valuable insight into the isovector properties of finite nuclei, providing constraints for the density dependence of the nuclear equation of state, which is crucial for understanding astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we establish functional dependencies between the properties of finite nuclei - such as weak charge form factors and neutron skin thickness - and the bulk properties of neutron stars, including tidal deformability from binary neutron star mergers and neutron star radii. The dependencies are formulated by introducing a family of $\beta$-equilibrated equations of state based on relativistic energy density functionals with point coupling interactions. The charge minus the weak form factors derived from CREX and PREX-II measurements, combined with the observational constraints on tidal deformability from the GW170817 event, are used to constrain the symmetry energy and neutron star radii. Notably, the energy density expanded up to the fourth order in symmetry energy yields larger radii compared to calculations limited to the second order term. However, the results reveal a discrepancy between the constraints provided by the CREX and PREX-II experiments. For a more quantitative assessment, higher precision parity-violating electron scattering data and neutron star observations are required.</description>

      <title>Evolution and final fates of low- and intermediate-mass stars</title>

Abstract: Stars are unique bodies of the Universe where self-gravity compress matter to such high temperature and density that several nuclear fusion reactions ignite, providing enough feedback against further compression for a time that can be even larger than the age of the universe. The main property of a star is its mass because it determines its structure, evolutionary history, age, and ultimate fate. Depending on this quantity, stars are broadly classified as low-mass stars, like our Sun, intermediate mass stars as the variable star Delta Cephei, and massive stars as Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star in Orion constellation. Here we will introduce the basic notions useful to understand stellar evolution of low- and intermediate- mass stars. This mass range (0.1 M$_{\odot}$ - 10.0 M$_{\odot}$) deserves special attention, as it contains most of the stars in the universe. This chapter will focus on how these stars form, the processes that drive their evolution, and key details regarding their structure. Finally, we will discuss the death of such stars, emphasizing the unique fates associated with low- and intermediate-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Coronal kink oscillations and photospheric driving: combining SolO/EUI and SST/CRISP high-resolution observations</title>

Abstract: The driving and excitation mechanisms of decay-less kink oscillations in coronal loops remain under debate. We aim to quantify and provide simple observational constraints on the photospheric driving of oscillating coronal loops in a few typical active region configurations: sunspot, plage, pores and enhanced-network regions. We then aim to investigate the possible interplay between photospheric driving and properties of kink oscillations in connected coronal loops. We analyse two unique datasets of the corona and photosphere taken at a high resolution during the first coordinated observation campaign between Solar Orbiter and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). A local correlation tracking method is applied on the SST/CRISP data to quantify the photospheric motions at the base of coronal loops. The same loops are then analysed in the corona by exploiting data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on Solar Orbiter, and by using a wavelet analysis to characterize the kink oscillations. Each photospheric region shows dynamics with an overall increase in strength going from pore, plage, enhanced-network to sunspot regions. Differences are also seen in the kink-mode amplitudes of the corresponding coronal loops. This suggests the photosphere is involved in the driving of coronal kink oscillations. However, the few samples available does not allow to further establish the excitation mechanism yet. Despite oscillating coronal loops being anchored in seemingly "static" strong magnetic field regions as seen from coronal EUV observations, photospheric observations provide evidence for a continuous and significant driving at their base. The precise connection between photospheric driving and coronal kink oscillations remains to be further investigated. This study finally provides critical constraints on photospheric driving that can be tested in existing numerical models of coronal loops.</description>

      <title>X-ray Variability in the Symbiotic Binary RT Cru: Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hard X-ray-emitting ($\delta$-type) symbiotic binaries, which exhibit a strong hard X-ray excess, have posed a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics in degenerate dwarfs. RT Cru, which is a member of the $\delta$-type symbiotics, shows stochastic X-ray variability. Timing analyses of X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, which we consider here, indicate hourly fluctuations, in addition to a spectral transition from 2007 to a harder state in 2012 seen with Suzaku observations. To trace the nature of X-ray variability, we analyze the multi-mission X-ray data using principal component analysis (PCA), which determines the spectral components that contribute most to the flickering behavior and the hardness transition. The Chandra HRC-S/LETG and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data provide the primary PCA components, which may contain some variable emission features, especially in the soft excess. Additionally, the absorbing column (first order with 50%), along with the source continuum (20%), and a third component (9%) - which likely accounts for thermal emission in the soft band - are the three principal components found in the Suzaku XIS1 observations. The PCA components of the NuSTAR data also correspond to the continuum and possibly emission features. Our findings suggest that the spectral hardness transition between the two Suzaku observations is mainly due to changes in the absorbing material and X-ray continuum, while some changes in the thermal plasma emission may result in flickering-type variations.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en pulse at chromospheric footpoints of magnetic loops and generation of the super-Dreicer electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-similar solution of the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations describing the propagation of the Alfv\'en pulse in an axially symmetric magnetic tube of variable diameter is obtained. The electric field component induced by the non-linear Alfv\'en wave and directed along the tube surface, i.e., accelerating particles along the magnetic field, is determined on the basis of the perturbation theory and specified to the case of a magnetic flux tube homogeneous over its cross section. For the chromospheric tubes, whose configuration is given by the barometric law of plasma pressure decrease, the conditions for achieving the super-Dreicer electric field limit necessary to drive the accelerated high-energy electrons into the coronal part of the loop are established.</description>
