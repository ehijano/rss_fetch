      <title>Completely Integrable Foliations: Singular Locus, Invariant Curves and Topological Counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study codimension $q \geq 2$ holomorphic foliations defined in a neighborhood of a point $P$ of a complex manifold that are completely integrable, i.e. with $q$ independent meromorphic first integrals. We show that either $P$ is a regular point, a non-isolated singularity or there are infinitely many invariant analytic varieties through $P$ of the same dimension as the foliation, the so called separatrices. Moreover, we see that this phenomenon is of topological nature.
  Indeed, we introduce topological counterparts of completely integrable local holomorphic foliations and tools, specially the concept of total holonomy group, to build holomorphic first integrals if they have isolated separatrices. As a result, we provide a topological characterization of completely integrable non-degenerated elementary isolated singularities of vector fields with an isolated separatrix.</description>

      <title>Refining Fuchs' Theorem: Ensuring Uniqueness through No-Resummation Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.03115v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits Fuchs' theorem to address a critical limitation in its framework: the implicit assumption that power series expansions remain invariant under term rearrangement. We propose a \textit{No-Resummation Constraint} that ensures the radius of convergence predicted by the theorem remains consistent, irrespective of term rearrangement or resummation.
  Through rigorous theoretical analysis and counterexamples, this study demonstrates that resummation can reduce the radius of convergence, thereby contradicting the predictions of Fuchs' theorem. The proposed constraint not only preserves the integrity of Fuchs' theorem but also redefines its scope, extending its applicability to settings involving multi-term recurrence relations in Fuchsian differential equations.
  This study provides a unified theoretical framework that resolves inconsistencies in Fuchs' theorem while laying the foundation for further exploration in power series convergence. By solidifying the relationship between singularities and convergence radii, this work offers new insights into the geometric and analytic properties of Fuchsian equations.</description>

      <title>Discretised sum-product theorems by Shannon-type inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By making use of arithmetic information inequalities, we give a strong quantitative bound for the discretised ring theorem. In particular, we show that if $A \subset [1,2]$ is a $(\delta,\sigma)$-set, with $|A| = \delta^{-\sigma},$ then $A+A$ or $AA$ has $\delta$-covering number at least $\delta^{-c}|A|$ for any $0 &lt; c &lt; \min\{\sigma/6, (1-\sigma)/6\}$ provided that $\delta &gt; 0$ is small enough.</description>

      <title>Geometric approach for the identification of Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some new Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type are presented and the analogue of Okamoto's space of initial conditions computed. Using the geometric approach that was introduced originally for the identification problem of Painlev\'e equations, comparing the irreducible components of the inaccessible divisors arising in the blow-up process, we find bi-rational coordinate changes between some of these systems that give rise to the same global Hamiltonian structure. This scheme thus gives a method for identifying Hamiltonian systems up to bi-rational maps, which is performed in this article for systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type having singularities that are either square-root type algebraic poles or ordinary poles.</description>

      <title>An improved lower bound for a problem of Littlewood on the zeros of cosine polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Z(N)$ denote the minimum number of zeros in $[0,2\pi]$ that a cosine polynomial of the form $$f_A(t)=\sum_{n\in A}\cos nt$$ can have when $A$ is a finite set of non-negative integers of size $|A|=N$. It is an old problem of Littlewood to determine $Z(N)$. In this paper, we obtain the lower bound $Z(N)\geqslant (\log\log N)^{(1+o(1))}$ which exponentially improves on the previous best bounds of the form $Z(N)\geqslant (\log\log\log N)^c$ due to Erd\'elyi and Sahasrabudhe.</description>

      <title>Summation formulae for quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02583v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Poisson summation formula for the zero locus of a quadratic form in an even number of variables with no assumption on the support of the functions involved. The key novelty in the formula is that all ``boundary terms'' are given either by constants or sums over smaller quadrics related to the original quadric. We also discuss the link with the classical problem of estimating the number of solutions of a quadratic form in an even number of variables. To prove the summation formula we compute (the Arthur truncated) theta lift of the trivial representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$. As previously observed by Ginzburg, Rallis, and Soudry, this is an analogue for orthogonal groups on vector spaces of even dimension of the global Schr\"odinger representation of the metaplectic group.</description>

      <title>A relation between the Dirichlet and the Regularity problem for Parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the Dirichlet and Regularity problem for parabolic operators of the form $ L = \mbox{div}(A\nabla\cdot) - \partial_t $ on cylindrical domains $ \Omega = \mathcal O \times \mathbb R $, where the base $ \mathcal O \subset \mathbb R^{n} $ is a $1$-sided chord arc domain (and for one result Lipschitz) in the spatial variables.
  In the paper we answer the question when the solvability of the $L^p$ Regularity problem for $L$ (denoted by $ (R_L)_{p} $) can be deduced from the solvability of the $ L^{p'} $ Dirichlet problem for the adjoint operator $L^*$ (denoted $ (D_L^*)_{p'} $).
  We show that this holds if for at least of $q\in(1,\infty)$ the problem $ (R_L)_{q} $ is solvable. That is, we establish a duality/dichotomy result: Dirichlet solvability implies Regularity solvability in the dual $L^p$ range, or the Regularity problem is not solvable in any $L^p$.
  Results like these were only known in the elliptic settings (Kenig-Pipher (1993) and Shen (2006)) but are new for parabolic PDEs. Our result is one of the key components needed for the recent advancement of Dindo\v{s}, Li and Pipher in understanding solvability of the Regularity problem for operators whose coefficients satisfy certain natural Carleson condition (called also DKP-condition in the elliptic case).</description>
