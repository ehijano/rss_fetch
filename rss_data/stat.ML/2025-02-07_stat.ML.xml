      <title>Two in context learning tasks with complex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine two in context learning (ICL) tasks with mathematical functions in several train and test settings for transformer models. Our study generalizes work on linear functions by showing that small transformers, even models with attention layers only, can approximate arbitrary polynomial functions and hence continuous functions under certain conditions. Our models also can approximate previously unseen classes of polynomial functions, as well as the zeros of complex functions. Our models perform far better on this task than LLMs like GPT4 and involve complex reasoning when provided with suitable training data and methods. Our models also have important limitations; they fail to generalize outside of training distributions and so don't learn class forms of functions. We explain why this is so.</description>

      <title>Online Learning Algorithms in Hilbert Spaces with $\beta-$ and $\phi-$Mixing Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an online algorithm in a reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) based on a class of dependent processes, called the mixing process. For such a process, the degree of dependence is measured by various mixing coefficients. As a representative example, we analyze a strictly stationary Markov chain, where the dependence structure is characterized by the \(\beta-\) and \(\phi-\)mixing coefficients. For these dependent samples, we derive nearly optimal convergence rates. Our findings extend existing error bounds for i.i.d. observations, demonstrating that the i.i.d. case is a special instance of our framework. Moreover, we explicitly account for an additional factor introduced by the dependence structure in the Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Conformal Prediction using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) quantifies the uncertainty of machine learning models by constructing sets of plausible outputs. These sets are constructed by leveraging a so-called conformity score, a quantity computed using the input point of interest, a prediction model, and past observations. CP sets are then obtained by evaluating the conformity score of all possible outputs, and selecting them according to the rank of their scores. Due to this ranking step, most CP approaches rely on a score functions that are univariate. The challenge in extending these scores to multivariate spaces lies in the fact that no canonical order for vectors exists. To address this, we leverage a natural extension of multivariate score ranking based on optimal transport (OT). Our method, OTCP, offers a principled framework for constructing conformal prediction sets in multidimensional settings, preserving distribution-free coverage guarantees with finite data samples. We demonstrate tangible gains in a benchmark dataset of multivariate regression problems and address computational \&amp; statistical trade-offs that arise when estimating conformity scores through OT maps.</description>

      <title>Rule-based Evolving Fuzzy System for Time Series Forecasting: New Perspectives Based on Type-2 Fuzzy Sets Measures Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world data contain uncertainty and variations that can be correlated to external variables, known as randomness. An alternative cause of randomness is chaos, which can be an important component of chaotic time series. One of the existing methods to deal with this type of data is the use of the evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFSs), which have been proven to be a powerful class of models for time series forecasting, due to their autonomy to handle the data and highly complex problems in real-world applications. However, due to its working structure, type-2 fuzzy sets can outperform type-1 fuzzy sets for highly uncertain scenarios. We then propose ePL-KRLS-FSM+, an enhanced class of evolving fuzzy modeling approach that combines participatory learning (PL), a kernel recursive least squares method (KRLS), type-2 fuzzy logic and data transformation into fuzzy sets (FSs). This improvement allows to create and measure type-2 fuzzy sets for better handling uncertainties in the data, generating a model that can predict chaotic data with increased accuracy. The model is evaluated using two complex datasets: the chaotic time series Mackey-Glass delay differential equation with different degrees of chaos, and the main stock index of the Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index - TAIEX. Model performance is compared to related state-of-the-art rule-based eFS models and classical approaches and is analyzed in terms of error metrics, runtime and the number of final rules. Forecasting results show that the proposed model is competitive and performs consistently compared with type-1 models, also outperforming other forecasting methods by showing the lowest error metrics and number of final rules.</description>

      <title>Guiding Two-Layer Neural Network Lipschitzness via Gradient Descent Learning Rate Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that applying an eventual decay to the learning rate (LR) in empirical risk minimization (ERM), where the mean-squared-error loss is minimized using standard gradient descent (GD) for training a two-layer neural network with Lipschitz activation functions, ensures that the resulting network exhibits a high degree of Lipschitz regularity, that is, a small Lipschitz constant. Moreover, we show that this decay does not hinder the convergence rate of the empirical risk, now measured with the Huber loss, toward a critical point of the non-convex empirical risk. From these findings, we derive generalization bounds for two-layer neural networks trained with GD and a decaying LR with a sub-linear dependence on its number of trainable parameters, suggesting that the statistical behaviour of these networks is independent of overparameterization. We validate our theoretical results with a series of toy numerical experiments, where surprisingly, we observe that networks trained with constant step size GD exhibit similar learning and regularity properties to those trained with a decaying LR. This suggests that neural networks trained with standard GD may already be highly regular learners.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Online Learning for Probabilistic Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load forecasting is essential for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective management of power systems. Load forecasting performance can be improved by learning the similarities among multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings). Techniques based on multi-task learning obtain predictions by leveraging consumption patterns from the historical load demand of multiple entities and their relationships. However, existing techniques cannot effectively assess inherent uncertainties in load demand or account for dynamic changes in consumption patterns. This paper proposes a multi-task learning technique for online and probabilistic load forecasting. This technique provides accurate probabilistic predictions for the loads of multiple entities by leveraging their dynamic similarities. The method's performance is evaluated using datasets that register the load demand of multiple entities and contain diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly enhance the effectiveness of current multi-task learning approaches across a wide variety of load consumption scenarios.</description>

      <title>Student-t processes as infinite-width limits of posterior Bayesian neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic properties of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have been extensively studied, particularly regarding their approximations by Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit. We extend these results by showing that posterior BNNs can be approximated by Student-t processes, which offer greater flexibility in modeling uncertainty. Specifically, we show that, if the parameters of a BNN follow a Gaussian prior distribution, and the variance of both the last hidden layer and the Gaussian likelihood function follows an Inverse-Gamma prior distribution, then the resulting posterior BNN converges to a Student-t process in the infinite-width limit. Our proof leverages the Wasserstein metric to establish control over the convergence rate of the Student-t process approximation.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression for Inverse Problems in Linear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a computationally efficient algorithm in system theory for solving inverse problems governed by linear partial differential equations (PDEs). We model solutions of linear PDEs using Gaussian processes with priors defined based on advanced commutative algebra and algebraic analysis. The implementation of these priors is algorithmic and achieved using the Macaulay2 computer algebra software. An example application includes identifying the wave speed from noisy data for classical wave equations, which are widely used in physics. The method achieves high accuracy while enhancing computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Powered E-Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality statistical inference requires a sufficient amount of data, which can be missing or hard to obtain. To this end, prediction-powered inference has risen as a promising methodology, but existing approaches are largely limited to Z-estimation problems such as inference of means and quantiles. In this paper, we apply ideas of prediction-powered inference to e-values. By doing so, we inherit all the usual benefits of e-values -- such as anytime-validity, post-hoc validity and versatile sequential inference -- as well as greatly expand the set of inferences achievable in a prediction-powered manner. In particular, we show that every inference procedure that can be framed in terms of e-values has a prediction-powered counterpart, given by our method. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework across a wide range of inference tasks, from simple hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to more involved procedures for change-point detection and causal discovery, which were out of reach of previous techniques. Our approach is modular and easily integrable into existing algorithms, making it a compelling choice for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Stein Discrepancy for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) leverages information from a labeled source dataset to improve accuracy on a related but unlabeled target dataset. A common approach to UDA is aligning representations from the source and target domains by minimizing the distance between their data distributions. Previous methods have employed distances such as Wasserstein distance and maximum mean discrepancy. However, these approaches are less effective when the target data is significantly scarcer than the source data. Stein discrepancy is an asymmetric distance between distributions that relies on one distribution only through its score function. In this paper, we propose a novel \ac{uda} method that uses Stein discrepancy to measure the distance between source and target domains. We develop a learning framework using both non-kernelized and kernelized Stein discrepancy. Theoretically, we derive an upper bound for the generalization error. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods using other domain discrepancy measures when only small amounts of target data are available.</description>

      <title>Type 2 Tobit Sample Selection Models with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Type 2 Tobit Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (TOBART-2). BART can produce accurate individual-specific treatment effect estimates. However, in practice estimates are often biased by sample selection. We extend the Type 2 Tobit sample selection model to account for nonlinearities and model uncertainty by including sums of trees in both the selection and outcome equations. A Dirichlet Process Mixture distribution for the error terms allows for departure from the assumption of bivariate normally distributed errors. Soft trees and a Dirichlet prior on splitting probabilities improve modeling of smooth and sparse data generating processes. We include a simulation study and an application to the RAND Health Insurance Experiment data set.</description>

      <title>Unrealized Expectations: Comparing AI Methods vs Classical Algorithms for Maximum Independent Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI methods, such as generative models and reinforcement learning, have recently been applied to combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, especially NP-hard ones. This paper compares such GPU-based methods with classical CPU-based methods on Maximum Independent Set (MIS). Experiments on standard graph families show that AI-based algorithms fail to outperform and, in many cases, to match the solution quality of the state-of-art classical solver KaMIS running on a single CPU. Some GPU-based methods even perform similarly to the simplest heuristic, degree-based greedy. Even with post-processing techniques like local search, AI-based methods still perform worse than CPU-based solvers.
  We develop a new mode of analysis to reveal that non-backtracking AI methods, e.g. LTFT (which is based on GFlowNets), end up reasoning similarly to the simplest degree-based greedy approach, and thus worse than KaMIS. We also find that CPU-based algorithms, notably KaMIS, have strong performance on sparse random graphs, which appears to refute a well-known conjectured upper bound for efficient algorithms from Coja-Oghlan &amp; Efthymiou (2015).</description>

      <title>Controlled LLM Decoding via Discrete Auto-regressive Biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlled text generation allows for enforcing user-defined constraints on large language model outputs, an increasingly important field as LLMs become more prevalent in everyday life. One common approach uses energy-based decoding, which defines a target distribution through an energy function that combines multiple constraints into a weighted average. However, these methods often struggle to balance fluency with constraint satisfaction, even with extensive tuning of the energy function's coefficients. In this paper, we identify that this suboptimal balance arises from sampling in continuous space rather than the natural discrete space of text tokens. To address this, we propose Discrete Auto-regressive Biasing, a controlled decoding algorithm that leverages gradients while operating entirely in the discrete text domain. Specifically, we introduce a new formulation for controlled text generation by defining a joint distribution over the generated sequence and an auxiliary bias sequence. To efficiently sample from this joint distribution, we propose a Langevin-within-Gibbs sampling algorithm using gradient-based discrete MCMC. Our method significantly improves constraint satisfaction while maintaining comparable or better fluency, all with even lower computational costs. We demonstrate the advantages of our controlled decoding method on sentiment control, language detoxification, and keyword-guided generation.</description>

      <title>Variational Control for Guidance in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit excellent sample quality, but existing guidance methods often require additional model training or are limited to specific tasks. We revisit guidance in diffusion models from the perspective of variational inference and control, introducing Diffusion Trajectory Matching (DTM) that enables guiding pretrained diffusion trajectories to satisfy a terminal cost. DTM unifies a broad class of guidance methods and enables novel instantiations. We introduce a new method within this framework that achieves state-of-the-art results on several linear and (blind) non-linear inverse problems without requiring additional model training or modifications. For instance, in ImageNet non-linear deblurring, our model achieves an FID score of 34.31, significantly improving over the best pretrained-method baseline (FID 78.07). We will make the code available in a future update.</description>

      <title>Aggregate and conquer: detecting and steering LLM concepts by combining nonlinear predictors over multiple layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A trained Large Language Model (LLM) contains much of human knowledge. Yet, it is difficult to gauge the extent or accuracy of that knowledge, as LLMs do not always ``know what they know'' and may even be actively misleading. In this work, we give a general method for detecting semantic concepts in the internal activations of LLMs. Furthermore, we show that our methodology can be easily adapted to steer LLMs toward desirable outputs. Our innovations are the following: (1) we use a nonlinear feature learning method to identify important linear directions for predicting concepts from each layer; (2) we aggregate features across layers to build powerful concept detectors and steering mechanisms. We showcase the power of our approach by attaining state-of-the-art results for detecting hallucinations, harmfulness, toxicity, and untruthful content on seven benchmarks. We highlight the generality of our approach by steering LLMs towards new concepts that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously considered in the literature, including: semantic disambiguation, human languages, programming languages, hallucinated responses, science subjects, poetic/Shakespearean English, and even multiple concepts simultaneously. Moreover, our method can steer concepts with numerical attributes such as product reviews. We provide our code (including a simple API for our methods) at https://github.com/dmbeaglehole/neural_controllers .</description>

      <title>Distribution learning via neural differential equations: minimal energy regularization and approximation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide expressive representations of invertible transport maps that can be used to approximate complex probability distributions, e.g., for generative modeling, density estimation, and Bayesian inference. We show that for a large class of transport maps $T$, there exists a time-dependent ODE velocity field realizing a straight-line interpolation $(1-t)x + tT(x)$, $t \in [0,1]$, of the displacement induced by the map. Moreover, we show that such velocity fields are minimizers of a training objective containing a specific minimum-energy regularization. We then derive explicit upper bounds for the $C^k$ norm of the velocity field that are polynomial in the $C^k$ norm of the corresponding transport map $T$; in the case of triangular (Knothe--Rosenblatt) maps, we also show that these bounds are polynomial in the $C^k$ norms of the associated source and target densities. Combining these results with stability arguments for distribution approximation via ODEs, we show that Wasserstein or Kullback--Leibler approximation of the target distribution to any desired accuracy $\epsilon &gt; 0$ can be achieved by a deep neural network representation of the velocity field whose size is bounded explicitly in terms of $\epsilon$, the dimension, and the smoothness of the source and target densities. The same neural network ansatz yields guarantees on the value of the regularized training objective.</description>

      <title>Bridging the inference gap in Mutimodal Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From medical diagnosis to autonomous vehicles, critical applications rely on the integration of multiple heterogeneous data modalities. Multimodal Variational Autoencoders offer versatile and scalable methods for generating unobserved modalities from observed ones. Recent models using mixturesof-experts aggregation suffer from theoretically grounded limitations that restrict their generation quality on complex datasets. In this article, we propose a novel interpretable model able to learn both joint and conditional distributions without introducing mixture aggregation. Our model follows a multistage training process: first modeling the joint distribution with variational inference and then modeling the conditional distributions with Normalizing Flows to better approximate true posteriors. Importantly, we also propose to extract and leverage the information shared between modalities to improve the conditional coherence of generated samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>A Pseudo Markov-Chain Model and Time-Elapsed Measures of Mobility from Collective Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a pseudo Markov-chain model to understand time-elapsed flows, over multiple intervals, from time and space aggregated collective inter-location trip data, given as a time-series. Building on the model, we develop measures of mobility that parallel those known for individual mobility data, such as the radius of gyration. We apply these measures to the NetMob 2024 Data Challenge data, and obtain interesting results that are consistent with published statistics and commuting patterns in cities. Besides building a new framework, we foresee applications of this approach to an improved understanding of human mobility in the context of environmental changes and sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Cyclic quantum causal modelling with a graph separation theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal modelling frameworks link observable correlations to causal explanations, which is a crucial aspect of science. These models represent causal relationships through directed graphs, with vertices and edges denoting systems and transformations within a theory. Most studies focus on acyclic causal graphs, where well-defined probability rules and powerful graph-theoretic properties like the d-separation theorem apply. However, understanding complex feedback processes and exotic fundamental scenarios with causal loops requires cyclic causal models, where such results do not generally hold. While progress has been made in classical cyclic causal models, challenges remain in uniquely fixing probability distributions and identifying graph-separation properties applicable in general cyclic models. In cyclic quantum scenarios, existing frameworks have focussed on a subset of possible cyclic causal scenarios, with graph-separation properties yet unexplored. This work proposes a framework applicable to all consistent quantum and classical cyclic causal models on finite-dimensional systems. We address these challenges by introducing a robust probability rule and a novel graph-separation property, p-separation, which we prove to be sound and complete for all such models. Our approach maps cyclic causal models to acyclic ones with post-selection, leveraging the post-selected quantum teleportation protocol. We characterize these protocols and their success probabilities along the way. We also establish connections between this formalism and other classical and quantum frameworks to inform a more unified perspective on causality. This provides a foundation for more general cyclic causal discovery algorithms and to systematically extend open problems and techniques from acyclic informational networks (e.g., certification of non-classicality) to cyclic causal structures and networks.</description>

      <title>Cyclic functional causal models beyond unique solvability with a graph separation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional causal models (fCMs) specify functional dependencies between random variables associated to the vertices of a graph. In directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), fCMs are well-understood: a unique probability distribution on the random variables can be easily specified, and a crucial graph-separation result called the d-separation theorem allows one to characterize conditional independences between the variables. However, fCMs on cyclic graphs pose challenges due to the absence of a systematic way to assign a unique probability distribution to the fCM's variables, the failure of the d-separation theorem, and lack of a generalization of this theorem that is applicable to all consistent cyclic fCMs. In this work, we develop a causal modeling framework applicable to all cyclic fCMs involving finite-cardinality variables, except inconsistent ones admitting no solutions. Our probability rule assigns a unique distribution even to non-uniquely solvable cyclic fCMs and reduces to the known rule for uniquely solvable fCMs. We identify a class of fCMs, called averagely uniquely solvable, that we show to be the largest class where the probabilities admit a Markov factorization. Furthermore, we introduce a new graph-separation property, p-separation, and prove this to be sound and complete for all consistent finite-cardinality cyclic fCMs while recovering the d-separation theorem for DAGs. These results are obtained by considering classical post-selected teleportation protocols inspired by analogous protocols in quantum information theory. We discuss further avenues for exploration, linking in particular problems in cyclic fCMs and in quantum causality.</description>

      <title>Archetypal Analysis for Binary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) is a matrix decomposition method that identifies distinct patterns using convex combinations of the data points denoted archetypes with each data point in turn reconstructed as convex combinations of the archetypes. AA thereby forms a polytope representing trade-offs of the distinct aspects in the data. Most existing methods for AA are designed for continuous data and do not exploit the structure of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose two new optimization frameworks for archetypal analysis for binary data. i) A second order approximation of the AA likelihood based on the Bernoulli distribution with efficient closed-form updates using an active set procedure for learning the convex combinations defining the archetypes, and a sequential minimal optimization strategy for learning the observation specific reconstructions. ii) A Bernoulli likelihood based version of the principal convex hull analysis (PCHA) algorithm originally developed for least squares optimization. We compare these approaches with the only existing binary AA procedure relying on multiplicative updates and demonstrate their superiority on both synthetic and real binary data. Notably, the proposed optimization frameworks for AA can easily be extended to other data distributions providing generic efficient optimization frameworks for AA based on tailored likelihood functions reflecting the underlying data distribution.</description>

      <title>"Short-length" Adversarial Training Helps LLMs Defend "Long-length" Jailbreak Attacks: Theoretical and Empirical Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs) aim to induce harmful behaviors in LLMs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. To mitigate attacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e., training LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to behave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays a critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on adversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a jailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\Theta(M)$, it is enough to align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length $\Theta(\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context learning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust generalization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term $\Theta(\sqrt{M_{\text{test}}}/M_{\text{train}})$, where $M_{\text{train}}$ and $M_{\text{test}}$ are the number of adversarially perturbed in-context samples during training and testing. Empirically, we conduct AT on popular open-source LLMs and evaluate their robustness against jailbreak attacks of different adversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a positive correlation between the attack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix during jailbreaking to the length during AT. Our findings show that it is practical to defend "long-length" jailbreak attacks via efficient "short-length" AT. The code is available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl.</description>

      <title>Keep It Light! Simplifying Image Clustering Via Text-Free Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many competitive clustering pipelines have a multi-modal design, leveraging large language models (LLMs) or other text encoders, and text-image pairs, which are often unavailable in real-world downstream applications. Additionally, such frameworks are generally complicated to train and require substantial computational resources, making widespread adoption challenging. In this work, we show that in deep clustering, competitive performance with more complex state-of-the-art methods can be achieved using a text-free and highly simplified training pipeline. In particular, our approach, Simple Clustering via Pre-trained models (SCP), trains only a small cluster head while leveraging pre-trained vision model feature representations and positive data pairs. Experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-20, CIFAR-100, STL-10, ImageNet-10, and ImageNet-Dogs, demonstrate that SCP achieves highly competitive performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result explaining why, at least under ideal conditions, additional text-based embeddings may not be necessary to achieve strong clustering performance in vision.</description>

      <title>Free Energy Risk Metrics for Systemically Safe AI: Gatekeeping Multi-Agent Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Free Energy Principle as a foundation for measuring risk in agentic and multi-agent systems. From these principles we introduce a Cumulative Risk Exposure metric that is flexible to differing contexts and needs. We contrast this to other popular theories for safe AI that hinge on massive amounts of data or describing arbitrarily complex world models. In our framework, stakeholders need only specify their preferences over system outcomes, providing straightforward and transparent decision rules for risk governance and mitigation. This framework naturally accounts for uncertainty in both world model and preference model, allowing for decision-making that is epistemically and axiologically humble, parsimonious, and future-proof. We demonstrate this novel approach in a simplified autonomous vehicle environment with multi-agent vehicles whose driving policies are mediated by gatekeepers that evaluate, in an online fashion, the risk to the collective safety in their neighborhood, and intervene through each vehicle's policy when appropriate. We show that the introduction of gatekeepers in an AV fleet, even at low penetration, can generate significant positive externalities in terms of increased system safety.</description>

      <title>Efficient Randomized Experiments Using Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomized experiments are the preferred approach for evaluating the effects of interventions, but they are costly and often yield estimates with substantial uncertainty. On the other hand, in silico experiments leveraging foundation models offer a cost-effective alternative that can potentially attain higher statistical precision. However, the benefits of in silico experiments come with a significant risk: statistical inferences are not valid if the models fail to accurately predict experimental responses to interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the predictions from multiple foundation models with experimental data while preserving valid statistical inference. Our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal, with asymptotic variance no larger than the standard estimator based on experimental data alone. Importantly, these statistical properties hold even when model predictions are arbitrarily biased. Empirical results across several randomized experiments show that our estimator offers substantial precision gains, equivalent to a reduction of up to 20% in the sample size needed to match the same precision as the standard estimator based on experimental data alone.</description>

      <title>PILAF: Optimal Human Preference Sampling for Reward Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models increasingly drive real-world applications, aligning them with human values becomes paramount. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique, translating preference data into reward models when oracle human values remain inaccessible. In practice, RLHF mostly relies on approximate reward models, which may not consistently guide the policy toward maximizing the underlying human values. We propose Policy-Interpolated Learning for Aligned Feedback (PILAF), a novel response sampling strategy for preference labeling that explicitly aligns preference learning with maximizing the underlying oracle reward. PILAF is theoretically grounded, demonstrating optimality from both an optimization and a statistical perspective. The method is straightforward to implement and demonstrates strong performance in iterative and online RLHF settings where feedback curation is critical.</description>

      <title>Every Call is Precious: Global Optimization of Black-Box Functions with Unknown Lipschitz Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing expensive, non-convex, black-box Lipschitz continuous functions presents significant challenges, particularly when the Lipschitz constant of the underlying function is unknown. Such problems often demand numerous function evaluations to approximate the global optimum, which can be prohibitive in terms of time, energy, or resources. In this work, we introduce Every Call is Precious (ECP), a novel global optimization algorithm that minimizes unpromising evaluations by strategically focusing on potentially optimal regions. Unlike previous approaches, ECP eliminates the need to estimate the Lipschitz constant, thereby avoiding additional function evaluations. ECP guarantees no-regret performance for infinite evaluation budgets and achieves minimax-optimal regret bounds within finite budgets. Extensive ablation studies validate the algorithm's robustness, while empirical evaluations show that ECP outperforms 10 benchmark algorithms including Lipschitz, Bayesian, bandits, and evolutionary methods across 30 multi-dimensional non-convex synthetic and real-world optimization problems, which positions ECP as a competitive approach for global optimization.</description>

Abstract: Data and algorithms have the potential to produce and perpetuate discrimination and disparate treatment. As such, significant effort has been invested in developing approaches to defining, detecting, and eliminating unfair outcomes in algorithms. In this paper, we focus on performing statistical inference for fairness. Prior work in fairness inference has largely focused on inferring the fairness properties of a given predictive algorithm. Here, we expand fairness inference by evaluating fairness in the data generating process itself, referred to here as data fairness. We perform inference on data fairness using targeted learning, a flexible framework for nonparametric inference. We derive estimators demographic parity, equal opportunity, and conditional mutual information. Additionally, we find that our estimators for probabilistic metrics exploit double robustness. To validate our approach, we perform several simulations and apply our estimators to real data.</description>

      <title>Relaxed Quantile Regression: Prediction Intervals for Asymmetric Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constructing valid prediction intervals rather than point estimates is a well-established approach for uncertainty quantification in the regression setting. Models equipped with this capacity output an interval of values in which the ground truth target will fall with some prespecified probability. This is an essential requirement in many real-world applications where simple point predictions' inability to convey the magnitude and frequency of errors renders them insufficient for high-stakes decisions. Quantile regression is a leading approach for obtaining such intervals via the empirical estimation of quantiles in the (non-parametric) distribution of outputs. This method is simple, computationally inexpensive, interpretable, assumption-free, and effective. However, it does require that the specific quantiles being learned are chosen a priori. This results in (a) intervals that are arbitrarily symmetric around the median which is sub-optimal for realistic skewed distributions, or (b) learning an excessive number of intervals. In this work, we propose Relaxed Quantile Regression (RQR), a direct alternative to quantile regression based interval construction that removes this arbitrary constraint whilst maintaining its strengths. We demonstrate that this added flexibility results in intervals with an improvement in desirable qualities (e.g. mean width) whilst retaining the essential coverage guarantees of quantile regression.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops a scale-insensitive framework for neural network significance testing, substantially generalizing existing approaches through three key innovations. First, we replace metric entropy calculations with Rademacher complexity bounds, enabling the analysis of neural networks without requiring bounded weights or specific architectural constraints. Second, we weaken the regularity conditions on the target function to require only Sobolev space membership $H^s([-1,1]^d)$ with $s &gt; d/2$, significantly relaxing previous smoothness assumptions while maintaining optimal approximation rates. Third, we introduce a modified sieve space construction based on moment bounds rather than weight constraints, providing a more natural theoretical framework for modern deep learning practices. Our approach achieves these generalizations while preserving optimal convergence rates and establishing valid asymptotic distributions for test statistics. The technical foundation combines localization theory, sharp concentration inequalities, and scale-insensitive complexity measures to handle unbounded weights and general Lipschitz activation functions. This framework better aligns theoretical guarantees with contemporary deep learning practice while maintaining mathematical rigor.</description>

      <title>Rule Generation for Classification: Scalability, Interpretability, and Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.10751v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new rule-based optimization method for classification with constraints. The proposed method leverages column generation for linear programming, and hence, is scalable to large datasets. The resulting pricing subproblem is shown to be NP-Hard. We recourse to a decision tree-based heuristic and solve a proxy pricing subproblem for acceleration. The method returns a set of rules along with their optimal weights indicating the importance of each rule for learning. We address interpretability and fairness by assigning cost coefficients to the rules and introducing additional constraints. In particular, we focus on local interpretability and generalize a separation criterion in fairness to multiple sensitive attributes and classes. We test the performance of the proposed methodology on a collection of datasets and present a case study to elaborate on its different aspects. The proposed rule-based learning method exhibits a good compromise between local interpretability and fairness on the one side, and accuracy on the other side.</description>

      <title>Random forests for binary geospatial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manuscript develops new method and theory for non-linear regression for binary dependent data using random forests. Existing implementations of random forests for binary data cannot explicitly account for data correlation common in geospatial and time-series settings. For continuous outcomes, recent work has extended random forests (RF) to RF-GLS that incorporate spatial covariance using the generalized least squares (GLS) loss. However, adoption of this idea for binary data is challenging due to the use of the Gini impurity measure in classification trees, which has no known extension to model dependence. We show that for binary data, the GLS loss is also an extension of the Gini impurity measure, as the latter is exactly equivalent to the ordinary least squares (OLS) loss. This justifies using RF-GLS for non-parametric mean function estimation for binary dependent data. We then consider the special case of generalized mixed effects models, the traditional statistical model for binary geospatial data, which models the spatial random effects as a Gaussian process (GP). We propose a novel link-inversion technique that embeds the RF-GLS estimate of the mean function from the first step within the generalized mixed effects model framework, enabling estimation of non-linear covariate effects and offering spatial predictions. We establish consistency of our method, RF-GP, for both mean function and covariate effect estimation. The theory holds for a general class of stationary absolutely regular dependent processes that includes common choices like Gaussian processes with Mat\'ern or compactly supported covariances and autoregressive processes. The theory relaxes the common assumption of additive mean functions and accounts for the non-linear link. We demonstrate that RF-GP outperforms competing methods for estimation and prediction in both simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time Competing-Risks Regression with or without Penalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many studies employ the analysis of time-to-event data that incorporates competing risks and right censoring. Most methods and software packages are geared towards analyzing data that comes from a continuous failure time distribution. However, failure-time data may sometimes be discrete either because time is inherently discrete or due to imprecise measurement. This paper introduces a new estimation procedure for discrete-time survival analysis with competing events. The proposed approach offers a major key advantage over existing procedures and allows for straightforward integration and application of widely used regularized regression and screening-features methods. We illustrate the benefits of our proposed approach by a comprehensive simulation study. Additionally, we showcase the utility of the proposed procedure by estimating a survival model for the length of stay of patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, considering three competing events: discharge to home, transfer to another medical facility, and in-hospital death. A Python package, PyDTS, is available for applying the proposed method with additional features.</description>

      <title>Distributed Event-Based Learning via ADMM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a distributed learning problem, where agents minimize a global objective function by exchanging information over a network. Our approach has two distinct features: (i) It substantially reduces communication by triggering communication only when necessary, and (ii) it is agnostic to the data-distribution among the different agents. We therefore guarantee convergence even if the local data-distributions of the agents are arbitrarily distinct. We analyze the convergence rate of the algorithm both in convex and nonconvex settings and derive accelerated convergence rates for the convex case. We also characterize the effect of communication failures and demonstrate that our algorithm is robust to these. The article concludes by presenting numerical results from distributed learning tasks on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experiments underline communication savings of 35% or more due to the event-based communication strategy, show resilience towards heterogeneous data-distributions, and highlight that our approach outperforms common baselines such as FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD and FedADMM.</description>

      <title>When predict can also explain: few-shot prediction to select better neural latents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latent variable models serve as powerful tools to infer underlying dynamics from observed neural activity. Ideally, the inferred dynamics should align with true ones. However, due to the absence of ground truth data, prediction benchmarks are often employed as proxies. One widely-used method, *co-smoothing*, involves jointly estimating latent variables and predicting observations along held-out channels to assess model performance. In this study, we reveal the limitations of the co-smoothing prediction framework and propose a remedy. In a student-teacher setup with Hidden Markov Models, we demonstrate that the high co-smoothing model space encompasses models with arbitrary extraneous dynamics in their latent representations. To address this, we introduce a secondary metric -- *few-shot co-smoothing*, performing regression from the latent variables to held-out channels in the data using fewer trials. Our results indicate that among models with near-optimal co-smoothing, those with extraneous dynamics underperform in the few-shot co-smoothing compared to 'minimal' models that are devoid of such dynamics. We provide analytical insights into the origin of this phenomenon and further validate our findings on real neural data using two state-of-the-art methods: LFADS and STNDT. In the absence of ground truth, we suggest a novel measure to validate our approach. By cross-decoding the latent variables of all model pairs with high co-smoothing, we identify models with minimal extraneous dynamics. We find a correlation between few-shot co-smoothing performance and this new measure. In summary, we present a novel prediction metric designed to yield latent variables that more accurately reflect the ground truth, offering a significant improvement for latent dynamics inference.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Transformer Derivative Estimates for Explicit Pathwise Learning Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An inherent challenge in computing fully-explicit generalization bounds for transformers involves obtaining covering number estimates for the given transformer class $T$. Crude estimates rely on a uniform upper bound on the local-Lipschitz constants of transformers in $T$, and finer estimates require an analysis of their higher-order partial derivatives. Unfortunately, these precise higher-order derivative estimates for (realistic) transformer models are not currently available in the literature as they are combinatorially delicate due to the intricate compositional structure of transformer blocks.
  This paper fills this gap by precisely estimating all the higher-order derivatives of all orders for the transformer model. We consider realistic transformers with multiple (non-linearized) attention heads per block and layer normalization. We obtain fully-explicit estimates of all constants in terms of the number of attention heads, the depth and width of each transformer block, and the number of normalization layers. Further, we explicitly analyze the impact of various standard activation function choices (e.g. SWISH and GeLU). As an application, we obtain explicit pathwise generalization bounds for transformers on a single trajectory of an exponentially-ergodic Markov process valid at a fixed future time horizon. We conclude that real-world transformers can learn from $N$ (non-i.i.d.) samples of a single Markov process's trajectory at a rate of ${O}(\operatorname{polylog}(N)/\sqrt{N})$.</description>

      <title>Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free baseline in key scenarios.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic meta-learners for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) over time is crucial in many disciplines such as personalized medicine. For example, electronic health records are commonly collected over several time periods and then used to personalize treatment decisions. Existing works for this task have mostly focused on model-based learners (i.e., learners that adapt specific machine-learning models). In contrast, model-agnostic learners -- so-called meta-learners -- are largely unexplored. In our paper, we propose several meta-learners that are model-agnostic and thus can be used in combination with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., transformers) to estimate HTEs over time. Here, our focus is on learners that can be obtained via weighted pseudo-outcome regressions, which allows for efficient estimation by targeting the treatment effect directly. We then provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis that characterizes the different learners and that allows us to offer insights into when specific learners are preferable. Finally, we confirm our theoretical insights through numerical experiments. In sum, while meta-learners are already state-of-the-art for the static setting, we are the first to propose a comprehensive set of meta-learners for estimating HTEs in the time-varying setting.</description>

      <title>SKADA-Bench: Benchmarking Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Methods with Realistic Validation On Diverse Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DA) consists of adapting a model trained on a labeled source domain to perform well on an unlabeled target domain with some data distribution shift. While many methods have been proposed in the literature, fair and realistic evaluation remains an open question, particularly due to methodological difficulties in selecting hyperparameters in the unsupervised setting. With SKADA-bench, we propose a framework to evaluate DA methods on diverse modalities, beyond computer vision task that have been largely explored in the literature. We present a complete and fair evaluation of existing shallow algorithms, including reweighting, mapping, and subspace alignment. Realistic hyperparameter selection is performed with nested cross-validation and various unsupervised model selection scores, on both simulated datasets with controlled shifts and real-world datasets across diverse modalities, such as images, text, biomedical, and tabular data. Our benchmark highlights the importance of realistic validation and provides practical guidance for real-life applications, with key insights into the choice and impact of model selection approaches. SKADA-bench is open-source, reproducible, and can be easily extended with novel DA methods, datasets, and model selection criteria without requiring re-evaluating competitors. SKADA-bench is available on Github at https://github.com/scikit-adaptation/skada-bench.</description>

      <title>Unintentional Unalignment: Likelihood Displacement in Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants are increasingly used for aligning language models with human preferences. Although these methods are designed to teach a model to generate preferred responses more frequently relative to dispreferred responses, prior work has observed that the likelihood of preferred responses often decreases during training. The current work sheds light on the causes and implications of this counter-intuitive phenomenon, which we term likelihood displacement. We demonstrate that likelihood displacement can be catastrophic, shifting probability mass from preferred responses to responses with an opposite meaning. As a simple example, training a model to prefer $\texttt{No}$ over $\texttt{Never}$ can sharply increase the probability of $\texttt{Yes}$. Moreover, when aligning the model to refuse unsafe prompts, we show that such displacement can unintentionally lead to unalignment, by shifting probability mass from preferred refusal responses to harmful responses (e.g., reducing the refusal rate of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 74.4% to 33.4%). We theoretically characterize that likelihood displacement is driven by preferences that induce similar embeddings, as measured by a centered hidden embedding similarity (CHES) score. Empirically, the CHES score enables identifying which training samples contribute most to likelihood displacement in a given dataset. Filtering out these samples effectively mitigated unintentional unalignment in our experiments. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of curating data with sufficiently distinct preferences, for which we believe the CHES score may prove valuable.</description>

      <title>The Implicit Bias of Structured State Space Models Can Be Poisoned With Clean Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are powered by an implicit bias: a tendency of gradient descent to fit training data in a way that generalizes to unseen data. A recent class of neural network models gaining increasing popularity is structured state space models (SSMs), regarded as an efficient alternative to transformers. Prior work argued that the implicit bias of SSMs leads to generalization in a setting where data is generated by a low dimensional teacher. In this paper, we revisit the latter setting, and formally establish a phenomenon entirely undetected by prior work on the implicit bias of SSMs. Namely, we prove that while implicit bias leads to generalization under many choices of training data, there exist special examples whose inclusion in training completely distorts the implicit bias, to a point where generalization fails. This failure occurs despite the special training examples being labeled by the teacher, i.e. having clean labels! We empirically demonstrate the phenomenon, with SSMs trained independently and as part of non-linear neural networks. In the area of adversarial machine learning, disrupting generalization with cleanly labeled training examples is known as clean-label poisoning. Given the proliferation of SSMs, particularly in large language models, we believe significant efforts should be invested in further delineating their susceptibility to clean-label poisoning, and in developing methods for overcoming this susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Probabilities of Rare Outputs in Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of low probability estimation: given a machine learning model and a formally-specified input distribution, how can we estimate the probability of a binary property of the model's output, even when that probability is too small to estimate by random sampling? This problem is motivated by the need to improve worst-case performance, which distribution shift can make much more likely. We study low probability estimation in the context of argmax sampling from small transformer language models. We compare two types of methods: importance sampling, which involves searching for inputs giving rise to the rare output, and activation extrapolation, which involves extrapolating a probability distribution fit to the model's logits. We find that importance sampling outperforms activation extrapolation, but both outperform naive sampling. Finally, we explain how minimizing the probability estimate of an undesirable behavior generalizes adversarial training, and argue that new methods for low probability estimation are needed to provide stronger guarantees about worst-case performance.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Forgetting in LLM Supervised Fine-Tuning and Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training of pre-trained LLMs, which typically consists of the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage and the preference learning (RLHF or DPO) stage, is crucial to effective and safe LLM applications. The widely adopted approach in post-training popular open-source LLMs is to sequentially perform SFT and RLHF/DPO. However, sequential training is sub-optimal in terms of SFT and RLHF/DPO trade-off: the LLM gradually forgets about the first stage's training when undergoing the second stage's training. We theoretically prove the sub-optimality of sequential post-training. Furthermore, we propose a practical joint post-training framework with theoretical convergence guarantees and empirically outperforms sequential post-training framework, while having similar computational cost.

Abstract: Disentanglement, or identifying statistically independent factors of the data, is relevant to much of machine learning, from controlled data generation and robust classification to efficient encoding and improving our understanding of the data itself. Disentanglement arises in several generative paradigms including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Recent progress has been made in understanding disentanglement in VAEs, where a choice of diagonal posterior covariance matrices is shown to promote mutual orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. We build on this to show how such orthogonality, a geometric property, translates to disentanglement, a statistical property, furthering our understanding of how a VAE identifies independent components of, or disentangles, the data.</description>

      <title>Conformal Risk Minimization with Variance Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a distribution-free framework for achieving probabilistic guarantees on black-box models. CP is generally applied to a model post-training. Recent research efforts, on the other hand, have focused on optimizing CP efficiency during training. We formalize this concept as the problem of conformal risk minimization (CRM). In this direction, conformal training (ConfTr) by Stutz et al.(2022) is a technique that seeks to minimize the expected prediction set size of a model by simulating CP in-between training updates. Despite its potential, we identify a strong source of sample inefficiency in ConfTr that leads to overly noisy estimated gradients, introducing training instability and limiting practical use. To address this challenge, we propose variance-reduced conformal training (VR-ConfTr), a CRM method that incorporates a variance reduction technique in the gradient estimation of the ConfTr objective function. Through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that VR-ConfTr consistently achieves faster convergence and smaller prediction sets compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Non-Euclidean High-Order Smooth Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop algorithms for the optimization of convex objectives that have H\"older continuous $q$-th derivatives by using a $q$-th order oracle, for any $q \geq 1$. Our algorithms work for general norms under mild conditions, including the $\ell_p$-settings for $1\leq p\leq \infty$. We can also optimize structured functions that allow for inexactly implementing a non-Euclidean ball optimization oracle. We do this by developing a non-Euclidean inexact accelerated proximal point method that makes use of an \emph{inexact uniformly convex regularizer}. We show a lower bound for general norms that demonstrates our algorithms are nearly optimal in high-dimensions in the black-box oracle model for $\ell_p$-settings and all $q \geq 1$, even in randomized and parallel settings. This new lower bound, when applied to the first-order smooth case, resolves an open question in parallel convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks for Drift Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept drift refers to the change of data distributions over time. While drift poses a challenge for learning models, requiring their continual adaption, it is also relevant in system monitoring to detect malfunctions, system failures, and unexpected behavior. In the latter case, the robust and reliable detection of drifts is imperative. This work studies the shortcomings of commonly used drift detection schemes. We show how to construct data streams that are drifting without being detected. We refer to those as drift adversarials. In particular, we compute all possible adversairals for common detection schemes and underpin our theoretical findings with empirical evaluations.</description>

      <title>On robust recovery of signals from indirect observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an uncertain linear inverse problem as follows. Given observation $\omega=Ax_*+\zeta$ where $A\in {\bf R}^{m\times p}$ and $\zeta\in {\bf R}^{m}$ is observation noise, we want to recover unknown signal $x_*$, known to belong to a convex set ${\cal X}\subset{\bf R}^{n}$. As opposed to the "standard" setting of such problem, we suppose that the model noise $\zeta$ is "corrupted" -- contains an uncertain (deterministic dense or singular) component. Specifically, we assume that $\zeta$ decomposes into $\zeta=N\nu_*+\xi$ where $\xi$ is the random noise and $N\nu_*$ is the "adversarial contamination" with known $\cal N\subset {\bf R}^n$ such that $\nu_*\in \cal N$ and $N\in {\bf R}^{m\times n}$. We consider two "uncertainty setups" in which $\cal N$ is either a convex bounded set or is the set of sparse vectors (with at most $s$ nonvanishing entries). We analyse the performance of "uncertainty-immunized" polyhedral estimates -- a particular class of nonlinear estimates as introduced in [15, 16] -- and show how "presumably good" estimates of the sort may be constructed in the situation where the signal set is an ellitope (essentially, a symmetric convex set delimited by quadratic surfaces) by means of efficient convex optimization routines.</description>

      <title>Causal Learning for Heterogeneous Subgroups Based on Nonlinear Causal Kernel Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the challenge posed by multi-source and heterogeneous data collected from diverse environments, causal relationships among features can exhibit variations influenced by different time spans, regions, or strategies. This diversity makes a single causal model inadequate for accurately representing complex causal relationships in all observational data, a crucial consideration in causal learning. To address this challenge, the nonlinear Causal Kernel Clustering method is introduced for heterogeneous subgroup causal learning, highlighting variations in causal relationships across diverse subgroups. \textcolor{new}{The main component for clustering heterogeneous subgroups lies in the construction of the $u$-centered sample mapping function with the property of unbiased estimation, which assesses the differences in potential nonlinear causal relationships in various samples and supported by causal identifiability theory.} Experimental results indicate that the method performs well in identifying heterogeneous subgroups and enhancing causal learning, leading to a reduction in prediction error.</description>

      <title>On characterizing optimal learning trajectories in a class of learning problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this brief paper, we provide a mathematical framework that exploits the relationship between the maximum principle and dynamic programming for characterizing optimal learning trajectories in a class of learning problem, which is related to point estimations for modeling of high-dimensional nonlinear functions. Here, such characterization for the optimal learning trajectories is associated with the solution of an optimal control problem for a weakly-controlled gradient system with small parameters, whose time-evolution is guided by a model training dataset and its perturbed version, while the optimization problem consists of a cost functional that summarizes how to gauge the quality/performance of the estimated model parameters at a certain fixed final time w.r.t. a model validating dataset. Moreover, using a successive Galerkin approximation method, we provide an algorithmic recipe how to construct the corresponding optimal learning trajectories leading to the optimal estimated model parameters for such a class of learning problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient Over-parameterized Matrix Sensing from Noisy Measurements via Alternating Preconditioned Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the noisy matrix sensing problem in the over-parameterization setting, where the estimated rank $r$ is larger than the true rank $r_\star$. Specifically, our main objective is to recover a matrix $ X_\star \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times n_2} $ with rank $ r_\star $ from noisy measurements using an over-parameterized factorized form $ LR^\top $, where $ L \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times r}, \, R \in \mathbb{R}^{n_2 \times r} $ and $ \min\{n_1, n_2\} \ge r &gt; r_\star $, with the true rank $ r_\star $ being unknown. Recently, preconditioning methods have been proposed to accelerate the convergence of matrix sensing problem compared to vanilla gradient descent, incorporating preconditioning terms $ (L^\top L + \lambda I)^{-1} $ and $ (R^\top R + \lambda I)^{-1} $ into the original gradient. However, these methods require careful tuning of the damping parameter $\lambda$ and are sensitive to initial points and step size. To address these limitations, we propose the alternating preconditioned gradient descent (APGD) algorithm, which alternately updates the two factor matrices, eliminating the need for the damping parameter and enabling faster convergence with larger step sizes. We theoretically prove that APGD achieves near-optimal error convergence at a linear rate, starting from arbitrary random initializations. Through extensive experiments, we validate our theoretical results and demonstrate that APGD outperforms other methods, achieving the fastest convergence rate. Notably, both our theoretical analysis and experimental results illustrate that APGD does not rely on the initialization procedure, making it more practical and versatile.</description>

      <title>The Ensemble Kalman Update is an Empirical Matheron Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is a widely used method for data assimilation in high-dimensional systems. In this paper, we show that the ensemble update step of the EnKF is equivalent to an empirical version of the Matheron update popular in the study of Gaussian process regression. While this connection is simple, it seems not to be widely known, the literature about each technique seems distinct, and connections between the methods are not exploited. This paper exists to provide an informal introduction to the connection, with the necessary definitions so that it is intelligible to as broad an audience as possible.</description>
