      <title>Multistable Curved-Crease Origami Blocks for Reconfigurable Modular Building System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a reconfigurable modular building system that assembles multistable curved-crease origami blocks. Curved-crease origami is designed with even-vertex polygonal trajectories and an elastica curvature profile. We then connect the matching ends to impart multistability. Through this design approach, we create various blocks and investigate their snapping and load-bearing behavior using finite element analysis. We design block assemblies of multi-story and quasi-continuous wall surfaces and fabricate a series of desktop and large-scale prototypes to demonstrate the flexibility and adaptability of our system for architectural use. Furthermore, by introducing a tension cable to the assembly, the assembled modules can be snapped into multiple configurations.</description>

      <title>Membrane phononic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phononic circuits constructed from high tensile stress membranes offer a range of desirable features such as high acoustic confinement, controllable nonlinearities, low mass, compact footprint, and ease of fabrication. This tutorial presents a systematic approach to modelling and designing phononic integrated circuits on this platform, beginning with acoustic confinement, wave propagation and dispersion, mechanical and actuation nonlinearities, as well as resonator dynamics. By adapting coupled mode theory from optoelectronics to suspended membranes, and validating this theory with several numerical techniques (finite element modelling, finite difference time domain simulations, and the transfer matrix method), we then provide a comprehensive framework to engineer a broad variety of phononic circuit building blocks. As illustrative examples, we describe the implementation of several acoustic circuit elements including resonant and non-resonant variable-ratio power splitters, mode converters, mode (de)multiplexers, and in-line Fabry-Perot cavities based on evanescent tunnel barriers. These building blocks lay the foundation for phononic integrated circuits with applications in sensing, acoustic signal processing, and power-efficient and radiation-hard computing.</description>

      <title>Investigation of particle dynamics and classification mechanism in a spiral jet mill through computational fluid dynamics and discrete element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the outcome of jet-milling based on the knowledge of process parameters and starting material properties is a task still far from being accomplished. Given the technical difficulties in measuring thermodynamics, flow properties and particle statistics directly in the mills, modelling and simulations constitute alternative tools to gain insight in the process physics and many papers have been recently published on the subject. An ideal predictive simulation tool should combine the correct description of non-isothermal, compressible, high Mach number fluid flow, the correct particle-fluid and particle-particle interactions and the correct fracture mechanics of particle upon collisions but it is not currently available. In this paper we present our coupled CFD-DEM simulation results; while comparing them with the recent modelling and experimental works we will review the current understating of the jet-mill physics and particle classification. Subsequently we analyze the missing elements and the bottlenecks currently limiting the simulation technique as well as the possible ways to circumvent them towards a quantitative, predictive simulation of jet-milling.</description>

      <title>Performance enhancement in Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers by tailoring the relative distance between junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers with heterogeneously spaced junctions are theoretically investigated. We consider unit cells with three junctions and characterize their interaction by spatially displaced fields defined by node fluxes. To solve this problem we define the system action and apply the variational principle to obtain the static action, which determines the equations of motion. This work shows that gain and bandwidth can be increased by modifying the relative distance between junctions within the same unit cell, thus increasing the effective nonlinear interaction. We find an optimal sub-unit-cell size ratio, which maximizes both gain and bandwidth, while equally spaced junctions offer minimum performance. Even though this method does not rely on phase-matching, the same device can operate at different pump frequencies, it requires a very large number of JJs to achieve gains above 20 dB. We show that this method can be combined with resonant-phase matching and predicts an ideal gain above 29 dB on a 4 GHz bandwidth with 1998 junctions. Despite possible challenges fabricating devices at the optimal sub-unit-cell size with current technologies, substantial gain increase can still be achieved at sub-optimal sizes.</description>

      <title>Janus Skyrmion: Interfacial Quasiparticle with Two-Faced Helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Janus particles are functional particles with at least two surfaces showing asymmetric properties. We show at the interface between two magnetic regions with different antisymmetric exchange interactions, a new species of topological quasiparticles can emerge, in which different helicity structures can coexist. We name such an interfacial quasiparticle a "Janus skyrmion", in analogy to the Janus particle. As the Janus skyrmion shows helicity asymmetry, its size could vary with both the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A vertical spin current could drive the Janus skyrmion into one-dimensional motion along the interface without showing the skyrmion Hall effect, at a speed which depends on both the spin polarization angle and current density. Thermal fluctuations could also lead to one-dimensional random walk of a Brownian Janus skyrmion. This work uncovers unique dynamics of interfacial quasiparticles with exotic helicity structures, which may be realized in interface-engineered magnetic layers.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in tantalum superconducting circuits on silicon for scalable quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance and scalability of superconducting quantum circuits are fundamentally constrained by non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which induce microwave losses that limit resonator quality factors and qubit coherence times. Understanding and mitigating these excitations is therefore central to advancing scalable quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate on-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in high-Q {\alpha}-tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon, operated in the single-photon regime. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal persistent non-equilibrium quasiparticles at millikelvin temperatures, producing a measurable suppression of the internal quality factor (Qi) relative to theoretical expectations. By benchmarking across materials, we find that the quasiparticle density in {\alpha}-Ta is approximately one-third that of NbN at equivalent normalised temperatures (T/Tc), directly correlating with reduced microwave loss. Our methodology establishes a scalable platform for probing quasiparticle dynamics and points towards new routes for engineering superconducting circuits with improved coherence, with impact on qubit readout resonators, kinetic-inductance detectors, and emerging quantum processors and sensors.</description>

Abstract: Guided by a comprehensive analysis of accumulation mode transistor physics and oxide semiconductor materials properties, we demonstrate an innovative oxide semiconductor transistor structure and process flow that break the constraint between performance and reliability observed in conventional InGaZnO4 (IGZO) transistors. The newly proposed 10 nm innovative IGZO transistor features high on-current, high extrinsic mobility (20 cm2V-1s-1), near-zero hysteresis, and only 15 mV Vt shift after positive-bias-stress (PBS) of 3 MV/cm stress for 1000s at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Generalized many-body approach for near-field radiative heat transfer between nonspherical dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized fluctuational electrodynamics-based many-body approach for calculating near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) between nonspherical dipoles is proposed. The geometric parameters of nonspherical dipoles are implemented in the definition of the self-term of the free-space Green's function. Dipole polarizability is defined a posteriori from the free-space Green's function solution such that polarizability calculation is an optional post-processing step rather than a required input. Both strong and weak forms of the generalized many-body approach are presented. It is shown that the approximate weak form is less computationally expensive but is only applicable to small particles characterized by size parameters less than ~0.24. The generalized many-body method is compared against an analytical solution for NFRHT between two spheroidal dipoles. A good agreement is obtained, and the small discrepancies are ascribed to differences in approximations for multiple reflections. The generalized many-body method is then applied to analyze the near-field spectral conductance between two SiC ellipsoidal dipoles. Results reveal that changes in the orientation of one of the ellipsoidal dipoles lead to active tuning of localized surface phonon resonance by up to three orders of magnitude. Finally, the spectral radiative thermal conductivity of a metamaterial composed of 1000 SiO2 ellipsoidal particles is studied. The metamaterial displays anisotropic radiative thermal conductivity, with resonance values differing by up to a factor of 2.8 between different directions. The generalized many-body model of NFRHT presented in this paper may be used to develop particle-based metamaterials with novel, engineered radiative thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Exact Formulation of the Resonant Coupling of a Deep-Subwavelength Particle in a Rectangular Conducting Cavity: Beyond the Jaynes-Cummings Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the resonant interaction between a deep-subwavelength particle and a perfectly conducting rectangular cavity, with potential applications in cavity classical and quantum electrodynamics and wave physics. The particle may behave as a harmonic oscillator, such as a semiconductor plasmonic nanoparticle, a ferrite particle, or as a two-level system, such as a Rydberg atom or trapped ion operating in the microwave regime, where metals can be modeled as perfect conductors at microwave frequencies. Our primary objective is to determine the joint resonances (eigenfrequencies) of the coupled cavity-particle system without imposing restrictions on the coupling strength. Unlike conventional quantum optics models, such as the Jaynes-Cummings model, which typically consider interactions with a limited number of cavity modes and may suffer from causality violations, our formulation fully accounts for the complete mode spectrum of the cavity, ensuring strict causality.
  From a mathematical standpoint, we introduce a novel singularity extraction technique (renormalization) for the local field Green's function, $G^{\text{loc}}(r)$, which represents the field at the particle's location due to backscattering of its own radiation. This function is defined as the difference between the cavity Green's function and its free-space counterpart, resulting in a numerically challenging $\infty - \infty$ form. To precisely calculate this limit, we develop a stable and efficient recursive approach tailored for a rectangular cavity, which can be easily applied to other structured cavities and waveguides [...]</description>

      <title>Metallic $p$-wave magnet with commensurate spin helix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic states with spin-split electronic structure give rise to novel spintronic, magnonic, and electronic phenomena despite (near-) zero net magnetization. The simplest odd-parity spin splitting - $p$-wave - was originally proposed to emerge from a collective instability in interacting electron systems. Recent theory identifies a distinct route to realise $p$-wave spin-split electronic bands without strong correlations, termed $p$-wave magnetism. Here we demonstrate an experimental realisation of a metallic $p$-wave magnet. The odd-parity spin splitting of delocalised conduction electrons arises from their coupling to an antiferromagnetic texture of localised magnetic moments: a coplanar spin helix whose magnetic period is an even multiple of the chemical unit cell, as revealed by X-ray scattering experiments. This texture breaks space inversion symmetry but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a half-unit-cell translation - thereby fulfilling the symmetry conditions for $p$-wave magnetism. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our $p$-wave magnet exhibits a characteristic anisotropy in the electronic conductivity. Relativistic spin-orbit coupling and a tiny spontaneous net magnetization further break $T$ symmetry, resulting in a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE, $\sigma_{xy}&gt;600\,$S/cm, Hall angle $&gt;3\,\%$), for an antiferromagnet. Our model calculations show that the spin nodal planes found in the electronic structure of $p$-wave magnets are readily gapped by a small perturbation to induce the AHE.</description>

      <title>Universal Multistate Kinetic Models for the In-Silico Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters exhibit complex photophysical behaviors that cannot be fully captured by the conventional three state model (S0, S1, T1). The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2), and accounts for the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results. These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters.</description>
