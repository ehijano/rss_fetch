      <title>Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current models of ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas are often considered as compatible with quantum theory. In this work, however, it is shown that improvements should be introduced into these models to rigorously take into account the quantum nature of phase space which is related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models which are considered is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. Hamiltonian operator of a gas particle and its eigenstates are firstly determined and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamics properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the thermodynamic particles number, the internal energy, the grand canonical potential and the pressure as well as the state equations, corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperature and for confined volume. They permit in particular to highlight the existence of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamics functions and variables are directly related to the momenta quantum statistical variances. Well-known relations corresponding to classical ideal gas model can be retrieved from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperature and for large volume.</description>

      <title>Quantum droplet speed management and supersolid behavior in external harmonic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a management method for controlling the speed and direction of self-bound quantum droplets (QDs) in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate mixture under time-modulated external harmonic confinement. Utilizing the 1D extended Gross-Pit"{a}evskii equation, QDs are constructed within both regular and expulsive parabolic traps, considering temporally varying attractive quadratic beyond mean field and repulsive cubic mean-field atom-atom interactions. Through the derived wavefunction solution, we illustrate the dynamics of slowing, stopping, reversing, fragmentation, collapse, and revival of droplets. Additionally, the solutions reveal a crystalline order with a superfluid background, indicative of supersolid behavior in various parameter domains. Notably, one-third of the constant background matches the lowest residual condensate. These findings hold potential applications in matter-wave interferometry and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Coherence of a non-equilibrium polariton condensate across the interaction-mediated phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of spatial coherence in a confined two-dimensional Bose gas of exciton-polaritons with tuneable interactions offers a unique opportunity to explore the role of interactions in a phase transition in a driven-dissipative quantum system, where both the phase transition and thermalisation are mediated by interactions. We investigate, experimentally and numerically, the phase correlations and steady-state properties of the gas over a wide range of interaction strengths by varying the photonic/excitonic fraction of the polaritons and their density. We find that the first order spatial coherence function exhibits algebraic decay consistent with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition. Surprisingly, the exponent of the algebraic decay is inversely proportional to the coherent density of polaritons, in analogy to equilibrium superfluids above the BKT transition, but with a different proportionality constant. Our work paves the way for future investigations of the phenomenon of phase transitions and superfluidity in a driven-dissipative setting</description>

      <title>Controllable interatomic interaction mediated by diffractive coupling in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-mediated interaction can be used for simulating complex many-body phenomena with ultracold atoms coupled to electromagnetic modes of an optical resonator. We theoretically study a method of producing controllable interatomic interaction mediated by forward-diffracted photons circulating inside a ring cavity. One example of such a system is the three-mode cavity, where an on-axis mode can coexist with two diffracted sidebands. We demonstrate how the self-organized stripe states of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) occurring in this cavity geometry can exhibit supersolid properties, due to spontaneous breaking of the Hamiltonian's continuous translational symmetry. A numerical study of the collective excitation spectrum of these states demonstrates the existence of massles and finite-gap excitations, which are identified as phase (Goldstone) and amplitude (Higgs) atomic density modes. We further demonstrate how judicious Fourier filtering of intracavity light can be used to engineer the effective atom-atom interaction profile for many cavity modes. The numerical results in this configuration show the existence of droplet array and single droplet BEC states for commensurate and incommensurate cavity modes, respectively. Diffractive coupling in a cavity is thereby introduced as a novel route towards tailoring the photon-mediated interaction of ultracold atoms. Spatial features of the self-organized optical potentials can here be tuned to scales several times larger than the pump laser wavelength, such that the corresponding atomic density distributions could be imaged and manipulated using low numerical aperture optics. These calculations and insights pave the way towards quantum simulation of exotic nonequilibrium many-body physics with condensates in a cavity.</description>

      <title>Imaging Coulomb interactions and migrating Dirac cones in twisted graphene by local quantum oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat band moir\'e graphene systems have emerged as a quintessential platform to investigate correlated phases of matter. A plethora of interaction-driven ground states have been proposed, and yet despite extensive experimental effort, there has been little direct evidence that distinguishes between the various phases, in particular near charge neutrality point. Here, we use a nanoscale scanning superconducting quantum interference device to image the local thermodynamic quantum oscillations in alternating-twist trilayer graphene at magnetic fields as low as 56 mT, which reveal ultrafine details of the density of states and of the renormalization of the single-particle band structure by Coulomb interactions. We find that the charging self-energy due to occupied electronic states, is critical in explaining the high carrier density physics. At half-filling of the conduction flat band, we observe a Stoner-like symmetry breaking, suggesting that it is the most robust mechanism in the hierarchy of phase transitions. On approaching charge neutrality, where the charging energy is negligible and exchange energy is dominant, we find the ground state to be a nematic semimetal which is favored over gapped states in the presence of heterostrain. In the revealed semimetallic phase, the flat-band Dirac cones migrate towards the mini-Brillouin zone center, spontaneously breaking the C_3 rotational symmetry. Our low-field local quantum oscillations technique presents an alluring avenue to explore the ground states of diverse strongly interacting van der Waals systems.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which are the set of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we have set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit.</description>

      <title>Stability and Dynamics of Atom-Molecule Superfluids Near a Narrow Feshbach Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observations of a stable molecular condensate emerging from a condensate of bosonic atoms and related "super-chemical" dynamics have raised an intriguing set of questions. Here we provide a microscopic understanding of this unexpected stability and dynamics in atom-molecule superfluids; we show one essential element behind these phenomena is an extremely narrow Feshbach resonance in $^{133}$Cs at 19.849G. Comparing theory and experiment we demonstrate how this narrow resonance enables the dynamical creation of a large closed-channel molecular fraction superfluid, appearing in the vicinity of unitarity. Theoretically the observed superchemistry (\textit{i.e.}, Bose enhanced reactions of atoms and molecules), is found to be assisted by the formation of Cooper-like pairs of bosonic atoms that have opposite momenta. Importantly, this narrow resonance opens the possibility to explore the quantum critical point of a molecular Bose superfluid and related phenomena which would not be possible near a more typically broad Feshbach resonance.</description>

      <title>Condensate and superfluid fraction of homogeneous Bose gases in a self-consistent Popov approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the condensate and superfluid fraction of a homogeneous gas of weakly interacting bosons in three spatial dimensions by adopting a self-consistent Popov approximation, comparing this approach with other theoretical schemes. Differently from the superfluid fraction, we find that at finite temperature the condensate fraction is a non-monotonic function of the interaction strength, presenting a global maximum at a characteristic value of the gas parameter, which grows as the temperature increases. This non-monotonic behavior has not yet been observed, but could be tested with the available experimental setups of ultracold bosonic atoms confined in a box potential. We clearly identify the region of parameter space that is of experimental interest to look for this behavior and provide explicit expressions for the relevant observables. Finite size effects are also discussed within a semiclassical approximation.</description>

Abstract: We simulate a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate in the strongly dipolar regime, observing the existence of self-bound droplets, as well as their splitting into multiple droplets by confinement-induced frustration. Our quantum Monte Carlo approach goes beyond the limits of the established effective mean-field theories for dipolar quantum gases, revealing small droplets produced by strong dipolar interactions outside known stable regimes. The simulations include realistic molecular interactions and therefore have direct relevance for current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spin Squeezing from Finite Temperature Easy-plane Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin squeezing is a form of entanglement that reshapes the quantum projection noise to improve measurement precision. Here, we provide numerical and analytic evidence for the following conjecture: any Hamiltonian exhibiting finite temperature, easy-plane ferromagnetism can be used to generate scalable spin squeezing, thereby enabling quantum-enhanced sensing. Our conjecture is guided by a connection between the quantum Fisher information of pure states and the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. We demonstrate that spin-squeezing exhibits a phase diagram with a sharp transition between scalable squeezing and non-squeezing. This transition coincides with the equilibrium phase boundary for XY order at a finite temperature. In the scalable squeezing phase, we predict a sensitivity scaling that lies in between the standard quantum limit and the scaling achieved in all-to-all coupled one-axis twisting models. A corollary of our conjecture is that short-ranged versions of two-axis twisting cannot yield scalable metrological gain. Our results provide insights into the landscape of Hamiltonians that can be used to generate metrologically useful quantum states.</description>

      <title>Mixed-State Quantum Spin Liquids and Dynamical Anyon Condensations in Kitaev Lindbladians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids and anyons, used to be subjects of condensed matter physics, now are realized in various platforms of qubits, offering unprecedented opportunities to investigate fundamental physics of many-body quantum entangled states. Qubits are inevitably exposed to environment effects such as decoherence and dissipation, which are believed to be detrimental to many-body entanglement. Here, we argue that unlike the common belief decoherence and dissipation can give rise to novel topological phenomena in quantum spin liquids. We study open quantum systems of the Kitaev spin liquid and the toric code via the Lindblad master equation approach. By using exact solutions and numerical approaches, we show the dynamical occurrence of anyon condensation by decoherence and dissipation, which results in a topological transition from the initial state spin liquid to the steady state spin liquid. The mechanism of the anyon condensation transition by the Lindblad dynamics is elucidated. We also provide an insight into the relationship between the Kitaev spin liquid and the toric code in the picture of anyon condensation. Our work suggests open quantum systems to be a new venue for topological phenomena of quantum spin liquids and anyons.</description>

      <title>Pound-Drever-Hall Feedforward: Laser Phase Noise Suppression beyond Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) laser frequency stabilization is a powerful technique widely used for building narrow-linewidth lasers. This technique is however ineffective in suppressing high-frequency (&gt;100~kHz) laser phase noise detrimental for many applications. Here, we introduce an effective method which can greatly enhance its high-frequency performance. The idea is to recycle the residual PDH signal of a laser locked to a cavity, by feedforwarding it directly to the laser output field after a delay fiber. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrate a phase noise suppression capability about 4 orders of magnitude better than just using usual PDH feedback for phase noise around a few MHz. We further find that this method exhibits noise suppression performance equivalent to cavity filtering. The new method holds great promise for applications demanding highly stable lasers with diminished phase noise up to tens of MHz, e.g. precise and high-speed control of atomic and molecular quantum states.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum dynamics of observables at eigenstate transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an outstanding goal to unveil the key features of quantum dynamics at eigenstate transitions. Focusing on quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians that exhibit localization transitions, we identify physical observables that exhibit scale-invariant critical dynamics at the transition when quenched from the initially localized charge density-wave states. The identification is based on two ingredients: (a) A relationship between the time evolution of observables in a many-body state and the transition probabilities of single-particle states, and (b) scale invariance of transition probabilities, which generalizes the corresponding recent result for survival probabilities [M. Hopjan and L. Vidmar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023); Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 043301 (2023)]. These properties suggest that the scale-invariant critical dynamics in the quantum-quench dynamics is also exhibited by the observables, which share the common eigenbasis with the Hamiltonian before the quench. Focusing on experimentally relevant observables such as site occupations and the particle imbalance, we numerically demonstrate their critical behavior at the eigenstate transitions in the three-dimensional Anderson model and the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e model model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of hydrodynamic theories for superfluids with dipole symmetry. Taking diffusion as an example, we systematically construct a hydrodynamic framework that incorporates an intrinsic dipole degree of freedom in analogy to spin density in micropolar (spinful) fluids. Subsequently, we study a dipole condensed phase and propose a model that captures the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ charge. The theory explains the role of the inverse Higgs constraint for this class of theories, and naturally generates the gapless field. Next, we introduce finite temperature theory using the Hamiltonian formalism and study the hydrodynamics of ideal fracton superfluids. Finally, we postulate a derivative counting scheme and incorporate dissipative effects using the method of irreversible thermodynamics. We verify the consistency of the dispersion relations and argue that our counting is systematic.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recently reported magnetic-field induced topological phases in ultracold atoms and correlated Moir\'e materials, we investigate topological phase transitions in a minimal model consisting of interacting spinless fermions described by the Hofstadter model on a square lattice. For interacting lattice Hamiltonians in the presence of a commensurate magnetic flux it has been demonstrated that the quantized Hall conductivity is constrained by a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM)-type theorem due to magnetic translation symmetry. In this work, we revisit the validity of the theorem for such models and establish that a topological phase transition from a topological to a trivial insulating phase can be realized but must be accompanied by spontaneous magnetic translation symmetry breaking caused by charge ordering of the spinless fermions. To support our findings, the topological phase diagram for varying interaction strength is mapped out numerically with exact diagonalization for different flux quantum ratios and band fillings using symmetry indicators. We discuss our results in the context of the LSM-type theorem.</description>

      <title>Deciding factor for detecting a particle within a subspace via dark and bright states</title>

Abstract: In a measurement-induced continuous-time quantum walk, we address the problem of detecting a particle in a subspace, instead of a fixed position. In this configuration, we develop an approach of bright and dark states based on the unit and vanishing detection probability respectively for a particle-detection in the subspace. Specifically, by employing the rank-nullity theorem, we determine several properties of dark and bright states in terms of energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian used for a quantum walk and the projectors applied to detect the subspace. We provide certain conditions on the position and the rank of the subspace to be detected, resulting in the unit total detection probability, which has broad implications for quantum computing. Further, we illustrate the forms of dark as well as bright states and the dependence of detection probability on the number of dark states by considering a cyclic graph with nearest-neighbor and next nearest-neighbor hopping. Moreover, we observe that the divergence in the average number of measurements for detecting a particle successfully in a subspace can be reduced by performing high rank projectors.</description>

      <title>Amplitude, phase, and topological fluctuations shaping the complex phase diagram of two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the amplitude and phase fluctuations of the Ginzburg-Landau quasi-order parameter for superconductors in two spatial dimensions. Starting from the mean-field critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}0}$, we calculate the beyond-mean-field critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ by including thermal fluctuations of the quasi-order parameter within the Gaussian level. Moreover, from our beyond-mean field results, we derive the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$, which takes into account topological vortex-antivortex excitations in the phase fluctuations as well as the amplitude fluctuations, to obtain the shifts of transition temperatures. We elucidate how the Gaussian thermal fluctuations and phase fluctuations associated with vortex excitations affect thermodynamic properties by determining the $H$-$T$ phase diagram for a type-II superconductor and computing the critical behaviors of the heat capacity, which are experimentally accessible, allowing the characterization of the cascade of different kinds of fluctuations in 2D superconductors.</description>
