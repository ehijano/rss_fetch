      <title>Differential metabolic and cellular brain regional susceptibility in adult rats with chronic liver disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background &amp; Aims: Patients with type C hepatic encephalopathy (HE) present diverse symptoms indicating that various brain regions are affected. Understanding the distinct metabolic and cellular changes across these regions could help explain the clinical variability of HE. We analyzed, for the first time, the longitudinal in-vivo neurometabolic and morphological changes in astrocytes, neurons and microglia in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum during the progression of CLD-induced type C HE in the bile duct ligated (BDL) rat model. Methods: Wistar rats underwent BDL and their brains were studied before BDL and at post-operative weeks-2, 4, 6 and 8 using in-vivo 1H-MRS (9.4T) of the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum along with histological assessment (astrocytes, microglia, and neurons) and blood biochemistry. Results: Across all brain regions, glutamine (Gln) was the first metabolite to increase, followed by a decrease in osmolytes and neurotransmitters. The cerebellum was characterized by the highest Gln burden (+134%), elevated Lactate (+84%) and decreased GABA (-23%), suggesting its increased vulnerability. This coincided with pronounced alterations in astrocyte morphology, possibly related to the high Gln load. In contrast, the striatum displayed the lowest Gln increase (+48%) but the strongest osmolyte decrease, with milder astrocytic changes. We also showed mutual and distinct regional morphological changes in microglia (activation) and neurons (decreased dendritic spine density, soma size alterations). Conclusions: Our findings highlight both common and differential metabolic and cellular responses to CLD across the brain regions, with cerebellum and striatum showing differential responses. We also hypothesized that glutamine is one of the initial brain metabolic markers of type C HE, impacting astrocytes and inevitably neurons contributing to cognitive decline.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-OCT simulation framework based on mathematical models of intratissue dynamics, image formation, and measurement noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) enables label-free functional imaging by capturing temporal OCT signal variations caused by intracellular and intratissue motions. However, the relationship between DOCT signals and the sample motion behind them remains unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive DOCT simulation framework that incorporates mathematical models of intracellular/intratissue motions, two OCT signal generator types that generate OCT signal time sequences from the moving scatterer models, and representative DOCT algorithms. The theory and algorithms of the framework are described in detail, and the utility of this framework is demonstrated through numerical studies. This framework is available as open source and will enhance the understanding and utility of DOCT.</description>

      <title>The Role of Computational Modeling in Enhancing Thermal Safety During Cardiac Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: In this review, we aim to provide an analysis of current cardiac ablation techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation (RF), cryoablation, and pulsed-field ablation (PFA), with a focus on the role of computational modeling in enhancing the precision, safety, and effectiveness of these treatments. Particular attention is given to thermal management, exploring how computational approaches contribute to understanding and controlling energy delivery, heat distribution, and tissue response during ablation procedures. Methods: The mechanisms, applications, and limitations of radiofrequency (RF) ablation, cryoablation, and pulsed field ablation (PFA) are reviewed. Additionally, the use of computational approaches, including numerical methods and artificial intelligence (AI)-based models, for evaluating energy distribution, lesion size, and tissue response during ablation procedures is discussed. Results: Computational methods can predict ablation treatment outcomes and help optimize lesion size, ablation parameters, and procedural safety. However, these models are only reliable when properly validated and verified. Conclusion: Further research is essential to collect reliable in vivo data for validating computational models and integrating them into clinical practice to improve patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Accurate, provable, and fast nonlinear tomographic reconstruction: A variational inequality approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of signal reconstruction for computed tomography (CT) under a nonlinear forward model that accounts for exponential signal attenuation, a polychromatic X-ray source, general measurement noise (e.g. Poisson shot noise), and observations acquired over multiple wavelength windows. We develop a simple iterative algorithm for single-material reconstruction, which we call EXACT (EXtragradient Algorithm for Computed Tomography), based on formulating our estimate as the fixed point of a monotone variational inequality. We prove guarantees on the statistical and computational performance of EXACT under practical assumptions on the measurement process. We also consider a recently introduced variant of this model with Gaussian measurements, and present sample and iteration complexity bounds for EXACT that improve upon those of existing algorithms. We apply our EXACT algorithm to a CT phantom image recovery task and show that it often requires fewer X-ray projection exposures, lower source intensity, and less computation time to achieve similar reconstruction quality to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning: A new frontier in the exploration of multi-institutional medical imaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has transformed the perspective of medical imaging, leading to a genuine technological revolution in modern computer-assisted healthcare systems. However, ubiquitously featured deep learning (DL) systems require access to a considerable amount of data, facilitating proper knowledge extraction and generalization. Admission to such extensive resources may be hindered due to the time and effort required to convey ethical agreements, set up and carry the acquisition procedures through, and manage the datasets adequately with a particular emphasis on proper anonymization. One of the pivotal challenges in the DL field is data integration from various sources acquired using different hardware vendors, diverse acquisition protocols, experimental setups, and even inter-operator variabilities. In this paper, we review the federated learning (FL) concept that fosters the integration of large-scale heterogeneous datasets from multiple institutions in training DL models. In contrast to a centralized approach, the decentralized FL procedure promotes training DL models while preserving data privacy at each institution involved. We formulate the FL principle and comprehensively review general and dedicated medical imaging aggregation and learning algorithms, enabling the generation of a globally generalized model. We meticulously go through the challenges in constructing FL-based systems, such as data heterogeneity across the institutions, resilience to potential attacks on data privacy, and the variability in computational and communication resources among the entangled sites that might induce efficiency issues of the entire system. Finally, we explore the up-to-date open frameworks for rapid FL-based algorithm prototyping and shed light on future directions in this intensively growing field.</description>

      <title>Neural-network based high-speed volumetric dynamic optical coherence tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wedemonstratedeep-learningneuralnetwork(NN)-baseddynamicopticalcoherence tomography (DOCT), which generates high-quality logarithmic-intensity-variance (LIV) DOCT images from only four OCT frames. The NN model is trained for tumor spheroid samples using a customized loss function: the weighted mean absolute error. This loss function enables highly accurate LIV image generation. The fidelity of the generated LIV images to the ground truth LIV images generated using 32 OCT frames is examined via subjective image observation and statistical analysis of image-based metrics. Fast volumetric DOCT imaging with an acquisition time of 6.55 s/volume is demonstrated using this NN-based method.</description>

      <title>Cutting Voxel Projector a New Approach to Construct 3D Cone Beam CT Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of projectors for 3D cone beam tomographic reconstruction. Analytical formulas are derived to compute the relationship between the volume of a voxel projected onto a detector pixel and its contribution to the line integral of attenuation recorded by that pixel. Based on these formulas, we construct a near-exact projector and backprojector, particularly suited for algebraic reconstruction techniques and hierarchical reconstruction approaches with nonuniform voxel grids. Unlike traditional projectors, which assume a uniform grid with fixed voxel sizes, our method enables local refinement of voxels, allowing for adaptive grid resolution and improved reconstruction quality in regions of interest. We have implemented this cutting voxel projector along with a relaxed, speed-optimized version and compared them to two established projectors: a ray-tracing projector based on Siddon's algorithm and a TT footprint projector. Our results demonstrate that the cutting voxel projector achieves higher accuracy than the TT projector, especially for large cone beam angles. Furthermore, the relaxed version of the cutting voxel projector offers a significant speed advantage, while maintaining comparable accuracy. In contrast, Siddon's algorithm, tuned to achieve the same accuracy, is considerably slower than the cutting voxel projector. All algorithms are implemented in a GPU optimized open-source framework for algebraic reconstruction. GitHub repository of the project https://github.com/kulvait/KCT_cbct.</description>

      <title>Dynamic optical coherence tomography algorithm for label-free assessment of swiftness and occupancy of intratissue moving scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) statistically analyzes fluctuations in time-sequential OCT signals, enabling label-free and three-dimensional visualization of intratissue and intracellular activities. Current DOCT methods, such as logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) and OCT correlation decay speed (OCDS) have several limitations.Namely, the DOCT values and intratissue motions are not directly related, and hence DOCT values are not interpretable in the context of the tissue motility. We introduce a new DOCT algorithm that provides more direct interpretation of DOCT in the contexts of dynamic scatterer ratio and scatterer speed in the tissue.The detailed properties of the new and conventional DOCT methods are investigated by numerical simulations, and the experimental validation with in vitro and ex vivo samples demonstrates the feasibility of the new method.</description>
