      <title>A review of topological data analysis and topological deep learning in molecular sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a powerful framework for extracting robust, multiscale, and interpretable features from complex molecular data for artificial intelligence (AI) modeling and topological deep learning (TDL). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the development, methodologies, and applications of TDA in molecular sciences. We trace the evolution of TDA from early qualitative tools to advanced quantitative and predictive models, highlighting innovations such as persistent homology, persistent Laplacians, and topological machine learning. The paper explores TDA's transformative impact across diverse domains, including biomolecular stability, protein-ligand interactions, drug discovery, materials science, and viral evolution. Special attention is given to recent advances in integrating TDA with machine learning and AI, enabling breakthroughs in protein engineering, solubility and toxicity prediction, and the discovery of novel materials and therapeutics. We also discuss the limitations of current TDA approaches and outline future directions, including the integration of TDA with advanced AI models and the development of new topological invariants. This review aims to serve as a foundational reference for researchers seeking to harness the power of topology in molecular science.</description>

      <title>AI-based Methods for Simulating, Sampling, and Predicting Protein Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in deep learning have opened an era of abundant and accurate predicted protein structures; however, similar progress in protein ensembles has remained elusive. This review highlights several recent research directions towards AI-based predictions of protein ensembles, including coarse-grained force fields, generative models, multiple sequence alignment perturbation methods, and modeling of ensemble descriptors. An emphasis is placed on realistic assessments of the technological maturity of current methods, the strengths and weaknesses of broad families of techniques, and promising machine learning frameworks at an early stage of development. We advocate for "closing the loop" between model training, simulation, and inference to overcome challenges in training data availability and to enable the next generation of models.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Nitric Oxide in Trigeminal Neuralgia Rats with a Cerium Single-Atom Nanozyme Electrochemical Biosensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is the most common neuropathic disorder; however, its pathogenesis remains unclear. A prevailing theory suggests that nitric oxide (NO) may induce nerve compression and irritation via vascular dilation, thereby being responsible for the condition, making real-time detection of generated NO critical. However, traditional evaluations of NO rely on indirect colorimetric or chemiluminescence techniques, which offer limited sensitivity and spatial resolution for its real-time assessment in biological environments. Herein, we reported the development of a highly sensitive NO electrochemical biosensor based cerium single-atom nanozyme (Ce1-CN) with ultrawide linear range from 1.08 nM to 143.9 {\mu}M, and ultralow detection limit of 0.36 nM, which enables efficient and real-time evaluation of NO in TN rats. In-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed the high-performance biosensing mechanism, whereby the Ce centers in Ce1-CN nanoenzymes adsorb NO and subsequently react with OH- to form *HNO2. Results demonstrated that NO concentration was associated with TN onset. Following carbamazepine treatment, NO production from nerves decreased, accompanied by an alleviation of pain. These findings indicate that the biosensor serves as a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis of TN and guiding subsequent therapeutic strategies.</description>
