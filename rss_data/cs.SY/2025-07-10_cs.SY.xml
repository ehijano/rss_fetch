      <title>Revisiting Chien-Hrones-Reswick Method for an Analytical Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06352v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an analytical method for tuning PI controllers in First-Order with Time Delay (FOTD) systems, leveraging the Lambert W function. The Lambert W function enables exact pole placement, yielding analytical expressions for PI gains. The proposed approach identifies a critical condition that achieves a step response without overshoot with minimum settling time, while also providing explicit tuning rules for systems where controlled overshoot is specified. The method demonstrates strong agreement with established empirical Chien-Hrones-Reswick tuning rules for both non-overshooting and overshooting cases, bridging the gap between theoretical analysis and empirical results.</description>

      <title>Forex Trading Robot Using Fuzzy Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a fuzzy system for conducting short-term transactions in the forex market. The system is designed to enhance common strategies in the forex market using fuzzy logic, thereby improving the accuracy of transactions. Traditionally, technical strategies based on oscillator indicators have relied on predefined ranges for indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Commodity Channel Indicator (CCI), and Stochastic to determine entry points for trades. However, the use of these classic indicators has yielded suboptimal results due to the changing nature of the market over time. In our proposed approach, instead of employing classical indicators, we introduce a fuzzy Mamdani system for each indicator. The results obtained from these systems are then combined through voting to design a trading robot. Our findings demonstrate a considerable increase in the profitability factor compared to three other methods. Additionally, net profit, gross profit, and maximum capital reduction are calculated and compared across all approaches.</description>

      <title>How Complex is a Complex Network? Insights from Linear Systems Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper leverages linear systems theory to propose a principled measure of complexity for network systems. We focus on a network of first-order scalar linear systems interconnected through a directed graph. By locally filtering out the effect of nodal dynamics in the interconnected system, we propose a new quantitative index of network complexity rooted in the notion of McMillan degree of a linear system. First, we show that network systems with the same interconnection structure share the same complexity index for almost all choices of their interconnection weights. Then, we investigate the dependence of the proposed index on the topology of the network and the pattern of heterogeneity of the nodal dynamics. Specifically, we find that the index depends on the matching number of subgraphs identified by nodal dynamics of different nature, highlighting the joint impact of network architecture and component diversity on overall system complexity.</description>

      <title>VoI-aware Scheduling Schemes for Multi-Agent Formation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formation control allows agents to maintain geometric patterns using local information, but most existing methods assume ideal communication. This paper introduces a goal-oriented framework combining control, cooperative positioning, and communication scheduling for first-order formation tracking. Each agent estimates its position using 6G network-based triangulation, and the scheduling of information updates is governed by Age of Information (AoI) and Value of Information (VoI) metrics. We design three lightweight, signaling-free scheduling policies and assess their impact on formation quality. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maintaining accurate formations with no additional communication overhead, showing that worst-case formation adherence increases by 20%.</description>

      <title>An AI-Driven Thermal-Fluid Testbed for Advanced Small Modular Reactors: Integration of Digital Twin and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a multipurpose artificial intelligence (AI)-driven thermal-fluid testbed designed to advance Small Modular Reactor technologies by seamlessly integrating physical experimentation with advanced computational intelligence. The platform uniquely combines a versatile three-loop thermal-fluid facility with a high-fidelity digital twin and sophisticated AI frameworks for real-time prediction, control, and operational assistance. Methodologically, the testbed's digital twin, built upon the System Analysis Module code, is coupled with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. This machine learning model, trained on experimental data, enables faster-than-real-time simulation, providing predictive insights into the system's dynamic behavior. The practical application of this AI integration is showcased through case studies. An AI-driven control framework where the GRU model accurately forecasts future system states and the corresponding control actions required to meet operational demands. Furthermore, an intelligent assistant, powered by a large language model, translates complex sensor data and simulation outputs into natural language, offering operators actionable analysis and safety recommendations. Comprehensive validation against experimental transients confirms the platform's high fidelity, with the GRU model achieving a temperature prediction root mean square error of 1.42 K. This work establishes an integrated research environment at the intersection of AI and thermal-fluid science, showcasing how AI-driven methodologies in modeling, control, and operator support can accelerate the innovation and deployment of next-generation nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Voltage Regulation in Distribution Systems with Data Center Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent boom in foundation models and AI computing have raised growing concerns on the power and energy trajectories of large-scale data centers. This paper focuses on the voltage issues caused by volatile and intensity of data center power demand, which also aligns with recent observations of more frequent voltage disturbances in power grids. To address these data center integration challenges, we propose a dynamic voltage control scheme by harnessing data center's load regulation capabilities. By taking local voltage measurements and adjusting power injections at each data center buses through the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) scheme, we are able to maintain safe voltage magnitude in a distributed fashion with higher data center computing load. Simulations using real large language model (LLM) inference load validate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism. Both the LLM power data and proposed control scheme are open sourced.</description>

      <title>Experience-Centric Resource Management in ISAC Networks: A Digital Agent-Assisted Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a digital agent (DA)-assisted resource management scheme for enhanced user quality of experience (QoE) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. Particularly, user QoE is a comprehensive metric that integrates quality of service (QoS), user behavioral dynamics, and environmental complexity. The novel DA module includes a user status prediction model, a QoS factor selection model, and a QoE fitting model, which analyzes historical user status data to construct and update user-specific QoE models. Users are clustered into different groups based on their QoE models. A Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) model is utilized to quantify the impact of allocated communication resources on sensing accuracy. A joint optimization problem of communication and computing resource management is formulated to maximize long-term user QoE while satisfying CRB and resource constraints. A two-layer data-model-driven algorithm is developed to solve the formulated problem, where the top layer utilizes an advanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm to make group-level decisions, and the bottom layer uses convex optimization techniques to make user-level decisions. Simulation results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DA-assisted resource management scheme outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of user QoE.</description>

      <title>VisioPath: Vision-Language Enhanced Model Predictive Control for Safe Autonomous Navigation in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce VisioPath, a novel framework combining vision-language models (VLMs) with model predictive control (MPC) to enable safe autonomous driving in dynamic traffic environments. The proposed approach leverages a bird's-eye view video processing pipeline and zero-shot VLM capabilities to obtain structured information about surrounding vehicles, including their positions, dimensions, and velocities. Using this rich perception output, we construct elliptical collision-avoidance potential fields around other traffic participants, which are seamlessly integrated into a finite-horizon optimal control problem for trajectory planning. The resulting trajectory optimization is solved via differential dynamic programming with an adaptive regularization scheme and is embedded in an event-triggered MPC loop. To ensure collision-free motion, a safety verification layer is incorporated in the framework that provides an assessment of potential unsafe trajectories. Extensive simulations in Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) demonstrate that VisioPath outperforms conventional MPC baselines across multiple metrics. By combining modern AI-driven perception with the rigorous foundation of optimal control, VisioPath represents a significant step forward in safe trajectory planning for complex traffic systems.</description>

      <title>On Regular Regressors in Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a shortcoming in adaptive control, that the property of a regressor being persistently exciting (PE) is not well-behaved. One can construct regressors that upend the commonsense notion that excitation should not be created out of nothing. To amend the situation, a notion of regularity of regressors is needed. We are naturally led to a broad class of regular regressors that enjoy the property that their excitation is always confined to a subspace, a foundational result called the PE decomposition. A geometric characterization of regressor excitation opens up new avenues for adaptive control, as we demonstrate by formulating a number of new adaptive control problems.</description>

      <title>Dual State-space Fidelity Blade (D-STAB): A Novel Stealthy Cyber-physical Attack Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel cyber-physical attack paradigm, termed the Dual State-Space Fidelity Blade (D-STAB), which targets the firmware of core cyber-physical components as a new class of attack surfaces. The D-STAB attack exploits the information asymmetry caused by the fidelity gap between high-fidelity and low-fidelity physical models in cyber-physical systems. By designing precise adversarial constraints based on high-fidelity state-space information, the attack induces deviations in high-fidelity states that remain undetected by defenders relying on low-fidelity observations. The effectiveness of D-STAB is demonstrated through a case study in cyber-physical battery systems, specifically in an optimal charging task governed by a Battery Management System (BMS).</description>

      <title>Effects of Net Metering Policies on Distributed Energy Resource Valuation and Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Net energy metering has been a successful policy for increasing solar generation installations and reducing the costs of photovoltaic arrays for consumers. However, increased maturity of solar technologies and concerns over cost shifts created by net energy metering have recently caused the policy to change its incentives. What once favored behind-the-meter solar generation now is focused on compensating flexible operation. This paper explores the impacts that different net energy metering policies have on commercial consumers with various distributed energy resources. We show that the newest iteration of net energy metering is less beneficial for consumers with only solar generation and instead favors those that pair energy storage with solar. Though shiftable flexible demand offers consumers the ability to operate flexibly, the export prices offered by the latest net energy metering policy provide limited value to flexible demand.</description>

      <title>The Small Phase Condition is Necessary for Symmetric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the small phase condition is both sufficient and necessary to ensure the feedback stability when the interconnected systems are symmetric. Such symmetric systems arise in diverse applications. The key lies in that, for a complex symmetric and semi-sectorial matrix, the transformation matrix in its generalized sectorial decomposition can be taken to be real. Such a result fills the gap of phase based necessary condition for the feedback stability of symmetric systems, and serves as a counterpart of the necessity result for small gain condition. Moreover, we explore the necessity of small phase condition for general asymmetric systems. Some insightful results are presented, which help to clarify the main challenge in the general case.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Fast Frequency Regulation in Dynamic Virtual Power Plants via Disturbance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs), the integration of frequency containment reserve (FCR) and fast frequency control (FFC) enabled via local compensation of power imbalance represents a significant advancement in decentralized frequency regulation. However, they still have to cope with the limited power and energy capacities associated with commonly available storage solutions. This work combines a disturbance estimation based decentralized local control with distributed imbalance compensation in the event of local shortfall. The layered architecture facilitates fast local corrections in power setpoints while enabling coordination between neighbouring DVPP nodes to leverage the aggregated capacity, ensuring scalable and efficient operation suitable for renewable-heavy future grids. The proposed approach is validated on an illustrative 4-bus system with a high percentage of renewables.</description>

      <title>Techno-economic analysis of decarbonized backup power systems using scenario-based stochastic optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of growing concerns about power disruptions, grid reliability and the need for decarbonization, this study evaluates a broad range of clean backup power systems (BPSs) to replace traditional emergency diesel generators. A scenario-based stochastic optimization framework using actual load profiles and outage probabilities is proposed to assess the most promising options from a pool of 27 technologies. This framework allows a comparison of cost-effectiveness and environmental impact of individual technologies and hybrid BPSs across various scenarios. The results highlight the trade-off between total annual system cost and emissions. Significant emission reductions can be achieved at moderate cost increases but deep decarbonization levels incur higher costs. Primary and secondary batteries are included in optimal clean fuel-based systems across all decarbonization levels, combining cost-effective power delivery and long-term storage benefits. The findings highlight the often-overlooked importance of fuel replacement on both emissions and costs. Among the assessed technologies, ammonia generators and hydrogen fuel cells combined with secondary iron-air batteries emerge as cost-effective solutions for achieving decarbonization goals. To ensure a broad range of applicability, the study outlines the impact of emergency fuel purchases, varying demand patterns and demand response options on the optimal BPS. The research findings are valuable for optimizing the design of clean BPSs to economically meet the needs of many facility types and decarbonization targets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating external heat into electrolysers can reduce the electrical power demand for carbon-neutral hydrogen production. Efficient operation requires detailed models that incorporate heat availability and its effect on startup costs. This paper advances existing operational models by endogenously modelling startup costs and direct heat integration, based on a piecewise linear approximation of the electrochemical equations. We analyse the impact of low- and high-temperature heat integration on the efficiency and profitability of hydrogen production for solid oxide and proton exchange membrane electrolysis technologies.</description>

      <title>A Single-Point Measurement Framework for Robust Cyber-Attack Diagnosis in Smart Microgrids Using Dual Fractional-Order Feature Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-attacks jeopardize the safe operation of smart microgrids. At the same time, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point instrumentation or stringent modelling assumptions that are untenable under single-sensor constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order Memory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves low-latency fault localisation and cyber-attack detection using only one VPQ (Voltage-Power-Reactive-power) sensor. FO-MADS first constructs a dual fractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and Gr\"unwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and slow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then pinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch, effectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened through Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose attack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) to prioritise the most challenging samples. Experiments on a four-inverter microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under four attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6 % (bias), 94.0 % (noise), 92.8 % (data replacement), and 95.7 % (replay), while sustaining 96.7 % under attack-free conditions. These results establish FO-MADS as a cost-effective and readily deployable solution that markedly enhances the cyber-physical resilience of smart microgrids.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear dead-time compensation method for path tracking control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of autonomous vehicle technologies and advanced driver assistance systems, precise and reliable path tracking controllers are vital for safe and efficient navigation. However the presence of dead time in the vehicle control systems poses a challenge to real-world systems. Input and output delays are caused by factors like sensor processing and mechanical response and can range up to a few hundred milliseconds. This chapter addresses the problem of dead time in path tracking control and proposes a method to compensate the dead time. The proposed solution involves a nonlinear prediction model, in a structure similar to the Smith predictor, but incorporating the kinematic behavior of the vehicle plant system. The implementation avoids numeric integration or optimization, enabling a fast execution. Simulation tests with various controllers and disturbances, including dead-time uncertainty, demonstrate the efficacy of the dead-time compensation method. Results indicate improved control performance in all tested scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is a promising solution to meet the growing demands of 5G and future 6G networks by enabling direct communication between user devices. It enhances spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), reduces latency, and supports proximity-based services. As wireless systems evolve toward 5G and 6G paradigms, the integration of D2D with advanced cellular technologies introduces new opportunities and challenges. This survey paper reviews the architectural foundations of D2D communication and explores its integration with key 5G/6G enabling technologies. We review standardization efforts, analyze core challenges, and highlight future research directions to unlock the full potential of D2D in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning Controller for Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established intervention for Parkinson's disease (PD), but conventional open-loop systems lack adaptability, are energy-inefficient due to continuous stimulation, and provide limited personalization to individual neural dynamics. Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a closed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to dynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample complexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited deployability on resource-constrained hardware.
  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses the core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a predictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs Gumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in binary action spaces. Together, these components improve sample efficiency, exploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained neuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic simulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster convergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and resilience to post-training FP16 quantization. Our results show that SEA-DBS offers a practical and effective RL-based aDBS framework for real-time, resource-constrained neuromodulation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Robots Like Human Infants: A Case Study of Learned Bipedal Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typically, learned robot controllers are trained via relatively unsystematic regimens and evaluated with coarse-grained outcome measures such as average cumulative reward. The typical approach is useful to compare learning algorithms but provides limited insight into the effects of different training regimens and little understanding about the richness and complexity of learned behaviors. Likewise, human infants and other animals are "trained" via unsystematic regimens, but in contrast, developmental psychologists evaluate their performance in highly-controlled experiments with fine-grained measures such as success, speed of walking, and prospective adjustments. However, the study of learned behavior in human infants is limited by the practical constraints of training and testing babies. Here, we present a case study that applies methods from developmental psychology to study the learned behavior of the simulated bipedal robot Cassie. Following research on infant walking, we systematically designed reinforcement learning training regimens and tested the resulting controllers in simulated environments analogous to those used for babies--but without the practical constraints. Results reveal new insights into the behavioral impact of different training regimens and the development of Cassie's learned behaviors relative to infants who are learning to walk. This interdisciplinary baby-robot approach provides inspiration for future research designed to systematically test effects of training on the development of complex learned robot behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automotive safety and security are paramount in the rapidly advancing landscape of vehicular technology. Building safe and secure vehicles demands a profound understanding of automotive systems, particularly in safety and security. Traditional learning approaches, such as reading materials or observing demonstrations, often fail to provide the practical, hands-on experience essential for developing this expertise. For novice users, gaining access to automotive-grade systems and mastering their associated hardware and software can be challenging and overwhelming. In this paper, we present a novel, affordable, and flexible exploration platform, \hema, that enables users to gain practical, hands-on insights into the security compromises of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, a critical component in modern ADAS systems. Furthermore, we discuss the unique challenges and design considerations involved in creating such a platform, emphasizing its role in enhancing the understanding of automotive safety and security. This framework serves as an invaluable resource for educators, researchers, and practitioners striving to build expertise in the field.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization of Finite Condition Number for Laplacian Matrix in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the distributed optimization of the finite condition number of the Laplacian matrix in multi-agent systems. The finite condition number, defined as the ratio of the largest to the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, plays an important role in determining the convergence rate and performance of consensus algorithms, especially in discrete-time implementations. We propose a fully distributed algorithm by regulating the node weights. The approach leverages max consensus, distributed power iteration, and consensus-based normalization for eigenvalue and eigenvector estimation, requiring only local communication and computation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to centralized LMI-based optimization, significantly improving consensus speed and multi-agent system performance. The framework can be extended to edge weight optimization and the scenarios with non-simple eigenvalues, highlighting its scalability and practical applicability for large-scale networked systems.</description>

      <title>Transferable Parasitic Estimation via Graph Contrastive Learning and Label Rebalancing in AMS Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (MSE) and softmax cross-entropy (bsmCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification. Our code is available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CircuitGCL-099B/README.md}{here}.</description>

      <title>Few-shot Learning on AMS Circuits and Its Application to Parasitic Capacitance Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning is a powerful method to extract features from graph-structured data, such as analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. However, training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph. Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer. Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph. CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning. Furthermore, the ablation studies provide valuable insights into graph models for representation learning.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning-Based Pre-Layout Parasitic Capacitance Prediction on SRAM Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To achieve higher system energy efficiency, SRAM in SoCs is often customized. The parasitic effects cause notable discrepancies between pre-layout and post-layout circuit simulations, leading to difficulty in converging design parameters and excessive design iterations. Is it possible to well predict the parasitics based on the pre-layout circuit, so as to perform parasitic-aware pre-layout simulation? In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based 2-stage model to accurately predict these parasitics in pre-layout stages. The model combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressors, effectively managing class imbalance of the net parasitics in SRAM circuits. We also employ Focal Loss to mitigate the impact of abundant internal net samples and integrate subcircuit information into the graph to abstract the hierarchical structure of schematics. Experiments on 4 real SRAM designs show that our approach not only surpasses the state-of-the-art model in parasitic prediction by a maximum of 19X reduction of error but also significantly boosts the simulation process by up to 598X speedup.</description>

      <title>SkyVLN: Vision-and-Language Navigation and NMPC Control for UAVs in Urban Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as versatile tools across various sectors, driven by their mobility and adaptability. This paper introduces SkyVLN, a novel framework integrating vision-and-language navigation (VLN) with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to enhance UAV autonomy in complex urban environments. Unlike traditional navigation methods, SkyVLN leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language instructions and visual observations, enabling UAVs to navigate through dynamic 3D spaces with improved accuracy and robustness. We present a multimodal navigation agent equipped with a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history path memory mechanism. These components allow the UAV to disambiguate spatial contexts, handle ambiguous instructions, and backtrack when necessary. The framework also incorporates an NMPC module for dynamic obstacle avoidance, ensuring precise trajectory tracking and collision prevention. To validate our approach, we developed a high-fidelity 3D urban simulation environment using AirSim, featuring realistic imagery and dynamic urban elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkyVLN significantly improves navigation success rates and efficiency, particularly in new and unseen environments.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Short-term State Forecasting in Power Systems across Domains and Time Scales: A Hydroelectric Power Plant Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate short-term state forecasting is essential for efficient and stable operation of modern power systems, especially in the context of increasing variability introduced by renewable and distributed energy resources. As these systems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict their states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control decisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior. Modern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges for modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state forecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor networks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate information across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are designed under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are typically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts their ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly encountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy conversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both homogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among sensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical - which exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional baselines on average by 35.5% in terms of normalized root mean square error, confirming its effectiveness in multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous analytical model of traffic dynamics on a circular track, demonstrating the emergence of standing oscillations resulting from microscopic driver behaviour, delay responses, and proximity pressure. Without relying on simulation, we derive a series of coupled delay differential equations to model vehicular interactions. By introducing a mnemonic-based symbolic system, we establish a mathematical framework incorporating stochastic initial conditions, non-uniform reaction times, and cognitive lag. A full linear stability analysis is conducted using Fourier decomposition and modal perturbation techniques. Our results identify critical thresholds for harmonic induction, delineate the bounds of safe following distances, and reveal hysteresis in driver overcorrection. The analysis concludes with implications for autonomous vehicle control and potential suppression strategies for oscillatory instability. All derivations are purely symbolic and analytically proven.</description>

      <title>Distributed Fault-Tolerant Multi-Robot Cooperative Localization in Adversarial Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-robot systems (MRS), cooperative localization is a crucial task for enhancing system robustness and scalability, especially in GPS-denied or communication-limited environments. However, adversarial attacks, such as sensor manipulation, and communication jamming, pose significant challenges to the performance of traditional localization methods. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed fault-tolerant cooperative localization framework to enhance resilience against sensor and communication disruptions in adversarial environments. We introduce an adaptive event-triggered communication strategy that dynamically adjusts communication thresholds based on real-time sensing and communication quality. This strategy ensures optimal performance even in the presence of sensor degradation or communication failure. Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the convergence and stability properties of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its resilience against bounded adversarial zones and maintaining accurate state estimation. Robotarium-based experiment results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of localization accuracy and communication efficiency, particularly in adversarial settings. Our approach offers improved scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance for MRS, making it suitable for large-scale deployments in real-world, challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Stream Function-Based Navigation for Complex Quadcopter Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel stream function-based navigational control system for obstacle avoidance, where obstacles are represented as two-dimensional (2D) rigid surfaces in inviscid, incompressible flows. The approach leverages the vortex panel method (VPM) and incorporates safety margins to control the stream function and flow properties around virtual surfaces, enabling navigation in complex, partially observed environments using real-time sensing. To address the limitations of the VPM in managing relative distance and avoiding rapidly accelerating obstacles at close proximity, the system integrates a model predictive controller (MPC) based on higher-order control barrier functions (HOCBF). This integration incorporates VPM trajectory generation, state estimation, and constraint handling into a receding-horizon optimization problem. The 2D rigid surfaces are enclosed using minimum bounding ellipses (MBEs), while an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) captures and predicts obstacle dynamics, propagating these estimates into the MPC-HOCBF for rapid avoidance maneuvers. Evaluation is conducted using a PX4-powered Clover drone Gazebo simulator and real-time experiments involving a COEX Clover quadcopter equipped with a 360 degree LiDAR sensor.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Output-Feedback Controller Synthesis for Dissipativity from Noisy Input-State Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a dynamic output-feedback controller synthesis method for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. The synthesis goal is to render closed-loop system dissipative with respect to a given generic unstructured quadratic supply rate, while the system dynamics is partially represented by input-state data corrupted by a bounded disturbance. The controller synthesis is performed with respect to all systems which are consistent with the available data, and it is formulated in terms of a linear matrix inequality parametrized by a scalar variable, so that the synthesis can be performed using line search and convex optimization. Within the considered setting, the proposed synthesis procedure is non-conservative in a sense that it is based on conditions which are both necessary and sufficient.</description>

      <title>Formalization of the AADL Run-Time Services with Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Architecture Analysis &amp; Design Language (AADL) is an architecture description language for design of cyber-physical systems--machines controlled by software. The AADL standard, SAE International AS5506D, describes Run-Time Services (RTS) to be provided to execute AADL models in accordance with semantics defined by the standard. The RTS of primary concern are transport services and timing services. Although, the study presented in [1] sets a foundation for the formal semantics of AADL, but without modeling time. This paper extends and simplifies this formalization using a modal logic defined by a Kripke structure, to explicitly include time. The RTS defined in the AADL standard are also expanded to support reactive state-transition machines of the Behavior Specification annex standard language (BA) and its closely-related, formally-defined counterpart, the Behavior Language for Embedded Systems with Software (BLESS). An example of AADL RTS with time, implemented by the High Assurance Modeling and Rapid Engineering for Embedded Systems (HAMR) for state-transition machine behavior written in BLESS, is also presented.</description>

      <title>Manifolds in Power Systems Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manifold optimization (MO) is a powerful mathematical framework that can be applied to solving complex optimization problems with objective functions (OFs) and constraints on complex geometric structures, which is particularly useful in advanced power systems. We explore the application of MO techniques, which offer a robust framework for solving complex, non-convex optimization problems in electrical power distribution systems (EPDS) and electrical power transmission systems (EPTS), particularly for power flow analysis. This paper introduces the principles of MO and demonstrates its advantages over conventional methods by applying it to power flow optimization. For EPDS, a cost function derived from a backward-forward sweep (BFS) algorithm is optimized using the Manopt toolbox, yielding high accuracy and competitive computational times on 14-bus, 33-bus, and 69-bus systems when compared to established solvers. Similarly, for EPTS, MO applied via Manopt to 3-bus and 4-bus systems effectively solves power flow equations, matching traditional methods such as Newton-Raphson in performance. The study highlights that tools such as Manopt can mitigate implementation complexities, positioning MO as an efficient and accessible tool for power system analysis and potentially broader planning applications. The paper provides a comprehensive tutorial on MO, detailing its theoretical foundations, practical methodologies, and specific applications in power systems, particularly in power flow optimization.</description>

      <title>The Singular Angle of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.01629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an angle notion called the singular angle for nonlinear systems from an input-output perspective. The proposed system singular angle, based on the angle between $L_2$-signals, describes an upper bound for the ''rotating effect'' from system input to output signals. It quantifies passivity and serves as a counterpart to system $L_2$-gain. It also provides an alternative to a recently defined notion of system phase which adopts complexification of real-valued signals via the Hilbert transform. A nonlinear small angle theorem is established for feedback stability analysis, which involves a comparison of the loop system angle with $\pi$. The theorem generalizes the classical passivity theorem via a tradeoff between the singular angles of open-loop systems.</description>

      <title>Path-following model predictive control for autonomous e-scooters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to mitigate economical, ecological, and societal challenges in electric scooter (e-scooter) sharing systems, we develop an autonomous e-scooter prototype. Our vision is to design a fully autonomous prototype that can find its way to the next parking spot, high-demand area, or charging station. In this work, we propose a path-following model predictive control solution to enable localization and navigation in an urban environment with a provided path to follow. We design a closed-loop architecture that solves the localization and path following problem while allowing the e-scooter to maintain its balance with a previously developed reaction wheel mechanism. Our model predictive control approach facilitates state and input constraints, e.g., adhering to the path width, while remaining executable on a Raspberry Pi 5. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a real-world experiment on our prototype.</description>

      <title>Robust Longitudinal-lateral Look-ahead Pursuit Path-Following Control: Fast Finite-Time Stability Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of robust path-following for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex environments with bounded external disturbances and non-smooth predefined paths. Due to the unique aerodynamic characteristics and flight constraints of fixed-wing UAVs, achieving accurate and fast stable path following remains difficult, especially in low-altitude mountainous terrains, urban landscapes, and under wind disturbances. Most existing path-following guidance laws often struggle to ensure fast stabilization under unknown bounded disturbances while maintaining sufficient robustness, and there is a lack of research on optimizing robustness for non-smooth paths under flight constraints. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a constraints-based robust path-following controller. Firstly, from the perspective of global random attractor, we innovatively introduce robustness metrics that quantify both the exponential convergence rate and the range of the ultimate attractor set. Secondly, building on these metrics, we develop a robust longitudinal-lateral look-ahead pursuit (RLLP) guidance law for fixed-wing UAVs, specifically considering the flight path angle and track angle under external disturbances. Thirdly, we also derive an optimized version (Optimal-RLLP) to enhance the robustness metrics, and elaborate on the sufficient conditions for fast finite-time stability, ensuring the guidance law achieves finite-time stability and robustness with reduced sensitivity to constrained uncertainties. The simulation results validate the proposed guidance law's feasibility, optimality and robustness under atmospheric disturbances using a high-fidelity simulation platform and provide key principle for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>QoS-aware State-Augmented Learnable Algorithm for Wireless Coexistence Parameter Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and fair coexistence in unlicensed spectrum is essential to support heterogeneous networks such as 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi, which often contend for shared wireless resources. We introduce a general framework for wireless Coexistence Parameter Management (CPM) based on state-augmented constrained reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm, QaSAL-CPM, which incorporates state-augmentation by embedding the dual variables in the constrained optimization formulation directly into the agent's observation space. This method enables the agent to respond to constraint violations in real time while continuing to optimize a primary performance objective. Through extensive simulations of 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence scenarios, we show that QaSAL-CPM achieves reliable QoS compliance and improved policy robustness across various transmitter densities compared to previous approaches. The proposed framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution for real-time coexistence optimization in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Promoting Dynamic Mode Decomposition Applied to Sea Surface Temperature Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we leverage Koopman mode decomposition to analyze the nonlinear and high-dimensional climate systems acting on the observed data space. The dynamics of atmospheric systems are assumed to be equation-free, with the linear evolution of observables derived from measured historical long-term time-series data snapshots, such as monthly sea surface temperature records, to construct a purely data-driven climate dynamics. In particular, sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition is exploited to extract the dominant spatial and temporal modes, which are among the most significant coherent structures underlying climate variability, enabling a more efficient, interpretable, and low-dimensional representation of the system dynamics. We hope that the combined use of Koopman modes and sparsity-promoting techniques will provide insights into the significant climate modes, enabling reduced-order modeling of the climate system and offering a potential framework for predicting and controlling weather and climate variability.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Optimization for Electricity Imbalance: Integrating Renewables and Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) with peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offers promising solutions for grid modernization by incentivizing prosumers to participate in mitigating peak demand. However, this integration also introduces operational uncertainties and computational challenges. This paper aims to address these challenges with a novel scalable and tractable distributionally robust joint chance-constrained (DRJCC) optimization framework that effectively facilitates P2P energy trading by enhancing flexibility provision from large-scale DER operations under uncertain supply and demand. Therefore, a practical framework is proposed to solve the core challenges of DRJCC by integrating three key components: (1) a Wasserstein ambiguity set that effectively quantifies uncertainty with sparse data, (2) a CVaR-based approximation of joint chance constraints to balance computational efficiency with risk control, and (3) a privacy-preserving ADMM algorithm that enables distributed implementation through decomposition. To discern patterns in the data that indicate collaboration potential and adjust ambiguity sets for improved efficiency, K-means clustering is applied to historical scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed framework reduces peak demand by approximately 28% and total community costs by around 31%, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing grid robustness, operational reliability, and economic optimization in renewable-based energy management.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Uncertainty for Safe Social Navigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly used in pedestrian-rich environments where safe navigation and appropriate human interaction are crucial. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables socially integrated robot behavior, challenges persist in novel or perturbed scenarios to indicate when and why the policy is uncertain. Unknown uncertainty in decision-making can lead to collisions or human discomfort and is one reason why safe and risk-aware navigation is still an open problem. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates aleatoric, epistemic, and predictive uncertainty estimation into a DRL navigation framework for policy distribution uncertainty estimates. We, therefore, incorporate Observation-Dependent Variance (ODV) and dropout into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. For different types of perturbations, we compare the ability of deep ensembles and Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) to estimate the uncertainties of the policy. In uncertain decision-making situations, we propose to change the robot's social behavior to conservative collision avoidance. The results show improved training performance with ODV and dropout in PPO and reveal that the training scenario has an impact on the generalization. In addition, MC-dropout is more sensitive to perturbations and correlates the uncertainty type to the perturbation better. With the safe action selection, the robot can navigate in perturbed environments with fewer collisions.</description>
