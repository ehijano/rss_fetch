      <title>Optimal Dynamic Fees in Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are emerging as a popular decentralised trading platform. In this work, we determine the optimal dynamic fees in a constant function market maker. We find approximate closed-form solutions to the control problem and study the optimal fee structure. We find that there are two distinct fee regimes: one in which the AMM imposes higher fees to deter arbitrageurs, and another where fees are lowered to increase volatility and attract noise traders. Our results also show that dynamic fees that are linear in inventory and are sensitive to changes in the external price are a good approximation of the optimal fee structure and thus constitute suitable candidates when designing fees for AMMs.</description>

      <title>Non-Concave Utility Maximization with Transaction Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a finite-horizon portfolio selection problem with non-concave terminal utility and proportional transaction costs, in which the commonly used concavification principle for terminal value is no longer applicable. We establish a proper theoretical characterization of this problem via a two-step procedure. First, we examine the asymptotic terminal behavior of the value function, which implies that any transaction close to maturity only provides a marginal contribution to the utility. Second, we establish the theoretical foundation in terms of the discontinuous viscosity solution, incorporating the proper characterization of the terminal condition. Via extensive numerical analyses involving several types of utility functions, we find that the introduction of transaction costs into non-concave utility maximization problems can make it optimal for investors to hold on to a larger long position in the risky asset compared to the frictionless case, or hold on to a large short position in the risky asset despite a positive risk premium.</description>

      <title>Global Balance and Systemic Risk in Financial Correlation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global balance index is used in the network literature to quantify how balanced a signed network is. In this paper we show that the global balance index of financial correlation networks can be used as a systemic risk measure. We define the global balance index of a network starting from a diffusive process that describes how the information spreads across nodes in a network, providing an alternative derivation to the usual combinatorial one. The steady state of this process is the solution of a linear system governed by the exponential of the replication matrix of the process. We provide a bridge between the numerical stability of this linear system, measured by the condition number in an opportune norm, and the structural predictability of the underlying signed network. The link between the condition number and related systemic risk measures, such as the market rank indicators, allows the global balance index to be interpreted as a new systemic risk measure. A comprehensive empirical application to real financial data finally confirms that the global balance index of financial correlation networks represents a valuable and effective systemic risk indicator.</description>
