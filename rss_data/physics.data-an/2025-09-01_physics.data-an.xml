      <title>Computationally Tractable Offline Quantum Experimental Design for Nuclear Spin Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of nuclear spin environments in solid-state devices plays an important role in advancing quantum technologies, yet traditional methods often demand long measurement times. To address this challenge, we extend our recently developed deep-learning-based SALI model (Signal-to-image ArtificiaL Intelligence) by introducing the surrogate information gain (SIG) to optimize the selection of data points in the measurements. This approach significantly reduces time requirements in experiments while preserving accuracy in nuclear spin detection. The SIG is a figure of merit based on the expected variance of the signal, which is more straightforward to compute than the expected information gain rooted in Bayesian estimation. We demonstrate our approach on a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond coupled to $^{13}$C nuclei. In the high-field regime, our variance-based optimization is validated with experimental data, resulting in an 85$\%$ reduction in measurement time for a modest reduction in performance. This work also constitutes the first validation of SALI on experimental data. In the low-field regime, we explore its performance on simulated data, predicting a 60$\%$ reduction in the total experiment time by improving the temporal resolution of the measurements and applying SIG. This demonstrates the potential of integrating deep learning with optimized signal selection to enhance the efficiency of quantum sensing and nuclear spin characterization, paving the way for scaling these techniques to larger nuclear spin systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental measurement of quantum-first-passage-time distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical First-Passage-Time Distributions (FPTDs) have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. Their quantum counterparts, Quantum First-Passage-Time Distributions (QFPTDs), remain largely unexplored and have deep implications for both fundamental physics and the development of emerging quantum technologies. We measure the first QFPTDs using a motional mode of a single trapped ion. We develop a novel composite-phase laser pulse sequence to perform tunable stroboscopic projective measurements of the motional state of a trapped ion. We measure QFPTDs of the ion energy when coupled to electric-field noise and establish a clear connection with its classical counterpart. The measurement protocol developed here is broadly applicable to other quantum systems and provides a powerful method for exploring a broad range of QFPTD phenomena. With these results we open a new field of experimental investigations of QFPT processes with potential future relevance to quantum search algorithms, unraveling connections between classical and quantum dynamics, and study of the quantum measurement problem.</description>

      <title>AMBER: Algorithm for Multiplexing spectrometer Background Estimation with Rotation-independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the art neutron spectrometers enable simultaneous measurements of high-dimensional datasets, allowing for a large collection rate of dynamic material properties. In this paper, we present the Algorithm for Multiplexing spectrometer Background Estimation with Rotation-independence (AMBER), which is a segmentation algorithm designed to decompose measured neutron scattering data into model-agnostic foreground and background contributions. The method takes advantage of the fact that background and foreground signals are measured simultaneously during the data collection process, relying on rotational independence of background contributions. The algorithm, initially developed for multiplexing neutron spectrometers, aims to strongly reduce time consuming expert input, therefore promoting full data set usage while minimizing the source of systematic errors.</description>
