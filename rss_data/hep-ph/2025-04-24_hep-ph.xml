      <title>Phases of Dark Matter from Inverse Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse decays are an interesting avenue for producing dark matter in the early universe. We study in detail various phases of dark matter parameter space where inverse decays control its abundance, expanding on our work of INDY dark matter and going beyond. The role of initial conditions and the impact of departure from kinetic equilibrium are investigated as well. We show how these inverse decay phases can arise in theories of a kinetically mixed dark photon and dark Higgs, with promising prospects for detection at upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Baryon Number Violation: From Nuclear Matrix Elements to BSM Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processes that violate baryon number, most notably proton decay and $n\bar n$ transitions, are promising probes of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) needed to understand the lack of antimatter in the Universe. To interpret current and forthcoming experimental limits, theory input from nuclear matrix elements to UV complete models enters. Thus, an interplay of experiment, effective field theory, lattice QCD, and BSM model building is required to develop strategies to accurately extract information from current and future data and maximize the impact and sensitivity of next-generation experiments. Here, we briefly summarize the main results and discussions from the workshop "INT-25-91W: Baryon Number Violation: From Nuclear Matrix Elements to BSM Physics," held at the Institute for Nuclear Theory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, January 13-17, 2025.</description>

      <title>Stamps of state on structure: Probing the state of ultralight dark matter via its density fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) candidates with very small masses, and correspondingly large number densities, have gained significant interest in recent years. These DM candidates are typically said to behave "classically". More specifically, they are often assumed to reside in an ensemble of coherent states. One notable exception to this scenario is when isocurvature fluctuations of the DM are produced during inflation (or more generally by any Bogoliubov transformation). In such contexts, the ultralight DM instead resides in a squeezed state. In this work, we demonstrate that these two scenarios can be distinguished via the statistics of the DM density fluctuations, such as the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. This provides a probe of the DM state which persists in the limit of large particle number and does not rely on any non-gravitational interactions of the DM. Importantly, the statistics of these two states differ when the modes of the squeezed state are all in-phase, as is the case at the end of inflation. Later cosmological dynamics may affect this configuration. Our work motivates future numerical studies of how cosmological dynamics may impact the initial squeezed state and the statistics of its density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Prospects of detecting cosmic ray up-scattered dark matter with DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles in direct detection experiments is inherently difficult, as their low kinetic energies in the galactic halo are insufficient to produce observable recoils of the heavy nuclei in the detectors. On the other hand, whenever DM particles interact with nucleons, they can be accelerated by scattering with galactic cosmic rays. These cosmic-ray-boosted DM particles can then interact not only through coherent elastic scattering with nuclei, but also through scattering with individual nucleons in the detectors and produce outgoing particles at MeV to GeV kinetic energies. The resulting signal spectrum overlaps with the detection capabilities of modern neutrino experiments. One future experiment is the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. Our study shows that DUNE has a unique ability to search for cosmic-ray boosted DM with sensitivity comparable to dedicated direct detection experiments in the case of spin-independent interactions. Importantly, DUNE's sensitivity reaches similar values of DM-nucleon cross sections also in the case of spin-dependent interactions, offering a key advantage over traditional direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decays of doubly charmed (bottom) baryons to single heavy baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decays of baryons containing double charm or double bottom quarks, focusing on their transitions to single heavy baryons through three-point QCD sum rule framework. In our calculations, we take into account nonperturbative operators with mass dimensions up to five. We calculate the form factors associated with these decays, emphasizing the vector and axial-vector transition currents in the corresponding amplitude. By applying fitting functions for the form factors based on the squared momentum transfer, we derive predictions for decay widths and branching ratios in their possible lepton channels. These findings offer valuable insights for experimentalists exploring semileptonic decays of doubly charm or bottom baryons. Perhaps they can be validated in upcoming experiments like LHCb. These investigations contribute to a deeper understanding of the decay mechanisms in these baryonic channels.</description>

      <title>Generalized neutrino isocurvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for neutrino isocurvature usually constrain a specific linear combination of isocurvature perturbations. In this work, we discuss realistic cosmological scenarios giving rise to neutrino isocurvature. We show that in general both, neutrino and matter isocurvature perturbations are generated, whose ratio we parameterize by a newly introduced mixing angle. We obtain the first limits on this new mixing angle from PLANCK data, and discuss novel insights into the early Universe that could be provided by future measurements.</description>

      <title>Imprints of energy injection by compact dark stars in the 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strongly self-interacting component of asymmetric dark matter particles can form compact dark stars. The high dark matter density in these objects may allow significant dark matter annihilation into Standard Model particles, even when the portals to the visible sector are extremely weak. In this paper, we argue that compact dark stars could constitute an important source of energy injection during the cosmic dawn era in addition to that of the baryonic stars. Therefore, if dark stars annihilate into photons, the luminosity of dark stars may affect the reionization history of the Universe. We show that the evolution with the redshift of the temperature brightness of the 21-cm line could significantly deviate from the expectations of standard Cosmology, thus providing a new probe for particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Soft-Photon Contribution into Two-Photon Exchange Corrections for Azimuthal Asymmetries of SIDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that two-photon exchange (TPE) corrections to the cross-section of unpolarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) generate azimuthal-dependent terms and the corresponding $\braket{{\cos{(n\phi)}}}$ moments. A quark-diquark model of a nucleon was used in the calculations along with a soft-photon approximation. The infrared divergences in the intermediate steps of calculation are regularized with the fictitious photon mass that cancels out in the final result when the soft-photon bremsstrahlung process and interference terms are added. The calculations employ Mathematica ``LoopTools" package to evaluate the loop integrals. TPE corrections are analyzed in the kinematics of planned experiments at Jefferson Lab.</description>

      <title>Explosive production of Higgs particles and implications for heavy dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely believed that the parameter space for Higgs-portal dark matter that achieves the relic abundance through thermal freeze-out has already been tightly constrained, typically at masses on the order of ${\cal O}(10-100)$ GeV. We point out the possibility that the multiple Higgs production due to its self-interaction dramatically changes this picture. We show that the multiplicity can be as large as ${\cal O}(200)$ for the parameters of the Standard Model Higgs, independently of the kinematics of the particle production process. Consequently, heavy Higgs-portal dark matter of $m_\chi\gtrsim{\cal O}(1)$ TeV can achieve the required relic abundance in the same mechanism with that for canonical weakly interacting massive particle models.</description>

      <title>The lepton-number-violating pion decay and the type-I seesaw mechanism in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the process of lepton-number-violating pion decay, which dominates the nuclear neutrinoless double beta decay induced by the short-range operator, within the type-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1} seesaw mechanism. The type-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1} seesaw mechanism gives rise to the Dirac and Majorana mass terms of neutrinos by introducing the gauge-singlet right-handed neutrinos, which are usually called sterile neutrinos. Using chiral perturbation theory, the transition amplitudes in the case of the light and heavy sterile neutrinos are calculated up to $\mathcal{O}(Q^2/\Lambda^2_\chi)$ respectively, where $Q$ is the typical low-energy scale in this process and $\Lambda_\chi$ the chiral symmetry breaking scale. We then adopt a naive interpolation formula of mass dependence to obtain the amplitude in the full mass range and briefly discuss its validity.</description>

      <title>The resonance parameters of the vector charmonium-like state $G(3900)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the updated analysis of the $G(3900)$ by the BESIII collaboration, we perform a global analysis of the cross sections of the $e^+e^-\to D\bar{D}$, $e^+e^-\to D\bar{D}^*+c.c.$, $e^+e^-\to D^*\bar{D}^*$ processes, especially focusing on the properties of the $G(3900)$. As the energy region of interest is limited by the next opening threshold, i.e. the $D_1\bar{D}$ threshold, we focus on the energy region $[3.7,4.25]~\mathrm{GeV}$, where three charmonia $\psi(1D)$, $\psi(3S)$ and $\psi(2D)$ explicitly contribute to the cross sections. By constructing the $P$-wave contact interaction between the $(D,D^*)$ doublet and its antiparticle in the heavy quark limit, we extract the physical scattering amplitude by solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. No matter whether three or two charmonium states are included in our framework, we always find a dynamically generated state corresponding to the $G(3900)$, which suggests it to be a $P$-wave dynamically generated state. We also predict several dynamically generated states in the corresponding $1^{-+}$ channel. These states can be further searched for in the electron-positron annihilation process involving the emission of a single photon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the mass spectra and decay behaviors of the experimentally unobserved $1F$-wave singly bottom baryons. Calculating their mass spectra could provide crucial guidance for determining their spectroscopic positions. Additionally, by analyzing their decay properties, we could predict the important decay channels, which are essential for experimental searches and quantum number assignments. Our calculations aim to support ongoing experimental and theoretical efforts in singly bottom baryon spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is studied within the complex scalar field theory using the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation. We investigate fluctuation effects on the relativistic BEC through numerical analyses for various spatial dimensions and chemical potentials. Our numerical results are consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and this consistency is also analytically confirmed from the flow equation. We also discuss a numerical instability of the FRG in lower spatial dimensions, which is evadable for certain parameter choices.</description>

      <title>CoMBolt-ITA, a Collective Model via relativistic Boltzmann equation in Isotropization Time Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new (2+1)-model is developed to investigate the collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. This framework couples pre-equilibrium dynamics with hydrodynamic evolution by solving the Boltzmann equation within the isotropization time approximation. A numerical scheme based on the method of characteristics enables the evolution to begin from a specified initial Boltzmann distribution. In this work, the spatial structure of the initial distribution is modeled using the TrENTo framework. Our results show that a medium initialized at $\tau_0 $ in the order of 1\,[fm/$c$] with a small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\eta/s = 0.008$) evolves consistently with hydrodynamic simulations, such as those performed using the VISH2+1 code, while discrepancies arise for a medium with $\eta/s = 0.8$. Furthermore, when initialized with a highly anisotropic momentum distribution in the longitudinal direction at early times, the system exhibits spatially non-uniform thermalization in the transverse plane, leading to the emergence of a nontrivial hypersurface that marks the onset of hydrodynamic applicability.</description>

Abstract: The associated vector meson + jet production in photon - induced interactions at the LHC is investigated and predictions for the cross - sections are derived considering the NLO corrections to the BFKL kernel. We explore the possibility that in a near future the FOCAL detector could be used to measure the jet at forward rapidities, with the associated meson being measured by a central or forward detector, and estimate the rapidity distributions for the $\rho$ + jet and $J/\Psi$ + jet photoproduction in $pp$, $Pbp$ and $PbPb$ collisions. We demonstrate that the associated cross-sections are non - negligible and that a future experimental analysis can be useful to constrain the description of the BFKL kernel and improve our understanding of the QCD dynamics.</description>

      <title>Prospects for gravitational wave and ultra-light dark matter detection with binary resonances beyond the secular approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision observations of orbital systems have recently emerged as a promising new means of detecting gravitational waves and ultra-light dark matter, offering sensitivity in new regimes with significant discovery potential. These searches rely critically on precise modeling of the dynamical effects of these signals on the observed system; however, previous analyses have mainly only relied on the secularly-averaged part of the response. We introduce here a fundamentally different approach that allows for a fully time-resolved description of the effects of oscillatory metric perturbations on orbital dynamics. We find that gravitational waves and ultra-light dark matter can induce large oscillations in the orbital parameters of realistic binaries, enhancing the sensitivity to such signals by orders of magnitude compared to previous estimates.</description>

      <title>Gaussian generally covariant hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a version of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics in a way very different from the usual derivation: Instead of treating it as a coarse-grained deterministic theory expanded in gradients of equilibrium quantities, we treat it as a stochastic theory, characterized by partition functions in each cells, expanded in cumulants. We show that the Gaussian ansatz allows us, via the gravitational Ward identities acting as a constraint between the variance and the average, to maintain full general covariance, with hydrodynamic flow emerging as an approximate Killing vector. If the symmetry of relativistic hydrodynamics, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, is preserved, we show that linear response formulae are also generally covariant. We discuss our results and argue that in this approach, the applicability of the effective theory is parametrized around a very different quantity than the Knudsen number, offering hope of understanding the applicability of hydrodynamics to small systems.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of coupled dark energy and dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate an effective field theory (EFT) of coupled dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interacting through energy and momentum transfers. In the DE sector, we exploit the EFT of vector-tensor theories with the presence of a preferred time direction on the cosmological background. This prescription allows one to accommodate shift-symmetric and non-shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories by taking a particular weak coupling limit, with and without consistency conditions respectively. We deal with the DM sector as a non-relativistic perfect fluid, which can be described by a system of three scalar fields. By choosing a unitary gauge in which the perturbations in the DE and DM sectors are eaten by the metric, we incorporate the leading-order operators that characterize the energy and momentum transfers besides those present in the conventional EFT of vector-tensor and scalar-tensor theories and the non-relativistic perfect fluid. We express the second-order action of scalar perturbations in real space in terms of time- and scale-dependent dimensionless EFT parameters and derive the linear perturbation equations of motion by taking into account additional matter (baryons, radiation). In the small-scale limit, we obtain conditions for the absence of both ghosts and Laplacian instabilities and discuss how they are affected by the DE-DM interactions. We also compute the effective DM gravitational coupling $G_{\rm eff}$ by using a quasi-static approximation for perturbations deep inside the DE sound horizon and show that the existence of momentum and energy transfers allow a possibility to realize $G_{\rm eff}$ smaller than in the uncoupled case at low redshift.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for the moments of the binary collision integral and its relation to the relaxation-time approximation in leading-order anisotropic fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the moments of the nonlinear binary collision integral in the ultrarelativistic hard-sphere approximation for an arbitrary anisotropic distribution function in the local rest frame. This anisotropic distribution function has an angular asymmetry controlled by the parameter of anisotropy $\xi$, such that in the limit of a vanishing anisotropy $\lim_{\xi \rightarrow 0} \hat{f}_{0 \mathbf{k}} = f_{0 \mathbf{k}}$, approaches the spherically symmetric local equilibrium distribution function. The corresponding moments of the binary collision integral are obtained in terms of quadratic products of different moments of the anisotropic distribution function and couple to a well defined set of lower-order moments. To illustrate these results we compare the moments of the binary collision integral to the moments of the widely used relaxation-time approximation of Anderson and Witting in case of a spheroidal distribution function. We found that in an expanding system the nonlinear Boltzmann collision term leads to twice slower equilibration than the relaxation-time approximation. Furthermore we also show that including two dynamical moments helps to resolve the ambiguity which additional moment of the Boltzmann equation to choose to close the conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Measuring short-range correlations and quasi-elastic cross sections in A(e,e') at x&gt;1 and modest Q$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from the Jefferson Lab E08-014 experiment, investigating short-range correlations (SRC) through measurements of absolute inclusive quasi-elastic cross sections and their ratios. This study utilized 3.356 GeV electrons scattered off targets including $^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He, $^{12}$C, $^{40}$Ca, and $^{48}$Ca, at modest momentum transfers ($1.3 &lt; Q^2 \leq 2$ GeV$^2$). Kinematics were selected to enhance the cross-section contribution from high-momentum nucleons originating from the strongly interacting, short-distance components of two-nucleon SRCs (2N-SRCs), known to exhibit a universal structure across both light and heavy nuclei.We analyzed the A/$^2$H ratio within the region dominated by 2N-SRCs to characterize the nuclear dependence of SRC contributions across various nuclei. Additionally, the A/$^3$He ratio was examined at kinematics sensitive to nucleons with even higher momentum, aiming to identify signals indicative of three-nucleon SRCs (3N-SRCs). The traditional analysis method in the expected 3N-SRC region ($x &gt; 2$) did not yield a clear plateau; instead, the data diverged from the predicted 3N-SRC behavior as momentum transfer increased. However, when analyzed in terms of the struck nucleon's light-cone momentum, the data exhibited the opposite trend, progressively approaching the predicted 3N-SRC plateau. These observations suggest that future measurements at higher energies may facilitate a definitive isolation and identification of 3N-SRCs.</description>

      <title>Prospective sensitivity of CTA on detection of evaporating primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the lifetime of a black hole decreases, the energy of the Hawking radiation it emits increases, ultimately culminating in its disappearance through a powerful burst of gamma rays. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with an initial mass of $\sim 5\times10^{14}$ g, their lifespans are expected to end in the present epoch. Detecting such PBH bursts would provide compelling evidence of their existence. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) has the potential to observe these bursts at the high-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum. To investigate this possibility, we conduct a study to evaluate the sensitivity of CTA to the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that during a 5-year observational campaign, CTA could exclude a local burst rate density exceeding $\sim 36\ \mathrm{pc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which represents an improvement of one order of magnitude over the upper limit set by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). In addition, we propose an observation strategy optimized for detecting PBH bursts.</description>

      <title>Testing Quintessence Axion Dark Energy with Recent Cosmological Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quintessence axion model for dynamical dark energy, motivated in part by recent results from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). By carefully treating the initial conditions and parameter sampling, we identify a preferred parameter space featuring a sub-Planckian axion decay constant and a relatively large axion mass, which naturally avoids the quality problem and remains consistent with the perturbative string conjecture. Our parameter scan also uncovers a trans-Planckian regime of theoretical interest, which is only mildly disfavored by observations. The results remain robust when DESI BAO data are combined with CMB and supernova observations. Finally, we discuss the possible connection between this model and the recently reported non-zero rotation of the CMB linear polarization angle, emphasizing the broader cosmological implications and the promising prospects for testing this scenario. We show that an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ electromagnetic anomaly coefficient is preferred by the strongest constraint, which is in full agreement with the minimal quintessence axion model.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed Stochastic Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem in the LaMET framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One proposal to compute parton distributions from first principles is the large momentum effective theory (LaMET), which requires the Fourier transform of matrix elements computed non-perturbatively. Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) provides calculations of these matrix elements over a finite range of Fourier harmonics that are often noisy or unreliable in the largest computed harmonics. It has been suggested that enforcing an exponential decay of the missing harmonics helps alleviate this issue. Using non-perturbative data, we show that the uncertainty introduced by this inverse problem in a realistic setup remains significant without very restrictive assumptions, and that the importance of the exact asymptotic behavior is minimal for values of $x$ where the framework is currently applicable. We show that the crux of the inverse problem lies in harmonics of the order of $\lambda=zP_z \sim 5-15$, where the signal in the lattice data is often barely existent in current studies, and the asymptotic behavior is not firmly established. We stress the need for more sophisticated techniques to account for this inverse problem, whether in the LaMET or related frameworks like the short-distance factorization. We also address a misconception that, with available lattice methods, the LaMET framework allows a "direct" computation of the $x$-dependence, whereas the alternative short-distance factorization only gives access to moments or fits of the $x$-dependence.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger standard-siren cosmology for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors: Considering observations of gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, GW multi-messenger observations for binary neutron star merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. Extending the previous work, we explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimation by considering their associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, including $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) coincidence observations by the Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor and GW-triggered target-of-opportunity observations of kilonovae by different optical survey projects. During an assumed 10-year observation, we predict that the number of detectable GW-kilonova events is $\sim 4900$ with redshifts below $\sim 0.4$ under GW network and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in the $i$ band, which is three times more than that of GW-GRB detections. For the cosmological analysis, we find that with the inclusion of GW-kilonova detections, the constraints on cosmological parameters from GW-EM detections are significantly improved compared to those from GW-GRB detections. In particular, GW-EM detections can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with a precision ranging from $0.076\%$ to $0.034\%$. Moreover, GW multi-messenger observations could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). The combination of CBS and GW-EM can tightly constrain the equation of state parameters of dark energy $w$ in the $w$CDM model and $w_0$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model with precisions of $0.72\%$ and $0.99\%$, respectively, meeting the standard of precision cosmology. In conclusion, GW multi-messenger observations could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probing the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Pure Chromo-Natural Inflation: Signatures of Particle Production from Weak to Strong Backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider, in the context of axion-inflation, the \textit{Pure Natural Inflation} (PNI) model coupled with an SU(2) gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term. As the axion rolls down its potential, it dissipates energy in the gauge sector thus sourcing fluctuations of scalar and tensor degrees of freedom therein. Gauge field fluctuations will, in turn, feed primordial gravitational waves as well as curvature perturbations. Remarkably, we can use upcoming cosmological probes to test this mechanism across a vast range of scales, from the CMB to laser interferometers. Due to their flat plateau at large field values, we find that PNI potentials fare better vis-\'{a}-vis CMB observations than the conventional sinusoidal potential of chromo-natural inflation (CNI). We show that, even when the dynamics begin in the weak backreaction regime, the rolling of the axion leads to a build-up of the gauge-quanta production, invariably triggering the strong backreaction of the gauge sector tensors on the background dynamics. This transition results in the copious production of both scalar and tensor perturbations, which we study in detail. The gravitational wave signatures include a rich peak structure with a characteristic scale-dependent chirality, a compelling target for future gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the peak in scalar perturbations may lead to the formation of primordial black holes, potentially accounting for a significant fraction of the observed dark matter abundance.</description>

Abstract: We generalise a method recently introduced in the literature, that derives canonical differential equations, to multi-scale Feynman integrals with an underlying Calabi-Yau geometry. We start by recomputing a canonical form for the sunrise integral with all unequal masses. Additionally, we compute for the first time a canonical form for the three-loop banana integral with two unequal masses and for a four-loop banana integral with two unequal masses. For the integrals we compute, we find an $\epsilon$-form whose connection has at most simple poles. We motivate our construction by studying the Picard-Fuchs operators acting on the integrals considered. In the appendices, we give a constructive explanation for why our generalisation works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present WI2easy, a Mathematica package for high-precision analysis of warm inflation (WI) dynamics, enabling efficient computation of both background evolution and curvature perturbations. Designed with a user-friendly interface, the tool supports a broad spectrum of inflaton potentials--including large-field, small-field, and hybrid models--and accommodates arbitrary dissipation coefficients dependent on temperature, field amplitude, or both, encompassing canonical forms prevalent in WI studies. Users can define custom models through intuitive commands, generating full dynamical trajectories and perturbation spectra in a streamlined workflow. This facilitates rapid confrontation of theoretical predictions with observational constraints, empowering systematic exploration of WI parameter spaces. WI2easy bridges the gap between theoretical models and observational cosmology, offering a robust, adaptable framework for next-generation inflationary analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01421v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depending on the point of view, modern machine learning is either providing an unprecedented boost to the numerical methods of particle physics, or it is transforming the way we do science with vast amounts of complex data. In any case, it is crucial for young researchers to stay on top of this development and apply cutting-edge methods and tools to all LHC physics tasks. These lecture notes lead students with basic knowledge of particle physics and significant enthusiasm for machine learning to relevant applications. They start with an LHC-specific motivation and a non-standard introduction to neural networks and then cover classification, unsupervised classification, generative networks, data representations, and inverse problems. Three themes defining much of the discussion are statistically defined loss functions, uncertainties, and accuracy. To understand the applications, the notes include some aspects of theoretical LHC physics. All examples are chosen from particle physics publications of the last few years, and many of them come with corresponding tutorials.</description>

      <title>Viability of Boosted Light Dark Matter in a Two-Component Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the boosted dark matter (BDM) scenario in a two-component model. We consider a neutrinophilic two-Higgs doublet model ($\nu$2HDM), which consists of one extra Higgs doublet and a light right-handed neutrino. This model is extended with a light ($\sim 10$~MeV) singlet scalar DM $\phi_3$, which is stabilized under an extra dark $Z_2^{\rm DM}$ symmetry and can only effectively annihilate through the CP even scalar $H$. Although oblique parameters put tight constraints on the model, introduction of vectorlike leptons (VLL) can potentially salvage the issue. The vectorlike doublet $N$ and singlet $\chi$ are also stabilized through dark $Z_2^{\rm DM}$ symmetry. The lightest vectorlike mass eigenstate ($\chi_1 \sim 100$~GeV) is the 2nd DM component of the model. The fermion DM is restricted in a narrow mass region while a somewhat broader mass region is allowed for the scalar DM. However, when two DM sectors are coupled, the annihilation channel $\chi_1 \chi_1 \to \phi_3 \phi_3$ opens up. As a result, the fermionic relic density decreases, and paves way for broader fermionic DM mass region with under-abundant relic: a region of $[30-65]$ GeV compared to a narrower $[40-50]$ GeV window for the single component case. On the other hand, the light DM $\phi_3$ acquires significant boost from the annihilation of $\chi_1$, causing a dilution in the resonant annihilation of $\phi_3$. This in turn increases the scalar DM relic, allowing for a smaller mass region compared to the individual case. The exact and underabundant relic is achievable in a significant parameter space of the two-component model where the total DM relic is mainly dominated by the fermionic DM contribution. The scalar DM is found to be sub-dominant or equally dominant ($\sim 30 \% - 80 \%$ of total DM) with significant boost which can be detected in experiments.</description>

      <title>Soft modes in hot QCD matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral crossover of QCD at finite temperature and vanishing baryon density turns into a second order phase transition if lighter than physical quark masses are considered. If this transition occurs sufficiently close to the physical point, its universal critical behaviour would largely control the physics of the QCD phase transition. We quantify the size of this region in QCD using functional approaches, both Dyson-Schwinger equations and the functional renormalisation group. The latter allows us to study both critical and non-critical effects on equal footing, facilitating a precise determination of the scaling regime. We find that the physical point is far away from the critical region. Importantly, we show that the physics of the chiral crossover is dominated by soft modes even far beyond the critical region. While scaling functions determine all thermodynamic properties of the system in the critical region, the order parameter potential is the relevant quantity away from it. We compute this potential in QCD using the functional renormalisation group and Dyson-Schwinger equations and provide a simple parametrisation for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>The Chiral Lagrangian of CP-Violating Axion-Like Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the construction of the most general CP-violating chiral Lagrangian for an axion-like particle (ALP). Starting with an effective Lagrangian containing light quarks and gluons, we provide its matching onto a chiral effective Lagrangian at $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ described in terms of mesons and baryons, identifying the correspondence between the Jarlskog invariants of the two theories. After deriving the ALP interactions with mesons and baryons, we analyse a few relevant phenomenological implications such as the permanent electric dipole moments of nucleons and the CP-violating ALP and kaon decays.This work provides the necessary tools for further phenomenological analyses connecting low-energy observables with the couplings of the underlying ultraviolet complete theory.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement and Bell non-locality in loop-induced Higgs boson decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study quantum entanglement properties of the three-body $H\to\gamma l\bar{l}$ decays (for $l=e,\mu,\tau$) within the context of the Standard Model augmented with CP-violating interactions in the lepton Yukawa sector. Our aim is to elucidate the distribution of entanglement between the final photon, lepton and antilepton across the phase-space. These rare Higgs boson decays occur at 1-loop level, presenting a unique opportunity to scrutinize quantum correlations of fundamental interactions in tripartite systems by computing concurrence measures and investigating Bell non-locality. Moreover, we explore post-decay and autodistillation phenomena. Multipartite entanglement measures have much richer structure than those in the bipartite case, thus deserve more attention in collider phenomenology. In this line, we analyze here novel observables for these three-body Higgs boson decays, which can be extended to other multiparticle systems within the high-energy regime. We found that entanglement manifests among final particles, occasionally achieving a maximally entangled state in specific kinematical configurations. Also, these decay channels are promising for Bell non-locality tests but CP-effects are suppressed by lepton masses in this kind of observables.</description>

      <title>Light from darkness: history of a hot dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a scenario in which the expansion of the Early Universe is driven by a hot hidden sector (HS) with an initial temperature $T'$ that is significantly higher than that of the visible sector (VS), $T' \gg T$. The latter is assumed to be made of Standard Model (SM) particles and our main focus is on the possibility that dark matter (DM) is part of the dominant HS and that its abundance is set by secluded freeze-out. In particular, we study the subsequent evolution and fate of the DM companion particle after freeze-out all the way toward reheating of the VS. To make this scenario more concrete, we work within dark QED, a framework in which the DM is a Dirac fermion and its companion, a massive dark photon; coupling between the SM and HS is through kinetic mixing. We provide a detailed and comprehensive numerical and analytical analysis of the different regimes of reheating of the VS. Extending and complementing the work of Coy et al on the``Domain of thermal dark matter candidates", we use our results to explore the viable parameter space of both the DM matter particle and its companion, here the dark photon. We show that current and future fixed target experiments can probe scenarios along which the expansion was driven by relativistic DM photons, a scenario dubbed relativistic reheating. We also set new bounds on the maximal temperature ratio $T'/T$ and argue for an extension of the domain toward very large DM masses, $m_{\rm dm} \sim 10^{11}$ GeV. These are possible assuming that DM annihilation is bounded by unitarity and that reheating of the VS occurs just before big bang nucleosynthesis. We also discuss some possible implications for (and constraints on) baryogenesis, including simple leptogenesis mechanisms, and how they may set additional constraints on the domain of DM candidates.</description>

      <title>Unified view of scalar and vector dark matter solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of solitons -- stable, long-lived, and localized field configurations -- is a generic prediction for ultralight dark matter. These solitons, known by various names such as boson stars, axion stars, oscillons, and Q-balls depending on the context, are typically treated as distinct entities in the literature. This study aims to provide a unified perspective on these solitonic objects for real or complex, scalar or vector dark matter, considering self-interactions and nonminimal gravitational interactions. We demonstrate that these solitons share universal nonrelativistic properties, such as conserved charges, mass-radius relations, stability and profiles. Without accounting for alternative interactions or relativistic effects, distinguishing between real and complex scalar dark matter is challenging. However, self-interactions differentiate real and complex vector dark matter due to their different dependencies on the macroscopic spin density of dark matter waves. Furthermore, gradient-dependent nonminimal gravitational interactions impose an upper bound on soliton amplitudes, influencing their mass distribution and phenomenology in the present-day universe.</description>

      <title>Searching for type I seesaw mechanism in a two Heavy Neutral Leptons scenario at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the search for heavy neutral leptons (HNL) in the type I seesaw mechanism at the Future Circular Collider in its $e^+e^-$ stage (FCC-ee), considering a luminosity of 125 ab$^{-1}$ collected at $\sqrt{s}=$91.2 GeV. The study examines two generations of heavy neutral leptons produced in association with Standard Model (SM) neutrinos and decaying to a purely leptonic final state. This theoretical framework can explain neutrino oscillations and other open questions of the SM, providing a broader perspective on the relevance of this experimental search. The analysis is performed using a fast simulation of the IDEA detector concept to study potential HNL interactions at the FCC-ee. The sensitivity contours are obtained from a selection of kinematic variables aimed at improving the signal-to-background ratio for the prompt production case. In the case of long-lived HNLs, the background can be almost fully eliminated by exploiting their displaced decay vertices. The study shows that the FCC-ee has a significant sensitivity to observing these objects in a region of the phase space not accessible by other experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cross-section for the associated production of a jet with an electroweak gauge boson ($G = W^{\pm}, Z^0, \gamma$) at forward rapidities in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions is derived within the color - dipole $S$ - matrix framework. We present the full expressions for the differential cross-section of the $q p \rightarrow G q X$ process in the transverse momentum space, considering the longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the gauge boson. We demonstrate that the final formulae can be expressed in terms of the unintegrated gluon distribution and reproduce previous results for the associated jet + $\gamma$ and jet + $Z^0$ production, derived using other frameworks. Moreover, we derive the back - to - back correlation limit of the spectra and show that it can be expressed in terms of the unpolarized and linearly polarized transverse momentum gluon distributions. Our results improve the description of the inclusive jet plus color neutral particle production at forward rapidities, not far from the proton fragmentation region, in $pp$ or $pA$ collisions, and are the main ingredient to study the impact of nonlinear QCD effects in two - particle correlations.</description>

      <title>Radiative Mass Mechanism: Addressing the Flavour Hierarchy and Strong CP Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a class of models based on the parity invariant Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM), which incorporates the mechanism of radiative generation of fermion masses while simultaneously possessing the solution to the Strong CP problem. A flavour non-universal gauged abelian symmetry is imposed on top of LRSM, which helps in inducing the masses of second and first-generation fermions at one-loop and two-loop, respectively, and thereby reproduces the hierarchical spectrum of the masses. Parity invariance requires the vanishing of the strong CP parameter at the zeroth order, and the non-zero contribution arises at the two-loop level, which is in agreement with the experimental constraints. The minimal model predicts flavour symmetry breaking scale and the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry breaking scale at the same level. flavour non-universality of the new gauge interaction leads to various flavour-changing transitions both in quarks and leptonic sectors and, therefore, has various phenomenologically interesting signatures. The model predicts a new physics scale near $10^8$ GeV or above for phenomenological consistent solutions. This, in turn, restricts strong CP phase $\bar{\theta} \lesssim 10^{-14}$ as the parity breaking scale and flavour scale are related in the minimal framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of dark matter on hybrid stars. Using a two-fluid approach, where normal and dark matter components interact only gravitationally, we explore how dark matter can trigger the appearance of quark matter in neutron stars for unprecedented low masses. Our findings reveal that dark matter increases the central pressure of neutron stars, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid stars with quark cores even at very low compact star masses. The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of "masquerading hybrid stars", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters. Additionally, we identify a unique class of objects termed "dark oysters", characterized by a large dark matter halo and a small normal matter core, highlighting the diverse structural possibilities for compact stars influenced by dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of the finite system size on the QCD phase diagram was studied with various momentum space constraints within a mean-field quark-meson model. On the one hand side, the choice of the scenario -- low-momentum cutoff and discretization with periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions -- and the presence of the vacuum fluctuations were found to strongly affect the volume dependence of the CEP. On the other hand, its location is significantly shifted in each case for linear sizes below $L\approx 10$ fm. This is also reflected in the conserved charge fluctuations, which were investigated along the phase boundary using multiple scenarios for the finite size effects.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration in QC_2D from effective model using the functional renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The order of the chiral phase transition in two-color and two-flavor QC$_2$D is investigated using the functional renormalization group (FRG) technique in an effective model setting. We calculate the $\beta$ function of all couplings in the dimensionally reduced Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional with Pauli-G\"ursey SU(4) symmetry. We compare results of the perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion approach with those obtained via the FRG, evaluated directly in $d=3$ dimensions. The perturbative results suggest that the fixed-point structure is more intricate than that of three-color QCD, a conclusion further supported by the FRG analysis. Both methods display an infrared stable $O(6)$ fixed point at infinite axial anomaly; however, the FRG approach also reveals the existence of $U_A(1)$ anomaly-free fixed points, which can become infrared stable if the anomaly in the underlying theory vanishes at the critical temperature. These findings imply that the phase transition can be of second order, consistent with earlier findings for three colors.</description>

We systematically calculate their strong and radiative decay properties using the light-cone sum rule method. Besides the $\Lambda_c(2595)$, $\Lambda_c(2625)$, $\Xi_c(2790)$, and $\Xi_c(2815)$, our results suggest the existence of two additional $\Lambda_c$ baryons and two additional $\Xi_c$ baryons. Their masses, mass splittings within the same multiplets, and decay properties are summarized in Table V for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Light front holographic QCD theory in the generalized uncertainty principle framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we develop the framework of light-front holographic QCD in the presence of a minimal length scale by incorporating the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) into the QCD Lagrangian. From this modified theory, we derive a GUP-corrected light-front holographic QCD (LFH QCD) equation and obtain the corresponding hadronic mass spectrum. Our results show that the hadronic mass spectrum acquires an additional GUP-dependent term that increases the masses. This mass enhancement leads to significantly improved agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental data.</description>

      <title>The effect of decay cascade via an intermediate resonance in the $\gamma p \to \pi^0 \eta p $ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\gamma p \to \pi^0 \eta p$ reaction has been investigated by the CBELSA/TAPS Collaboration, revealing a narrow structure in the $\eta p$ invariant mass distributions at a mass of $1700$ MeV. In this study, we explore the possibility that the narrow structure is caused by a decay cascade via an intermediate nucleon resonance decaying to $\eta p$ final states. The candidates for the intermediate nucleon resonances are $N(1700)3/2^{-}$ and $N(1710)1/2^{+}$, with masses near the observed structure. We consider the $t$-channel $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange diagrams, the $u$-channel nucleon-pole exchange diagram, the contact term, and the $s$-channel pole diagrams of nucleon, $\Delta$, and nucleon resonances when constructing the reaction amplitudes to reproduce the stripped individual contribution of the narrow structure. Our analysis indicates that the signature strength of the decay cascade $\gamma p \to \pi^{0}N(1700)3/2^{-} \to \pi^{0}\eta p$ is too weak to reach the experimental curve of the narrow structure due to the small decay branching ratio of $N(1700)3/2^{-}$ to $\eta p$. Although the decay cascade $\gamma p \to \pi^{0}N(1710)1/2^{+} \to \pi^{0}\eta p$ can qualitatively reproduce the experimental curve of the invariant mass distributions, its cross-section width is much larger than that of the corresponding experimental curve. Therefore, we conclude that the decay cascade via an intermediate nucleon resonance could not be the reason leading to the narrow structure in the $\eta p$ invariant mass distributions of the $\gamma p \to \pi^0 \eta p$ reaction.</description>

      <title>Gauging spacetime inversions in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacetime inversion symmetries such as parity and time reversal play a central role in physics, but they are usually treated as global symmetries. In quantum gravity there are no global symmetries, so any spacetime inversion symmetries must be gauge symmetries. In particular this includes $\mathcal{CRT}$ symmetry (in even dimensions usually combined with a rotation to become $\mathcal{CPT}$), which in quantum field theory is always a symmetry and seems likely to be a symmetry of quantum gravity as well. In this article we discuss what it means to gauge a spacetime inversion symmetry, and we explain some of the more unusual consequences of doing this. In particular we argue that the gauging of $\mathcal{CRT}$ is automatically implemented by the sum over topologies in the Euclidean gravity path integral, that in a closed universe the Hilbert space of quantum gravity must be a real vector space, and that in Lorentzian signature manifolds which are not time-orientable must be included as valid configurations of the theory. In particular we give an example of an asymptotically-AdS time-unorientable geometry which must be included to reproduce computable results in the dual CFT.</description>

      <title>The quest to discover supersymmetry at the ATLAS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for supersymmetry with the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider intensified after the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. The search programme expanded in both breadth and depth, profiting from the increased integrated luminosity and higher centre-of-mass energy of Run 2, and gaining new sensitivity to unexplored areas of supersymmetry parameter space through the use of new experimental signatures and innovative analysis techniques. This report summarises the supersymmetry searches at ATLAS using up to 140 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, including the limits set on the production of gluinos, squarks, and electroweakinos for scenarios either with or without R-parity conservation, and including models where some of the supersymmetric particles are long-lived.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in Pantheon+ supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ Maximum Likelihood Estimators to examine the Pantheon+ catalogue of Type Ia supernovae for large scale anisotropies in the expansion rate of the Universe. The analyses are carried out in the heliocentric frame, the CMB frame, as well as the Local Group frame. In all frames, the Hubble expansion rate in the redshift range 0.023 &lt; z &lt; 0.15 is found to have a statistically significant dipolar variation exceeding 1.5 km/s/Mpc, i.e. bigger than the claimed 1% uncertainty in the SH0ES measurement of the Hubble parameter H_0. The deceleration parameter too has a redshift-dependent dipolar modulation at &gt; 5 sigma significance, consistent with previous findings using the SDSSII/SNLS3 Joint Lightcurve Analysis catalogue. The inferred cosmic acceleration cannot therefore be due to a Cosmological Constant, but is likely a general relativistic effect due to the anomalous bulk flow in our local Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black hole abundance with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}$ - $10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $2\times10^{16}$ - $5\times10^{17}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Our results indicate that although Insight-HXMT does not have an advantage in the first two scenarios, when considering the power-law model, its exceptional sensitivity in the hard X-ray regime and sufficiently high upper energy limit significantly strengthen the constraints on PBHs with masses greater than $10^{17}$ g compared to previous limits. Furthermore, the exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter has reached $4\times10^{17}$ g, which is comparable to the current threshold.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Stability of the Dark Energy Model from Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the stability of the dark energy model from time crystals proposed in [1]. We emphasize two ingredients, the coupling of the scalar field to gravity, and the fact that these time crystals are on an expanding FRW background, which play a crucial role in the field's dynamics. The Hubble parameter, which contributes a drag term to the equations of motion, grows with time until the scale factor diverges. When taken into account, these factors also alleviate the stability concern of [2].</description>
