      <title>A Note on Polychromatic Colorings of Shift-Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We popularize the question whether (for large $m$) all $m$-uniform shift-chain hypergraphs are (properly) $2$-colorable. On the other hand, we show that for every $m$ some $m$-uniform shift-chains are not polychromatic $3$-colorable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $D \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is called $r$-large if every $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ admits arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions $a,a+d,...,a+(k-1)d$ with gap $d \in D$. Closely related to largeness is accessibility; a set $D \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is called $r$-accessible if every $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ admits arbitrarily long monochromatic sequences $x_1,x_2,...,x_k$ with $x_{i+1}-x_{i} \in D$. It is known that if $D \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is $2$-large, then the gaps between elements in $D$ cannot grow exponentially. In this paper, we show that if $D$ is $2$-accessible, then the gaps between elements in $D$ cannot grow much faster than exponentially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we define flattened Catalan words as Catalan words whose runs of weak ascents have leading terms that appear in weakly increasing order. We provide generating functions, formulas, and asymptotic expressions for the number of flattened Catalan words based on the number of runs of ascents (descents), runs of weak ascents (descents), $\ell$-valleys, valleys, symmetric valleys, $\ell$-peaks, peaks, and symmetric peaks.</description>

      <title>The minimum orientable genus of the repeated Cartesian product of families of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the minimum genus of a graph is a fundamental optimisation problem in the study of network design and implementation as it gives a measure of non-planarity of graphs. In this paper, we are concerned with determining the smallest value of $g$ such that a given graph $G$ has an embedding on the orientable surface of genus $g$. In particular, we consider the Cartesian product of graphs since this is a well studied graph operation which is often used for modelling interconnection networks. The $s$-cube $Q_i^{(s)}$ is obtained by taking the repeated Cartesian product of $i$ complete bipartite graphs $K_{s,s}$. We determine the genus of the Cartesian product of the $2r$-cube with the repeated Cartesian product of cycles and of the Cartesian product of the $2r$-cube with the repeated Cartesian product of paths.</description>

      <title>Antimagic and product antimagic graphs with pendant edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph of size $m$ and $L$ a set of $m$ distinct real numbers. An $L$-labeling of $G$ is a bijection $\phi: E \rightarrow L$. We say that $\phi$ is an antimagic $L$-labeling if the induced vertex sum $\phi_+: V \rightarrow \mathbb {R}$ defined as $\phi_+(u)=\sum_{uv\in E}\phi(uv)$ is injective. Similarly, $\phi$ is a product antimagic $L$-labeling of $G$ if the induced vertex product $\phi_{\circ}: V \rightarrow \mathbb {R}$ defined as $\phi_{\circ}(u)=\prod_{uv\in E}\phi(uv)$ is injective. A graph $G$ is antimagic (resp. product antimagic) if it has an antimagic (resp. a product antimagic) $L$-labeling for $L=\{1,2,\dots,m\}$. Hartsfield and Ringel conjectured that every simple connected graph distinct from $K_2$ is antimagic, but the conjecture remains widely open.
  We prove, among other results, that every connected graph of size $m$, $m \geq 3$, admits an antimagic $L$-labeling for every arithmetic sequence $L$ of $m$ positive real numbers, if every vertex of degree at least three is a support vertex. As a corollary, we derive that these graphs are antimagic, reinforcing the veracity of the conjecture by Hartsfield and Ringel. Moreover, these graphs admit also a product antimagic $L$-labeling provided that the smallest element of $L$ is at least one. The proof is constructive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is a ``$k$-Kuratowski graph'' if it has exactly $k$ components, each isomorphic to $K_5$ or to $K_{3,3}$. We prove that if a graph $G$ contains no $k$-Kuratowski graph as a minor,then there is a set $X$ of boundedly many vertices such that $G\setminus X$ can be drawn in a (possibly disconnected) surface in which no $k$-Kuratowski graph can be drawn.</description>

      <title>Zero-one Grothendieck Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fink, M\'esz\'aros and St.Dizier showed that the Schubert polynomial $\mathfrak{S}_w(x)$ is zero-one if and only if $w$ avoids twelve permutation patterns. In this paper, we prove that the Grothendieck polynomial $\mathfrak{G}_w(x)$ is zero-one, i.e., with coefficients either 0 or $\pm$1, if and only if $w$ avoids six patterns. As applications, we show that zero-one homogeneous Grothendieck polynomials are Lorentzian, partially confirming three conjectures of Huh, Matherne, M\'esz\'aros and St.Dizier. Moreover, we verify several conjectures on the support and coefficients of Grothendieck polynomials posed by M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros, Setiabrata and St.Dizier for the case of zero-one Grothendieck polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schubert problem asks for combinatorial models to compute structure constants of the cohomology ring with respect to the Schubert classes, and has been an important open problem in algebraic geometry and combinatorics that guided fruitful research in decades. In this paper, we provide an explicit formula for the (equivariant) Schubert structure constants $c_{uv}^w$ across all Lie types when the elements $u,v,w$ are boolean. In particular, in type $A$, all Schubert structure constants on boolean elements are either $0$ or $1$.</description>

      <title>Computing $\vec{\mathcal{S}}$-DAGs and Parity Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treewidth on undirected graphs is known to have many algorithmic applications. When considering directed width-measures there are much less results on their deployment for algorithmic results. In 2022 the first author, Rabinovich and Wiederrecht introduced a new directed width measure, $\vec{\mathcal{S}}$-DAG-width, using directed separations and obtained a structural duality for it. In 2012 Berwanger~et~al.~solved Parity Games in polynomial time on digraphs of bounded DAG-width. With generalising this result to digraphs of bounded $\vec{\mathcal{S}}$-DAG-width and also providing an algorithm to compute the $\vec{\mathcal{S}}$-DAG-width of a given digraphs we give first algorithmical results for this new parameter.</description>

      <title>Variety of mutual-visibility problems in hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and $M \subseteq V(G)$. Vertices $x, y \in M$ are $M$-visible if there exists a shortest $x,y$-path of $G$ that does not pass through any vertex of $M \setminus \{x, y \}$. We say that $M$ is a mutual-visibility set if each pair of vertices of $M$ is $M$-visible, while the size of any largest mutual-visibility set of $G$ is the mutual-visibility number of $G$. If some additional combinations for pairs of vertices $x, y$ are required to be $M$-visible, we obtain the total (every $x,y \in V(G)$ are $M$-visible), the outer (every $x \in M$ and every $y \in V(G) \setminus M$ are $M$-visible), and the dual (every $x,y \in V(G) \setminus M$ are $M$-visible) mutual-visibility set of $G$. The cardinalities of the largest of the above defined sets are known as the total, the outer, and the dual mutual-visibility number of $G$, respectively.
  We present results on the variety of mutual-visibility problems in hypercubes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the definition of the $cd$-index of an Eulerian poset to the class of semi-Eulerian posets. For simplicial semi-Eulerian Buchsbaum posets, we show that all coefficients of the $cd$-index are non-negative. This proves a conjecture of Novik for odd dimensional manifolds and extends it to the even dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Quasisymmetric Schur $Q$-functions and peak Young quasisymmetric Schur functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relationship between quasisymmetric Schur $Q$-functions and peak Young quasisymmetric Schur functions. We introduce a bijection on $\mathsf{SPIT}(\alpha)$ such that $\{\mathrm{w}_{\rm c}(T) \mid T \in \mathsf{SPIT}(\alpha)\}$ and $\{\mathrm{w}_{\rm r}(T) \mid T \in \mathsf{SPIT}(\alpha)\}$ share identical descent distributions. Here, $\mathsf{SPIT}(\alpha)$ is the set of standard peak immaculate tableaux of shape $\alpha$, and $\mathrm{w}_{\rm c}$ and $\mathrm{w}_{\rm r}$ denote column reading and row reading, respectively. By combining this equidistribution with the algorithm developed by Allen, Hallam, and Mason, we demonstrate that the transition matrix from the basis of quasisymmetric Schur $Q$-functions to the basis of peak Young quasisymmetric Schur functions is upper triangular, with entries being non-negative integers. Furthermore, we provide explicit descriptions of the expansion of peak Young quasisymmetric Schur functions in specific cases, in terms of quasisymmetric Schur $Q$-functions. We also investigate the combinatorial properties of standard peak immaculate tableaux, standard Young composition tableaux, and standard peak Young composition tableaux. We provide a hook length formula for $\mathsf{SPIT}(\alpha)$ and show that standard Young composition tableaux and standard peak Young composition tableaux can be bijectively mapped to specific words in a familiar form. Especially, cases of compositions with rectangular shape are examined in detail.</description>

      <title>The largest subgraph without a forbidden induced subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the systematic study of the following Tur\'an-type question. Suppose $\Gamma$ is a graph with $n$ vertices such that the edge density between any pair of subsets of vertices of size at least $t$ is at most $1 - c$, for some $t$ and $c &gt; 0$. What is the largest number of edges in a subgraph $G \subseteq \Gamma$ which does not contain a fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph or, more generally, which belongs to a hereditary property $\mathcal{P}$? This provides a common generalization of two recently studied cases, namely $\Gamma$ being a (pseudo-)random graph and a graph without a large complete bipartite subgraph. We focus on the interesting case where $H$ is a bipartite graph.
  We determine the answer up to a constant factor with respect to $n$ and $t$, for certain bipartite $H$ and for $\Gamma$ either a dense random graph or a Paley graph with a square number of vertices. In particular, our bounds match if $H$ is a tree, or if one part of $H$ has $d$ vertices complete to the other part, all other vertices in that part have degree at most $d$, and the other part has sufficiently many vertices. As applications of the latter result, we answer a question of Alon, Krivelevich, and Samotij on the largest subgraph with a hereditary property which misses a bipartite graph, and determine up to a constant factor the largest number of edges in a string subgraph of $\Gamma$. The proofs are based on a variant of the dependent random choice and a novel approach for finding induced copies by inductively defining probability distributions supported on induced copies of smaller subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. The Four Color Theorem. Theory, methods, algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Four color problem is closely related to other branches of mathematics and practical applications. More than 20 of its reformulations are known, which connect this problem with problems of algebra, statistical mechanics and planning. And this is also typical for mathematics: the solution to a problem studied out of pure curiosity turns out to be useful in representing real objects and processes that are completely different in nature. Despite the published machine methods for combinatorial proof of the Four color conjecture, there is still no clear description of the mechanism for coloring a planar graph with four colors, its natural essence and its connection with the phenomenon of graph planarity. It is necessary not only to prove (preferably by deductive methods) that any planar graph can be colored with four colors, but also to show how to color it. The paper considers an approach based on the possibility of reducing a maximally flat graph to a regular flat cubic graph with its further coloring. Based on the Tate-Volynsky theorem, the vertices of a maximally flat graph can be colored with four colors, if the edges of its dual cubic graph can be colored with three colors. Considering the properties of a colored cubic graph, it can be shown that the addition of colors obeys the transformation laws of the fourth order Klein group. Using this property, it is possible to create algorithms for coloring planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Homological smoothness and Deligne resolution for tropical fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We say that a tropical fan is homologically smooth if each of its open subsets verify tropical Poincare duality. A tropical homology manifold is a tropical variety that is locally modelled by open subsets of homologically smooth tropical fans.
  We show that homological smoothness is a T-stable property in the category of tropical fans. This implies in particular that quasilinear fans are homologically smooth, and tropical varieties locally modelled by them are tropical homology manifolds. Previously, this was known only for locally matroidal tropical varieties.
  In order to show the above results, we prove a tropical analogue of the Deligne weight spectral sequence for homologically smooth tropical fans. This allows to describe the cohomology of tropical modifications, and will be of importance in our companion work which develops a Hodge theory in the tropical setting.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian measure of a convex body controls its maximal covering radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-studied vector balancing constant $\beta(U, V)$ of a pair of convex bodies $(U,V)$, is lower bounded by a lattice counterpart, $\alpha(U,V)$. In [BS97], Banaszczyk and Szarek proved that $\alpha(B_2^n, V)\leq c$ when $V$ has Gaussian measure at least $\frac{1}{2}$, and conjectured that, for centrally symmetric $V$, $\beta(B_2^n, V)$ is always bounded by a function of the Gaussian measure of $V$, independent of $n$. We resolve this conjecture in the affirmative. Moreover, we show that the analogous result holds for $\alpha(B_2^n, V)$ even without the central symmetry assumption.</description>

      <title>Blocking sets, minimal codes and trifferent codes</title>

Abstract: We prove new upper bounds on the smallest size of affine blocking sets, that is, sets of points in a finite affine space that intersect every affine subspace of a fixed codimension. We show an equivalence between affine blocking sets with respect to codimension-$2$ subspaces that are generated by taking a union of lines through the origin, and strong blocking sets in the corresponding projective space, which in turn are equivalent to minimal codes. Using this equivalence, we improve the current best upper bounds on the smallest size of a strong blocking set in finite projective spaces over fields of size at least $3$. Furthermore, using coding theoretic techniques, we improve the current best lower bounds on strong blocking set.
  Our main motivation for these new bounds is their application to trifferent codes, which are sets of ternary codes of length $n$ with the property that for any three distinct codewords there is a coordinate where they all have distinct values. Over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_3$, we prove that minimal codes are equivalent to linear trifferent codes. Using this equivalence, we show that any linear trifferent code of length $n$ has size at most $3^{n/4.55}$, improving the recent upper bound of Pohoata and Zakharov. Moreover, we show the existence of linear trifferent codes of length $n$ and size at least $\frac{1}{3}\left( 9/5 \right)^{n/4}$, thus (asymptotically) matching the best lower bound on trifferent codes.
  We also give explicit constructions of affine blocking sets with respect to codimension-$2$ subspaces that are a constant factor bigger than the best known lower bound. By restricting to~$\mathbb{F}_3$, we obtain linear trifferent codes of size at least $3^{23n/312}$, improving the current best explicit construction that has size $3^{n/112}$.</description>

      <title>An Alon-Tarsi Style Theorem for Additive Colorings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first give an alternative proof of the Alon-Tarsi list coloring theorem. We use the ideas from this proof to obtain the following result, which is an additive coloring analog of the Alon-Tarsi Theorem: Let $G$ be a graph and let $D$ be an orientation of $G$. We introduce a new digraph $\mathcal{W}(D)$, such that if the out-degree in $D$ of each vertex $v$ is $d_v$, and if the number of Eulerian subdigraphs of $\mathcal{W}(D)$ with an even number of edges differs from the number of Eulerian subdigraphs of $\mathcal{W}(D)$ with an odd number of edges, then for any assignment of lists $L(v)$ of $d_v+1$ positive integers to the vertices of $G$, there is an additive coloring of $G$ assigning to each vertex $v$ an element from $L(v)$. As an application, we prove an additive list coloring result for tripartite graphs $G$ such that one of the color classes of $G$ contains only vertices whose neighborhoods are complete.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic cycles in 2-edge-colored bipartite graphs with large minimum degree</title>

Abstract: For graphs $G_0$, $G_1$ and $G_2$, write $G_0\longmapsto(G_1, G_2)$ if each red-blue-edge-coloring of $G_0$ yields a red $G_1$ or a blue $G_2$. The Ramsey number $r(G_1, G_2)$ is the minimum number $n$ such that the complete graph $K_n\longmapsto(G_1, G_2)$. In [Discrete Math. 312(2012)], Schelp formulated the following question: for which graphs $H$ there is a constant $0&lt;c&lt;1$ such that for any graph $G$ of order at least $r(H, H)$ with $\delta(G)&gt;c|V(G)|$, $G\longmapsto(H, H)$. In this paper, we prove that for any $m&gt;n$, if $G$ is a balanced bipartite graph of order $2(m+n-1)$ with $\delta(G)&gt;\frac{3}{4}(m+n-1)$, then $G\longmapsto(CM_m, CM_n)$, where $CM_i$ is a matching with $i$ edges contained in a connected component. By Szem\'{e}redi's Regularity Lemma, using a similar idea as introduced by [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 75(1999)], we show that for every $\eta&gt;0$, there is an integer $N_0&gt;0$ such that for any $N&gt;N_0$ the following holds: Let $\alpha_1&gt;\alpha_2&gt;0$ such that $\alpha_1+\alpha_2=1$. Let $G[X, Y]$ be a balanced bipartite graph on $2(N-1)$ vertices with $\delta(G)\geq(\frac{3}{4}+3\eta)(N-1)$. Then for each red-blue-edge-coloring of $G$, either there exist red even cycles of each length in $\{4, 6, 8, \ldots, (2-3\eta^2)\alpha_1N\}$, or there exist blue even cycles of each length in $\{4, 6, 8, \ldots, (2-3\eta^2)\alpha_2N\}$. Furthermore, the bound $\delta(G)\geq(\frac{3}{4}+3\eta)(N-1)$ is asymptotically tight. Previous studies on Schelp's question on cycles are on diagonal case, we obtain an asymptotic result of Schelp's question for all non-diagonal cases.</description>

      <title>The squish map and the $\text{SL}_2$ double dimer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A plane partition, whose 3D Young diagram is made of unit cubes, can be approximated by a ``coarser" plane partition, made of cubes of side length 2. Indeed, there are two such approximations obtained by ``rounding up" or ``rounding down" to the nearest cube. We relate this coarsening (or downsampling) operation to the squish map introduced by the second author in earlier work. We exhibit a related measure-preserving map between the dimer model on the honeycomb graph, and the $\text{SL}_2$ double dimer model on a coarser honeycomb graph; we compute the most interesting special case of this map, related to plane partition $q$-enumeration with 2-periodic weights. As an application, we specialize the weights to be certain roots of unity, obtain novel generating functions (some known, some new, and some conjectural) that $(-1)$-enumerate certain classes of pairs of plane partitions according to how their dimer configurations interact.</description>

      <title>From Trees to Polynomials and Back Again: New Capacity Bounds with Applications to TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give simply exponential lower bounds on the probabilities of a given strongly Rayleigh distribution, depending only on its expectation. This resolves a weak version of a problem left open by Karlin-Klein-Oveis Gharan in their recent breakthrough work on metric TSP, and this resolution leads to a minor improvement of their approximation factor for metric TSP. Our results also allow for a more streamlined analysis of the algorithm.
  To achieve these new bounds, we build upon the work of Gurvits-Leake on the use of the productization technique for bounding the capacity of a real stable polynomial. This technique allows one to reduce certain inequalities for real stable polynomials to products of affine linear forms, which have an underlying matrix structure. In this paper, we push this technique further by characterizing the worst-case polynomials via bipartitioned forests. This rigid combinatorial structure yields a clean induction argument, which implies our stronger bounds.
  In general, we believe the results of this paper will lead to further improvement and simplification of the analysis of various combinatorial and probabilistic bounds and algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the decomposition of theta series for lattice cosets of ternary lattices. We show that the natural decomposition into an Eisenstein series, a unary theta function, and a cuspidal form which is orthogonal to unary theta functions correspond to the theta series for the genus, the deficiency of the theta series for the spinor genus from that of the genus, and the deficiency of the theta series for the class from that of the spinor genus, respectively. These three pieces are hence invariants of the genus, spinor genus, and class, respectively, extending known results for lattices and verifying a conjecture of the first author and Haensch. We furthermore extend the definition of $p$-neighbors to include lattice cosets and construct an algorithm to compute respresentatives for the classes in the genus or spinor genus via the $p$-neighborhoods.</description>

      <title>M\"obius function of the subgroup lattice of a finite group and Euler Characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The M\"obius function of the subgroup lattice of a finite group has been introduced by Hall and applied to investigate several questions. In this paper, we consider the M\"obius function defined on an order ideal related to the lattice of the subgroups of an irreducible subgroup $G$ of the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}(n,q)$ acting on the $n$-dimensional vector space $V=\mathbb{F}_q^n$, where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is the finite field with $q$ elements. We find a relation between this function and the Euler characteristic of two simplicial complexes $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$, the former raising from the lattice of the subspaces of $V$, the latter from the subgroup lattice of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce new combinatorial objects called $d$--fold partition diamonds, which generalize both the classical partition function and the partition diamonds of Andrews, Paule and Riese, and we set $r_d(n)$ to be their counting function. We also consider the Schmidt type $d$--fold partition diamonds, which have counting function $s_d(n).$ Using partition analysis, we then find the generating function for both, and connect the generating functions $\sum_{n= 0}^\infty s_d(n)q^n$ to Eulerian polynomials. This allows us to develop elementary proofs of infinitely many Ramanujan--like congruences satisfied by $s_d(n)$ for various values of $d$, including the following family: for all $d\geq 1$ and all $n\geq 0,$ $s_d(2n+1) \equiv 0 \pmod{2^d}.$</description>

Abstract: A parking function on $[n]$ creates a permutation in $S_n$ via the order in which the $n$ cars appear in the $n$ parking spaces. Placing the uniform probability measure on the set of parking functions on $[n]$ induces a probability measure on $S_n$. We initiate a study of some properties of this distribution.</description>
