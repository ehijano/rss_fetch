      <title>Stability of difference equations with interspecific density dependence, competition, and maturation delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general system of difference equations is presented for multispecies communities with density dependent population growth and delayed maturity. Interspecific competition, mutualism, predation, commensalism, and amensalism are accommodated. A sufficient condition for the local asymptotic stability of a coexistence equilibrium in this system is then proven. Using this system, the generalisation of the Beverton-Holt and Leslie-Gower models of competition to multispecies systems with possible maturation delays is presented and shown to yield interesting stability properties. The stability of coexistence depends on the relative abundances of the species at the unique interior equilibrium. A sufficient condition for local stability is derived that only requires intraspecific competition to outweigh interspecific competition. The condition does not depend on maturation delays. The derived stability properties are used to develop a novel estimation approach for the coefficients of interspecific competition. This approach finds an optimal configuration given the conjecture that coexisting species strive to outcompete competitors and are most likely observed near the stable interior equilibrium with the greatest dampening of perturbations. The optimal solution is compared to estimates of niche overlap using an empirical example of malaria mosquito vectors with delayed maturity in the Anopheles gambiae sensu lato species complex.</description>

      <title>Emergence of ecological structure and species rarity from fluctuating metabolic strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ecosystems often demonstrate the coexistence of numerous species competing for limited resources, with pronounced rarity and abundance patterns. A potential driver of such coexistence is environmental fluctuations that favor different species over time. However, how to include and treat such temporal variability in existing consumer-resource models is still an open problem. In this study, we examine the role of correlated temporal fluctuations in metabolic strategies within a stochastic consumer-resource framework, reflecting change of species behavior in response to the environment. In some conditions, we are able to solve analytically the species abundance distributions, through path integral formalism. Our results reveal that stochastic dynamic metabolic strategies induce community structures that align more closely with empirical ecological observations and contribute to the violation of the Competitive Exclusion Principle (CEP). The degree of CEP violation is maximized under intermediate competition strength, leading to an intermediate competition hypothesis. Furthermore, when non-neutral effects are present, maximal biodiversity is achieved for intermediate values of the amplitude of fluctuations. This work not only challenges traditional ecological paradigms, but also establishes a robust theoretical framework for exploring how temporal dynamics and stochasticity drive biodiversity and community.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation with Q-learning: the impact of information perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of human beings manifests in a remarkable diversity of responses to intricate environments, enabling us to approach problems from varied perspectives. However, in the study of cooperation, existing research within the reinforcement learning framework often assumes that individuals have access to identical information when making decisions, which contrasts with the reality that individuals frequently perceive information differently. In this study, we employ the Q-learning algorithm to explore the impact of information perception on the evolution of cooperation in a two-person Prisoner's Dilemma game. We demonstrate that the evolutionary processes differ significantly across three distinct information perception scenarios, highlighting the critical role of information structure in the emergence of cooperation. Notably, the asymmetric information scenario reveals a complex dynamical process, including the emergence, breakdown, and reconstruction of cooperation, mirroring psychological shifts observed in human behavior. Our findings underscore the importance of information structure in fostering cooperation, offering new insights into the establishment of stable cooperative relationships among humans.</description>

      <title>Bioenergetic trophic trade-offs determine mass-dependent extinction thresholds across the Cenozoic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Body size drives the energetic demands of organisms, constraining trophic interactions between species and playing a significant role in shaping the feasibility of species' populations in a community. On macroevolutionary timescales, these demands feed back to shape the selective landscape driving the evolution of body size and diet. We develop a theoretical framework for a three-level trophic food chain -- typical for terrestrial mammalian ecosystems -- premised on bioenergetic trade-offs to explore mammalian population dynamics. Our results show that interactions between predators, prey, and external subsidies generate instabilities linked to body size extrema, corresponding to observed limits of predator size and diet. These instabilities generate size-dependent constraints on coexistence and highlight a feasibility range for carnivore size between 40 to 110 kg, encompassing the mean body size of terrestrial Cenozoic hypercarnivores. Finally, we show that predator dietary generalization confers a selective advantage to larger carnivores, which then declines at megapredator body sizes, aligning with diet breadth estimates for contemporary and Pleistocene species. Our framework underscores the importance of understanding macroevolutionary constraints through the lens of ecological pressures, where the selective forces shaping and reshaping the dynamics of communities can be explored.</description>

      <title>Rate-induced biosphere collapse in the Daisyworld model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is much interest in the phenomenon of rate-induced tipping, where a system changes abruptly when forcings change faster than some critical rate. Here, we demonstrate and analyse rate-induced tipping in the classic "Daisyworld" model. The Daisyworld model considers a hypothetical planet inhabited only by two species of daisies with different reflectivities, and is notable because the daisies lead to an emergent "regulation" of the planet's temperature. The model serves as a useful thought experiment regarding the co-evolution of life and the global environment, and has been widely used in the teaching of Earth system science.
  We show that sufficiently fast changes in insolation (i.e. incoming sunlight) can cause life on Daisyworld to go extinct, even if life could in principle survive at any fixed insolation value among those encountered. Mathematically, this occurs due to the fact that the solution of the forced (nonautonomous) system crosses the stable manifold of a saddle point for the frozen (autonomous) system. The new discovery of rate-induced tipping in such a classic, simple, and well-studied model provides further supporting evidence that rate-induced tipping -- and indeed, rate-induced collapse -- may be common in a wide range of systems.</description>
