      <title>KKL theorem for the influence of a set of variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the notion of the influence of a set of variables on a Boolean function, which was recently introduced by Tal. We show that for an arbitrary fixed $d$, every Boolean function $f$ on $n$ variables admits a $d$-set of influence at least $\frac{1}{10} \mathbf{W}^{\geq d}(f) (\frac{\log n}{n})^d$, which is a direct generalisation of the Kahn-Kalai-Linial theorem. We give an example demonstrating essential sharpness of this result. Further, we generalise a related theorem of Oleszkiewicz regarding influences of pairs of variables.</description>

      <title>Circular-arc graphs and the Helly property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate some problems related to the Helly properties of circular-arc graphs, which are defined as intersection graphs of arcs of a fixed circle. As such, circular-arc graphs are among the simplest classes of intersection graphs whose models might not satisfy the Helly property. In particular, some cliques of a circular-arc graph might be Helly in some but not all arc intersection models of the graph.
  Our first result is an alternative proof of a theorem by Lin and Szwarcfiter which asserts that for every circular-arc graph $G$ either every normalized model of $G$ satisfies the Helly property or no normalized model of $G$ satisfies this property.
  Further, we study the Helly properties of a single clique of a circular-arc graph $G$. We divide the cliques of $G$ into three types: a clique $C$ of $G$ is always-Helly/always-non-Helly/ambiguous if $C$ is Helly in every/no/(some but not all) normalized model of $G$. We provide a combinatorial description for the cliques of each type, and based on it, we devise a polynomial time algorithm which determines the type of a given clique.
  Finally, we study the Helly Cliques problem, in which we are given an $n$-vertex circular-arc graph $G$ and some of its cliques $C_1, \ldots, C_k$ and we ask if there is an arc intersection model of $G$ in which all the cliques $C_1, \ldots, C_k$ satisfy the Helly property. We show that:
  (1) the Helly Cliques problem admits a $2^{O(k\log{k})}n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm (that is, it is FPT when parametrized by the number of cliques given in the input),
  (2) assuming Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), the Helly Cliques problem cannot be solved in time $2^{o(k)}n^{O(1)}$,
  (3) the Helly Cliques problem admits a polynomial kernel of size $O(k^6)$.
  All our results use a data structure, called a PQM-tree, which maintains all normalized models of a circular-arc graph $G$.</description>

      <title>Larger Nearly Orthogonal Sets over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d$ and $k$, a set ${\cal A} \subseteq \mathbb{F}^d$ is called $k$-nearly orthogonal if its members are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ vectors of ${\cal A}$ include an orthogonal pair. We prove that for every prime $p$ there exists some $\delta = \delta(p)&gt;0$, such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $k \geq 2$ and $d \geq k$, there exists a $k$-nearly orthogonal set of at least $d^{\delta \cdot k/\log k}$ vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$. The size of the set is optimal up to the $\log k$ term in the exponent. We further prove two extensions of this result. In the first, we provide a large set ${\cal A}$ of non-self-orthogonal vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$ such that for every two subsets of ${\cal A}$ of size $k+1$ each, some vector of one of the subsets is orthogonal to some vector of the other. In the second extension, every $k+1$ vectors of the produced set ${\cal A}$ include $\ell+1$ pairwise orthogonal vectors for an arbitrary fixed integer $1 \leq \ell \leq k$. The proofs involve probabilistic and spectral arguments and the hypergraph container method.</description>

      <title>From geometry to generating functions: rectangulations and permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We enumerate several classes of pattern-avoiding rectangulations. We establish new bijective links with pattern-avoiding permutations, prove that their generating functions are algebraic, and confirm several conjectures by Merino and M\"utze. We also analyze a new class of rectangulations, called whirls, using a generating tree.</description>

      <title>Placing Green Bridges Optimally, with a Multivariate Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.04539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of placing wildlife crossings, such as green bridges, over human-made obstacles to challenge habitat fragmentation. The main task herein is, given a graph describing habitats or routes of wildlife animals and possibilities of building green bridges, to find a low-cost placement of green bridges that connects the habitats. We develop different problem models for this task and study them from a computational complexity and parameterized algorithmics perspective.</description>

      <title>Variant Codes Based on A Special Polynomial Ring and Their Fast Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary array codes are widely used in storage systems to prevent data loss, such as the Redundant Array of Independent Disks~(RAID). Most designs for such codes, such as Blaum-Roth~(BR) codes and Independent-Parity~(IP) codes, are carried out on the polynomial ring F_2[x]/&lt;\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}x^i &gt;, where F_2 is a binary field, and p is a prime number. In this paper, we consider the polynomial ring F_2[x]/&lt;\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}x^{i\tau}&gt;, where p&gt;1 is an odd number and \tau \geq 1 is any power of two, and explore variant codes from codes over this polynomial ring. Particularly, the variant codes are derived by mapping parity-check matrices over the polynomial ring to binary parity-check matrices.
  Specifically, we first propose two classes of variant codes, termed V-ETBR and V-ESIP codes. To make these variant codes binary maximum distance separable~(MDS) array codes that achieve optimal storage efficiency, this paper then derives the connections between them and their counterparts over polynomial rings. These connections are general, making it easy to construct variant MDS array codes from various forms of matrices over polynomial rings. Subsequently, some instances are explicitly constructed based on Cauchy and Vandermonde matrices. In the proposed constructions, both V-ETBR and V-ESIP MDS array codes can have any number of parity columns and have the total number of data columns of exponential order with respect to $p$. In terms of computation, two fast syndrome computations are proposed for the Vandermonde-based V-ETBR and V-ESIP MDS array codes, both meeting the lowest known asymptotic complexity among MDS codes. Due to the fact that all variant codes are constructed from parity-check matrices over simple binary fields instead of polynomial rings, they are attractive in practice.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Approach to the Longest Path Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Longest Path Problem is a question of finding the maximum length between pairs of vertices of a graph. In the general case, the problem is NP-hard. However, there is a small collection of graph classes for which there exists an efficient solution. Current approaches involve either approximation or computational enumeration. For Tree-like classes of graphs, there are approximation and enumeration algorithms which solves the problem efficiently. We propose a new method of approaching the longest path problem with algebraic operations and conditions that exactly identify and or approximate the solution in polynomial time. We next introduce a 'booleanize' mapping on the adjacency matrix of a graph which we prove identifies the solution for trees, uniform block graphs, block graphs, and directed acyclic graphs, with approached conditions. Finally, we display the algorithms to find the solution, in addition to algorithms that generate all the longest paths.</description>
