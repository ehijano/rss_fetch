      <title>Scaling of many-body localization transitions: Quantum dynamics in Fock space and real space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body-localization (MBL) transitions are studied in a family of single-spin-flip spin-$\frac12$ models, including the one-dimensional (1D) chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, the quantum dot (QD) model with all-to-all pair interactions, and the quantum random energy model (QREM). We investigate the generalized imbalance that characterizes propagation in Fock space out of an initial basis state and, at the same time, can be efficiently probed by real-space measurements. For all models considered, the average imbalance and its quantum and mesoscopic fluctuations provide excellent indicators for the position of the MBL transition $W_c(n)$, where $n$ is the number of spins. Combining these findings with earlier results on level statistics, we determine phase diagrams of the MBL transitions in the $n$-$W$ plane. Our results provide evidence for a direct transition between the ergodic and MBL phases for each of the models, without any intermediate phase. For QREM and QD model, $W_c(n)$ grows as a power law of $n$ (with logarithmic corrections), in agreement with analytical predictions $W_c^{\rm QREM}(n) \sim n^{1/2} \ln n$ and $W_c^{\rm QD}(n) \gtrsim n^{3/4} \ln^{1/2} n$. This growth is in stark contrast to the 1D model, where $W_c(n)$ is essentially independent of $n$, consistent with the analytic expectation $W_c^{\rm 1D}(n\to \infty)= {\rm const}$. We also determine the scaling of the transition width $\Delta W (n) / W_c(n)$ and estimate the system size $n$ needed to study the asymptotic scaling behavior. While these values of $n$ are not accessible to exact simulations on a classical computer, they are within the reach of quantum simulators. Our results indicate feasibility of experimental studies of $n$-$W$ phase diagrams and scaling properties of MBL transitions in models of 1D and QD type and in their extensions to other spatial geometry or distance-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>Sampling through Algorithmic Diffusion in non-convex Perceptron problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of sampling from the solution space of simple yet non-convex neural network models by employing a denoising diffusion process known as Algorithmic Stochastic Localization, where the score function is provided by Approximate Message Passing. We introduce a formalism based on the replica method to characterize the process in the infinite-size limit in terms of a few order parameters, and, in particular, we provide criteria for the feasibility of sampling.
  We show that, in the case of the spherical perceptron problem with negative stability, approximate uniform sampling is achievable across the entire replica symmetric region of the phase diagram. In contrast, for the binary perceptron, uniform sampling via diffusion invariably fails due to the overlap gap property exhibited by the typical set of solutions. We discuss the first steps in defining alternative measures that can be efficiently sampled.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of the Anderson Transition on Small-World Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Anderson transition on random graphs draws interest through its resemblance to the many-body localization (MBL) transition with similarly debated properties. In this Letter, we construct a unitary Anderson model on Small-World graphs to characterize long time and large size wave-packet dynamics across the Anderson transition. We reveal the logarithmically slow non-ergodic dynamics in the critical regime, confirming recent random matrix predictions. Our data clearly indicate two localization times: an average localization time that diverges, while the typical one saturates. In the delocalized regime, the dynamics are initially non-ergodic but cross over to ergodic diffusion at long times and large distances. Finite-time scaling then allows us to characterize the critical dynamical properties: the logarithm of the average localization time diverges algebraically, while the ergodic time diverges exponentially. Our results could be used to clarify the dynamical properties of MBL and could guide future experiments with quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the square lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ans\"{a}tze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (SLAHM), where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions can be used to accurately study quantum many-body physics in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Percolation thresholds and connectivity in quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study entanglement percolation in qubit-based planar quantum network models of arbitrary topology, where neighboring nodes are initially connected by pure states with quenched disorder in their entanglement. To address this, we develop a physics-informed heuristic algorithm designed to find a sequence of entanglement swapping and distillation operations to connect any pair of distant nodes. The algorithm combines locally optimal percolation strategies between nodes at a maximum distance of one swapping operation. If this fails to produce a maximally entangled state, it looks for alternative paths surrounding intermediate states within the process. We analytically find and numerically verify thresholds in quantum percolation, which depend on the initial network configuration and entanglement, and are associated with specific percolation strategies. We classify these strategies based on the connectivity, a quantity that relates the entanglement in the final state and the level of integrity of the network at the end of the process. We find distinct regimes of quantum percolation, which are clearly separated by the percolation thresholds of the employed strategies and vastly vary according to the network topology.</description>

      <title>Training and re-training liquid crystal elastomer metamaterials for pluripotent functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training has emerged as a promising materials design technique in which function can be acheived through repeated physical modification of an existing material rather than by direct chemical functionalization, cutting or reprocessing. This work investigates both the ability to train for function and then to erase that function on-demand in macroscopic metamaterials made from liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs). We first show that the Poisson's ratio of these disordered arrays can be tuned via directed aging to induce an auxetic response. We then show that the arrays can be reset and re-trained for another local mechanical function, allostery, thus demonstrating pluripotent functionality.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Fermi-liquid behavior by interactions in disordered metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of electron-electron and electron-disorder scattering in correlated Fermi liquids by the disordered Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory with an IPT-CPA solver. We find significant violations of Matthiessen's rule (additivity of scattering mechanisms) which we explain in terms of the screening of the disorder potential by interactions, leading to a protection of the electron-electron inelastic scattering rate against disorder. We also show that large disorder can lead to a surprising enhancement of the electron-electron scattering that contrasts with the competition seen in the elastic channel. Our results compare positively with available resistivity data in the disordered Fermi liquid phase of the correlated organic metals $\kappa$-(ET)$_{2}$X, and rationalize the strong sample dependence of the $T^2$ coefficients observed in the resistivity of correlated perovskite oxides such as SrVO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Additional jamming transition in 2D bidisperse granular packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a jamming diagram for 2D bidisperse granular systems, capturing two distinct jamming transitions. The first occurs as large particles form a jammed structure, while the second, emerging at a critical small-particle concentration, $X_{\mathrm{S}}^{*} \approx 0.21$, and size ratio, $\delta^{*} \approx 0.25$, involves small particles jamming into the voids of the existing large-particle structure upon further compression. Below this threshold, small particles fill voids within the large-particle network, increasing packing density. Beyond this point, excess small particles disrupt efficient packing, resulting in looser structures. The alignment of these findings with 3D results suggests a general geometric mechanism governing the second jamming transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How a closed system thermalizes, especially in the absence of global conservation laws but in the presence of disorder and interactions, is one of the central questions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We explore this for a disordered, periodically driven Ising chain. Our numerical results reveal inhomogeneous thermalization leading to a distribution of thermalization timescales within a single disordered sample, which we encode via a distribution of effective local temperatures. Using this, we find an excellent collapse $\textit{without}$ $\textit{any}$ $\textit{fitting}$ $\textit{parameters}$ of the local relaxation dynamics for the entire range of disorder values in the ergodic regime when adapting the disorder-averaged diagonal entanglement entropy as internal `time' of the system. This approach evidences a remarkably uniform parametrization of the dynamical many-body evolution of local temperature within the otherwise highly heterogeneous ergodic regime, independent of the strength of the disorder.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anderson localization describes disorder-induced phase transitions, distinguishing between localized and extended states. In quasiperiodic systems, a third multifractal state emerges, characterized by unique energy and wave functions. However, critical indicators for differentiating these states, such as Lyapunov exponents (LEs) and inverse participation ratios (IPRs), have yet to be experimentally detected. To address these challenges, we introduce exactly solvable one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with flat bands, analytically determining phase boundaries using Avila's global theorem. We propose experimental realizations using Rydberg atom arrays, enabling the distinction of localized, extended, and multifractal states with as few as 18 qubits. Importantly, we develop a robust spectroscopic method for the experimental measurement of LEs and IPRs. Our work opens new avenues for the experimental exploration of Anderson localization and multifractal states in artificial quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Superspin Renormalization and Slow Relaxation in Random Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an excited-state real-space renormalization group (RSRG-X) formalism to describe the dynamics of conserved densities in randomly interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems. Our formalism is suitable for systems with $\textrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and we apply it to chains of randomly positioned spins with dipolar $XX+YY$ interactions, as arise in Rydberg quantum simulators and other platforms. The formalism generates a sequence of effective Hamiltonians which provide approximate descriptions for dynamics on successively smaller energy scales. These effective Hamiltonians involve ``superspins'': two-level collective degrees of freedom constructed from (anti)aligned microscopic spins. Conserved densities can then be understood as relaxing via coherent collective spin flips. For the well-studied simpler case of randomly interacting nearest-neighbor $XX+YY$ chains, the superspins reduce to single spins. Our formalism also leads to a numerical method capable of simulating the dynamics up to an otherwise inaccessible combination of large system size and late time. Focusing on disorder-averaged infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, in particular the local spin survival probability $\overline{S_p}(t)$, we demonstrate quantitative agreement in results between our algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) at low but nonzero frequencies. Such agreement holds for chains with nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and long-range dipolar interactions. Our results indicate decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$ slower than any power law and feature no significant deviation from the $\sim 1/ \log^2(t)$ asymptote expected from the infinite-randomness fixed-point of the nearest-neighbor model. We also apply the RSRG-X formalism to two-dimensional long-range systems of moderate size and find slow late-time decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$.</description>

      <title>Local geometry of NAE-SAT solutions in the condensation regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local behavior of typical solutions of random constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) describes many important phenomena including clustering thresholds, decay of correlations, and the behavior of message passing algorithms. When the constraint density is low, studying the planted model is a powerful technique for determining this local behavior which in many examples has a simple Markovian structure. The work of Coja-Oghlan, Kapetanopoulos, M\"{u}ller (2020) showed that for a wide class of models, this description applies up to the so-called condensation threshold.
  Understanding the local behavior after the condensation threshold is more complex due to long-range correlations. In this work, we revisit the random regular NAE-SAT model in the condensation regime and determine the local weak limit which describes a random solution around a typical variable. This limit exhibits a complicated non-Markovian structure arising from the space of solutions being dominated by a small number of large clusters. This is the first description of the local weak limit in the condensation regime for any sparse random CSPs in the one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) class. Our result is non-asymptotic, and characterizes the tight fluctuation $O(n^{-1/2})$ around the limit. Our proof is based on coupling the local neighborhoods of an infinite spin system, which encodes the structure of the clusters, to a broadcast model on trees whose channel is given by the 1RSB belief-propagation fixed point. We believe that our proof technique has broad applicability to random CSPs in the 1RSB class.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetization from interface reflections in a conductor with charge current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11979v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that a high-quality flat interface or boundary can serve as a long-range skew scatterer for charged quasiparticles in a metal. When an electric current flows parallel to the interface, the balance between clockwise and counterclockwise reflections is disrupted, leading to a net orbital magnetization. This magnetization is maximized at the interface and varies linearly in the direction perpendicular to it. We suggest that this effect can be detected using spatially resolved Kerr effect measurements at distances up to the electron phase coherence length from the interface. Unlike the orbital Hall and orbital Edelstein effects, the proposed phenomenon does not require inversion symmetry breaking in the bulk of the sample and is unrelated to Hall effect physics.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-induced effective coupling in SYK chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum chains have recently been considered in the context of developing novel discrete realizations of holographic dualities. To advance this programme, we explore the ground states of infinite chains with large number $N$ of Majorana fermions on each site, which interact via on-site $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) couplings, as well as via additional inhomogeneous hopping terms between nearest-neighbour sites. The hopping parameters are either aperiodically or randomly distributed. Our approach unifies techniques to solve SYK-like models in the large $N$ limit with a real-space renormalization group method known as strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG). We show that the SDRG decimation of SYK dots linked by a strong hopping induces an effective hopping interaction between their neighbouring sites. If two decimated sites are nearest neighbours, in the large $q$ limit their local ground states admit a holographic dual description in terms of eternal traversable wormholes. At the end of the SDRG procedure, we obtain a factorised ground state of the infinite inhomogeneous SYK chains that we consider, which has a spacetime description involving a sequence of wormholes. This amounts to a local near-boundary description of the bulk geometry in the context of discrete holography.</description>
