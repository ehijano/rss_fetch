      <title>Slow neutrons in Palermo: a forgotten conference by Enrico Fermi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16928v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On October 22, 1934, in a famous experiment, Enrico Fermi and his colleagues discovered that a significant increase in induced radioactivity can be obtained when neutrons are slowed down by means of hydrogen atoms. This discovery and its explanation earned him the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics. One year later, on October 1935, Fermi held a public speech in Palermo, Italy, presenting his findings at the 24th congress of the Italian Society for the Progress of Sciences. The transcription of his speech, entitled "Recenti risultati della radioattivit\`a artificiale" (Recent Results in Artificial Radioactivity), was soon published in Italy. The published text is one of the very first articles in which Fermi describes the success of the Via Panisperna boys and how he came to discover that hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. Unfortunately, the content of the original Italian speech has never been republished since and was forgotten. Similarly, a translation published internally by the US Atomic Energy Commission is not publicly available and is probably lost. In this work, we include the transcription of the original article in Italian, and we also propose an English translation to make the text available worldwide to a broader public.</description>

      <title>A not-too-simple solution to Goodman's new riddle of induction in the age of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review the works of G\"ardenfors (1990) and Scorzato (2013) and show that their combination provides an elegant solution of Goodman's new riddle of induction. The solution is based on two main ideas: (1) clarifying what is expected from a solution: understanding that philosophy of science is a science itself, with the same limitations and strengths as other scientific disciplines; (2) understanding that the concept of complexity of a model's assumptions and the concept of direct measurements must be characterized together. Although both measurements and complexity have been the subject of a vast literature, within the philosophy of science, essentially no other attempt has been made to combine them. The widespread expectation, among modern philosophers, that Goodman's new riddle cannot be solved is not defensible without a serious exploration of such a natural approach. A clarification of this riddle has always been very important, but it has become even more crucial in the age of AI.</description>
