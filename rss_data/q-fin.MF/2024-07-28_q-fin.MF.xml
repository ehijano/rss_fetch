      <title>Set risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of set risk measures (SRMs), which are real-valued maps defined on the space of all non-empty, closed, and bounded sets of almost surely bounded random variables. Traditional risk measures typically operate on spaces of random variables, but SRMs extend this framework to sets of random variables. We establish an axiom scheme for SRMs, similar to classical risk measures but adapted for set operations. The main technical contribution is an axiomatic dual representation of convex SRMs by using regular, finitely additive measures on the unit ball of the dual space of essentially bounded random variables. We explore worst-case SRMs, which evaluate risk as the supremum of individual risks within a set, and provide a collection of examples illustrating the applicability of our framework to systemic risk, portfolio optimization, and decision-making under uncertainty. This work extends the theory of risk measures to a more general and flexible setup, accommodating a broader range of financial and mathematical applications.</description>

      <title>The Gradient Flow of the Bass Functional in Martingale Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $\mu$ and $\nu$, probability measures on $\mathbb R^d$ in convex order, a Bass martingale is arguably the most natural martingale starting with law $\mu$ and finishing with law $\nu$. Indeed, this martingale is obtained by stretching a reference Brownian motion so as to meet the data $\mu,\nu$. Unless $\mu$ is a Dirac, the existence of a Bass martingale is a delicate subject, since for instance the reference Brownian motion must be allowed to have a non-trivial initial distribution $\alpha$, not known in advance. Thus the key to obtaining the Bass martingale, theoretically as well as practically, lies in finding $\alpha$.
  In \cite{BaSchTsch23} it has been shown that $\alpha$ is determined as the minimizer of the so-called Bass functional. In the present paper we propose to minimize this functional by following its gradient flow, or more precisely, the gradient flow of its $L^2$-lift. In our main result we show that this gradient flow converges in norm to a minimizer of the Bass functional, and when $d=1$ we further establish that convergence is exponentially fast.</description>
