      <title>Non-Discriminatory Personalized Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monopolist offers personalized prices to consumers with unit demand, heterogeneous values, and idiosyncratic costs, who differ in a protected characteristic, such as race or gender. The seller is subject to a non-discrimination constraint: consumers with the same cost, but different characteristics must face identical prices. Such constraints arise in regulated markets like credit or insurance. The setting reduces to an optimal transport, and we characterize the optimal pricing rule. Under this rule, consumers may retain surplus, and either group may benefit. Strengthening the constraint to cover transaction prices redistributes surplus, harming the low-value group and benefiting the high-value group.</description>

      <title>Optimal risk sharing, equilibria, and welfare with empirically realistic risk attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03328v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines optimal risk sharing for empirically realistic risk attitudes, providing results on Pareto optimality, competitive equilibria, utility frontiers, and the first and second theorems of welfare. Empirical studies suggest, contrary to classical assumptions, that risk seeking is prevalent in particular subdomains, and is even the majority finding for losses, underlying for instance the disposition effect. We first analyze cases of expected utility agents, some of whom may be risk seeking. Yet more empirical realism is obtained by allowing agents to be risk averse in some subdomains but risk seeking in others, which requires generalizing expected utility. Here we provide first results, pleading for future research. Our main new tool for analyzing generalized risk attitudes is a counter-monotonic improvement theorem.</description>

      <title>Markets with Heterogeneous Agents: Dynamics and Survival of Bayesian vs. No-Regret Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of heterogeneous learning agents in asset markets with stochastic payoffs. Our main focus is on comparing Bayesian learners and no-regret learners who compete in markets and identifying the conditions under which each approach is more effective. Surprisingly, we find that low regret is not sufficient for survival: an agent can have regret as low as $O(\log T)$ but still vanish when competing against a Bayesian with a finite prior and any positive prior probability on the correct model. On the other hand, we show that Bayesian learning is fragile, while no-regret learning requires less knowledge of the environment and is therefore more robust. Motivated by the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose a balanced strategy for utilizing Bayesian updates that improves robustness and adaptability to distribution shifts, providing a step toward a best-of-both-worlds learning approach. The method is general, efficient, and easy to implement. Finally, we formally establish the relationship between the notions of survival and market dominance studied in economics and the framework of regret minimization, thus bridging these theories. More broadly, our work contributes to the understanding of dynamics with heterogeneous types of learning agents and their impact on markets.</description>
