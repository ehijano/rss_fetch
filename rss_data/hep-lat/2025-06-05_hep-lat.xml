      <title>The Infrared Phase of QCD and Anderson Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When Anderson localization entered the QCD landscape, it was almost immediately thought about in connection with thermal phases, namely as a factor in the chiral transition. However, recent developments revealed an additional structure that made Anderson-like features central to the genesis of the entirely new thermal phase: the IR phase. I will explain these developments.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Rotating Gluonic Matter at Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We write down an effective theory of the Polyakov loop to investigate the deconfinement phase transition of imaginary-rotating gluonic matter using the strong-coupling expansion. We find the strength of the nearest-neighbor Polyakov-loop interaction modified by the sum of contributions involving the chair-type loops along the temporal direction. Our results show that the deconfinement transition temperature increases with increasing imaginary angular velocity, which agrees with the predictions from the models and the high-temperature perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the reduced density matrix and entanglement entropies using autoregressive networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an application of autoregressive neural networks to Monte Carlo simulations of quantum spin chains using the correspondence with classical two-dimensional spin systems. We use a hierarchy of neural networks capable of estimating conditional probabilities of consecutive spins to evaluate elements of reduced density matrices directly. Using the Ising chain as an example, we calculate the continuum limit of the ground state's von Neumann and R\'enyi bipartite entanglement entropies of an interval built of up to 5 spins. We demonstrate that our architecture is able to estimate all the needed matrix elements with just a single training for a fixed time discretization and lattice volume. Our method can be applied to other types of spin chains, possibly with defects, as well as to estimating entanglement entropies of thermal states at non-zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase are ``kinematical'' singularities, which can be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we discuss the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. Finally, we elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Improving thermal state preparation of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with reinforcement learning on quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, known for its strong quantum correlations and chaotic behavior, serves as a key platform for quantum gravity studies. However, variationally preparing thermal states on near-term quantum processors for large systems ($N&gt;12$, where $N$ is the number of Majorana fermions) presents a significant challenge due to the rapid growth in the complexity of parameterized quantum circuits. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with convolutional neural networks, employing an iterative approach to optimize the quantum circuit and its parameters. The refinement process is guided by a composite reward signal derived from entropy and the expectation values of the SYK Hamiltonian. This approach reduces the number of CNOT gates by two orders of magnitude for systems $N\geq12$ compared to traditional methods like first-order Trotterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL framework in both noiseless and noisy quantum hardware environments, maintaining high accuracy in thermal state preparation. This work advances a scalable, RL-based framework with applications for quantum gravity studies and out-of-time-ordered thermal correlators computation in quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum hardware.

      <title>Exploring fully-heavy tetraquarks through the CGAN framework: Mass and width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully-heavy tetraquark states, $QQ\bar{Q}\bar{Q} (Q=c,b)$, have garnered significant attention both experimentally and theoretically, due to their unique properties and potential to provide new insights into Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this study, we employ Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to predict the masses and decay widths of fully-heavy tetraquarks. To deepen our understanding of heavy multiquark structures, we prepare datasets based on two distinct approaches and train the CGAN model using both. The CGAN framework allows us to capture the complex relationships between input features, such as quark content, quantum numbers, and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and output properties, including mass and decay width. Our predictions, based on the CGAN framework, are consistent with existing data. By combining fundamental knowledge of QCD with advanced machine learning techniques, this work represents a significant step forward in the theoretical understanding of fully-heavy tetraquark states. Our CGAN approach has the potential to become a strong contender for future studies in heavy tetraquark systems, complementing existing theoretical models to deliver more precise results. Additionally, our findings could assist in the search for fully-heavy tetraquark systems in future experiments.</description>

      <title>2d Cardy-Rabinovici model with the modified Villain lattice: Exact dualities and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cardy-Rabinovici model is a toy model of the lattice $U(1)$ gauge theories to study various oblique confinement states associated with the nonzero $\theta$ angles. We reformulate the $2$d version of this model using the modified Villain lattice formalism, and we establish the exact $\theta$ periodicity for the Witten effect and the strong-weak duality at the finite lattice spacings. We then study the phase structure of this model based on the duality, symmetry and anomaly, and the perturbative renormalization group.</description>
