      <title>Closed subcategories of quotient categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of closed subcategories in a quasi-scheme, i.e. a Grothendieck category $X$. The closed subcategories are the direct analogs of closed subschemes in the commutative case, in the sense that when $X$ is the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a quasi-projective scheme $S$, then the closed subschemes of $S$ correspond bijectively to the closed subcategories of $X$. Many interesting quasi-schemes, such as the noncommutative projective scheme Qgr-$B$ = Gr-$B$/Tors-$B$ associated to a graded algebra $B$, arise as quotient categories of simpler abelian categories. In this paper we will show how to describe the closed subcategories of any quotient category $X/Y$ in terms of closed subcategories of $X$ with special properties, when $X$ is a category with a set of compact projective generators.</description>

      <title>Constructing strictly sign regular matrices of all sizes and sign patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of strictly sign regular (SSR) matrices has been extensively studied by many authors over the past century, notably by Schoenberg, Motzkin, Gantmacher, and Krein. A classical result of Gantmacher-Krein assures the existence of SSR matrices for any dimension and sign pattern. In this article, we provide an algorithm to explicitly construct an SSR matrix of any given size and sign pattern. (We also provide in an Appendix, the Python code implementing our algorithm.) To develop this algorithm, we show that one can extend an SSR matrix by adding an extra row (column) to its border, resulting in a higher order SSR matrix. Furthermore, we show how inserting a suitable new row/column between any two successive rows/columns of an SSR matrix results in a matrix that remains SSR. We also establish analogous results for strictly sign regular $m \times n$ matrices of order $p$ for any $p \in [1, \min\{m,n\}]$.</description>

      <title>Puncturing Quantum Stabilizer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical coding theory contains several techniques to obtain new codes from other codes, including puncturing and shortening. For quantum codes, a form of puncturing is known, but its description is based on the code space rather than its generators. In this work, we generalize the puncturing procedure to allow more freedom in the choice of which coded states are kept and which are removed. We describe this puncturing by focusing on the stabilizer matrix containing the generators of the code. In this way, we are able to explicitly describe the stabilizer matrix of the punctured code given the stabilizer matrix of the original stabilizer code. The additional freedom in the procedure also opens up new ways to construct new codes from old, and we present several ways to utilize this for the search of codes with good or even optimal parameters. In particular, we use the construction to obtain codes whose parameters exceed the best previously known. Lastly, we generalize the proof of the Griesmer bound from the classical setting to stabilizer codes since the proof relies heavily on the puncturing technique.</description>

      <title>Refining Ky Fan's majorization relation with linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A separable version of Ky Fan's majorization relation is proven for a sum of two operators that are each a tensor product of two positive semi-definite operators. In order to prove it, upper bounds are established for the relevant largest eigenvalue sums in terms of the optimal values of certain linear programs. The objective function of these linear programs is the dual of the direct sum of the spectra of the summands. The feasible sets are bounded polyhedra determined by positive numbers, called alignment terms, that quantify the overlaps between pairs of largest eigenvalue spaces of the summands. By appealing to geometric considerations, tight upper bounds are established on the alignment terms of tensor products of positive semi-definite operators. As an application, the spin alignment conjecture in quantum information theory is affirmatively resolved to the 2-letter level. Consequently, the coherent information of platypus channels is additive to the 2-letter level.</description>

      <title>Interval Multiplicities of Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any persistence module $M$ over a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$, and any interval $I$ in $\mathbf{P}$, we give a formula of the multiplicity $d_M(V_I)$ of the interval module $V_I$ in the indecomposable decomposition of $M$ in terms of structure linear maps of the module $M$. This makes it possible to compute the maximal interval-decomposable direct summand of $M$, which gives us a way to decide whether $M$ is interval-decomposable or not. Moreover, the formula tells us essential morphisms of $\mathbf{P}$ that are necessary to compute the multiplicity $d_M(V_I)$. This suggests us some poset morphism $\zeta \colon Z \to \mathbf{P}$ such that the induced restriction functor $R \colon \operatorname{mod} \mathbf{P} \to \operatorname{mod} Z$ has the property that the multiplicity $d:= d_{R(M)}(R(V_I))$ is equal to $d_M(V_I)$. If $Z$ can be taken as a poset of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}$ as in the bipath case, then the calculation of the multiplicity $d$ can be done more efficiently, starting from the filtration level of topological spaces. Thus this even makes it unnecessary to compute the structure linear maps of $M$.</description>
