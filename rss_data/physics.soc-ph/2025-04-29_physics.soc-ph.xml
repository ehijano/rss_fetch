      <title>Rumor propagation on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid spread of information and rumors through social media platforms, especially in group settings, motivates the need for more sophisticated models of rumor propagation. Traditional pairwise models do not account for group interactions, a limitation that we address by proposing a higher-order rumor model based on hypergraphs. Our model incorporates a group-based annihilation mechanism, where a spreader becomes a stifler when the fraction of hyperedges aware of the rumor exceeds a threshold. Our model has two distinct subcritical behaviors: exponential and power-law decay, which can coexist depending on the heterogeneity of the hypergraph. Interestingly, our analysis reveals continuous phase transitions in both homogeneous and heterogeneous hypergraphs, challenging the idea that higher-order interactions lead to discontinuous transitions. Finally, we validate our model using empirical data from Telegram and email cascades, providing additional evidence that real-world rumor propagation tends to occur near criticality. These results open the door to a more detailed understanding of rumor dynamics in higher-order systems.</description>

      <title>Metric Similarity and Manifold Learning of Circular Dichroism Spectra of Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning analysis of circular dichroism spectra of globular proteins from the SP175 database, using the optimal transport-based $1$-Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{W}_1$ (with order $p=1$) and the manifold learning algorithm $t$-SNE. Our results demonstrate that $\mathcal{W}_1$ is consistent with both Euclidean and Manhattan metrics while exhibiting robustness to noise. On the other hand, $t$-SNE uncovers meaningful structure in the high-dimensional data. The clustering in the $t$-SNE embedding is primarily determined by proteins with distinct secondary structure compositions: one cluster predominantly contains $\beta$-rich proteins, while the other consists mainly of proteins with mixed $\alpha/\beta$ and $\alpha$-helical content.</description>

      <title>Identifying Central Nodes in Multiplex Networks by Embracing Layer-Specific Heterogeneity via DomiRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robustness and resilience of complex systems are crucial for maintaining functionality amid disruptions or intentional attacks. Many such systems can be modeled as networks, where identifying structurally central nodes is essential for assessing their robustness and susceptibility to failure. Traditional centrality metrics often face challenges in identifying structurally important nodes in networks exhibiting heterogeneity at the network scale, with multilayer networks being a prime example of such networks. These metrics typically fail to balance the trade-off between capturing local layer-specific structures and integrating global multiplex connectivity. In this study, we extend DomiRank centrality, a metric that has been shown to effectively assess nodal importance across diverse monoplex topologies, to multiplex networks. Our approach combines layer-specific DomiRank calculations with a global contextualization step, incorporating multiplex-wide DomiRank scores to combine rankings. Through synthetic and real-world network studies, we demonstrate that our generalized DomiRank framework significantly improves the identification of key nodes in highly heterogeneous multiplex networks. This work advances centrality-based robustness assessments by addressing the fundamental trade-off between layer adaptability and multiplex-wide coherence.</description>

      <title>The impact of COVID-19 on building energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buildings are responsible for a significant portion of global energy demand and GHG emissions. Using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus as a case study, we find that, similar to the baseline metabolism of biological organisms, large buildings are on average $25\%$ more energetically efficient per unit size than smaller buildings. This suggests that institutions can be perceived as super populations with buildings as units (organisms) following standard metabolic relationships. Importantly, the relative efficiency of larger buildings progressively increased to $34\%$ until 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a major shock, disrupting this trend and leading to a reversal to the expected $25\%$ baseline level. This suggests that energetic adaptations are contingent on relatively stable conditions.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of leadership and success in software development teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From science to industry, teamwork plays a crucial role in knowledge production and innovation. Most studies consider teams as static groups of individuals, thereby failing to capture how the micro-dynamics of collaborative processes and organizational changes determine team success. Here, we leverage fine-grained temporal data on software development teams from three software ecosystems -- Rust, JavaScript, and Python -- to gain insights into the dynamics of online collaborative projects. Our analysis reveals an uneven workload distribution in teams, with stronger heterogeneity correlated with higher success, and the early emergence of a lead developer carrying out the majority of work. Moreover, we find that a sizeable fraction of projects experience a change of lead developer, with such a transition being more likely in projects led by inexperienced users. Finally, we show that leadership change is associated with faster success growth. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the link between team evolution and success in collaborative processes.</description>

      <title>Near decomposability of complex networks based on Simon's theory of complexity architecture: conceptions, approaches and an application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on Simon's theory of complexity architecture, we investigate the near decomposability of complex networks, including network near decomposable hierarchy (NDH) and near decomposability in behavior and properties (NDBP): the related conceptions and approaches are given and illustrated with an example. Different from existing researches, we emphasize the network NDBP; and follow Simon's generation mechanism of complex things to find the network NDH; In addition, based on Simon's theory that most things in the real world are complex systems with the NDH; and the situation that the approach for analyzing the NDH of a simple room system in Simon's example requires that the system adjacency matrix be in the near block diagonal form, which is often not the case for the adjacency matrices of complex systems in the real world, we propose an approach for analyzing the NDH of complex networks (complex systems) by splitting network adjacency matrices, which is suitable for solving real-world problems faced rather than for scientific discovery. The near decomposability of complex networks, due to the advantages of network language, can provide a more convenient and effective way than the near decomposability of complex systems for understanding and dealing with the problems of complex things.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods to probe for spatial correlations in temporal networks and infer their topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face interaction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</description>

      <title>EpiClim: Weekly District-Wise all-India multi-epidemics Climate-Health Dataset for accelerated GeoHealth research</title>

Abstract: Climate change significantly impacts public health, driving the emergence and spread of epidemics. Climate health models are essential for assessing and predicting disease outbreaks influenced by climatic variables like temperature and precipitation. For instance, dengue and malaria correlate with temperature changes, while cholera is linked to precipitation anomalies. Advances in AI-enabled weather prediction (AI-NWP) have improved forecasting, but integrating climate models with health systems is hindered by the lack of comprehensive, granular health datasets. This study introduces EpiClim: India's Epidemic-Climate Dataset, the first weekly district-wise dataset for major epidemics in India from 2009 to the present, sourced from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP). The dataset, covering diseases like dengue, malaria, and acute-diarrheal disease, bridges the gap between climate and health data, enabling the integration of climate forecasts with epidemic prediction models. This work lays the foundation for coupling predictive climate health models with weather and climate models, advancing efforts to mitigate climate-induced public health crises.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Limits Shape Language Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical regularities in human language have fascinated researchers for decades, suggesting deep underlying principles governing its evolution and information structuring for efficient communication. While Zipf's Law describes the frequency-rank distribution of words, deviations from this pattern-particularly for less frequent words-challenge the notion of an entirely optimized communication system. Here, we present a theoretical framework that integrates concepts from information theory, network science, and adjacent possible to explain these deviations. We propose that language evolves through optimization processes constrained by the finite cognitive capacities of humans. This results in a dual structure within language: while frequent words form an optimized, highly navigable core, less frequent words reside in a suboptimal regime, requiring more complex combinations to convey meaning. Our findings reveal that Zipf's exponents' deviation to larger values-from 1 to 2-marks a transition from an optimal to a suboptimal state, dictated by cognitive limits. This transition imposes a fundamental limit on communication efficiency, where cognitive constraints lead to a reliance on combinations of words rather than the creation of new vocabulary to express an open-ended conceptual space. A simple model based on the adjacent possible remarkably aligns with the empirical frequency-rank distribution of words in a language. These insights have significant implications for natural language processing and the design of artificial linguistic models, offering new perspectives on optimizing human and machine communication.</description>

      <title>Extracting Participation in Collective Action from Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media play a key role in mobilizing collective action, holding the potential for studying the pathways that lead individuals to actively engage in addressing global challenges. However, quantitative research in this area has been limited by the absence of granular and large-scale ground truth about the level of participation in collective action among individual social media users. To address this limitation, we present a novel suite of text classifiers designed to identify expressions of participation in collective action from social media posts, in a topic-agnostic fashion. Grounded in the theoretical framework of social movement mobilization, our classification captures participation and categorizes it into four levels: recognizing collective issues, engaging in calls-to-action, expressing intention of action, and reporting active involvement. We constructed a labeled training dataset of Reddit comments through crowdsourcing, which we used to train BERT classifiers and fine-tune Llama3 models. Our findings show that smaller language models can reliably detect expressions of participation (weighted F1=0.71), and rival larger models in capturing nuanced levels of participation. By applying our methodology to Reddit, we illustrate its effectiveness as a robust tool for characterizing online communities in innovative ways compared to topic modeling, stance detection, and keyword-based methods. Our framework contributes to Computational Social Science research by providing a new source of reliable annotations useful for investigating the social dynamics of collective action.</description>
