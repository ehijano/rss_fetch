      <title>Token-Mol 1.0: Tokenized drug design with large language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant interests have recently risen in leveraging sequence-based large language models (LLMs) for drug design. However, most current applications of LLMs in drug discovery lack the ability to comprehend three-dimensional (3D) structures, thereby limiting their effectiveness in tasks that explicitly involve molecular conformations. In this study, we introduced Token-Mol, a token-only 3D drug design model. This model encodes all molecular information, including 2D and 3D structures, as well as molecular property data, into tokens, which transforms classification and regression tasks in drug discovery into probabilistic prediction problems, thereby enabling learning through a unified paradigm. Token-Mol is built on the transformer decoder architecture and trained using random causal masking techniques. Additionally, we proposed the Gaussian cross-entropy (GCE) loss function to overcome the challenges in regression tasks, significantly enhancing the capacity of LLMs to learn continuous numerical values. Through a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), Token-Mol achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing task-specific methods across various downstream tasks, including pocket-based molecular generation, conformation generation, and molecular property prediction. Compared to existing molecular pre-trained models, Token-Mol exhibits superior proficiency in handling a wider range of downstream tasks essential for drug design. Notably, our approach improves regression task accuracy by approximately 30% compared to similar token-only methods. Token-Mol overcomes the precision limitations of token-only models and has the potential to integrate seamlessly with general models such as ChatGPT, paving the way for the development of a universal artificial intelligence drug design model that facilitates rapid and high-quality drug design by experts.</description>

      <title>Protein intrinsic disorder prediction using Attention U-Net and ProtTrans protein language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prediction of intrinsic disorder regions has significant implications for understanding protein function, structure, and dynamics. It can help to discover novel functions or protein-protein interactions essential to designing new drugs, therapies, or enzymes. Recently, a new generation of predictors based on protein language models is emerging. These algorithms reach state-of-the-art accuracy without calculating time-consuming multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). The article pre-sents a new protein intrinsic disorder predictor DisorderUnetLM based on the Attention U-Net convolutional neural network using features from the protein language model ProtTrans. DisorderUnetLM shows top results in the direct comparison with flDPnn and IDP-CRF predictors using MSAs and with the SETH predictor using features from the same ProtTrans model. Moreover, among 41 predictors from the latest Critical Assessment of Protein Intrinsic Disorder Prediction (CAID-2) benchmark, it ranks 9th for the Disorder-PDB subset (with ROC-AUC of 0.924) and 1st for the Disorder-NOX subset (with ROC-AUC of 0.844) which confirms its potential to perform well in the upcoming CAID-3 challenge for which Disor-derUnetLM was submitted.</description>
