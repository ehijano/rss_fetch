      <title>Learning the Universe: GalactISM simulations of resolved star formation and galactic outflows across main sequence and quenched galactic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a suite of six high-resolution chemo-dynamical simulations of isolated galaxies, spanning observed disk-dominated environments on the star-forming main sequence, as well as quenched, bulge-dominated environments. We compare and contrast the physics driving star formation and stellar feedback amongst the galaxies, with a view to modeling these processes in cosmological simulations. We find that the mass-loading of galactic outflows is coupled to the clustering of supernova explosions, which varies strongly with the rate of galactic rotation $\Omega = v_c/R$ via the Toomre length, leading to smoother gas disks in the bulge-dominated galaxies. This sets an equation of state in the star-forming gas that also varies strongly with $\Omega$, so that the bulge-dominated galaxies have higher mid-plane densities, lower velocity dispersions, and higher molecular gas fractions than their main sequence counterparts. The star formation rate in five out of six galaxies is independent of $\Omega$, and is consistent with regulation by the mid-plane gas pressure alone. In the sixth galaxy, which has the most centrally-concentrated bulge and thus the highest $\Omega$, we reproduce dynamical suppression of the star formation efficiency (SFE) in agreement with observations. This produces a transition away from pressure-regulated star formation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Molecular Gas in Infrared Bright Galaxies with CARMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the CO(1-0) maps of 28 infrared-bright galaxies from the Great Observatories All-Sky Luminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (GOALS) taken with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA). We detect 100GHz continuum in 16 of 28 galaxies, which trace both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and compact star-forming cores. The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\alpha_{\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio. Mergers tend to have the highest gas-to-dust ratios. We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to "enhanced" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components.</description>

      <title>Towards Implementation of the Pressure-Regulated, Feedback-Modulated Model of Star Formation in Cosmological Simulations: Methods and Application to TNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional star formation subgrid models implemented in cosmological galaxy formation simulations, such as that of Springel &amp; Hernquist (2003, hereafter SH03), employ adjustable parameters to satisfy constraints measured in the local Universe. In recent years, however, theory and spatially-resolved simulations of the turbulent, multiphase, star-forming ISM have begun to produce new first-principles models, which when fully developed can replace traditional subgrid prescriptions. This approach has advantages of being physically motivated and predictive rather than empirically tuned, and allowing for varying environmental conditions rather than being tied to local Universe conditions. As a prototype of this new approach, by combining calibrations from the TIGRESS numerical framework with the Pressure-Regulated Feedback-Modulated (PRFM) theory, simple formulae can be obtained for both the gas depletion time and an effective equation of state. Considering galaxies in TNG50, we compare the "native" simulation outputs with post-processed predictions from PRFM. At TNG50 resolution, the total midplane pressure is nearly equal to the total ISM weight, indicating that galaxies in TNG50 are close to satisfying vertical equilibrium. The measured gas scale height is also close to theoretical equilibrium predictions. The slopes of the effective equations of states are similar, but with effective velocity dispersion normalization from SH03 slightly larger than that from current TIGRESS simulations. Because of this and the decrease in PRFM feedback yield at high pressure, the PRFM model predicts shorter gas depletion times than the SH03 model at high densities and redshift. Our results represent a first step towards implementing new, numerically calibrated subgrid algorithms in cosmological galaxy formation simulations.</description>

      <title>Kinematic study of the Orion Complex: Analysing the young stellar clusters from big and small structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analysed young stellar clusters with spatial and kinematic coherence in the Orion star-forming complex. For this study, we selected a sample of pre-main sequence candidates using parallaxes, proper motions and positions on the colour-magnitude diagram. After applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm in the 5D parameter space provided by Gaia DR3, we divided the recovered clusters into two regimes: Big Structures and Small Structures, defined by the number of detected stars per cluster. In the first regime, we found 13 stellar groups distributed along the declination axis in the regions where there is a high density of stars. In the second regime, we recovered 34 clusters classified into two types: 14 as small groups completely independent from the larger structures, including four candidates of new clusters, and 12 classified as sub-structures embedded within five larger clusters. Additionally, radial velocity data from APOGEE-2 and GALAH DR3 was included to study the phase space in some regions of the Orion complex. From the Big Structure regime, we found evidence of a general expansion in the Orion OB1 association over a common centre, giving a clue about the dynamical effects the region is undergoing. Likewise, in the Small Structure regime, the projected kinematics shows the ballistic expansion in the $\lambda$ Orionis association and the detection of likely events of clusters' close encounters in the OB1 association.</description>

      <title>The physical origin of positive metallicity radial gradients in high-redshift galaxies: insights from the FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations, we investigate the temporal evolution of gas-phase metallicity radial gradients of Milky Way-mass progenitors in the redshift range of $0.4&lt;z&lt;3$. We pay special attention to the occurrence of positive (i.e. inverted) metallicity gradients -- where metallicity increases with galactocentric radius. This trend, contrary to the more commonly observed negative radial gradients, has been frequently seen in recent spatially resolved grism observations. The occurrence rate of positive gradients in FIRE-2 is about $\sim10\%$ for $0.4&lt;z&lt;3$, and $\sim16\%$ at higher redshifts ($1.5&lt;z&lt;3$), broadly consistent with observations. Moreover, we investigate the correlations among galaxy metallicity gradient, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and degree of rotational support. Our results show that galaxies with lower mass, higher specific SFR (sSFR), and more turbulent disks are more likely to exhibit positive metallicity gradients. The FIRE-2 simulations show evidence for positive gradients that occur both before and/or after major episodes of star formation, manifesting as sharp rises in a galaxy's star-formation history. Positive gradients occurring before major star-formation episodes are likely caused by metal-poor gas inflows, whereas those appearing afterwards often result from metal-enriched gas outflows, driven by strong stellar feedback. Our results support the important role of stellar feedback in governing the chemo-structural evolution and disk formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies at the cosmic noon epoch.</description>

      <title>Disparate Effects of Circumgalactic Medium Angular Momentum in IllustrisTNG and SIMBA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the role of circumgalactic medium (CGM) angular momentum ($j_{\rm CGM}$) on star formation in galaxies, whose influence is currently not well understood. The analysis utilises central galaxies from two hydrodynamical simulations, SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. We observe a substantial divergence in how star formation rates correlate with CGM angular momentum between the two simulations. Specifically, quenched galaxies in IllustrisTNG show high $j_{\rm CGM}$, while in SIMBA, quenched galaxies have low $j_{\rm CGM}$. This difference is attributed to the distinct active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback mechanisms active in each simulation. Moreover, both simulations demonstrate similar correlations between $j_{\rm CGM}$ and environmental angular momentum ($j_{\rm Env}$) in star-forming galaxies, but these correlations change notably when kinetic AGN feedback is present. In IllustrisTNG, quenched galaxies consistently show higher $j_{\rm CGM}$ compared to their star-forming counterparts with the same $j_{\rm Env}$, a trend not seen in SIMBA. Examining different AGN feedback models in SIMBA, we further confirm that AGN feedback significantly influences the CGM gas distribution, although the relationship between the cold gas fraction and the star formation rate (SFR) remains largely stable across different feedback scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the formation of cores in accreting filaments and the impact of ambient environment on it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent numerical works, including ours, lend credence to the thesis that ambient environment, i.e., external pressure, affects star-forming ability of clouds &amp; filaments. In continuation with our series of papers on the subject we explore this thesis further by developing hydrodynamic simulations of accreting filaments confined by external pressures in the range $10^{4 -7}$ $K\ cm^{-3}$. Our findings are-\textbf{(i)} irrespective of linemass, filaments fragment to yield spheroidal cores. Initially sub-critical filaments in low to intermediate external pressure environments form broad cores which suggests, weakly self-gravitating filaments must fragment via \emph{collect-and-collapse} mode to form broad cores. Transcritical filaments, by contrast, become susceptible to Jeans-type instability and form pinched cores; \textbf{(ii)} ambient environment bears upon physical properties of filaments including their {\small FWHM$_{fil}$}. Only those initially suffused with subsonic turbulence in Solar Neighbourhood-like environs, however, have {\small FWHM$_{fil}$}$\sim$ 0.1 $pc$. In high pressure environs they not only have smaller widths, but become severely eviscerated. On the contrary, filaments suffused with initially supersonic turbulence are typically broader; \textbf{(iii)} quasi-oscillatory nature of velocity gradients is ubiquitous along filament lengths and its magnitude generally increases with increasing pressure. The periodicity of the velocity gradients approximately matches the fragmentation lengthscale of filaments; \textbf{(iv)} oscillatory features of the radial component of the velocity gradient are a unreliable proxy for detecting signatures of accretion onto filaments; \textbf{(v)} filaments at either extreme of external pressure are inefficient at cycling gas into the dense phase which could reconcile the corresponding inefficiency of star-formation in such environments.</description>

      <title>Finding Passive Galaxies in HI-MaNGA: The Impact of Star-Formation Rate Indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HI-rich galaxies typically have high star-formation rates (SFR), but there exist interesting HI-rich and low star-forming (low-SF) galaxies. Previous work on a sample of these galaxies identified from HI-MaNGA (HI follow-up to the MaNGA survey) using an infrared indicator of specific-SFR (sSFR; namely W2-W3~&lt;2) could find no single physical process to explain their unusual behaviour. The method by which galaxies are identified as low sSFR may be important in this conclusion. In this Research Note, we explore how an HI-rich, low sSFR sample of HI-MaNGA galaxies differs using H alpha, single stellar population, and ultraviolet estimators of SFR. We find that samples are statistically similar to each other so long as W2-W3~&lt;2 is interpreted as corresponding to sSFR&lt;10^{-11.15} yr^{-1}.</description>

      <title>How Long Will the Quasar UV/Optical Flickering Be Damped? II. the Observational Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristic timescale at which the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) turns from red noise to white noise can probe the accretion physics around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). A number of works have studied the characteristic timescale of quasars and obtained quite different scaling relations between the timescale and quasar physical properties. One possible reason for the discrepancies is that the characteristic timescale can be easily underestimated if the light curves are not long enough. In this work, we construct well-defined AGN samples to observationally test the relationships between the characteristic timescale and AGN properties obtained by previous works. Our samples eliminate the effects of insufficient light-curve lengths. We confirm that the timescale predictions \citep{Zhou2024} of the Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing model are consistent with our timescale measurements. The timescale predictions by empirically relations \citep[e.g.,][]{Kelly2009} are systematically smaller than our measured ones. Our results provide further evidence that AGN variability is driven by thermal fluctuations in SMBH accretion disks. Future flagship time-domain surveys can critically test our conclusions and reveal the physical nature of AGN variability.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). (IV): Exploring Ionized Gas Outflows in Central Kiloparsec Regions of GATOS Seyferts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing JWST MIRI/MRS IFU observations of the kiloparsec scale central regions, we showcase the diversity of ionized gas distributions and kinematics in six nearby Seyfert galaxies included in the GATOS survey. Specifically, we present spatially resolved flux distribution and velocity field maps of six ionized emission lines covering a large range of ionization potentials ($15.8-97.1$ eV). Based on these maps, we showcase the evidence of ionized gas outflows in the six targets, and find some highly disturbed regions in NGC\,5728, NGC\,5506, and ESO137-G034. We propose AGN-driven radio jets plausibly play an important role in triggering these highly disturbed regions. With the outflow rates estimated based on [Ne~{\footnotesize V}] emission, we find the six targets tend to have ionized outflow rates converged to a narrower range than previous finding. These results have important implication for the outflow properties in AGN of comparable luminosity.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). (VI): Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission in the Central Regions of Three Seyferts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze JWST MIRI/MRS IFU observations of three Seyferts and showcase the intriguing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission characteristics in regions of $\sim 500\,\rm pc$ scales over or around their active galactic nuclei (AGN). Combining the model predictions and the measurements of PAH features and other infrared emission lines, we find that the central regions containing a high fraction of neutral PAHs with small sizes, e.g., those in ESO137-G034, are in highly heated environments, due to collisional shock heating, with hard and moderately intense radiation fields. Such environments are proposed to be associated with inhibited growth or preferential erosion of PAHs, decreasing the average PAH size and the overall abundance of PAHs. We additionally find that the central regions containing a high fraction of ionized PAHs with large sizes, e.g., those in MCG-05-23-016, are likely experiencing severe photo-ionization because of the radiative effects from the radiative shock precursor besides the AGN. The severe photo-ionization can contribute to the ionization of all PAHs and further destruction of small PAHs. Overall, different Seyferts, even different regions in the same galaxy, e.g., those in NGC\,3081, can contain PAH populations of different properties. Specifically, Seyferts that exhibit similar PAH characteristics to ESO137-G034 and MCG-05-23-016 also tend to have similar emission line properties to them, suggesting that the explanations for PAH characteristics of ESO137-G034 and MCG-05-23-016 may also apply generally. These results have promising application in the era of JWST, especially in diagnosing different (i.e., radiative, and kinetic) AGN feedback modes.</description>

      <title>Morphology and Mach Number Distribution of Merger Shock Surfaces in Merging Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a binary merger of two subclusters with comparable masses, a pair of merger shocks are typically generated, often manifesting as double radio relics. Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, we identify major merger events with mass ratio $\mathcal{M}_1/\mathcal{M}_2\lesssim4$ and impact parameter $b/r_{\rm vir,1}\lesssim1$, where $r_{\rm vir,1}$ is the virial radius of the larger subcluster. We analyze merger shock surfaces approximately 1 Gyr after the pericenter passage, focusing on their morphology and the distribution of the Mach number, $M_s$, of their constituent shock zones. The shock surfaces exhibit an elongated shape with a minor-to-major axis ratio of $\sim0.6-0.9$ and cover the area of $\sim5-20\%$ of the enclosed sphere. The area ratio of the two shock surfaces roughly scales with $\mathcal{M}_1/\mathcal{M}_2$, typically positioning the larger shock ahead of the smaller subcluster. The axis connecting the two subclusters generally does not pass through the centers of the shock surfaces, due to the nonzero impact parameter and the turbulent flows around them. The distribution of $M_s$ of shock zones on each surface can be approximated by a log-normal function, peaking at $M_{s,\rm{peak}}\approx2-4.5$ and extending up to $\sim10$. The surface-area-weighted and X-ray-emissivity-weighted average Mach numbers are comparable, with ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{\rm{area}}\approx2.3-4.4$ and ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{X}\approx2-4$. In contrast, the cosmic-ray-energy-flux-weighted average Mach numbers are higher with ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{\rm{CR}}\approx3-5$. This discrepancy aligns with the differences between Mach numbers derived from X-ray and radio observations of radio relic shocks. On the other hand, we find that mostly ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{X}\gtrsim2$ for simulated merger shocks, although shocks with $M_{\rm X-ray}\lesssim2$ are often reported in observations.</description>

      <title>The Outflowing [OII] Nebulae of Compact Starburst Galaxies at z $\sim$ 0.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity outflows are ubiquitous in compact, massive (M$_* \sim$ 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$), z $\sim$ 0.5 galaxies with extreme star formation surface densities ($\Sigma_{SFR} \sim$ 2000 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$). We have previously detected and characterized these outflows using MgII absorption lines. To probe their full extent, we present Keck/KCWI integral field spectroscopy of the [OII] and MgII emission nebulae surrounding all of the 12 galaxies in this study. We find that [OII] is more effective than MgII in tracing low surface brightness, extended emission in these galaxies. The [OII] nebulae are spatially extended beyond the stars, with radial extent R$_{90}$ between 10 and 40 kpc. The nebulae exhibit non-gravitational motions, indicating galactic outflows with maximum blueshifted velocities ranging from -335 to -1920 km s$^{-1}$. The outflow kinematics correlate with the bursty star formation histories of these galaxies. Galaxies with the most recent bursts of star formation (within the last $&lt;$ 3 Myr) exhibit the highest central velocity dispersions ($\sigma &gt;$ 400 km s$^{-1}$), while the oldest bursts have the lowest-velocity outflows. Many galaxies exhibit both high-velocity cores and more extended, slower-moving gas indicative of multiple outflow episodes. The slower, larger outflows occurred earlier and have decelerated as they propagate into the CGM and mix on timescales $&gt;$ 50 Myr.</description>

      <title>First map of D$_2$H$^+$ emission revealing the true centre of a prestellar core: further insights into deuterium chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. IRAS 16293E is a rare case of a prestellar core being subjected to the effects of at least one outflow.Aims. We want to disentangle the actual structure of the core from the outflow impact and evaluate the evolutionary stage of the core. Methods. Prestellar cores being cold and depleted, the best tracers of their central regions are the two isotopologues of trihydrogren cation which are observable from the ground, ortho-H$_2$D and para-D$_2$H . We used the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope to map the para-D$_2$H$^+$ emission in IRAS 16293E and collected James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) archival data of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ . We compare their emission to that of other tracers, including dust emission, and analyse their abundance with the help of a 1D radiative transfer tool. The ratio of the abundances of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ and para-D$_2$H$^+$ can be used to estimate the stage of the chemical evolution of the core.Results. We have obtained the first complete map of para-D$_2$H$^+$ emission in a prestellar core. We compare it to a map of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ and show their partial anti-correlation. This reveals a strongly evolved core with a para-D$_2$H$^+$/ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ abundance ratio towards the centre for which we obtain a conservative lower limit from 3.9 (at 12 K) up to 8.3 (at 8 K) while the high extinction of the core is indicative of a central temperature below 10 K. This ratio is higher than predicted by the known chemical models found in the literature. Para-D$_2$H$^+$ (and indirectly ortho-H$_2$D$^+$) is the only species that reveals the true centre of this core, while the emission of other molecular tracers and dust are biased by the temperature structure that results from the impact of the outflow.Conclusions. This study invites to reconsider the analysis of previous observations of this source and possibly questions the validity of the deuteration chemical models or of the reaction and inelastic collisional rate coefficients of the H$^{+3}$ isotopologue family. This could impact the deuteration clock predictions for all sources.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolution of Four Old Galactic Open Clusters traced by their constituent stars with \textit{Gaia} DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolutionary stages of four open clusters, Berkeley 39, Collinder 261, NGC 6819, and NGC 7789, of ages ranging from 1.6 -- 6 Gyr. These clusters have previously been classified into dynamically young and intermediate age groups based on the segregation level of BSS with respect to red giant branch stars and main sequence stars, respectively. We identify members of these four clusters using the ML-MOC algorithm on Gaia DR3 data. To examine the relative segregation of cluster members of different evolutionary stages, we utilize cumulative radial distributions, proper motion distributions, and spatial distributions in galactocentric coordinates. Our analysis shows that Berkeley 39 and NGC 6819 exhibit moderate signs of population-wise segregation from evolved to less-evolved members. NGC 7789 shows signs of mass segregation only in the cumulative radial distributions. On the other hand, Collinder 261 exhibits high segregation of BSS in the cumulative radial distribution, while other populations show the same level of segregation.</description>

      <title>A Survey Of High Mass Star Forming Regions In The Line Of Singly Deuterated Ammonia NH2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present survey represents a continuation of our study of high mass star forming regions in the lines of deuterated molecules, the first results of which were published in Trofimova et al. (2020). This paper presents the results of observations of 50 objects in the line of ortho modification of singly deuterated ammonia NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s - 1_{01}^a$ at frequency 85.9 GHz, carried out with the 20-m radio telescope of the Onsala Space Observatory (Sweden). This line is detected in 29 sources. The analysis of obtained data, as well as the fact that gas density in the investigated sources, according to independent estimates, is significantly lower than the critical density for this NH$_2$D transition, indicate non-LTE excitation of NH$_2$D. Based on non-LTE modeling, estimates of the relative content of the NH$_2$D molecule and the degree of deuterium enrichment were obtained, and the dependencies of these parameters on temperature and velocity dispersion were analyzed with and without taking into account detection limits assuming the same gas density in all sources. An anti-correlation between the NH$_2$D relative abundances and the kinetic temperature is revealed in the temperature range 15-50K. At the same time, significant decrease in the ratio of the NH$_2$D/NH$_3$ abundances with increasing temperature, predicted by the available chemical models, is not observed under the adopted assumptions. An anti-correlation was also revealed between the relative content of the main isotopologue of ammonia NH$_3$ and the velocity dispersion, while no statistically significant correlation with the kinetic temperature of sources in the same temperature range was found.</description>

      <title>Low surface brightness dwarf galaxies and their globular cluster populations around the low-density environment of our closest S0 NGC3115</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding faint dwarf galaxies is fundamental to the development of a robust theory of galaxy formation on small scales. Since the discovery of a population of ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) rich in globular clusters (GCs) in Coma, an increasing number of studies on low surface brightness dwarf galaxies (LSBds) have been published in recent years. The most massive LSBds have been observed predominantly in groups and clusters, with properties displaying dependence on the environment. In this work, we use deep DECam imaging to systematically identify LSBds and their GC populations around the low-density environment of NGC 3115. We carefully analyse the structure and morphology of 24 candidates, 18 of which are reported for the first time. Most candidates exhibit red colours suggesting a connection between their colour and distance to NGC 3115. We followed up with Gemini GMOS imaging 9 LSBds to properly identify their GC populations. We derive lower limits for the number of GCs associated with each galaxy. Our analysis reveals that they occur around of the same loci of Fornax LSB dwarf GC systems. The relationship between the number of GCs and total mass provides a tool in which, by counting the GCs in these galaxies, we estimate an upper limit for the total mass of these LSB dwarfs, obtaining the mean value of $\sim 3.3\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. Our results align with expectations for dwarf-sized galaxies, particularly regarding the distribution and specific frequency of their GC systems.</description>

      <title>3D ISM structure challenges the Serkowski relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Serkowski relation is the cornerstone of studies of starlight polarization as a function of wavelength. Although empirical, its extensive use since its inception to describe polarization induced by interstellar dust has elevated the relation to the status of an indisputable "law", serving as the benchmark for validating interstellar dust grain models. We revisit the effects of the 3D structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) on the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization. We use analytical models to show how the wavelength dependence of both the polarization fraction and direction is affected by the presence of multiple clouds along the line of sight (LOS), accounting for recent developments in dust distribution modelling and utilizing an expanded archive of stellar polarization measurements. We highlight concrete examples of stars whose polarization profiles are severely affected by LOS variations of the dust grain and magnetic field properties, and we provide a recipe to accurately fit multiple cloud Serkowski models to such cases. We present, for the first time, compelling observational evidence that the 3D structure of the magnetized ISM often results to the violation of the Serkowski relation. We show that 3D effects impact interstellar cloud parameters derived from Serkowski fits. In particular, the dust size distribution in single - cloud sightlines may differ from analyses that ignore 3D effects, with important implications for dust modelling in the Galaxy. Our results suggest that multiband stellar polarization measurements offer an independent probe of the LOS variations of the magnetic field, constituting a valuable new tool for the 3D cartography of the ISM. We caution that, unless 3D effects are explicitly accounted for, a poor fit to the Serkowski relation does not, by itself, constitute conclusive evidence that a star is intrinsically polarized.</description>

      <title>MEGS: Morphological Evaluation of Galactic Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the morphology of galaxies is a critical aspect of astrophysics research, providing insight into the formation, evolution, and physical properties of these vast cosmic structures. Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\sim200$ for 2D images and $\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred: The existence of massive dark matter-deficient satellite galaxies in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of a massive galaxy with an extremely low dark matter content (i.e. NGC 1277) has posed questions about how such objects form and evolve in a hierarchical universe. We here report on the finding of several massive, dark matter-deficient galaxies in a set of 324 galaxy clusters theoretically modelled by means of full-physics hydrodynamical simulations. We first focus on two example galaxies selected amongst the most massive and dark matter-deficient ones. By tracing the evolution of these galaxies, we find that their lack of dark matter is a result of multiple pericentre passages. While orbiting their host halo, tidal interactions gradually strip away dark matter while preserving the stellar component. A statistical analysis of all massive satellite galaxies in the simulated clusters shows that the stellar-to-total mass ratio today is strongly influenced by the number of orbits and the distance at pericentres. Galaxies with more orbits and closer pericentres are more dark matter-deficient. Additionally, we find that massive, dark matter-deficient galaxies at the present day are either the remnants of very massive galaxies at infall or former central galaxies of infalling groups. We conclude that such massive yet dark matter-deficient galaxies exist and are natural by-products of typical cluster galaxy evolution, with no specific requirement for an exotic formation scenario.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation-based hot CGM model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the inflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better understanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain simulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements probing the hot CGM in X-rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our knowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from current/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulations to build a fully self-consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We construct a lightcone and generate mock X-ray observations. We quantify the projection effects, namely the locally correlated large-scale structure in X-rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which affects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments. We present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X-ray surface brightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing stellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $\beta$, the exponent quantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry forward the current state-of-the-art by also showing the impact of the locally correlated environment on the measured X-ray surface brightness profiles. We also present, for the first time, the effect of misclassified centrals in stacking experiments for three stellar mass bins: $10^{10.5-11}\ M_\odot$, $10^{11-11.2}\ M_\odot$, and $10^{11.2-11.5}\ M_\odot$. We find that the contaminating effect of the misclassified centrals on the stacked profiles increases when the stellar mass decreases.</description>

      <title>The VIRUS-dE Survey I: Stars in dwarf elliptical galaxies - 3D dynamics and radially resolved stellar initial mass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the stellar structure of a sample of dwarf ellipticals (dE) inhabiting various environments within the Virgo cluster. Integral-field observations with a high spectral resolution allow us to robustly determine their low velocity dispersions ($\sim25$ km s$^{-1}$) and higher-order kinematic moments out to the half-light radius. We find the dEs exhibit a diversity in ages with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older, suggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered Virgo while others have been quenched shortly after reionization. Orbit-superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar mass-to-light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit structure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed compared to ordinary early-type galaxies and correlates with the environment. Flattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to their equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we find an age-dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) or, alternatively, evidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that have had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower density environments. dEs appear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure but the state they were `frozen' in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to their initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Initial-Mass Function via Stellar Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar initial-mass function (IMF) represents a fundamental quantity in astrophysics and cosmology, describing the mass distribution of stars from low to very-high masses. It is intimately linked to a wide variety of topics, including stellar and binary evolution, galaxy evolution, chemical enrichment, and cosmological reionization. Nonetheless, the IMF still remains highly uncertain. In this work, we aim at determining the IMF with a novel approach based on the observed rates of transients of stellar origin. We parametrize the IMF with a simple, but flexible, Larson shape, and insert it into a parametric model for the cosmic UV luminosity density, local stellar mass density, type Ia supernova (SN Ia), core-collapse supernova (CCSN), and long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) rates as function of redshift. We constrain our free parameters by matching the model predictions to a set of empirical determinations for the corresponding quantities, via a Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method. Remarkably, we are able to provide an independent IMF determination, with characteristic mass $m_c=0.10^{+0.24}_{-0.08}\:M_{\odot}$, and high-mass slope $\xi=-2.53^{+0.24}_{-0.27}$, that is in accordance with the widely-used IMF parameterizations (e.g. Salpeter, Kroupa, Chabrier). Moreover, the adoption of an up-to-date recipe for the cosmic metallicity evolution, allows us to constrain the maximum metallicity of LGRB progenitors to $Z_{max}=0.12^{+0.29}_{-0.05}\:Z_{\odot}$. We also find what progenitor fraction actually leads to SN Ia or LGRB emission, put constraints on the CCSN and LGRB progenitor mass ranges, and test the IMF universality. These results show the potential of this kind of approach for studying the IMF, its putative evolution with galactic environment and cosmic history, and the properties of SN Ia, CCSN and LGRB progenitors, especially considering the wealth of data incoming in the future.</description>

      <title>The Large Magellanic Cloud: expanding the low-mass parameter space of dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) impacts the predicted signals in near-future direct detection experiments for non-standard dark matter (DM) interactions, using the Auriga cosmological simulations. We extract the local DM distribution of a simulated Milky Way-like halo that has an LMC analogue and study the expected signals in DarkSide-20k, SBC, DARWIN/XLZD, SuperCDMS, NEWS-G, and DarkSPHERE considering DM-nucleon effective interactions, as well as inelastic DM scattering. We find that the LMC causes substantial shifts in direct detection exclusion limits towards smaller cross sections and DM masses for all non-relativistic effective field theory (NREFT) operators, with the impact being highly pronounced for velocity-dependent operators at low DM masses. For inelastic DM, where the DM particle up-scatters to a heavier state, the LMC shifts the direct detection exclusion limits towards larger DM mass splitting and smaller cross sections. Thus, we show that the LMC significantly expands the parameter space that can be probed by direct detection experiments towards smaller DM-nucleon cross sections for all NREFT operators and larger values of mass splitting for inelastic DM.</description>

      <title>Hanging on the cliff: EMRI formation with local two-body relaxation and post-Newtonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are anticipated to be primary gravitational wave sources for LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). They form in dense nuclear clusters when a compact object (CO) is captured by the central massive black holes (MBHs) due to frequent two-body interactions among orbiting objects. We present a novel Monte Carlo approach to evolve the post-Newtonian (PN) equations of motion of a CO orbiting an MBH accounting for two-body relaxation locally on the fly, without the assumption of orbit-averaging. We estimate the fraction $S(a_0)$ of EMRIs to total captures (including direct plunges, DPs) as a function of the initial semi-major axis $a_0$ for COs around MBHs of $M_\bullet\in[10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot,4\times10^6\,{\rm M}_\odot]$. Previous results indicate $S(a_0)\rightarrow 0$ at large $a_0$, with a sharp transition from EMRIs to DPs around a critical scale $a_{\rm c}$. This notion has been recently challenged for low-mass MBHs, with EMRIs forming at $a\gg a_{\rm c}$, the so-called "cliffhangers''. Our simulations confirm their existence, at larger numbers than previously expected. Cliffhangers start to appear for $M_\bullet\lesssim3\times 10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and can account for up to 55% of the overall EMRIs formed. We find $S(a_0)\gg 0$ for $a\gg a_{\rm c}$, reaching values as high as 0.6 for $M_\bullet=10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$, much larger than previously found. We find that the PN description of the system greatly enhances the number of EMRIs by shifting $a_{\rm c}$ to larger values at all MBH masses, and that the local treatment of relaxation significantly boosts the number of cliffhangers for small MBHs. Our work shows the limitations of standard assumptions for estimating EMRI formation rates, most importantly their dynamical models. Future estimates of rates and properties of EMRIs detectable by LISA should account for these improvements.</description>

      <title>CHARM: Creating Halos with Auto-Regressive Multi-stage networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To maximize the amount of information extracted from cosmological datasets, simulations that accurately represent these observations are necessary. However, traditional simulations that evolve particles under gravity by estimating particle-particle interactions (N-body simulations) are computationally expensive and prohibitive to scale to the large volumes and resolutions necessary for the upcoming datasets. Moreover, modeling the distribution of galaxies typically involves identifying virialized dark matter halos, which is also a time- and memory-consuming process for large N-body simulations, further exacerbating the computational cost. In this study, we introduce CHARM, a novel method for creating mock halo catalogs by matching the spatial, mass, and velocity statistics of halos directly from the large-scale distribution of the dark matter density field. We develop multi-stage neural spline flow-based networks to learn this mapping at redshift z=0.5 directly with computationally cheaper low-resolution particle mesh simulations instead of relying on the high-resolution N-body simulations. We show that the mock halo catalogs and painted galaxy catalogs have the same statistical properties as obtained from $N$-body simulations in both real space and redshift space. Finally, we use these mock catalogs for cosmological inference using redshift-space galaxy power spectrum, bispectrum, and wavelet-based statistics using simulation-based inference, performing the first inference with accelerated forward model simulations and finding unbiased cosmological constraints with well-calibrated posteriors. The code was developed as part of the Simons Collaboration on Learning the Universe and is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/shivampcosmo/CHARM}.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the gravitational wave detectability of globular clusters and the Magellanic Clouds for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the stellar evolution code BPASS and the gravitational wave simulation code LEGWORK to simulate populations of compact binaries that may be detected by the in-development space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector LISA. Specifically, we simulate the Magellanic Clouds and binary populations mimicking several globular clusters, neglecting dynamical effects. We find that the Magellanic Clouds would have a handful of detectable sources each, but for globular clusters the amount of detectable sources would be less than one. We compare our results to earlier research and find that our predicted numbers are several tens of times lower than calculations using the stellar evolution code BSE that take dynamical effects into account, but also calculations using the stellar evolution code SeBa for the Magellanic Clouds. This correlates with earlier research which compared BPASS models for GW sources in the Galactic disk with BSE models and found a similarly sized discrepancy. We analyse and explain this discrepancy as being caused by differences between the stellar evolution codes, particularly in the treatment of mass transfer and common-envelope events in binaries, where in BPASS mass transfer is more likely to be stable and tends to lead to less orbital shrinkage in the common-envelope phase than in other codes. This difference results in fewer compact binaries with periods short enough to be detected by LISA existing in the BPASS population. For globular clusters, we conclude that the impact of dynamical effects is uncertain from the literature, but the differences in stellar evolution have an effect of a factor of a few tens.</description>

      <title>Caught in the cosmic web: environmental effects on subhalo abundance and internal density profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the high-resolution \Nbody{} cosmological simulation COLOR, we explore the cosmic web (CW) environmental effects on subhalo populations and their internal properties. We use \cactus{}, a new implementation of the state-of-the-art segmentation method \nexus{}, to delineate the simulation volume into nodes, filaments, walls, and voids. We group host halos by virial mass and segment each mass bin into consecutive CW elements. This reveals that subhalo populations in hosts within specific environments differ on average from the cosmic mean. The subhalo mass function is affected strongly, where hosts in filaments typically contain more subhalos (5 to 30\%), while hosts in voids are subhalo-poor, with 50\% fewer subhalos. We find that the abundance of the most massive subhalos, with reduced masses of $\mu\equiv M_\mathrm{sub}/M_{200}\geq0.1$ is most sensitive to the CW environment. A corresponding picture emerges when looking at subhalo mass fractions, $f_\mathrm{sub}$, where the filament hosts are significantly more `granular' (having higher $f_\mathrm{sub}$) than the cosmic mean, while the void hosts have much smoother density distributions (with $f_\mathrm{sub}$ lower by $10{-}40\%$ than the mean). Finally, when we look at the subhalo internal kinematic \vmax{}--\rmax{} relations, we find that subhalos located in the void and wall hosts exhibit density profiles with lower concentrations than the mean, while the filament hosts demonstrate much more concentrated mass profiles. Across all our samples, the effect of the CW environment generally strengthens with decreasing host halo virial mass. Our results show that host location in the large-scale CW introduces significant systematic effects on internal subhalo properties and population statistics. Understanding and accounting for them is crucial for unbiased interpretation of observations related to small scales and satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred project: Radio luminosity evolution from merger-induced shock fronts in simulated galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster mergers are believed to generate large-scale shock waves that are ideal sites for electron acceleration. We compute radio emission light curves for galaxy group and cluster mergers simulated in a cosmological context to study the dependence of radio luminosity on cluster mass, redshift, and impact parameter. We used model galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred project to identify cluster mergers characterised by the two main merging structures and follow their evolution throughout the simulated cosmic history. We found that the median non-thermal radio relic luminosity light curve produced in galaxy cluster mergers can be described by a skewed Gaussian function abruptly rising after core-passage of the secondary cluster that peaks after $\sim0.1-0.8\,$Gyr as a function of $M_{200,1}$, the mass of the primary, displaying a mass-dependent luminosity output increase of $\lesssim10$ to about $\gtrsim10-50$ times relative to the radio emission measured at core-passage for galaxy groups and clusters, respectively. In general, most merger orbits are fairly radial with a median opening angle of $\sim20^{\circ}$ before the collision. We also found that, independent of the cluster mass, less radial mergers tend to last longer, although the trend is weak. Finally, we found that the peak radio luminosity shows a significant correlation with mass, $P_{1.4}\propto M_{200,1}^{2.05}$, demonstrating that this relation holds all the way up from galaxy group scales to the most massive galaxy clusters. We conclude that cluster mass is the primary driver for radio `gischt' median luminosity, although there are significant variations for a given cluster mass. Our simulations suggest that the shock-driven, non-thermal radio emission observed on cluster outskirts are the result of massive galaxy cluster mergers at $z\lesssim1$, peaking at $z\sim0-0.5$.</description>

      <title>Mass-loss Rate of Highly Evolved Stars in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs) and red supergiant stars (RSGs) exhibit significant mass loss phenomena and are considered important sources of interstellar dust. In this work, we employed an uniform method of spectral energy distribution fitting to analyze a large, and hence statistically significant, sample of approximately 40,000 RSGs and AGBs in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), providing a new catalog of evolved stars that includes stellar parameters and dust properties. Our results reveal that the total dust-production rate (DPR) of the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately $9.69\times10^{-6}\,\rm{M_{\odot }\, yr^{-1}}$, while it is around $1.75\times10^{-6}\,\rm{M_{\odot }\,yr^{-1}}$ for the Small Magellanic Cloud, with a few stars significantly contributing to the total DPR. No significant differences were observed in the contributions to DPR from carbon-rich and oxygen-rich (O-rich) evolved stars in the MCs. We explored the relations between stellar parameters (luminosity, infrared color, period, amplitude) and mass-loss rate (MLR) for evolved stars. A prominent turning point at $\log{(L/L_{\odot})} \approx 4.4$ appears in the luminosity-MLR diagram of RSGs, potentially related to the mass-loss mechanism of RSGs. The luminosity-MLR relation of AGBs is highly scattered. The DPR of AGBs shows a clear change with pulsation period and amplitude, with DPR exhibiting a drastic increase at pulsation periods of approximately 300 days and I-band amplitudes greater than 0.5 mag. Metallicity has some impact on the DPR of O-rich stars, with lower metallicity seeming to result in lower mean DPR and a higher proportion of optically thin stars.</description>

      <title>Photon Ring Dimming as a Signature of Photon-Axion Conversion in Janis-Newman-Winicour Naked Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possible existence of axions in the universe introduces the intriguing possibility of photon-axion conversion in strong magnetic fields, particularly near compact objects like supermassive black holes or even naked singularity. In this study, we investigate the conversion of photons into axions in the vicinity of a Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetime, a well-known naked singularity solution. Our analysis reveals that photons can efficiently convert into axions with masses less than $100 \rm \ neV$. We calculate the conversion probability and find that it is significantly influenced by the characteristic parameter of the JNW spacetime. The potential observational signatures of this conversion, would be the dimming of photon ring in the X-ray and gamma-ray spectrum. Our findings suggest that compact objects like M87* could be prime candidates for detecting photon-axion conversion effects, provided future advances in high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Testing the asteroseismic estimates of stellar radii with surface brightness-colour relations and Gaia DR3 parallaxes. Red giants and red clump stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compared stellar radii derived from asteroseismic scaling relations with those estimated using two independent surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) and Gaia DR3 parallaxes. We cross-matched asteroseismic and astrometric data for over 6,400 RGB and RC stars from the APO-K2 catalogue with the TESS Input Catalogue v8.2 to obtain precise V band magnitudes and E(B-V) colour excesses. We then adopted two different SBCRs from the literature to derive stellar radius estimates, denoted as $R^a$ and $R^b$, respectively. We analysed the ratio of these SBCR-derived radii to the asteroseismic radius estimates, $R$, provided in the APO-K2 catalogue. Both SBCRs exhibited good agreement with asteroseismic radius estimates. On average, $R^a$ was overestimated by 1.2% with respect to $R$, while $R^b$ was underestimated by 2.5%. For stars larger than 20 $R_{\odot}$, SBCR radii are systematically lower than asteroseismic ones. The agreement with asteroseismic radii shows a strong dependence on the parallax. The dispersion is halved for stars with a parallax greater than 2.5 mas. In this subsample, $R^b$ showed perfect agreement with $R$, while $R^a$ remained slightly overestimated by 3%. A trend with [Fe/H] of 4% to 6% per dex was found. For stars less massive than about 0.95 $M_{\odot}$, SBCR radii were significantly higher than asteroseismic ones, by about 6%. This overestimation correlated with the presence of extended helium cores in these stars' structures relative to their envelopes. Furthermore, radius ratios showed a dichotomous behaviour at higher masses, mainly due to the presence of several RC stars with SBCR radii significantly lower with respect to asteroseismology. This behaviour originates from a different response of asteroseismic scaling relations and SBCR to [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratios for massive stars, both in RGB and RC phases, which is reported here for the first time.</description>

      <title>The Ancient Egyptian Cosmological Vignette: First Visual Evidence of the Milky Way and Trends in Coffin Depictions of the Sky Goddess Nut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several studies have argued that the Milky Way was a representation of the ancient Egyptian sky goddess Nut. Here, I test this assumption by examining Nut's visual depictions on ancient Egyptian coffins. I assemble a catalog of 555 coffin elements, which includes 118 cosmological vignettes from the 21st/22nd Dynasties, and report several observations. First, I find that the cosmological vignette on the outer coffin of Nesitaudjatakhet bears a unique feature: a thick, undulating black curve that bisects Nut's star-studded body and recalls the Great Rift that cleaves the Milky Way in two. Moreover, it resembles similar features identified as the Milky Way on the bodies of Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni spiritual beings. Hence, I argue that the undulating curve on Nut's body is the first visual representation of the Milky Way identified in the Egyptian archaeological record. However, its rarity strengthens the conclusion reached by Graur (2024a): Though Nut and the Milky Way are linked, they are not synonymous. Instead of acting as a representation of Nut, the Milky Way is one more celestial phenomenon that, like the Sun and the stars, is associated with Nut in her role as the sky. Second, Nut's body is decorated with stars in only a quarter of the vignettes. If we associate Nut's naked and star-studded forms with the day and night sky, respectively, we would expect to see stars in half of the vignettes. This null hypothesis is rejected at $&gt;6\sigma$ statistical significance. For whatever reason, it appears that the Egyptians of the 21st/22nd Dynasties preferred the day sky over the night sky. Finally, I discuss the interplay between Nut's cosmological vignette and full-length portraits inside coffins from the New Kingdom to the Roman Period in light of Nut's combined cosmological and eschatological roles as an embodiment of the coffin.</description>

      <title>X-ray reverberation as an explanation for UV/optical variability in nearby Seyferts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all wavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last decade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and densely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert galaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical continuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical models. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the X-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation model). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be used to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to investigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model can also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do this, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC 4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from archival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based telescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X-ray reverberation model by determining the disc's transfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the model by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion rates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal reverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well as the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results suggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed UV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be fully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II. Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first 2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays, and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of these observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time, rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately every month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the band-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are 0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence Trends with Galactic Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in isolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings employing data from ESA's Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying trends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The findings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted changes from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to stellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet outcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors influencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying theoretical support for galactic-scale influences upon planet formation. In this manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems of Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet occurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary systems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly, their longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We consider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is determined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in which the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both models, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a negative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic midplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased by a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK dwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the hypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar and planetary properties.</description>

      <title>A Host Galaxy Morphology Link Between Quasi-Periodic Eruptions and Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical processes that produce X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) recently discovered from the nuclei of several low-redshift galaxies are mysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link between QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal that the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high Sersic indicies, bulge-to-total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass densities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive properties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these parameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy Survey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host galaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host galaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high surface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^-2. These properties are similar to TDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass- and redshift-matched control sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central black holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to their stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host galaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical link between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.</description>

      <title>The origin of the H$\alpha$ line profiles in simulated disc galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of ionised H$\alpha$ gas in high-redshift disc galaxies have ubiquitously found significant line broadening, $\sigma_{\rm H\alpha}\sim10-100$ km s$^{-1}$. To understand whether this broadening reflects gas turbulence within the interstellar medium (ISM) of galactic discs, or arises from out-of-plane emission in mass-loaded outflows, we perform radiation hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of isolated Milky Way-mass disc galaxies in a gas-poor (low-redshift) and gas rich (high-redshift) condition and create mock H$\alpha$ emission line profiles. We find that the majority of the total (integrated) H$\alpha$ emission is confined within the ISM, with extraplanar gas contributing $\sim45$% of the extended profile wings ($v_z\geq200$ km s$^{-1}$) in the gas-rich galaxy. This substantiates using the H$\alpha$ emission line as a tracer of mid-plane disc dynamics. We investigate the relative contribution of diffuse and dense H$\alpha$ emitting gas, corresponding to diffuse ionised gas (DIG; $\rho\lesssim0.1$ cm$^{-3}$, $T\sim8\,000$ K) and HII regions ($\rho\gtrsim10$ cm$^{-3}$, $T\sim10\,000$ K), respectively, and find that DIG contributes $f_{\rm DIG}\lesssim10$% of the total L$_{\rm H\alpha}$. However, the DIG can reach upwards of $\sigma_{\rm H\alpha}\sim60-80$ km s$^{-1}$ while the HII regions are much less turbulent $\sigma_{\rm H\alpha}\sim10-40$ km $s^{-1}$. This implies that the $\sigma_{\rm H\alpha}$ observed using the full H$\alpha$ emission line is dependent on the relative H$\alpha$ contribution from DIG/HII regions and a larger $f_{\rm DIG}$ would shift $\sigma_{\rm H\alpha}$ to higher values. Finally, we show that $\sigma_{\rm H\alpha}$ evolves, in both the DIG and HII regions, with the galaxy gas fraction. Our high-redshift equivalent galaxy is roughly twice as turbulent, except for in the DIG which has a more shallow evolution.</description>

      <title>The THESAN project: galaxy sizes during the epoch of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate galaxy sizes at redshift $z\gtrsim 6$ with the cosmological radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulation suite THESAN(-HR). These simulations simultaneously capture the reionization of the large-scale intergalactic medium and resolved galaxy properties. The intrinsic size ($r^{\ast}_{1/2}$) of simulated galaxies increases moderately with stellar mass at $M_{\ast} \lesssim 10^{8}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ and decreases fast at larger masses, resulting in a hump feature at $M_{\ast}\sim 10^{8}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ that is insensitive to redshift. Low-mass galaxies are in the initial phase of size growth and are better described by a spherical shell model with feedback-driven gas outflows competing with the cold inflows. In contrast, massive galaxies fit better with the disk formation model. They generally experience a phase of rapid compaction and gas depletion, likely driven by internal disk instability rather than external processes. We identify four compact quenched galaxies in the $(95.5\,{\rm cMpc})^{3}$ volume of THESAN-1 at $z\simeq 6$, and their quenching follows reaching a characteristic stellar surface density akin to the massive compact galaxies at cosmic noon. Compared to observations, we find that the median UV effective radius ($R^{\rm UV}_{\rm eff}$) of simulated galaxies is at least three times larger than the observed ones at $M_{\ast}\lesssim 10^{9}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ or $M_{\rm UV}\gtrsim -20$ at $6 \lesssim z \lesssim 10$. This inconsistency, related to the hump feature of the intrinsic size--mass relation, persists across many other cosmological simulations with different galaxy formation models and demonstrates the potential of using galaxy morphology to constrain the physics of galaxy formation at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>A high-velocity star recently ejected by an intermediate-mass black hole in M15</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is crucial for understanding various astrophysical phenomena, yet their existence remains elusive, except for the LIGO-Virgo detection. We report the discovery of a high-velocity star J0731+3717, whose backward trajectory about 21 Myr ago intersects that of globular cluster M15 within the cluster tidal radius. Both its metallicity [Fe/H] and its alpha-to-iron abundance ratio [$\alpha$/Fe] are consistent with those of M15. Furthermore, its location falls right on the fiducial sequence of the cluster M15 on the color-absolute magnitude diagram, suggesting similar ages. These support that J0731+3717 is originally associated with M15 at a confidence level of "seven nines". We find that such a high-velocity star ($V_{\rm ej} = 548^{+6}_{-5}$ km s$^{-1}$) was most likely tidally ejected from as close as one astronomical unit to the center of M15, confirming an IMBH ($\ge 100 M_{\odot}$ with a credibility of 98%) as the exclusive nature of the central unseen mass proposed previously.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Predictors of LyC Escape I: A Survival Analysis of the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand how galaxies reionized the universe, we must determine how the escape fraction of Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons (fesc) depends on galaxy properties. Using the z~0.3 Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), we develop and analyze new multivariate predictors of fesc. These predictions use the Cox proportional hazards model, a survival analysis technique that incorporates both detections and upper limits. Our best model predicts the LzLCS fesc detections with a root-mean-square (RMS) scatter of 0.31 dex, better than single-variable correlations. According to ranking techniques, the most important predictors of fesc are the equivalent width (EW) of Lyman-series absorption lines and the UV dust attenuation, which track line-of-sight absorption due to HI and dust. The HI absorption EW is uniquely crucial for predicting fesc for the strongest LyC emitters, which show properties similar to weaker LyC emitters and whose high fesc may therefore result from favorable orientation. In the absence of HI information, star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) and [O III]/[O II] ratio are the most predictive variables and highlight the connection between feedback and fesc. We generate a model suitable for z&gt;6, which uses only the UV slope, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, and [O III]/[O II]. We find that $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ is more important in predicting fesc at higher stellar masses, whereas [O III]/[O II] plays a greater role at lower masses. We also analyze predictions for other parameters, such as the ionizing-to-non ionizing flux ratio and Ly=alpha escape fraction. These multivariate models represent a promising tool for predicting fesc at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Predictors of LyC Escape II: Predicting LyC Escape Fractions for High-Redshift Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST is uncovering the properties of ever increasing numbers of galaxies at z&gt;6, during the epoch of reionization. Connecting these observed populations to the process of reionization requires understanding how efficiently they produce Lyman continuum (LyC) photons and what fraction (fesc) of these photons escape into the intergalactic medium. By applying the Cox proportional hazards model, a survival analysis technique, to the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), we develop new, empirical, multivariate predictions for fesc. The models developed from the LzLCS reproduce the observed fesc for z~3 samples, which suggests that LyC emitters may share similar properties at low and high redshift. Our best-performing models for the z~3 galaxies include information about dust attenuation, ionization, and/or morphology. We then apply these models to z$\gtrsim$6 galaxies. For large photometric samples, we find a median predicted fesc=0.047-0.14. For smaller spectroscopic samples, which may include stronger emission line galaxies, we find that $\geq$33% of the galaxies have fesc &gt;0.2, and we identify several candidate extreme leakers with fesc $\geq$0.5. The current samples show no strong trend between predicted fesc and UV magnitude, but limited spectroscopic information makes this result uncertain. Multivariate predictions can give significantly different results from single variable predictions, and the predicted fesc for high-redshift galaxies can differ significantly depending on whether star formation rate surface density or radius is used as a measure of galaxy morphology. We provide all parameters necessary to predict fesc for additional samples of high-redshift galaxies using these models.</description>

Abstract: Giant (&gt;100 kpc) nebulae associated with active galaxies provide rich information about the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies, its link with the interstellar medium (ISM) of the hosts and the mechanisms involved in their evolution. We have studied the giant nebula associated with the Teacup (z=0.085) quasar based on VLT MUSE integral field spectroscopy to investigate whether the well known giant (~10 kpc) active galactic nucleus (AGN) induced outflow has an impact on the distribution of heavy elements in and outside the host galaxy. For this, we have mapped the O/H and N/O abundances in two spatial dimensions across the giant nebula and within the galaxy by means of comparing emission line ratios with photoionisation model predictions. We have found that the widely studied AGN driven outflow responsible for the 10 kpc ionised bubble is enhancing the gas metal abundance up to 10 kpc from the AGN. O/H is solar or slightly higher in the bubble edges, in comparison with the subsolar abundances across the rest of the nebula (median O/H~0.63 O/H_sun)). The main conclusion is that AGN feedback can produce metal enrichment at large extranuclear distances in galaxies (&gt;~10 kpc).</description>

      <title>The tight correlation of PAH and CO emission from z~0-4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aim: The cold molecular gas mass is one of the crucial, yet challenging parameters in galaxy evolution studies. Here, we introduce a new calibration for estimating molecular gas masses using mid-infrared (MIR) photometry. This topic is timely, as JWST now allows us to detect the MIR emission of typical main-sequence galaxies across a wide range of masses and star formation rates with modest time investments. This Letter highlights the strong synergy between ALMA and JWST for studies of dust and gas at cosmic noon. Methods: We combine a sample of 14 main sequence galaxies at z=1-3 with robust CO detections and multi-band MIR photometry, along with a literature sample at z=0-4 with CO and PAH spectroscopy, to study the relationship between PAH, CO(1-0), and total IR luminosities. PAH luminosities are derived from modeling rest-frame UV to sub-mm data. The new z=1-3 sample extends previous high-z studies to about an order-of-magnitude lower PAH and CO luminosities, into the regime of local starbursts for the first time. Results: The PAH-to-CO luminosity ratio remains constant across a wide range of luminosities, for various galaxy types, and throughout the explored redshift range. In contrast, the PAH-to-IR and CO-to-IR luminosity ratios deviate from a constant value at high L(IR). The intrinsic scatter in the L(PAH)-L'(CO) relation is 0.21 dex, with a median of 1.40, and a power-law slope of $1.07 \pm 0.04$. Both the PAH-IR and CO-IR relations are sub-linear. Given the tight and uniform PAH-CO relation over ~3 orders of magnitude, we provide a recipe to estimate the cold molecular gas mass of galaxies from PAH luminosities, with a PAH-to-molecular gas conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm PAH7.7} = (3.08 \pm 1.08)(4.3/\alpha_{\rm CO})\,M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$. This method opens a new window to explore the gas content of galaxies beyond the local Universe using multi-wavelength JWST/MIRI imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The redshifted 21cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn is expected to provide unprecedented insights into early Universe astrophysics and cosmology. Here we explore how dark matter can heat the intergalactic medium before the first galaxies, leaving a distinctive imprint in the 21cm power spectrum. We provide the first dedicated Fisher matrix forecasts on the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope to dark matter decays. We show that with 1000 hours of observation, HERA has the potential to improve current cosmological constraints on the dark matter decay lifetime by up to three orders of magnitude. Even in extreme scenarios with strong X-ray emission from early-forming, metal-free galaxies, the bounds on the decay lifetime would be improved by up to two orders of magnitude. Overall, HERA shall improve on existing limits for dark matter masses below $2$ GeV$/c^2$ for decays into $e^+e^-$ and below few MeV$/c^2$ for decays into photons.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search of Distant Superclusters with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superclusters, encompassing environments across a wide range of overdensities, can be regarded as unique laboratories for studying galaxy evolution. Although numerous supercluster catalogs have been published, none of them goes beyond redshift $z=0.7$. In this work, we adopt a physically motivated supercluster definition, requiring that superclusters should eventually collapse even in the presence of dark energy. Applying a friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm to the CAMIRA cluster sample constructed using the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey data, we have conducted the first systematic search for superclusters at $z=0.5-1.0$ and identified 673 supercluster candidates over an area of 1027 deg$^2$. The FoF algorithm is calibrated by evolving $N$-body simulations to the far future to ensure high purity. We found that these high-$z$ superclusters are mainly composed of $2-4$ clusters, suggesting the limit of gravitationally bound structures in the younger Universe. In addition, we studied the properties of the clusters and brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) residing in different large-scale environments. We found that clusters associated with superclusters are typically richer, but no apparent dependence of the BCG properties on large-scale structures is found. We also compared the abundance of observed superclusters with mock superclusters extracted from halo light cones, finding that photometric redshift uncertainty is a limiting factor in the performance of superclusters detection.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Extraction Against Non-Stationary Instrumental Noises with Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13091</link>

Abstract: Sapce-borne gravitational wave antennas, such as LISA and LISA-like mission (Taiji and Tianqin), will offer novel perspectives for exploring our Universe while introduce new challenges, especially in data analysis. Aside from the known challenges like high parameter space dimension, superposition of large number of signals etc., gravitational wave detections in space would be more seriously affected by anomalies or non-stationarities in the science measurements. Considering the three types of foreseeable non-stationarities including data gaps, transients (glitches), and time-varying noise auto-correlations, which may come from routine maintenance or unexpected disturbances during science operations, we developed a deep learning model for accurate signal extractions confronted with such anomalous scenarios. Our model exhibits the same performance as the current state-of-the-art models do for the ideal and anomaly free scenario, while shows remarkable adaptability in extractions of coalescing massive black hole binary signal against all three types of non-stationarities and even their mixtures. This also provide new explorations into the robustness studies of deep learning models for data processing in space-borne gravitational wave missions.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of JWST results with exotic halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unveiling astounding results about the first few hundred million years of life of the Universe, delivering images of galaxies at very high redshifts. Here, we develop a UV luminosity function model for high-redshift galaxies, considering parameters such as the stellar formation rate, dust extinction, and halo mass function. Calibration of this luminosity function model using UV luminosity data at redshifts z = 4-7 yields optimal parameter values. Testing the model against data at higher redshifts reveals successful accommodation of the data at z = 8-9, but challenges emerge at z~13. Our findings suggest a negligible role of dust extinction at the highest redshifts, prompting a modification of the stellar formation rate to incorporate a larger fraction of luminous objects per massive halo, consistently with similar recent studies. This effect could be attributed to mundane explanations such as unknown evolution of standard astrophysics at high redshift or to the existence of exotic objects at high redshift. We comment on this latter possibility.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Extremely r-process-enhanced Thin-disk Star with [Eu/H] = +0.78</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly r-process-enhanced stars are rare and usually metal-poor ([Fe/H] &lt; - 1.0), and mainly populate the Milky Way halo and dwarf galaxies. This study presents the discovery of a relatively bright (V = 12.72), highly r-process-enhanced (r-II) star ([Eu/Fe] = +1.32, [Ba/Eu] = - 0.95), LAMOST J020632.21 + 494127.9. This star was selected from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) medium-resolution (R ~ 7500) spectroscopic survey; follow-up high-resolution (R ~ 25,000) observations were conducted with the High Optical Resolution Spectrograph (HORuS) installed on the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). The stellar parameters (${T_{\rm eff}}$ = 4130 K, $\rm log\,g $ = 1.52, $ \rm[Fe/H] $ = $ - $0.54, $\xi$ = 1.80 $ \rm{km\,{s^{-1}}} $) have been inferred taking into account non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects. The abundances of [Ce/Fe], [Pr/Fe], and [Nd/Fe] are +0.19, +0.65 and +0.64, respectively, relatively low compared to the Solar r-process pattern normalized to Eu. This star has a high metallicity ([Fe/H] = - 0.54) compared to most other highly r-process-enhanced stars, and has the highest measured abundance ratio of Eu to H ([Eu/H] = +0.78). It is classified as a thin-disk star based on its kinematics, and does not appear to belong to any known stream or dwarf galaxy.</description>
