      <title>Solovay reducibility implies S2a-reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original notion of Solovay reducibility was introduced by Robert M. Solovay (unpublished notes) in 1975 as a measure of relative randomness.
  The S2a-reducibility introduced by Xizhong Zheng and Robert Rettinger (DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-27798-9_39) in 2004 is a modification of Solovay reducibility suitable for computably approximable (c.a.) reals.
  We demonstrate that Solovay reducibility implies S2a-reducibility on the set of c.a. reals, even with the same constant, but not vice versa.</description>

      <title>The short exact sequence in definable Galois cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Remarks on Galois Cohomology and Definability [2], Pillay introduced definable Galois cohomology, a model-theoretic generalization of Galois cohomology. Let $M$ be an atomic and strongly $\omega$-homogeneous structure over a set of parameters $A$. Let $B$ be a normal extension of $A$ in $M$. We show that a short exact sequence of automorphism groups $1 \to \text{Aut}(M/B) \to \text{Aut}(M/A) \to \text{Aut}(B/A) \to 1$ induces a short exact sequence in definable Galois cohomology. Our result complements the long exact sequence in definable Galois cohomology developed in More on Galois cohomology, definability and differential algebraic groups [3].</description>

      <title>A note on surjective cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For cardinals $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$, we write $\mathfrak{a}=^\ast\mathfrak{b}$ if there are sets $A$ and $B$ of cardinalities $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$, respectively, such that there are partial surjections from $A$ onto $B$ and from $B$ onto $A$. $=^\ast$-equivalence classes are called surjective cardinals. In this article, we show that $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{DC}_\kappa$, where $\kappa$ is a fixed aleph, cannot prove that surjective cardinals form a cardinal algebra, which gives a negative solution to a question proposed by Truss [J. Truss, Ann. Pure Appl. Logic 27, 165--207 (1984)]. Nevertheless, we show that surjective cardinals form a ``surjective cardinal algebra'', whose postulates are almost the same with those of a cardinal algebra, except that the refinement postulate is replaced by the finite refinement postulate. This yields a smoother proof of the cancellation law for surjective cardinals, which states that $m\cdot\mathfrak{a}=^\ast m\cdot\mathfrak{b}$ implies $\mathfrak{a}=^\ast\mathfrak{b}$ for all cardinals $\mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{b}$ and all nonzero natural numbers $m$.</description>

      <title>Adding ultrafilters to Shelah's model for no nowhere dense ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit a forcing for producing a model with no nowhere dense ultrafilters that satisfies the full Sacks Property. By interleaving this forcing with other forcing notions, a model containing a $(2, {\aleph}_{0})$-selective ultrafilter, but no nowhere dense ultrafilters is produced. It is thus proved that the existence of $(2, {\aleph}_{0})$-selective ultrafilters does not imply the existence of nowhere dense ultrafilters.</description>

      <title>Impact Analysis of Data Drift Towards The Development of Safety-Critical Automotive System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant part of contemporary research in autonomous vehicles is dedicated to the development of safety critical systems where state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, like computer vision (CV), can play a major role. Vision models have great potential for the real-time detection of numerous traffic signs and obstacles, which is essential to avoid accidents and protect human lives. Despite vast potential, computer vision-based systems have critical safety concerns too if the traffic condition drifts over time. This paper represents an analysis of how data drift can affect the performance of vision models in terms of traffic sign detection. The novelty in this research is provided through a YOLO-based fusion model that is trained with drifted data from the CARLA simulator and delivers a robust and enhanced performance in object detection. The enhanced model showed an average precision of 97.5\% compared to the 58.27\% precision of the original model. A detailed performance review of the original and fusion models is depicted in the paper, which promises to have a significant impact on safety-critical automotive systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized explosion principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Paraconsistency is commonly defined and/or characterized as the failure of a principle of explosion. The various standard forms of explosion involve one or more logical operators or connectives, among which the negation operator is the most frequent and primary. In this article, we start by asking whether a negation operator is essential for describing explosion and paraconsistency. In other words, is it possible to describe a principle of explosion and hence a notion of paraconsistency that is independent of connectives? A negation-free paraconsistency resulting from the failure of a generalized principle of explosion is presented first. We also derive a notion of quasi-negation from this and investigate its properties. Next, more general principles of explosion are considered. These are also negation-free; moreover, these principles gradually move away from the idea that an explosion requires a statement and its opposite. Thus, these principles can capture the explosion observed in logics where a statement and its negation explode only in the presence of additional information, such as in the logics of formal inconsistency.</description>

      <title>The Klein j-Function is not Pfaffian over the Real Exponential Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: James Freitag showed that the Klein j-function is not paffian over the complex numbers. We expand on this result by showing that a restriction of the Klein j-function to the imaginary interval (0, i) is not pfaffian over the real field exponential field in the sense of Miller and Speissegger.</description>
