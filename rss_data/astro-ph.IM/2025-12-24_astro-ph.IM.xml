      <title>Breakthrough Listen Observations of 3I/ATLAS with the Green Bank Telescope at 1-12 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, made its closest approach to Earth on 2025 December 19. On 2025 December 18, the Breakthrough Listen program conducted a technosignature search toward 3I/ATLAS using the 100 m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope at 1-12 GHz. We report a nondetection of candidate signals down to the 100 mW level.</description>

      <title>Detecting Strongly-Lensed Supernovae in Wide-field Space Telescope Imaging via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed supernovae (SNe) are extremely rare and fade quickly; as a result, they are challenging to detect. To identify lensed SNe in large imaging datasets, current surveys primarily rely on the {\it magnification} effect of gravitational lensing -- searching for transients that appear brighter than expected \cite{c3}. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept study that uses a deep neural network to classify previously detected transients. Instead of relying on magnification, this network aims to identify doubly-imaged SNe with small separations ($&lt;0.6$ arcsec) based on the {\it distorted shape} of the transient object. This proposed method is most applicable to space-based imaging surveys from wide-field imaging observatories such as the upcoming Roman Space Telescope. To train and test our network, we use archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging surveys. Due to the extreme rarity of lensed SNe, we cannot train a neural network on actual lensed SN data. Instead, we have used HST imaging data to generate simulated imaging datasets for both training and testing. Our simulations use astrophysical priors to define the separations, relative brightnesses, and colors of each multiply-imaged SN. We have also simulated false positives (image artifacts and unlensed supernovae), which are much more prevalent than true lensed SN. Our deep learning model is trained to identify lensed SNe from a single difference image (i.e., not using multiple epochs). This network achieves a recall score of 99\% on simulated gravitationally lensed SNe. The network successfully distinguishes between single supernovae (SNe) and those with gravitationally lensed SNe, as well as images with zero SNe, achieving recall scores of 90\% and 96\% for single-SNe and zero-SNe images, respectively.</description>

      <title>Calibration Method of Spacecraft-Inertial Sensor Center-of-Mass Offset for the Taiji Gravitational Wave Detection Mission under Science Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately calibrating the center-of-mass (CoM) offset between the spacecraft (SC) and the inertial sensor test mass (TM) is crucial for space-based gravitational-wave (GW) antennas, such as LISA and Taiji. Current calibration methods require additional spacecraft maneuvers that disrupt science data continuity and inter-satellite links, compromising the coherence of gravitational wave signals. Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis. For LISA-like missions, where data continuity is paramount for detecting faint gravitational wave signals, this method will enhance scientific output and reliability.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Fermi paradox via passive SETI: a general framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the extent to which a lack of observations from SETI may be used to quantify the Fermi paradox. Building on previous research, we construct a geometrical model to compute the probability of at least one detection of an extraterrestrial electromagnetic (EM) signal of galactic origin, as a function of the number $N$ of communicative civilizations. We show how this is derivable from the probability of detecting a single signal; the latter is $\approx 0.6 \delta/R$, where $\delta$ is the distance between the initial and final EM signals and $R$ is the radius of the Milky Way, for $\delta/R \ll 1$. We show how to combine this analysis with the Drake equation $N = \mathscr{N} \delta /c$, where $c$ is the speed of light; this implies, applying a simplified toy model as an example, that the probability of detecting at least one signal is $&gt;99 \%$ for $\delta / c \gtrsim 10^{2.8}$ years, given that $\mathscr{N} = 1$. Lastly, we list this toy model's significant limitations, and suggest ways to ameliorate them in more realistic future models.</description>

      <title>Fast far-sidelobe modeling for centimeter to sub-millimeter astrophysical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation centimeter to sub-millimeter telescopes require exquisite control over instrumental far-sidelobe response to accurately measure faint signals like the Cosmic Microwave Background B modes. Because existing electromagnetic modeling methods are computationally expensive, we developed a novel, diffraction-based beam modeling method for rapid and low-cost calculations. We applied this methodology to model the BICEP3 far-sidelobes and found good qualitative agreement with in situ beam measurements. Using this validated simulated beam, we calculated the sidelobe temperature pickup for a specific observation scenario: scanning near the slopes of Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert. This rapid, predictive framework is most valuable as a tool for optimizing instrument baffling and identifying efficient scan strategies during the conceptual design phase.</description>

      <title>Real-time RFI Mitigation Techniques in Radio Astronomy and Their Practical Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio astronomy is facing critical challenges due to an ever-increasing human-made signal density filling up the radio spectrum. With the rise of satellites, mobile networks, and other wireless technologies, radio telescopes are struggling with radio frequency interference (RFI), which can masquerade, block or distort astronomical signals. In this chapter, we explain where RFI comes from, how it affects observations, and discuss different ways to reduce or remove interference. The techniques presented here reflect the state of the art in real-time RFI mitigation at the time of publication and include methods such as filtering, digital processing, and optimal scheduling. The proposed catalogue also explores new ideas like satellite avoidance through scheduling, the use of intelligent surfaces to block interference, and advanced computer algorithms to clean up data. The chapter also highlights the need for strong cooperation between astronomers and spectrum regulators to protect radio frequencies for future discoveries. By combining technical solutions and better policies, we can help ensure that radio astronomy continues to provide important insights into the universe.</description>

      <title>SatTrack: Software for Evaluating Satellite Interference and Rim-Based Interference Mitigation Using a Reconfigurable Parabolic Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations (e.g., Starlink and Iridium) significantly increase the likelihood of transient, high-power interference events at ground receivers. This report presents SatTrack, a GUI-driven simulation framework that (i) tracks satellite motion relative to a fixed antenna boresight, (ii) predicts reflector gain patterns of a parabolic reflector antenna with a reconfigurable rim of specified size using a physical optics (PO) surface-current model decomposed into fixed and reconfigurable rim regions, and (iii) synthesizes deep, directional nulls using fast rim-weight optimization algorithms. Beyond baseline serial greedy and greedy bit-flip methods, additional files support advanced weight optimization algorithms including simulated annealing and majorization-minimization operating over higher-order complex weight alphabets, enabling deeper null formation. Interference power from satellites is estimated using free-space path loss and an FCC-derived Starlink EIRP versus steering-angle model, and event-level throughput for each satellite is computed using Shannon capacity. Results show simple binary rim control achieves about 40-55 dB of average interference suppression, while advanced optimization methods can exceed 65-70 dB under favorable geometries, with best-case received interference below -220 dBm. We compare no mitigation, satellite muting, and rim-based spatial nulling, showing rim-based nulling approaches muting-level suppression while preserving throughput close to the no-mitigation case. These results highlight both the scalability of rim-based reflector reconfiguration and the fundamental limitation when satellites cross the main lobe.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enabled optical large-baseline interferometry: applications, protocols and feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) offers the potential for unprecedented angular resolution in both astronomical imaging and precision measurements. Classical approaches, however, face significant limitations due to photon loss, background noise, and the requirements for dynamical delay lines over large distances. This document surveys recent developments in quantum-enabled VLBI, which aim to address these challenges using entanglement-assisted protocols, quantum memory storage, and nonlocal measurement techniques. While its application to astronomy is well known, we also examine how these techniques may be extended to geodesy -- specifically, the monitoring of Earth's rotation. Particular attention is given to quantum-enhanced telescope architectures, including repeater-based long baseline interferometry and quantum error-corrected encoding schemes, which offer a pathway toward high-fidelity optical VLBI. To aid the discussion, we also compare specifications for key enabling technologies to current state-of-the-art experimental components, including switching rates, gate times, entanglement distribution rates, and memory lifetimes. By integrating quantum technologies, future interferometric networks may achieve diffraction-limited imaging at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, surpassing the constraints of classical techniques and enabling new precision tests of astrophysical and fundamental physics phenomena.</description>

      <title>200,000+ Deep Learning-inferred Periods of Stellar Variability from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars exhibit a range of variability periods that depend on their mass, age, and evolutionary stage. For space-based photometric data, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated success in recovering and measuring periodic variability from photometric missions like Kepler and TESS. All-sky ground-based surveys can have similar if not longer baselines than space-based missions; however, these datasets are more challenging to work with due to irregular sampling, more complex systematics, and larger data gaps. In this work, we demonstrate that CNNs can be used to derive variability periods from ground-based surveys. From the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, we recover 208,260 variability periods between 1 and 30 days, approximately 60% of which are new detections. We recover periods for active RSCVn, anomalous sub-subgiants, and cool dwarfs that are consistent with previously measured rotation periods, while periods for stars above the Kraft break are generally spurious. We also identify periodic signals in tens of thousands of giant stars that correspond to frequencies of stellar oscillations rather than rotation. Our results highlight that CNNs can be used on sparsely sampled ground-based photometry to recover periodicity. We conclude that the findings of our work are very promising for the potential recovery of hundreds of thousands of stellar rotation periods in data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescopes Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey.</description>

      <title>Towards an Agnostic Algorithm for Sampling Empirical Structure Models: The case of Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to efficiently sample the full space of planetary interior density profiles. Our approach uses as few assumptions as possible to pursue an agnostic algorithm. The algorithm avoids the common Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and instead uses an optimisation-based gradient-descent approach designed for computational efficiency. In this work, we use Uranus and Neptune as test cases and obtain empirical models that provide density and pressure profiles consistent with the observed physical properties (total mass, radius, and gravitational moments). We compare our findings to other work and find that while other studies are generally in line with our findings, they do not cover the entire space of solutions faithfully. Furthermore, we present guidance for modellers that construct Uranus or Neptune interior models with a fixed number of layers. We provide a statistical relation between the steepness classifying a density discontinuity and the resulting number of discontinuities to be expected. For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg$\,$m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune. Our algorithm to efficiently and faithfully investigate the full space of possible interior density profiles can be used to study all planetary objects with gravitational field data.</description>
