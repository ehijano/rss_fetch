      <title>Average Action Efficiency Rises Monotonically in Self-Organizing Systems via Stochastic Least-Action Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organizing systems convert noisy motion into efficient structure, yet a universal, dimensionless measure of this transformation is lacking. We derive the Average Action Efficiency (AAE) - events per total action - from a stochastic path-integral least-action principle. A Lyapunov identity links its monotonic rise to the action variance and the rate of noise reduction, defining growth, saturation, and decay regimes. Agent-based ant foraging and single-molecule ATP-synthase data confirm the predicted sigmoidal rise and plateau. Because AAE needs only an event count and an integrated action, it offers a lightweight metric and design rule for feedback-controlled self-organization across physics, chemistry, biology, and active matter.</description>

      <title>A unifying approach to self-organizing systems interacting via conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.</description>

      <title>Defining and classifying models of groups: The social ontology of higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex systems research, the study of higher-order interactions has exploded in recent years. Researchers have formalized various types of group interactions, such as public goods games, biological contagion, and information broadcasting, showing how higher-order networks can capture group effects more directly than pairwise models. However, equating hyperedges-edges involving more than two agents-with groups can be misleading, as it obscures the polysemous nature of ``group interactions''. For instance, many models of higher-order interactions focus on the internal state of the hyperedge, specifying dynamical rules at the group level. These models often neglect how interactions with external groups can influence behaviors and dynamics within the group. Yet, anthropologists and philosophers remind us that external norms, factors, and forces governing intergroup behavior are essential to defining within-group dynamics. In this paper, we synthesize concepts from social ontology relevant to the emerging physics of higher-order networks. We propose a typology for classifying models of group interactions based on two perspectives. The first focuses on individuals within groups engaging in collective action, where shared agency serves as the binding force. The second adopts a group-first approach, emphasizing institutional facts that extend beyond the specific individuals involved. Building on these perspectives, we introduce four dimensions to classify models of group interactions: persistence, coupling, reducibility, and alignment. For the physics of higher-order networks, we provide a hierarchy of nested mathematical models to explore the complex properties of social groups. We highlight social interactions not yet explored in the literature on higher-order networks and propose future research avenues to foster collaboration between social ontology and the physics of complex systems.</description>
