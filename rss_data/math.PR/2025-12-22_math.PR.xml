      <title>Universal Cancellations in Uniform Random Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vast literature over the past fifteen years has been devoted to the study of the geometric properties of Gaussian random waves. In this work, we investigate the geometric behavior of \emph{uniform random waves}, a much less studied non-Gaussian model in which the $L^2$ norm is constrained to be exactly equal to one in every realization (a normalization that is natural from the standpoint of quantum mechanics). We show that this norm-constrained formulation has deep consequences for the universality of the so-called \emph{Berry's cancellation phenomenon}, as well as for novel high-frequency asymptotic variance estimates. These effects manifest themselves in both local geometric functionals, such as the Lipschitz--Killing curvatures, and global ones, such as the number of connected components above a fixed threshold. A key byproduct of our analysis is a new explicit relation between Hermite expansions and spherical harmonic decompositions for $0$-homogeneous functionals of Gaussian vectors, which enables a systematic chaos-based analysis of non-Gaussian random waves.</description>

      <title>Conditional Expectation Backward Stochastic Differential Equations and Related Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with Conditional Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new type of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), called conditional expectation BSDEs, whose drivers depend not only on the value of the solutions but also on their conditional expectations with respect to a certain sub-{\sigma}-algebra. The collection of these sub-{\sigma}-algebra forms a subfiltration, which stands for partial information that is common for decision making applications. The classical BSDEs and the mean-field BSDEs can be regarded as two special and extreme cases of conditional expectation BSDEs. We establish the well-posedness for conditional expectation BSDEs under mild conditions and discuss the comparison results. Then, we provide an alternative construction for the solutions to conditional reflected BSDEs without the continuity assumption for the subfiltration, which can be seen as the limit of a sequence of penalized conditional expectation BSDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a novel connection between null-recurrent CTMCs and electric networks, offering a systematic classification of null-recurrent behavior based on the first returning speed. By leveraging techniques from electric network theory, we present a general method for estimating the first returning speed of null recurrent birth-death processes and provide some important examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the propagation of chaos and Euler-Maruyama method of DDSDE driven by multiplicative fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in (\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2},1)$. We have not only obtained an upper bound for the error of the Euler-Maruyama method but also verified the correctness of this result via systematic numerical simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principle for the absorption time of the Beta-coalescent via integral functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some aspects of the absorption time of the Beta$(a,b)$-Coalescent starting with $n$ blocks. More precisely, when $a&gt;1$, the absorption time is known to converge to infinity as $n$ goes to infinity, and we prove that it satisfies a large deviation principle. When $a \in (0,1)$, it is known that the coalescent comes down from infinity, and we derive bounds for the convergence in the Kolmogorov distance of the distribution of the absorption time as $n$ goes to infinity. To prove our results we introduce a method, inspired from statistical mechanics, that allows to infer the asymptotic behavior of the Laplace transforms of some integral functionals of the Beta-coalescent as the initial number of blocks $n$ goes to infinity. As a by-product of our proofs we also obtain estimates for the record probabilities of the Beta-coalescent.</description>

      <title>Splitting infinity: a de Finetti game with state-dependent profit rates and singular control for diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a game of resource extraction of a common good under one-dimensional diffusive dynamics with player actions corresponding to singular stochastic control up to absorption at $0$, implying a trade-off between profitable resource extraction and sustainability. Unsurprisingly, immediate extraction of all available resources is an equilibrium. A main result is that we characterize and prove the existence of non-trivial equilibria that do not result in immediate absorption, but instead are attained with both players extracting resources according to a state-dependent rate of threshold type, corresponding to the presence of control only when the state process is in an interval $(b,\infty)$. The underlying assumption is, roughly, that the drift coefficient of the uncontrolled state process grows sufficiently fast in relation to the discount rate, implying that the value for the corresponding one-player problem is infinite. We also study a generalization of the game that allows a state-dependent profit rate integrated against the control processes. In this game we again characterize and prove the existence of non-trivial equilibria of threshold type. In particular, a main novelty is that we find equilibria where the state process is controlled with its own local time such that we have reflection points with associated initial jumps, as well as other points in the state space where the control processes increase in a singular manner (skew points).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the critical inverse temperatures $\beta_c^{\mathbb N}(\alpha)$ and $\beta_c^{\mathbb Z}(\alpha)$ for the one- and two-sided Dyson models are the same when the power of the interaction strength $\alpha$ satisfies $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. We conjecture that this is true also in the remaining case of $\alpha=2$.</description>

      <title>Koenigs functions in the subcritical and critical Markov branching processes with Poisson probability reproduction of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Special functions have always played a central role in physics and in mathematics, arising as solutions of nonlinear differential equations, as well as in the theory of branching processes, which extensively uses probability generating functions. The theory of iteration of real functions leads to limit theorems for the discrete-time and real-time Markov branching processes. The Poisson reproduction of particles in real time is analysed through the integration of the Kolmogorov equation. These results are further extended by employing graphical representations of Koenigs functions under subcritical and critical branching mechanisms. The limit conditional law in the subcritical case and the invariant measure for the critical case are discussed, as well. The obtained explicit solutions contain the exponential Bell polynomials and the modified exponential-integral function $\rm{Ein} (z)$.</description>

      <title>Tightness of Stationary Nodal Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rescaled nodal volume field $\xi_R$ associated with a smooth, stationary Gaussian field on $[0,R]^d$, whose covariance satisfies adequate integrability conditions. Our main theorem shows that, as $R \to \infty$, the process $\xi_R$ converges in distribution, in an appropriate space of c\`adl\`ag mappings, to a standard Brownian sheet. The proof relies on a recent finite-dimensional CLT by Ancona, Gass, Letendre, and Stecconi (2025), as well as on a multidimensional Kolmogorov--Chentsov criterion for tightness due to Bickel and Wichura (1971). The application of the latter requires new moment estimates that are of independent interest. Our results stand in sharp contrast with Berry's random wave model, where the required integrability conditions fail and the question of tightness remains open.</description>

      <title>The stable trees revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new, relatively simple, line-breaking construction of the $\alpha$-stable tree which realises its random finite-dimensional distributions. This is a direct analogue of Aldous' line-breaking construction of the Brownian continuum random tree, which is based on an inhomogeneous Poisson process. Here, we replace the deterministic rate function from the Brownian setting by a random rate process, given by a certain measure-changed $(\alpha-1)$-stable subordinator. Rather than attaching uniformly, the line-segments now connect to locations chosen with probability proportional to the sizes of the jumps of the rate process.
  We also give a new proof of an invariance principle originally due to Duquesne, which states that the family tree of a Bienaym\'e branching process with critical offspring distribution in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law (for $\alpha \in (1,2))$, conditioned to have $n$ vertices, converges on rescaling distances appropriately to the $\alpha$-stable tree. Our proof makes use of a discrete line-breaking construction of the branching process tree, which we show converges to our continuous line-breaking construction.</description>

      <title>Stochastic transport equation with L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stochastic transport equation with globally $\beta$-H\"older continuous and bounded vector field driven by a non-degenerate pure-jump L\'evy noise of $\alpha$-stable type. Whereas the deterministic transport equation may lack uniqueness, we prove the existence and pathwise uniqueness of a weak solution in the presence of a multiplicative pure jump noise, assuming $\frac{\alpha}{2}+\beta&gt;1$. Notably, our results cover the entire range $\alpha \in (0,2)$, including the supercritical regime $\alpha\in(0,1)$ where the driving noise exhibits notoriously weak regularization. A key step of our strategy is the development of a \emph{sharp} $C^{1+\delta}$-diffeomorphism
  and new regularity results for the Jacobian determinant of the stochastic flow associated to its stochastic characteristic equation. These novel probabilistic results are of independent interest and constitute a substantial component of our work. Our results are the first full generalization of the celebrated paper by Flandoli, Gubinelli, and Priola [Invent. Math. 2010] from the Brownian motion to the pure jump L\'evy noise. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be the first example of a partial differential equation of fluid dynamics where well-posedness is restored by the influence of a non-degenerate pure-jump noise.</description>

      <title>Pathwise uniqueness by noise for singular stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathwise uniqueness for stochastic PDEs with drift in differential form is a main open problem in the recent literature on regularisation by noise. This paper establishes a self-contained theory in the framework of stochastic evolution equations on separable Hilbert spaces and provides a first result to address such an issue. The singularity of the drift allows to achieve novel uniqueness results for several classes of examples, ranging from fluid-dynamics to phase-separation models.</description>

      <title>On exponentially height-penalized random trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$, a $\textit{$\mu$-height-biased tree of size $n$}$ is a random plane tree $\mathbf{\mathbf{T}}_n$ with $n$ vertices with law given by $\mathbb{P}(\mathbf{T}=t) \propto e^{-\mu h(t)}$, where $t$ ranges over fixed plane trees with $n$ vertices, and $h(t)$ is the height of $t$. Fix a sequence $(\mu_n)_{n \ge 1}$ of real numbers, and for $n \ge 1$ let $\mathbf{T}_n$ be a $\mu$-height-biased tree of size $n$. Durhuus and \"Unel (2023) described the asymptotic behaviour of $h(\mathbf{T}_n)$ when $\mu_n \equiv \mu \in \mathbb{R}$ is fixed. In this work, we extend their results to arbitrary sequences of positive parameters depending on $n$. Most notably, we show that such a tree behaves like a height-biased Continuum Random Tree (CRT) when $\mu_n$ is of order $1/\sqrt{n}$; that its height is asymptotically $(2\pi^2n/\mu_n)^{1/3}$ when $\mu_n$ is of larger order than $1/\sqrt{n}$ and of smaller order than $n$; and that its height converges to a fixed constant when $\mu_n$ is of order at least $n$, with some random jumps under specific conditions on $\mu_n$. We additionally prove various results on second order behaviours, and large deviation principles for the height, for different regimes of $\mu_n$. Finally, we describe new statistics of these trees, covering their widths, their root degrees, and the local structure around their roots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $N$ i.i.d. samples from a probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbf{R}^d$, we study the rate of convergence of the empirical measure $\mu_N \to \mu$ in the negative Sobolev space $W^{-\alpha, p}$. When $W^{-\alpha, p}$ contains point measures (i.e. when $\alpha p &gt; (p-1)d$), we show $\mathbf{E} \| \mu_N - \mu \|_{W^{-\alpha, p}}^p \leq C_d / N^{p/2}$ for an explicit dimensional constant $C_d$, and obtain a Gaussian tail bound. When $0 &lt; \alpha p \leq d(p-1)$, we prove a similar result for Gaussian regularizations.</description>

      <title>Zeros of polynomial powers under the heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of zeros of high polynomial powers under the heat flow. For any fixed polynomial $P(z)$, we prove that the empirical zero distribution of its heat-evolved $n$-th power converges to a distribution on the complex plane as $n$ tends to infinity. We describe this limit distribution $\mu_t$ as a function of the time parameter $t$ of the heat evolution: For small time, zeros start to spread out in approximately semicircular distributions, then intricate curves start to form and merge, until for large time, the zero distribution approaches a widespread semicircle law through the initial center of mass. The Stieltjes transform of the limit distribution $\mu_t$ satisfies a self-consistent equation and a Burgers' equation. The present paper deals with general complex-rooted polynomials for which, in contrast to the real-rooted case, no free-probabilistic representation for $\mu_t$ is available.</description>

Abstract: In classical percolation theory, the van den Berg-Kesten (BK) inequality is a fundamental tool that shows that disjoint events induce negative conditionings on each other. The inequality also holds in the context of last passage percolation (LPP), which is the zero temperature limit of polymer models and an important subclass in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Recently, an analog of the BK inequality was discovered in the context of zero temperature line ensembles and the scaling limit of LPP, where it was used to study upper tail probabilities of the weight and the scaling limit of geodesics under such upper tail conditionings. However, while it has become apparent that such an inequality in the positive temperature setting would have a number of applications, it seems likely that a direct generalization of the zero temperature inequality would not hold. In this work we prove a version of the BK inequality for the KPZ line ensemble and the continuum directed random polymer. We do so by working with the log gamma polymer, making use of its integrability and the geometric RSK correspondence. Our inequality serves as a key input in analyzing the KPZ line ensemble and proving sharp upper tail estimates of the KPZ equation in arXiv:2208.08922, and proving convergence of the continuum directed random polymer to Brownian bridge under the upper tail event in arXiv:2311.12009. The crucial role of integrability in the validity of such an inequality is highlighted via a counter-example for a non-integrable model.</description>

      <title>Generating temporal networks with the Ascona model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new sampling method for continuous-time temporal networks based on queueing processes. In particular, we focus on a Markovian version of the model where the links between nodes are Poisson distributed in time and have exponential duration. We highlight the stochastic properties of these temporal structures and leverage them to design synthetic temporal networks with a controllable level of smoothness, which follow patterns relevant for the validation and interpretation of methods for community, scale, change-point, and periodicity detection. Additionally, we show that imposing assortativity constraints on the samples leads to a continuous-time generalization of stochastic block models. Finally, we describe how variations of the model can be used to sample alternative types of structure and temporal networks, especially discrete-time ones.</description>

      <title>On the abelian structure of noncompetitive chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are foundational models for describing complex biochemical processes. We study noncompetitive CRNs, a class of networks whose static states are rate-independent, and that can implement ReLU neural networks. A central contribution of this work is that noncompetitive CRNs are special instances of Abelian networks (ANs) a well-established framework for self-organized criticality. CRNs of interest in biochemistry and systems biology are embedded in complex networks so that local CRNs have to respond to internal and environmental cues. We describe the network's response to such perturbations using a sandpile Markov chain whose state space is the set of CRN's static states, from where no reaction is possible. The addition of molecules to a static state induces reactions that move the system into a new static state. For noncompetitive CRNs of finite state space, we use AN theory to get that the fraction of static states that are recurrent is in one to one correspondence with the critical group of the AN.
  Overall, this work establishes a unified algebraic and probabilistic framework for analyzing the long-term behavior of noncompetitive CRNs.</description>

      <title>Relative arbitrage problem under eigenvalue lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new formulation of the relative arbitrage problem from stochastic portfolio theory that asks for a time horizon beyond which arbitrage relative to the market exists in all ``sufficiently volatile'' markets. In our formulation, ``sufficiently volatile'' is interpreted as a lower bound on an ordered eigenvalue of the instantaneous covariation matrix, a quantity that has been studied extensively in the empirical finance literature. Upon framing the problem in the language of stochastic optimal control, we characterize the time horizon in question through the unique upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE). In a special case, this PDE amounts to the arrival time formulation of the Ambrosio-Soner co-dimension mean curvature flow. Beyond the setting of stochastic portfolio theory, the stochastic optimal control problem is analyzed for arbitrary compact, possibly non-convex, domains, thanks to a boundedness assumption on the instantaneous covariation matrix.</description>

      <title>Study of a TPFA scheme for the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with constraint though numerical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution provides numerical experiments for a finite volume scheme for an approximation of the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The approximation is done by a Yosida approximation of the subdifferential operator. The problem is set on a polygonal bounded domain in two or three dimensions. The non-linear character of the projection term induces challenges to implement the scheme. To this end, we provide a splitting method for the finite volume scheme. We show that the splitting method is accurate. The computational error estimates induce that the squared $L^2$-error w.r.t. time is of order $1$ as long as the noise term is small enough. For larger noise terms the order of convergence w.r.t. time might become worse.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning for the high-order sampling of the invariant distribution of parabolic semilinear SPDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a class of ergodic parabolic semilinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with gradient structure, we introduce a preconditioning technique and design high-order integrators for the approximation of the invariant distribution. The preconditioning yields improved temporal regularity of the dynamics while preserving the invariant distribution and allows the application of postprocessed integrators. For the semilinear heat equation driven by space-time white noise in dimension $1$, we obtain new temporal integrators with orders $1$ and $2$ for sampling the invariant distribution with a minor overcost compared to the standard semilinear implicit Euler method of order $1/2$. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and illustrate the efficiency of the approach.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for a finite volume scheme of a stochastic non-linear parabolic equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a two-point flux approximation finite volume scheme with respect to space and the variational solution. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>

      <title>Sharp Favard length of random Cantor sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for a large class of planar $1$-dimensional random fractals $S$, the Favard length $\Fav(S(r))$ of the neighborhood $S(r)$ is comparable to $\log^{-1}(1/r)$, matching a universal lower bound; up to now, this was only known in expectation for a few concrete models. In particular, we show that there exist $1$-Ahlfors regular sets with the fastest possible Favard length decay. For a wide class of planar one-dimensional ``grid random fractals'', including fractal percolation and its Ahlfors-regular variants, we further show that $\Fav(S(r))/\log(1/r)$ converges almost surely, and we identify the limit explicitly. Furthermore, we prove that for some $1$-dimensional Ahlfors-regular random fractals $S$, the Favard length of $S(r)$ decays instead like $\log\log(1/r)/\log(1/r)$, showing that the $1/\log(1/r)$ decay is not universal among random fractals, as might be expected from previous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate importance sampling methods for rare-event simulation in diffusion processes. We show, from a large-deviation perspective, that the resulting importance sampling estimator is log-efficient. This connection is established via a stochastic optimal control formulation, and the associated Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation is derived using dynamic programming. To approximate the optimal control, we adopt a spectral parameterization and employ the cross-entropy method to estimate the parameters by solving a least-squares problem. Finally, we present a numerical example to validate the effectiveness of the cross-entropy approach and the efficiency of the resulting importance sampling estimator.</description>

      <title>Near-Maturity Asymptotics of Critical Prices of American Put Options under Exponential L\'{e}vy Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the near-maturity ($t\rightarrow T^{-}$) convergence rate of the optimal early-exercise price $b(t)$ of an American put under an exponential L\'{e}vy model with a {\it nonzero} Brownian component. Two important settings, not previous covered in the literature, are considered. In the case that the optimal exercise price converges to the strike price ($b(T^{-})=K$), we contemplate models with negative jumps of unbounded variation (i.e., processes that exhibit high activity of negative jumps or sudden falls in asset prices). In the second case, when the optimal exercise price tend to a value lower than $K$, we consider infinite activity jumps (though still of bounded variations), extending existing results for models with finite jump activity (finitely many jumps in any finite interval). In both cases, we show that $b(T^{-})-b(t)$ is of order $\sqrt{T-t}$ with explicit constants proportionality. Furthermore, we also derive the second-order near-maturity expansion of the American put price around the critical price along a certain parabolic branch.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the equivalence of definitions for conditional Poisson processes, Cox processes, and stochastic intensities of point processes on the real line. We show that Watanabe's characterisation of conditional Poisson processes in terms of local martingales is necessary and sufficient. Additionally, we consider conditions enabling the measure change method a la Girsanov to alter the intensity of Cox processes to a desired new target intensity, e.g. for the probability reference approach in filtering. Such a measure change exists if a corresponding stochastic exponential is a proper martingale. We show that this holds if the new locally integrable target intensity is the product of the original intensity and another non-negative process.</description>

      <title>Langevin dynamics of lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Langevin dynamics of various lattice formulations of the Yang--Mills--Higgs model, with an inverse Yang--Mills coupling $\beta$ and a Higgs parameter $\kappa$. The Higgs component is either a bounded field taking values in a compact target space, or an unbounded field taking values in a vector space in which case the model also has a Higgs mass parameter $m$. We study the regime where $(\beta,\kappa)$ are small in the first case or $(\beta,\kappa/m)$ are small in the second case. We prove the exponential ergodicity of the dynamics on the whole lattice via functional inequalities. We establish exponential decay of correlations for a broad class of observables, namely, the infinite volume measure exhibits a strictly positive mass gap. Moreover, when the target space of the Higgs field is compact, appropriately rescaled observables exhibit factorized correlations in the large $N$ limit. These extend the earlier results \cite{SZZ22} on pure lattice Yang--Mills to the case with a coupled Higgs field.
  Unlike pure lattice Yang--Mills where the field is always bounded, in the case where the coupled Higgs component is unbounded, the control of its behavior is much harder and requires new techniques. Our approach involves a disintegration argument and a delicate analysis of correlations to effectively control the unbounded Higgs component.</description>

      <title>Viscous shock fluctuations in KPZ</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study ``V-shaped'' solutions to the KPZ equation, those having opposite asymptotic slopes $\theta$ and $-\theta$, with $\theta&gt;0$, at positive and negative infinity, respectively. Answering a question of Janjigian, Rassoul-Agha, and Sepp\"al\"ainen, we show that the spatial increments of V-shaped solutions cannot be statistically stationary in time. This completes the classification of statistically time-stationary spatial increments for the KPZ equation by ruling out the last case left by those authors.
  To show that these V-shaped time-stationary measures do not exist, we study the location of the corresponding ``viscous shock,'' which, roughly speaking, is the location of the bottom of the V. We describe the limiting rescaled fluctuations, and in particular show that the fluctuations of the shock location are not tight, for both stationary and flat initial data. We also show that if the KPZ equation is started with V-shaped initial data, then the long-time limits of the time-averaged laws of the spatial increments of the solution are mixtures of the laws of the spatial increments of $x\mapsto B(x)+\theta x$ and $x\mapsto B(x)-\theta x$, where $B$ is a standard two-sided Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: We study the half-space KPZ equation with a Neumann boundary condition, starting from stationary Brownian initial data. We derive a variance identity that links the fluctuations of the height function to the transversal fluctuations of a half-space polymer model. Utilizing this identity, we obtain estimates for the polymer endpoints, leading to optimal fluctuation exponents for the height function in both the subcritical and critical regimes, as well as an optimal upper bound for the fluctuation exponents in the extended critical regime. We also compute the average growth rate as a function of the boundary parameter.</description>

      <title>Zeros and critical points of Gaussian fields: cumulants asymptotics and limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^k$ be a smooth centered stationary Gaussian field and $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded Borel set. In this paper, we determine the asymptotics as $R \to \infty$ of all the cumulants of the $(d-k)$-dimensional volume of $f^{-1}(0) \cap R\mathcal{B}$. When $k=1$, we obtain similar asymptotics for the number of critical points of $f$ in $R\mathcal{B}$. Our main hypotheses are some regularity and non-degeneracy of the field, as well as mild integrability conditions on the first derivatives of its covariance kernel. As corollaries of these cumulants estimates, we deduce a strong Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the nodal volume (resp.~the number of critical points) of a regular and non-degenerate enough field whose covariance decays fast enough at infinity. Our results hold more generally for a one-parameter family $(f_R)$ of Gaussian fields admitting a stationary local scaling limit as $R \to \infty$, for example Kostlan polynomials in the large degree limit. They also hold for the random measures of integration over the vanishing locus of $f_R$ as $R \to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>Fractional diffusion in convex domains and reflected isotropic stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the fractional diffusion limit of the kinetic scattering equation with diffusive boundary condition in a strongly convex bounded domain $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. According to the nature of the boundary condition, two types of fractional heat equations may arise at the limit, corresponding to two types of isotropic stable processes reflected in $\mathcal{D}$. In both cases, when the process tries to jump across the boundary, it is stopped at the unique point where $\partial\mathcal{D}$ intersects the line segment defined by the attempted jump. It then leaves the boundary either continuously (for the first type) or by a power-law distributed jump (for the second type). The construction of these processes is done via an It\^o synthesis: we concatenate their excursions in the domain, which are obtained by translating, rotating and stopping the excursions of some stable processes reflected in the half-space. The key ingredient in this procedure is the construction of the boundary processes, i.e. the processes time-changed by their local time on the boundary, which solve stochastic differential equations driven by some Poisson measures of excursions. The well-posedness of these boundary processes relies on delicate estimates involving some geometric inequalities and the laws of the undershoot and overshoot of the excursion when it leaves the domain. We show that these reflected Markov processes are Markov and Feller, we study their infinitesimal generator and we write down the reflected fractional heat equations satisfied by their time-marginals.</description>

      <title>No arbitrage assumption implies the differentiability of derivative pricing function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we show necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to transform a continuous Markov semimartingale to a semimartingale. As a result, the no-arbitrage principle guarantees the differentiability of asset prices with respect to the underlying noise, if the asset prices are continuous and the underlying noise is a continuous Markov semimartingale.</description>

      <title>Effective Gaps between singular values of non-stationary matrix products subject to non-degenerate noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the singular values and Lyapunov exponents of non-stationary random matrix products subject to small, absolutely continuous, additive noise. Consider a fixed sequence of matrices of bounded norm. Independently perturb the matrices by additive noise distributed according to Lebesgue measure on matrices with norm less than $\epsilon$. Then the gaps between the logarithms of the singular values of the random product of $n$ of these matrices are all of order at least $\epsilon^2n$, both in expectation; and almost surely for large $n$.
  To prove this, we develop recent work of Gorodetski and Kleptsyn \cite{gorodetski2023nonstationary}. That paper gives a very flexible method, based on relative entropy, for showing that a non-stationary product of matrices in SL(d,R) has a strictly positive Lyapunov exponent. We extend their work in two ways, firstly by making the estimates quantitative in the context of absolutely continuous distributions, giving the universal estimates described above; and secondly by developing a fibered version of their methods, working on flag bundles instead of the projective space to estimate gaps between arbitrary consecutive exponents. Our methods retain much of the flexibility of those of Gorodetski and Kleptsyn, and we hope that they will find application in other related problems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-compactness for dominated kernels with application to quasi-stationary distribution theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a domination principle for positive operators, which provides an upper bound on the essential spectral radius and yields quasi-compactness criteria on weighted supremum spaces with Lyapunov type functions and local domination. In particular, for kernels acting on such spaces, we obtain $r_{ess}(P)\leq r_{ess}(Q)$ whenever $0\leq P\leq Q$ as kernels, a property that is known to fail in general on $L^p$ spaces, $p&lt;+\infty$.
  We then describe the asymptotics of iterates of positive quasi-compact kernels, showing convergence, after suitable renormalization, towards a finite decomposition over eigenelements, and we study the long-time behaviour of quasi-compact continuous-time semigroups. For the latter, we prove that measurability in time and quasi-compactness at a single positive time imply quasi-compactness at all times, exclude periodic behaviour, and entail convergence to eigenelements as time goes to infinity.
  Finally, we apply these results to absorbed Markov processes and quasi-stationary distributions. In this setting, the domination and Lyapunov criteria allow one to work in reducible situations and to relax classical regularity assumptions, for instance replacing strong Feller conditions by domination from a regular kernel or by locally uniformly integrable densities on suitable weighted supremum spaces.</description>

      <title>Recurrence, transience and anti-concentration of Rademacher random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rademacher random walk associated with a deterministic sequence $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ is the walk which starts at zero and, at step $i$, independently steps either up or down by $a_i$ with equal probability. We continue the study begun by Bhattacharya and Volkov in 2023 of the transience or recurrence of one-dimensional Rademacher random walks. In particular, we show that if the sequence of step sizes is bounded, the walk is weakly recurrent, meaning that it returns infinitely often to a random finite interval, while if the step sizes tend to infinity arbitrarily slowly, the walk may be transient. On the other hand, using a construction with integer step sizes, we show that the step sizes may grow arbitrarily fast and still give a weakly recurrent random walk. We also show, using a construction with non-integer step sizes, that the same conclusion holds even if we restrict to strictly increasing step sizes. However, we prove that if $a_n = n^{\alpha + o(1)}$ for some $\alpha &gt; 1/2$, then the walk is transient. We show that the bound on $\alpha$ is tight by giving an example where $a_n = \Theta(n^{1/2})$ and the walk is weakly recurrent.</description>

      <title>Intensity doubling for Brownian loop-soups in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an intensity doubling feature of critical Brownian loop-soups on the cable-graphs of ${\mathbb Z}^d$ for $d \ge 7$ that can be described as follows: In the box $[-N, N]^d$ (and with a probability that goes to $1$ as $N$ goes to infinity), the set of all clusters of Brownian loops that do contain proper self-avoiding cycles of diameter comparable to $N$ can be decomposed into two identically distributed families: (a) The collection of clusters that do contain a large Brownian loop from the loop-soup (and therefore do automatically contain such a large cycle) (b) The collection of clusters that contain no macroscopic loop from the loop-soup (more specifically, no loop of diameter greater than $N^{\beta}$ when $\beta &gt; 4/ (d-2)$ is fixed) but nevertheless contain a large cycle. In particular, due to the fact that these two families are asymptotically identically distributed, large cycles formed in case (b) by chains of small Brownian loops (i.e., all of diameter much smaller than $N$) will look like large Brownian loops themselves, and form a second independent "ghost" critical loop-soup in the scaling limit. Reformulated in terms of the Gaussian free field on such cable-graphs, this shows that large cycles in the collection of its sign clusters will converge in the scaling limit to a Brownian loop-soup with twice the usual critical intensity. This result had been conjectured by the first author in arXiv:2209.07901 [math.PR] ; our proof builds heavily on the second author's switching property for such loop-soups from arXiv:2502.06754 [math.PR] .</description>

      <title>Towards a Mathematical Theory of Adaptive Memory: From Time-Varying to Responsive Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops a comprehensive mathematical theory for a class of stochastic processes whose local regularity adapts dynamically in response to their own state. We first introduce and rigorously analyze a time-varying fractional Brownian motion (TV-fBm) with a deterministic, H\"older-continuous Hurst exponent function. Key properties are established, including its exact variance scaling law, precise local increment asymptotics, local non-determinism, large deviation asymptotics for its increments, and a covariance structure that admits a closed-form hypergeometric representation. We then define a novel class of processes termed Responsive Fractional Brownian Motion (RfBm). Here,the Hurst exponent is governed by a Lipschitz-H\"older response function depending on the process state itself, creating an intrinsic feedback mechanism between state and memory. We establish the well-posedness of this definition, prove pathwise H\"older regularity of the induced instantaneous scaling exponent, and analyze associated cumulative memory processes along with their asymptotic convergence. The mathematical structure of RfBm naturally gives rise to a continuous-time, pathwise attention mechanism. We show that its kernel induces a well-defined attention weight distribution, derive fundamental bounds for these weights, and quantify the stability of attentional allocation through residence measures and volatility functionals. This work develops a stochastic-process-theoretic framework for concepts central to adaptive memory and content-sensitive information processing, offering a mathematically grounded perspective that may complement existing empirical approaches.</description>

      <title>Optimal Ratcheting of Dividends with Irreversible Reinsurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an insurance company that faces two key constraints: a ratcheting dividend constraint and an irreversible reinsurance constraint. The company allocates part of its reserve to pay dividends to its shareholders while strategically purchasing reinsurance for its claims. The ratcheting dividend constraint ensures that dividend cuts are prohibited at any time. The irreversible reinsurance constraint ensures that reinsurance contracts cannot be prematurely terminated or sold to external entities. The dividend rate and reinsurance level are modeled as nondecreasing processes, thereby satisfying the constraints. Claims are modeled using a Brownian risk model. The main objective is to maximize the cumulative expected discounted dividend payouts until the time of ruin. The reinsurance and dividend levels are restricted to a finite set. The optimal value function is shown to be the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. A threshold strategy is constructed and shown to be optimal. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the optimality conditions and optimal strategies.</description>

      <title>The Return Times Theorem, Auto-Correlation and Sequences with an Empty Fourier-Bohr Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07453v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the proof by J. Bourgain, H. Furstenberg, Y. Katznelson and D.S. Ornstein of their return times theorem [2] and lights a corner in it regarding the role of auto-correlation. As for pointwise convergence, this was already observed in [5], and here we exploit the opportunity to write down the proof. This yields a more intrinsic characterization of the sequences satisfying the pointwise theorem. Then we proceed and obtain a characterization linked to auto-correlation also to sequences satisfying the mean theorem - by that theorem those were already known to be exactly the sequences with an empty Fourier-Bohr spectrum. Some further investigation is done and examples are provided regarding generic sequences satisfying the pointwise theorem for which the measure on the circle that the auto-correlation function represents (by Fourier transform) is not atomless, and also regarding the existence of sequences that satisfy the mean theorem but not the pointwise one.</description>

      <title>A measure-valued HJB perspective on Bayesian optimal adaptive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bayesian adaptive optimal stochastic control problem where a hidden static signal has a non-separable influence on the drift of a noisy observation. Being allowed to control the specific form of this dependence, we aim at optimising a cost functional depending on the posterior distribution of the hidden signal. Our setup is in sharp contrast to existing work: we include costs that depend on the full posterior distribution in a form that admits a large class of non-linear relationships. Expressing the dynamics of this posterior distribution in the observation filtration, we embed our problem into a genuinely infinite-dimensional stochastic control problem using measure-valued martingales. We address this problem by use of viscosity theory and approximation arguments. Specifically, we show equivalence to a corresponding weak formulation, characterise the optimal value of the problem in terms of the unique continuous viscosity solution of an associated HJB equation, and construct a piecewise constant and arbitrarily-close-to-optimal control to our main problem of study. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also provide a novel stability result for a class of measure-valued SDEs which we believe is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the recently introduced inhomogeneous $n$-species $t$-PushTASEP, a long-range stochastic process on a periodic lattice. A Baxter-type formula is established, expressing the Markov matrix as an alternating sum of commuting transfer matrices over all the fundamental representations of $U_t(\widehat{sl}_{n+1})$. This superposition acts as an inclusion-exclusion principle, selectively extracting the sequential particle transitions characteristic of the PushTASEP, while canceling forbidden channels. The homogeneous specialization connects the PushTASEP to ASEP, showing that the two models share eigenstates and a common integrability structure.</description>

      <title>Conditioned stochastic stability of equilibrium states on uniformly hyperbolic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditioned stochastic stability of equilibrium states for H\"older potentials on uniformly hyperbolic sets. While standard stochastic stability characterises measures on attractors, we analyse the statistics of transient dynamics on non-attracting sets by conditioning small random perturbations of the dynamics to not escape from our regions of interest. We prove that as the noise intensity vanishes, the quasi-ergodic measure of the $e^\phi$-weighted process generated by $\e$-small random perturbations of the deterministic dynamics converges to the unique equilibrium state associated with the potential $\phi - \log \left|\det \left. D T\right|_{E^u}\right|$. The results are obtained via perturbative spectral analysis of transfer operators acting on anisotropic Banach spaces and topological hyperbolic dynamics arguments. Furthermore, we extend this framework globally to Axiom A diffeomorphisms with multiple basic sets using dynamical filtrations. This work provides a rigorous characterisation of natural measures on uniformly hyperbolic repellers, which are fundamental in the context of transient chaos.</description>

      <title>Variations of the Hardy Z-Function and the Montgomery Pair Correlation Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1973 Montgomery formulated the pair correlation conjecture, predicting that the local spacing statistics of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function coincide with those of eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\mathcal{RH}_N(\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with an admissible probability measure with smooth, positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $\beta=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$.</description>
