      <title>Phase controlled multi-terminal Josephson junction in ternary hybrid nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents multiterminal Josephson junctions in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor InAsSb-Al nanocrosses. Hybrid nanocrosses are grown using molecular beam epitaxy and are formed through As-assisted merging of oppositely directed InAsSb nanowires. We explain this complex ternary merging mechanism using a temperature-dependent phase diagram and investigate the detailed crystal structure with atomic-resolution imaging. The hybrid nanoscrosses enabled the fabrication of multiterminal Josephson junction devices, which were characterized at low temperatures. The supercurrent through each terminal combination was measured as a function of the density in the junction and the relative phase of the terminals, which was controlled by an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced switching of magnetisation in the epsilon-near-zero regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of controlling spins using ultrashort light and strain pulses has triggered intense discussions about the mechanisms responsible for magnetic re-ordering. All-optical magnetisation switching can be achieved through ultrafast heat-driven demagnetisation or transient modifications of magnetic anisotropy. During the phononic switching of magnetic dielectrics, however, mid-infrared optical excitations can modify the crystal environment via both the thermal quenching of anisotropy and the generation of strain respectively, with the relative distinction between these thermal and non-thermal processes remaining an open question. Here, we examine the effect of mid-infrared pulses tuned to the frequency of optical phonon resonances on the labyrinthine domain structure of a cobalt-doped yttrium iron garnet film. We find that the labyrinthine domains are transformed into stable parallel stripes, and quantitative micromagnetic calculations demonstrate this stems predominantly from a partial quenching of the anisotropy. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, we find that this heat-facilitated process of magnetisation switching is spectrally strongest not at the maximum of absorbed optical energy but rather at the epsilon-near-zero points. Our results reveal that the epsilon-near-zero condition provides an alternative pathway for laser-driven control of magnetisation, even when the underlying mechanism is primarily thermal.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Valent Ce Disrupts Magnetic Ordering in CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed valency in intermetallics with lanthanide cations is well established as a pathway to unusual charge transport, complex magnetism, and superconductivity. In this work, we report a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties of the mixed valent compound CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterize CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$ as a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) compound with mixed-valent Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$ on a single crystallographic site. $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy indicates that the Fe sublattice is nonmagnetic, in direct contrast with recent reports of this compound. Low-temperature electrical resistivity and heat capacity measurements show no evidence of magnetic ordering, and a modest Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma$) of 22.7 mJ/mol$\cdot$K$^2$ make extensive Kondo hybridization unlikely. DC and AC magnetic susceptibility data suggest short-range magnetic order at $\sim$5.2 and 7.6 K with no frequency dependence, ruling out canonical spin-glass behavior in this compound. Additionally, the magnetic susceptibility data does not contain any broad features that are typically associated with an intermediate valence state in Ce, suggesting either high-temperature valence fluctuation or a different mechanism of mixed valency. This work demonstrates that mixed-valent Ce inhibits magnetic ordering in CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$ and provides a broader picture for how to analyze short-range spin interactions in Q1D intermetallics.</description>

      <title>Preparation and evaluation of alexandrite, forsterite, and topaz substrates for the epitaxial growth of rutile oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-insulator transitions and superconductivity in rutile-structured oxides hold promise for advanced electronic applications, yet their thin film synthesis is severely hindered by limited substrate options. Here, we present three single- crystalline substrates, BeAl2O4, Mg2SiO4, and Al2SiO4(F,OH)2, prepared via optimized thermal and chemical treatments to achieve atomically smooth surfaces suitable for epitaxial growth. Atomic force microscopy confirms atomic step-and-terrace surface morphologies, and oxide molecular-beam epitaxy growth on these substrates demonstrates successful heteroepitaxy of rutile TiO2, VO2, NbO2, and RuO2 films. Among these unconventional substrates, BeAl2O4 exhibits exceptional thermal and chemical stability, making it a versatile substrate candidate. These findings introduce new substrate platforms that facilitate strain engineering and exploration of rutile oxide thin films, potentially advancing the study of their strain-dependent physical properties.</description>

      <title>Review of the tight-binding method applicable to the properties of moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring a wide range of ex- otic quantum phenomena. Unlike angstrom-scale materials, the moir\'e length-scale system contains a large number of atoms, and its electronic structure is significantly modulated by the lattice relaxation. These features pose a huge theoretical challenge. Among the available theoretical approaches, tight-binding (TB) methods are widely employed to predict the electronic, transport, and optical properties of systems such as twisted graphene, twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and related moir\'e materials. In this review, we pro- vide a comprehensive overview of atomistic TB Hamiltonians and the numerical techniques commonly used to model graphene-based, TMD-based and hBN-based moir\'e superlattices. We also discuss the connection between atomistic TB descriptions and effective low-energy continuum models. Two examples of different moir\'e materials and geometries are provided to emphasize the advantages of the TB methods. This review is intended to serve as a theoretical and practical guide for those seeking to apply TB methods to the study of various properties of moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Fracture Nonreciprocity at the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal intrinsic fracture nonreciprocity, manifesting as directional asymmetry in crack resistance, in two-dimensional heterostructures engineered through lattice-mismatched interfaces. Density-functional theory combined with machine-learning molecular dynamics show that intrinsic lattice mismatch between bonded component crystals imprints asymmetric prestrain states at crack tips, governing bond-breaking thresholds through charge redistribution. The failure criterion obeys a universal exponential scaling law between normalized charge density and bond strain, insensitive to bonding chemistry and local atomic environment. The magnitude of nonreciprocity scales systematically with lattice mismatch, reaching 49% at 10% mismatch. Validation across hexagonal, square, rectangular, and oblique two-dimensional lattices confirms universality, establishing interface strain engineering as a general design principle that bridges electronic structure to nanoscale failure, enabling rational design of damage-tolerant nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Disorder-broadened topological Hall phase and anomalous Hall scaling in FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures that are promising candidates for low-power spintronic memory and logic devices. Realizing skyrmion-based devices requires an understanding of how structural disorder affects their stability and transport properties. This study uses Ne$^{+}$ ion irradiation at fluences from $10^{11}$ to $10^{14}$ ions-cm$^{-2}$ to systematically vary defect densities in 80 nm epitaxial FeGe films and quantify the resulting modifications to magnetic phase boundaries and electronic scattering. Temperature- and field-dependent Hall measurements reveal that increasing disorder progressively extends the topological Hall signal from a narrow window near 200\~K in pristine films down to 4\~K at the highest fluence, with peak amplitude more than doubling. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect transitions from quadratic Berry curvature scaling to linear skew scattering behavior, with the skew coefficient increasing threefold. These results establish quantitative correlations between defect concentration, skyrmion phase space, and transport mechanisms in a chiral magnet. It demonstrates that ion-beam modification provides systematic control over both topological texture stability and electrical detectability.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Terahertz Photoconductivity and Near-Field Imaging of Nanoscale Inhomogeneities in Multilayer Epitaxial Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study broadband terahertz (THz) conductivity and ultrafast photoconductivity spectra in lithographically fabricated multilayer epitaxial graphene nanoribbons grown on C- face of 6H-SiC substrate. THz near-field spectroscopy reveals local conductivity variations across nanoscale structural inhomogeneities such as wrinkles and grain boundaries within the multilayer graphene. Ultrabroadband THz far-field spectroscopy (0.15-16 THz) distinguishes doped graphene layers near the substrate from quasi-neutral layers (QNLs) further from the substrate. Temperature-dependent THz conductivity spectra are dominated by intra-band transitions both in the doped and QNLs. Photoexcitation then alters mainly the response of the QNLs: these exhibit a very high carrier mobility and a large positive THz photoconductivity with picosecond lifetime. The response of QNLs strongly depends on the carrier temperature $T_c$: the scattering time drops by an order of magnitude down to ~10 fs upon an increase of $T_c$ from 50 K to $T_c &gt;$ 1000 K, which is attributed to an enhanced electron-electron and electron- phonon scattering and to an interaction of electrons with mid-gap states.</description>

      <title>Probing the atomic dynamics of ultrafast melting with femtosecond electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melting is an everyday phase transition that is determined by thermodynamic parameters like temperature and pressure. In contrast, ultrafast melting is governed by the microscopic response to a rapid energy input and, thus, can reveal the strength and dynamics of atomic bonds as well as the energy flow rate to the lattice. Accurately describing these processes remains challenging and requires detailed insights into transient states encountered. Here, we present data from femtosecond electron diffraction measurements that capture the structural evolution of copper during the ultrafast solid to liquid phase transformations. At absorbed energy densities 2 to 4 times the melting threshold, melting begins at the surface slightly below the nominal melting point followed by rapid homogeneous melting throughout the volume. Molecular dynamics simulations reproduce these observations and reveal a weak electron lattice energy transfer rate for the given experimental conditions. Both simulations and experiments show no indications of rapid lattice collapse when its temperature surpasses proposed limits of superheating, providing evidence that inherent dynamics limits the speed of disordering in ultrafast melting of metals.</description>

      <title>LeMat-Bulk: aggregating, and de-duplicating quantum chemistry materials databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of materials science databases has driven machine learning-based discovery while also posing challenges in data integration, duplication, and interoperability. Robust standardization and de-duplication methods are needed to address these issues and streamline materials research. We present LeMat-Bulk, a unified dataset combining Materials Project, OQMD, and Alexandria, encompassing over 5.3 million PBE-calculated materials and also representing the largest collection of PBESol and SCAN functional calculations. Our methodology standardizes calculations across databases that utilize different parameters, effectively addressing redundancy and enhancing cross-compatibility. To de-duplicate, we propose a hashing function which we termed the Bonding Algorithm Weisfeiller-Lehman (BAWL). We comprehensively benchmark this fingerprint under atomic noise, lattice strain, and symmetry transformations, demonstrating that it outperforms existing fingerprinting techniques such as SLICES, and CLOUD in robustness while offering greater computational efficiency than similarity-based approaches such as Pymatgen's StructureMatcher. Additionally, the fingerprint facilitates the analysis of functional-dependent trends (PBE, PBESol, SCAN) offering a scalable framework for data-driven materials science.</description>

      <title>Systematic global structure search of bismuth-based binary systems under pressure using machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have significantly advanced global crystal structure prediction by enabling efficient and accurate property evaluations. In this study, global structure searches are performed for 11 bismuth-based binary systems, including Na-Bi, Ca-Bi, and Eu-Bi, under pressures ranging from 0 to 20 GPa, employing polynomial MLPs developed specifically for these systems. The searches reveal numerous compounds not previously reported in the literature and identify all experimentally known compounds that are representable within the explored configurational space. These results highlight the robustness and reliability of the current MLP-based structure search. The study provides valuable insights into the discovery and design of novel bismuth-based materials under both ambient and high-pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial stress tuning of the anomalous Hall effect in Mn3Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable electronic properties in magnetic materials lead to novel physical phenomena that have the potential to be exploited in the design of new spintronic devices. Here, we report the effect of uniaxial stress on the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the hexagonal frustrated antiferromagnetic Heusler compound Mn3Ge. Our x-ray diffraction results show that the c/a ratio varies linearly with strain when stress is applied along the a axis, as well as a significantly higher Young's modulus along the c direction. The linear behavior of the c/a ratio under uniaxial stress mirrors that seen under hydrostatic pressure up to 1.8 GPa, but results in a characteristically different behavior of the AHE. Stress applied along the a axis induces a distortion in the ab plane, smoothing the abrupt jump in the AHE signal at zero magnetic field. In contrast, stress applied along the c axis has little effect, presumably due to the higher Young's modulus. We argue that this is due to pronounced changes in magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Influence of Bi Alloying on GaAs Valence Band Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi alloying is predicted to transform GaAs from a semiconductor to a topological insulator or semi-metal. To date, studies of the GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ alloy band structure have been limited, and the origins of Bi-induced enhancement of the spin-orbit splitting energy, $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$, are unresolved. Here, we present high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of droplet-free epitaxial GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ films with $x_{\mathrm{Bi}}$ = 0.06. In addition to quantifying the Bi-induced shifts of the light-hole and heavy-hole valence bands, we probe the origins of the Bi-enhanced $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$. Using exact-two-component density functional theory calculations, we identify the key role of Bi p-orbitals in the upward shift of the light-hole and heavy-hole bands that results in the Bi-enhanced $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$.</description>

      <title>Antisolvent-Assisted Growth of Centimeter-Scale CsPbBr$_3$ Perovskite Single Crystals: A Theory-Guided Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fabrication of large, high-quality single crystals (SCs) of all-inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) via accessible methods remains a significant challenge. This work presents a systematic approach to optimize the antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) method, where the experimental design is guided by a theoretical methods at each step. A synergistic 9:1 (v/v) DMSO/DMF binary solvent was selected to balance solubility and kinetics, a choice rationalized by an analysis of Gutmann's donor numbers. Subsequently, ethanol was selected as a promising antisolvent by evaluating its properties against key criteria of miscibility and diffusion rate using Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) and Fick's law expressed in terms of saturated vapor pressure. Within this rationally-defined chemical system, the "growth window" was experimentally mapped, identifying an optimal precursor concentration of 0.35 M and a preliminary titration step to induce a controlled metastable state. The optimized protocol consistently yields phase-pure, orthorhombic CsPbBr$_3$ SCs up to 1 cm in size within one week at room temperature. The resulting crystals exhibit high crystallinity and thermal stability up to \SI{550}{\celsius}</description>

      <title>Point Defects Limited Carrier Mobility in Janus MoSSe monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects, often formed during the growth of Janus MoSSe, act as built-in scatterers and affect carrier transport in electronic devices based on Janus MoSSe. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the impact of common defects, such as sulfur vacancies, selenium vacancies, and chalcogen substitutions, on electron transport, and compare their influence with that of mobility limited by phonons. Here, we define the saturation defect concentration ($C_{\mathrm{sat}}$) as the highest defect density that still allows the total mobility to remain within 90\% of the phonon-limited value, providing a direct measure of how many defects a device can tolerate. Based on $C_{\mathrm{sat}}$, we find a clear ranking of defect impact: selenium substituting for sulfur is relatively tolerant, with $C_{\mathrm{sat}}\approx2.07\times10^{-4}$, while selenium vacancies are the most sensitive, with $C_{\mathrm{sat}}\approx3.65\times10^{-5}$. Our $C_{\mathrm{sat}}$ benchmarks and defect hierarchy provide quantitative, materials-specific design rules that can guide the fabrication of high-mobility field-effect transistors, electronic devices, and sensors based on Janus MoSSe.</description>

      <title>An improved reliability factor for quantitative low-energy electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative low-energy electron diffraction [LEED $I(V)$ or LEED $I(E)$, the evaluation of diffraction intensities $I$ as a function of the electron energy] is a versatile technique for the study of surface structures. The technique is based on optimizing the agreement between experimental and calculated intensities. Today, the most commonly used measure of agreement is Pendry's $R$ factor $R_\mathrm{P}$. While $R_\mathrm{P}$ has many advantages, it also has severe shortcomings, as it is a noisy target function for optimization and very sensitive to small offsets of the intensity. Furthermore, $R_\mathrm{P} = 0$, which is meant to imply perfect agreement between two $I(E)$ curves can also be achieved by qualitatively very different curves. We present a modified $R$ factor $R_\mathrm{S}$, which can be used as a direct replacement for $R_\mathrm{P}$, but avoids these shortcomings. We also demonstrate that $R_\mathrm{S}$ is as good as $R_\mathrm{P}$ or better in steering the optimization to the correct result in the case of imperfections of the experimental data, while another common $R$ factor, $R_\mathrm{ZJ}$ (suggested by Zanazzi and Jona) is worse in this respect.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Design of poly(ethylene terephthalate)-replacement copolymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a widely used thermoplastic in packaging, textiles, and engineering applications, is valued for its strength, clarity, and chemical resistance. Increasing environmental impact concerns and regulatory pressures drive the search for alternatives with comparable or superior performance. We present an AI-driven polymer design pipeline employing virtual forward synthesis (VFS) to generate PET-replacement copolymers. Inspired by the esterification route of PET synthesis, we systematically combined a down-selected set of Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)-listed monomers to create 12,100 PET-like polymers. Machine learning models predicted glass transition temperature (Tg), band gap, and tendency to crystallize, for all designs. Multi-objective screening identified 1,108 candidates predicted to match or exceed PET in $T_{\rm g}$ and band gap, including the ``rediscovery'' of other known commercial PET-alternate polymers (e.g., PETG, Tritan, Ecozen) that provide retrospective validation of our design pipeline, demonstrating a capability to rapidly design experimentally feasible polymers at a scale. Furthermore, selected, entirely new (previously unknown) candidates designed here have been synthesized and characterized, providing a definitive validation of the design framework.</description>

      <title>Influence of carbon nanocone structure on ultra-efficient water flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation, the water flow in carbon nanocones is studied using the TIP4P/2005 rigid water model. The results demonstrate a nonuniform dependence of the flow on the cone apex angle and the diameter of the opening where the flow is established, leading to a significant increase in the flow in some cases. The effects of cone diameter and pressure gradient are investigated to explain flow behavior with different system structures. We observed that some cones can optimize the water flow precisely. Nanocones with a larger opening facilitate the sliding of water, significantly increasing the flow, thus being promising membranes for technological use in water impurity separation processes. Nanocones with narrower opening angles limited water mobility due to excessive confinement. This phenomenon is linked to the ability of water to form a larger hydrogen-bond network in typical systems with diameters of this size, obtaining a single-layer water structure. Nanocones act as selective nanofilters capable of allowing water molecules to pass through while blocking salts and impurities. The conical shape of their structures creates a directed flow that improves separation efficiency. Membranes based on carbon nanocones are becoming promising for clean, smart, and efficient technologies. The combination of transport speed, selectivity, and structural control put them ahead of other nanostructures for various purposes.</description>

      <title>AI-assisted design of chemically recyclable polymers for food packaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer packaging plays a crucial role in food preservation but poses major challenges in recycling and environmental persistence. To address the need for sustainable, high-performance alternatives, we employed a polymer informatics workflow to identify single- and multi-layer drop-in replacements for polymer-based packaging materials. Machine learning (ML) models, trained on carefully curated polymer datasets, predicted eight key properties across a library of approximately 7.4 million ring-opening polymerization (ROP) polymers generated by virtual forward synthesis (VFS). Candidates were prioritized by the enthalpy of polymerization, a critical metric for chemical recyclability. This screening yielded thousands of promising candidates, demonstrating the feasibility of replacing diverse packaging architectures. We then experimentally validated poly(p-dioxanone) (poly-PDO), an existing ROP polymer whose barrier performance had not been previously reported. Validation showed that poly-PDO exhibits strong water barrier performance, mechanical and thermal properties consistent with predictions, and excellent chemical recyclability (95% monomer recovery), thereby meeting the design targets and underscoring its potential for sustainable packaging. These findings highlight the power of informatics-driven approaches to accelerate the discovery of sustainable polymers by uncovering opportunities in both existing and novel chemistries.</description>

      <title>Stresses and fluid flow in lamina cribrosa through anisotropic poroelasticty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explore the possible mechanical correlations between intraocular pressure (IOP) variations and glaucoma, this study presents a transversely isotropic poroelastic model of the Lamina Cribrosa (LC) based on Reissner Mindlin plate theory, ultimately highlighting the interplay between solid matrix deformation and blood flow behavior under pathological conditions. Starting from poroelasticity theory, the equilibrium equations governing the LC were formulated and analytically solved by applying appropriate mechanical and hydraulic boundary conditions. The results indicate that both strain and stress measures (in the form of shear strain and von Mises stress) peak in the peripheral region of the LC, which is currently suspected to be the initial site of glaucomatous damage. These quantities increase with IOP, suggesting a pressure-dependent mechanical insult to the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. In parallel, the model predicts a monotonic reduction in fluid content as IOP rises, which may contribute to ischemic phenomena and disc haemorrhages. The influence of material anisotropy was also examined, revealing that isotropic assumptions tend to underestimate the fluid content while overestimating shear strain. Given the current experimental challenges in measuring blood flow within the LC, the proposed model provides a valuable framework for exploring the coupled mechanical hemodynamic behavior of the tissue and for inverse estimation of its mechanical parameters, such as the stiffness of the opening for the central retinal vessels.</description>

      <title>Impact of the lead factor of neutron irradiation on the magnetic properties of RPV steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials used in nuclear reactors are constantly exposed to the effects of neutron irradiation, which leads to changes in their mechanical properties. In particular, the steels employed in reactor pressure vessels experience a reduction in the ductile-to brittle transition temperature. Given that the pressure vessel is a non-redundant component, understanding this phenomenon is of significant interest. In this work, we focus on studying the effects of accelerated irradiation by maintaining constant neutron fluence while varying neutron flux, which results in different lead factors. This approach enables the extrapolation of accelerated test results to real operational conditions of the reactor pressure vessels. In our study, we analyzed irradiated steels using three magnetic techniques. Each technique responds differently to the microstructural changes induced by irradiation, allowing for a better characterization of its effects on the material. Through DC magnetometry, the analysis of minor loops shows that the remanence, coercivity, and saturation of the steel depend not only on the fluence with which the material was irradiated but also on the irradiation rate, which means, more specifically, on the lead factor. The AC susceptibility technique shows that the response of the irradiated steel to the applied magnetic field increases with fluence but also with the lead factor. For the real part of XAC, there is an increase with the lead factor, while the imaginary component of XAC grows with the size of the nanoprecipitates. Finally, Barkhausen noise measurements show a clear increase in the RMS of the signal with the lead factor.</description>

      <title>Fast and Scalable Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or large amounts of configurations, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as DFT. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires $3N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces, which is not negligible as the system size increases. This paper presents a way to replace the $3N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. This improves the computational cost and scalability of the method. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the corrected VMC forces with those obtained by the Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles with perturbative Triples [CCSD(T)] calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are significantly biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values much closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Neural Network Performance and Interpretability of Quantum Wavefunction Probability Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting quantum wavefunction probability distributions is crucial for computational chemistry and materials science, yet machine learning (ML) models often face a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. This study compares Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) in modeling quantum probability distributions for the H$_{2}^+$ ion, leveraging data generated via Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While ANN achieved superior accuracy (R$^2$ = 0.99 vs ANFIS's 0.95 with Gaussian membership functions), it required over 50x more parameters (2,305 vs 39-45). ANFIS, however, provided unique interpretability: its Gaussian membership functions encoded spatial electron localization near proton positions ($\mu = 1.2 A$), mirroring Born probability densities, while fuzzy rules reflected quantum superposition principles. Rules prioritizing the internuclear direction revealed the system's 1D symmetry, aligning with Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals theory--a novel data-driven perspective on orbital hybridization. Membership function variances ($\sigma$) further quantified electron delocalization trends, and peak prediction errors highlighted unresolved quantum cusps. The choice of functions critically impacted performance: Gaussian/Generalized Bell outperformed Sigmoid, with errors improving as training data increased, showing scalability. This study underscores the context-dependent value of ML: ANN for precision and ANFIS for interpretable, parameter-efficient approximations that link inputs to physical behavior. These findings advocate hybrid approaches in quantum simulations, balancing accuracy with explainability to accelerate discovery. Future work should extend ANFIS to multi-electron systems and integrate domain-specific constraints (e.g., kinetic energy terms), bridging data-driven models and fundamental physics.</description>

Abstract: This review presents the covalent chemistry of carbon within the spin-radical concept of electron interaction. Using the language of valence bond trimodality, the regions of classical spinless covalence and its spin counterpart are defined. Carbon is the only element exhibiting spin covalent chemistry. Classical covalent chemistry of carbon concerns molecular substances whose valence bond structure includes segregate or chained single sp3C-C bonds. Substances with double sp2C-C and triple sp1C-C bonds are the subject of spin covalent chemistry of carbon. The mathematical apparatus of spin covalence forms the basis of algorithms governing the chemical modification of carbon substances, polymerization processes, and catalysis involving them, making it possible to supplement the empirical spin covalent chemistry of carbon with its virtual analog.</description>

      <title>Structural modulation, physical properties, and electronic band structure of the kagome metal UCr$_6$Ge$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical flexibility of the $RM_6X_6$ stoichiometry, where an $f$-block element is intercalated in the CoSn structure type, allows for the tuning of flatbands associated with kagome lattices to the Fermi level and for emergent phenomena due to interactions between the $f$- and $d$-electron lattices. Yet, 5$f$ members of the "166" compounds are underrepresented compared with 4$f$ members. Here, we report single-crystal growth of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$, which crystallizes in a monoclinically distorted Y$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$-type structure. The real-space character of the modulation, which is unique within the $RM_6X_6$ family, is approximated by a 3$\times$1$\times$2 supercell of the average monoclinic cell. The compound has kagome-lattice flatbands near the Fermi level and a moderately enhanced electronic heat capacity, as evidenced by its low-temperature Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma=86.5$ mJ mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$) paired with band structure calculations. The small, isotropic magnetization and featureless resistivity of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$ suggest itinerant uranium 5$f$ electrons and Pauli paramagnetism. The isotropic magnetic behavior of the uranium 5$f$ electrons starkly contrasts with localized behavior in other uranium 166 compounds, highlighting the high tunability of the magnetic ground state across the material family.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nodal Gap in a Doped Spin-1/2 Antiferromagnetic Mott Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many emergent phenomena appear in doped Mott insulators near the insulator-to-metal transition. In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, superconductivity arises when antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is gradually suppressed by carrier doping, and a $\textit{d}$-wave superconducting gap forms when an enigmatic nodal gap evolves into a point node. Here, we examine electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$, the 5$\textit{d}$-electron counterpart of cuprates, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. At low doping levels, we observe the formation of electronic states near the Fermi level, accompanied by a gap at the AFM zone boundary, mimicking the AFM gap in electron-doped cuprates. With increasing doping, a distinct gap emerges along the (0,0)-($\pi$,$\pi$) nodal direction, paralleling that observed in hole-doped cuprates. This anomalous nodal gap persists after the collapse of the AFM gap and gradually decreases with further doping. It eventually vanishes into a point node of the reported $\textit{d}$-wave gap. These observations replicate the characteristic features in both electron- and hole-doped cuprates, indicating a unified route toward nodal metallicity in doped spin-1/2 AFM Mott insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ultrathin ferromagnetic films sandwiched between two distinct heavy metal layers or between a heavy metal and an oxide layer, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is of interfacial origin. Its chirality and strength are determined by the properties of the adjacent heavy metals and the degree of oxidation at the interfaces. Here, we demonstrate that the DMI chirality can change solely with variations in the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer - an effect that has not been experimentally studied in details or explained until now. Our experimental observation in the trilayer system Ta/FeCoB/TaOx is supported by ab initio calculations: they reveal that variations in orbital filling and inter-atomic distances at the interface, driven by the structural relaxations in the ultrathin regime, lead to an inversion of DMI chirality. We hence propose a new degree of freedom to tune DMI chirality and the associated chiral spin textures by tailoring crystal structure e.g. using strain or surface acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Controlled Chirality Switching of Weyl Quasiparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial chirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However, archieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological charge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.</description>

      <title>Emissive perovskite quantum wires in robust nanocontainers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light emissive nanostructures were prepared from boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) filled with inorganic lead halide perovskites. BNNTs provide a platform for facile synthesis of high aspect ratio perovskite quantum wires having color-tunable, highly polarized emission. BNNTs form a flexible and robust protective shell around individual nanowires, that mitigate degradation during post-processing for practical applications, while allowing to exploit the emission of the perovskite nanowires due to its optical transparency. The wire diameter can be tuned by choosing appropriate BNNT hosts, giving easy access to the strongly quantum confined diameter range. The individual encapsulated quantum wires can be used as building blocks for nanoscale photonic devices, and to create large-scale flexible assemblies.</description>

      <title>Microsecond-Pulsed Nanocalorimetry: A Scalable Approach for Ultrasensitive Heat Capacity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a nanocalorimetric technique based on microsecond-pulsed heating (\mu s-PHnC) that enables high-sensitivity, quasi-isothermal heat capacity measurements on nanoscale samples. Such resolution is critical for exploring thermodynamic signatures in low-dimensional materials, where conventional techniques fall short. By confining thermal excitation to microsecond timescales, this approach minimizes lateral heat diffusion, reduces heat capacity addenda to below 10^{-9} J K^{-1}, and achieves noise densities as low as 75 pJ K^{-1} Hz^{-1/2} mm^{-2}, unlocking precise thermodynamic characterization of subnanogram samples in areas as small as 30 x 30 \mu m^{2}. The method delivers exceptional temperature homogeneity, as demonstrated by resolving sharp phase transitions, such as the antiferromagnetic transition in ultrathin CoO films, with unprecedented clarity. Its quasi-static operation is inherently compatible with external stimuli, including magnetic and electric fields, thereby expanding its utility for in-operando thermodynamic studies. This advancement establishes a robust and scalable platform for probing thermal phenomena in nanostructured and low-dimensional materials, significantly broadening the scope of nanocalorimetry.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cross-Domain Transfer for Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate yet transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for accelerating materials and chemical discovery. However, most universal MLIPs overfit to narrow datasets or computational protocols, limiting their reliability across chemical and functional domains. We introduce a transferable multi-domain training strategy that jointly optimizes universal and task-specific parameters through selective regularization, coupled with a domain-bridging set (DBS) that aligns potential-energy surfaces across datasets. Systematic ablation experiments show that small DBS fractions (0.1%) and targeted regularization synergistically enhance out-of-distribution generalization while preserving in-domain fidelity. Trained on fifteen open databases spanning molecules, crystals, and surfaces, our model, SevenNet-Omni, achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy, including adsorption-energy errors below 0.06 eV on metallic surfaces and 0.1 eV on metal-organic frameworks. Despite containing only 0.5% r$^2$SCAN data, SevenNet-Omni reproduces high-fidelity r$^2$SCAN energetics, demonstrating effective cross-functional transfer from large PBE datasets. This framework offers a scalable route toward universal, transferable MLIPs that bridge quantum-mechanical fidelities and chemical domains.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the delicate "hidden" interface conditions in WS2 flakes by advanced atomic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delicate interfacial conditions and behaviors play critical roles in determining the valuable physical properties of two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures on substrates. However, directly probing these complex interface conditions remains challenging. Here, we reveal the coupled in-plane strain and out-of-plane bonding conditions in strain-engineered WS2 flakes by combining dual-harmonic electrostatic force microscopy (DH-EFM) and scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM). A striking contradiction is observed between the compressive-strain-induced larger bandgap (lower electrical conductivity) detected by DH-EFM, and the enhanced conductivity probed by sMIM. Comparative measurements under different sMIM modes demonstrate that this contradiction originates from a tip-loading-force-induced dynamic puckering effect, which is governed by the interfacial bonding strength. Furthermore, the progressive accumulation and subsequent release of conductivity during forward/backward sMIM-contact scans further confirms this dynamic puckering behavior, revealing pronounced differences in interface conditions between the open- and closed-ring regions of WS2. This work resolves the correlation between electrical properties and interface conditions, and provides fundamental insights for interface-engineered devices.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spin Coating: Homogeneous All-Inorganic Perovskite Films via High-Pressure Recrystallization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications owing to their outstanding optical and electronic properties. Among them, all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbBr$_3$ offer superior thermal and chemical stability. However, obtaining high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ thin films via solution processing remains challenging due to the precursor's low solubility, and current additive or solvent engineering strategies are often complex and poorly reproducible. High-pressure recrystallization has recently emerged as a promising route to improve film quality, yet its impact on film properties remains insufficiently explored. Here, we systematically investigate the morphological, structural, and optical properties of CsPbBr$_3$ thin films prepared by high-pressure recrystallization, in comparison with standard non-recrystallized films. Optimized recrystallization at 300 bar produces smooth, pinhole-free, single-phase 3D perovskite layers with sub-nanometer roughness, while the film thickness is precisely tunable via precursor concentration. The process enhances both grain and crystallite sizes, leading to amplified spontaneous emission with a reduced excitation threshold and improved photostability. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction further reveals the orthorhombic--tetragonal--cubic phase transition, consistent with single-crystal behavior. This study provides fundamental insights into pressure-driven recrystallization and establishes a reproducible, scalable approach for fabricating high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ films for optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Local insulator-to-superconductor transition in amorphous InO$_x$ films modulated by e-beam irradiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method enabling precise post-fabrication modulation of the electrical resistance in micrometer-scale regions of amorphous indium oxide (a-InO$_x$) films. By subjecting initially insulating films to an electron beam at room temperature, we demonstrate that the exposed region of the films becomes superconducting. The resultant superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is adjustable up to 2.8 K by changing the electron dose and accelerating voltage. This technique offers a compelling alternative to traditional a-InO$_x$ annealing methods for both fundamental investigations and practical applications. Moreover, it empowers independent adjustment of electrical properties across initially identical a-InO$_x$ samples on the same substrate, facilitating the creation of superconducting microstructures with precise $T_c$ control at the micrometer scale. Some possible mechanisms for the observed resistance modifications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation of a quasiparticle band structure with the quantum-selected configuration interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle band structures are fundamental for understanding strongly correlated electron systems. While solving these structures accurately on classical computers is challenging, quantum computing offers a promising alternative. Specifically, the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) method, combined with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), provides a quantum algorithm for calculating quasiparticle band structures. However, optimizing the variational parameters in VQE becomes increasingly difficult as the system size grows, due to device noise, statistical noise, and the barren plateau problem. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach that combines QSE with the quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method for calculating quasiparticle band structures. QSCI may leverage the VQE ansatz as an input state but, unlike the standard VQE, it does not require full optimization of the variational parameters, making it more scalable for larger quantum systems. Based on this approach, we demonstrate the quantum computation of the quasiparticle band structure of a silicon using 16 qubits on an IBM quantum processor.</description>

      <title>The nexus between negative charge-transfer and reduced on-site Coulomb energy in correlated topological metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) CoTe$_2$ and NiTe$_2$ are topological Dirac Type-II metals. Their $d$-bands do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO and NiO. We address this conundrum by quantifying the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band resonant photoemission spectroscopy (PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV/3.7 eV for CoTe$_2$/NiTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level PES and x-ray absorption spectra of CoTe$_2$ and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe$_2$, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$&lt;$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe$_2$ is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$${p}$ type lowest energy excitations. Similarly, we obtain a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe$_2$ compared to NiO. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in correlated metals.</description>
