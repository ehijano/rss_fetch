      <title>A One-Particle Density Matrix Framework for Mode-Shell Correspondence: Characterizing Topology in Higher-Order Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing higher-order topological phases directly from the one-particle density matrix, without any reference to an underlying Hamiltonian. Our approach extends the mode-shell correspondence, originally formulated for single-particle Hamiltonians, to Gaussian states subject to chiral constraints. In this correspondence, the mode index counts topological boundary modes, while the shell index quantifies the bulk topology in a surrounding region, providing a bulk-boundary diagnostic. In one-dimensional topological insulators, the shell index reduces to the local chiral marker, recovering the winding number in the translation-invariant limit. We apply the mode-shell correspondence to a $C_4$-symmetric higher-order topological insulator with a chiral constraint and show that a fractional shell index implies that the higher-order phase is intrinsic. The one-particle density matrix is formulated in real space, so the mode-shell correspondence applies to models without translation invariance. By introducing structural disorder into the $C_4$-symmetric higher-order insulator, we show that the mode-shell correspondence remains a meaningful diagnostic in the amorphous limit. The mode-shell correspondence generalizes to interacting states with a gapped bulk spectrum in the one-particle density matrix, providing a practical and diverse route to characterize higher-order topology from the quantum state itself.</description>

      <title>Directed evolution effectively selects for DNA based physical reservoir computing networks capable of multiple tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA and other biopolymers are being investigated as new computing substrates and alternative to silicon-based digital computers. However, the established top-down design of biomolecular interaction networks remains challenging and does not fully exploit biomolecular self-assembly capabilities. Outside of the field of computation directed evolution has been used as a tool for goal directed optimization of DNA sequences. Here, we propose integrating directed evolution with DNA-based reservoir computing to enable in-material optimization and adaptation. Simulations of colloidal beads networks connected via DNA strands demonstrate a physical reservoir capable of non-linear time-series prediction tasks, including Volterra series and Mackey-Glass chaotic dynamics. Reservoir computing performance, quantified by normalized mean squared error (NMSE), strongly depends on network topology, suggesting task-specific optimal network configurations. Implementing genetic algorithms to evolve DNA-encoded network connectivity effectively identified well-performing reservoir networks. Directed evolution improved reservoir performance across multiple tasks, outperforming random network selection. Remarkably, sequential training on distinct tasks resulted in reservoir populations maintaining performance on prior tasks. Our findings indicate DNA-bead networks offer sufficient complexity for reservoir computing, and that directed evolution robustly optimizes performance.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Low-Dimensional Turbulence via Multi-Dimensional Hybrid Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of complex dynamics remains an open problem across many domains of physics, where nonlinearities and multiscale interactions severely limit the reliability of conventional forecasting methods. Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing by exploiting the high dimensionality of the Hilbert space, where the dynamics of quantum systems take place. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical reservoir architecture capable of handling multivariate time series through quantum evolution combined with classical memory enhancement. Our model employs a five-qubit transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian with input-modulated dynamics and temporal multiplexing, enabling the encoding of input signals over multiple timescales. We apply this framework to two paradigmatic models of chaotic behavior in fluid dynamics, where multiscale dynamics and nonlinearities play a dominant role: a low-dimensional truncation of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the Lorenz-63 system. By systematically scanning the quantum system's parameter space, we identify regions that maximize forecasting performance, as measured by the Valid Prediction Time. The observed robustness and reliable performances for both dynamical systems suggest that this hybrid quantum approach offers a flexible platform for modelling complex nonlinear time series.</description>

      <title>Optimal rate-variance coding due to firing threshold adaptation near criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrently connected neuron populations play key roles in sensory perception and memory storage across various brain regions. While these populations are often assumed to encode information through firing rates, this method becomes unreliable with weak stimuli. We propose that in such cases, information can be transmitted via spatial spike patterns, employing a sparse or combinatorial coding based on firing rate variance. Around the critical point of a stochastic recurrent excitable network, we uncover a synergistic dual-coding scheme, enabled by single-cell threshold adaptation. This scheme optimizes variance coding for weak signals without compromising rate coding for stronger inputs, thus maximizing input/output mutual information. These optimizations are robust across adaptation rules and coupling strengths through self-suppression of internal noise, particularly around the network's phase transition, and are linked to threshold recovery times observed in hippocampal memory circuits (~$10^2$-$10^3$ms). In contrast, nonadaptive networks perform similarly only at criticality, suggesting that threshold adaptation is essential for reliable encoding of weak signals into diverse spatial patterns. Our results imply a fundamental role for near-critical latent adaptive dynamics enabled by dual coding in biological and artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.</description>

      <title>Expanding the search space of high entropy oxides and predicting synthesizability using machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient computational methodology for predicting the synthesizability of high entropy oxides (HEOs) in a large space of possible candidate compounds. HEOs are a growing field with an enormous potential chemical composition space, and yet the discovery of new HEOs is slow and driven by experimental trial-and-error. In this work, we attempt to speed up this process by using a machine learned interatomic potential offering DFT-level accuracy. Our methodology starts by identifying a set of crystal structures and elements for screening, building a large random unit cell of each composition and structure, then relaxing this structure. The most promising candidates are distinguished based on the variance of the individual cation energies, which we introduce as our entropy descriptor, and the enthalpy of mixing, which is used as the enthalpy descriptor. The approach is applied to tetravalent HEOs, and its validity is confirmed by comparison to alternative descriptors and DFT calculations for a set of 7 elements. The search is then extended to a set of 14 elements and three crystal structures, where it successfully identifies the only known stable 4-component HEO in the $\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, as well as predicting several new 5-component candidate systems. This approach can straightforwardly be applied to new sets of elements and structures, allowing for the accelerated discovery of new HEOs.</description>
