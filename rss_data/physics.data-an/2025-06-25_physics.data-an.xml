      <title>Tunable correlation retention: A statistical method for generating synthetic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to generate statistically representative synthetic data from a given dataset. The main goal of our method is for the created data set to mimic the inter--feature correlations present in the original data, while also offering a tunable parameter to influence the privacy level. In particular, our method constructs a statistical map by using the empirical conditional distributions between the features of the original dataset. Part of the tunability is achieved by limiting the depths of conditional distributions that are being used. We describe in detail our algorithms used both in the construction of a statistical map and how to use this map to generate synthetic observations. This approach is tested in three different ways: with a hand calculated example; a manufactured dataset; and a real world energy-related dataset of consumption/production of households in Madeira Island. We evaluate the method by comparing the datasets using the Pearson correlation matrix with different levels of resolution and depths of correlation. These two considerations are being viewed as tunable parameters influencing the resulting datasets fidelity and privacy. The proposed methodology is general in the sense that it does not rely on the used test dataset. We expect it to be applicable in a much broader context than indicated here.</description>

      <title>From few to many maps: A fast map-level emulator for extreme augmentation of CMB systematics datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, fast, and efficient generative model built upon scattering covariances, the most recent iteration of the scattering transforms statistics. This model is designed to augment by several orders of magnitude the number of map simulations in datasets of computationally expensive CMB instrumental systematics simulations, including their non-Gaussian and inhomogeneous features. Unlike conventional neural network-based algorithms, this generative model requires only a minimal number of training samples, making it highly compatible with the computational constraints of typical CMB simulation campaigns. We validate the method using realistic simulations of CMB systematics, which are particularly challenging to emulate, and perform extensive statistical tests to confirm its ability to produce new statistically independent approximate realizations. Remarkably, even when trained on as few as 10 simulations, the emulator closely reproduces key summary statistics -- including the angular power spectrum, scattering coefficients, and Minkowski functionals -- and provides pixel-to-pixel covariance estimates with substantially reduced sample noise compared to those obtained without augmentation. The proposed approach has the potential to shift the paradigm in simulation campaign design. Instead of producing large numbers of low- or medium-accuracy simulations, future pipelines can focus on generating a few high-accuracy simulations that are then efficiently augmented using such generative model. This promises significant benefits for current and forthcoming cosmological surveys such as $Planck$, $LiteBIRD$, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, Euclid and Rubin-LSST. We make both the general framework for scattering transform statistics available at https://github.com/jmdelouis/HealpixML and the emulator available at https://github.com/pcampeti/CMBSCAT.</description>
