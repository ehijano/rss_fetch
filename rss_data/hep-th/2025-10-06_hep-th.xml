      <title>K-Points and Type IIB/Heterotic Duality with NS5-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit type II$_0$ limits in the vector multiplet moduli space of compactifications of Type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds. These limits are special because they cannot be described using mirror symmetry. While we showed in previous work that the gravitational duality frame emerging in such limits corresponds to a weakly coupled heterotic string compactified on K3 times a string-sized torus, our focus here is on the additional field theory sectors that decouple from gravity in these asymptotic regimes. Concretely, we argue that, in the dual heterotic description, these field theory sectors correspond to spacetime-filling NS5-branes wrapping the heterotic torus. The existence of such non-perturbative field theory sectors manifests itself in an exponential dependence of the prepotential on the heterotic dilaton at leading order. Applied to K-point limits in one-parameter moduli spaces, our results imply that these limits are in perfect agreement with the Distance and Emergent String Conjectures. More precisely, the light tower of states predicted by the Distance Conjecture arises from excitations of a weakly coupled heterotic string compactified to four dimensions on a background containing spacetime-filling NS5-branes.</description>

      <title>Modular theory and symmetry resolution in hyperfinite von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study modular theory in hyperfinite von Neumann algebras, i.e. in those of type II or type III, from the viewpoint of a subregion charge sector decomposition. We address this symmetry resolution by considering infinite tensor products of finite-dimensional algebras with fixed subregion charge values. An important ingredient is the combination of these algebras using direct integrals. This allows us to obtain the symmetry-resolved modular operator, modular flow, and modular correlation functions for hyperfinite algebras. Our approach establishes a mathematical foundation for recent results on symmetry resolution and modular theory in conformal field theory. Our analysis applies both to charges defined on a continuous range, or on a discrete set. The latter is of interest for condensed matter theory. Moreover, within the AdS/CFT correspondence we expect our findings to be relevant as a new ingredient for bulk spacetime reconstruction, including information from different boundary charge sectors.</description>

      <title>Flux tube profile from Holography: finite size and strong coupling corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the holographic correspondence as a tool to infer the classical flux tube profile connecting a static quark-antiquark pair in a $2+1$-dimensional strongly-coupled large $N$ QCD-like theory. Our final prediction extends already known results in the literature in several ways. First, it is an analytical function of both the space-like boundary coordinates; in other words, we keep track of what happens both along and transversely to the inter-quark axis. Then, we take into account the finiteness of the inter-quark distance and the first correction in the strong coupling expansion. To the same order, we also confirm the relation between the mass of the lightest glueball in the spectrum and the intrinsic width of the flux tube profile. We conclude by trying to gain some insights about the quantum fluctuations. Intriguingly, our proposal is in agreement with widespread expectations in the literature. En passant, we also derive a semi-analytical formula that gives the first correction to the scalar glueball masses in the strong coupling expansion.</description>

      <title>Superstring amplitudes from the field-theory limit: an n-point map at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are perturbative superstring amplitudes for massless external states just an $\alpha'$ dressing of super-Yang-Mills/supergravity? This is the case at tree level, where the worldsheet correlators at $n$ points can be written in a natural worldsheet basis, such that the kinematic coefficients are BCJ numerators of super-Yang-Mills/supergravity amplitudes, with the non-trivial $\alpha'$ dependence carried only by the Koba-Nielsen factor. Motivated by this construction, we present for the first time a complete worldsheet basis of one-loop superstring correlators at $n$ points. All the kinematic coefficients associated to non-cusp basis elements are identified with pieces of one-loop BCJ numerators of super-Yang-Mills/supergravity. This determines the superstring correlators up to 15 points in terms of field theory. Starting at 16 points (modular weight 12), the worldsheet basis may include cusp forms, which vanish in the field-theory degeneration, such that the associated coefficients cannot be fixed in this manner. Therefore, the one-loop answer to our initial question is determined, at high multiplicity, by whether the coefficients of cusp basis elements vanish or not. As a by-product of our construction, we present new constraints on the field-theory limit that result from string modularity. These are expressed as additional relations among one-loop BCJ numerators in maximal super-Yang-Mills/supergravity starting at 6 points.</description>

      <title>Inverse Monoid Topological Quantum Field Theories and Open-Closed Grand Canonical Symmetric Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-closed topological quantum field theory for inverse monoids which generalizes the theory of principle fiber bundles with finite gauge group over Riemann surfaces with boundary. The theory is constructed using the isomorphism between the semisimple inverse monoid algebra and a matrix algebra which lies at the heart of monoid structure and representation theory. An example that we study in detail is the Ivanov-Kerov monoid of partial permutations. We review motivations from string theory for the resulting grand canonical theory of covers with boundaries.</description>

      <title>How to get an interacting conformal line defect for free theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that interacting conformal line defects in free quantum field theories can exist, provided that inversion symmetry is broken. Important for our demonstration is the existence of a special cross ratio for bulk-defect-defect three point functions that is invariant under the conformal group but picks up a sign under inversion. We examine the particular case of a free scalar field in detail, and provide a toy model example where this bulk field interacts via a Yukawa term with fermions on the line. We expect nontrivial line defects may also exist for free Maxwell theory in four dimensions and free bulk fermions.</description>

      <title>New perspectives in Kac-Moody algebras associated to higher dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we present a general framework for the construction of Kac-Moody (KM) algebras associated to higher-dimensional manifolds. Starting from the classical case of loop algebras on the circle $\mathbb{S}^{1}$, we extend the approach to compact and non-compact group manifolds, coset spaces, and soft deformations thereof. After recalling the necessary geometric background on Riemannian manifolds, Hilbert bases and Killing vectors, we present the construction of generalized current algebras $\mathfrak{g}(\mathcal{M})$, their semidirect extensions with isometry algebras, and their central extensions. We show how the resulting algebras are controlled by the structure of the underlying manifold, and illustrate the framework through explicit realizations on $SU(2)$, $SU(2)/U(1)$, and higher-dimensional spheres, highlighting their relation to Virasoro-like algebras. We also discuss the compatibility conditions for cocycles, the role of harmonic analysis, and some applications in higher-dimensional field theory and supergravity compactifications. This provides a unifying perspective on KM algebras beyond one-dimensional settings, paving the way for further exploration of their mathematical and physical implications.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrected black hole microstates and entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the semiclassical black hole microstate construction to include quantum corrections to the microscopic entropy using a doubly holographic model of black holes. Specifically, we consider a double-sided black hole on a JT brane with holographic matter, coupled to a pair of holographic CFTs on the asymptotic boundaries. The dimension of the Hilbert space spanned by the microstates of this doubly holographic black hole is given by the exponentiated entropy, which is equal to the sum of the quantum-corrected thermodynamic entropies of the left and right black holes. Importantly, the quantum-corrected thermodynamic entropy is shown to be equal to the generalised entropy of the eternal black hole, and thus can be interpreted as quantifying the entanglement between the two asymptotic boundaries.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional chaos I: Classical and quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of multi-dimensional chaos that applies to processes described by erratic functions of several dynamical variables. We employ this concept in the interpretation of classical and quantum scattering off a pinball system. In the former case it is illustrated by means of two-dimensional plots of the scattering angle and of the number of bounces. We draw similar patterns for the quantum differential cross section for various geometries of the disks. We find that the eigenvalues of the S-matrix are distributed according to the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE) in random matrix theory (RMT), provided the setup be asymmetric and the wave-number be large enough. We then consider the electric potential associated with charges randomly located on a plane as a toy model that generalizes the scattering from a leaky torus. We propose several methods to analyze the spacings between the extrema of this function. We show that these follow a repulsive Gaussian beta-ensemble distribution even for Poisson-distributed positions of the charges. A generalization of the spectral form factor is introduced and determined. We apply these methods to the case of a chaotic S-matrix and of the quantum pinball scattering. The spacings between nearest neighbor extrema points and ratios between adjacent spacings follow a logistic and Beta distributions correspondingly. We conjecture about a potential relation with random tensor theory.</description>

      <title>Existence of ghost-eliminating constraints in multivielbein theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a Hamiltonian constraint analysis of the multivielbein theory proposed in arXiv:1804.09723. The analysis shows that the secondary constraints have the correct form to constrain the dynamical variables, thereby eliminating the problematic ghost modes that generally plague theories of interacting spin-2 fields. Under mild restrictions on the solution space, we also identify the tertiary constraints and show that these eliminate the canonical momenta associated with the ghost modes. Our analysis confirms that the theory with $N$ interacting vielbeins propagates $2+5(N-1)$ modes, corresponding to a nonlinear theory of one massless and $N-1$ massive spin-2 fields free of the Boulware-Deser ghost instabilities.</description>

      <title>New Junction Condition and Casimir effect for Network CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, BCFT and ICFT have been generalized to the CFT on networks (NCFT). A key aspect of NCFT is how we connect the CFTs in different edges at the nodes of the network. For a free scalar field, one naturally requires that the scalar fields are continuous at the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a new junction condition that instead requires the normal derivative of the scalar field to be continuous at the node. We demonstrate that this new junction condition is consistent with the variational principle and energy conservation. Furthermore, we provide an exact realization of it in a real physical system. As an application, we analyze the Casimir effect using both the traditional and the new junction conditions in networks formed by regular polyhedra. Our results indicate that the new junction condition generally results in a smaller Casimir effect.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study grand-canonical symmetric orbifolds of conformal field theories on the sphere. We show that a consistent operator product expansion can be defined, provided the Hilbert space is taken to be the direct sum of symmetric orbifolds of all degrees. This Hilbert space contains a tower of central operators of conformal dimension zero, one of which represents the central charge of the Virasoro algebra. Our construction thus provides a conformal field theory interpretation of the central charge operator $\mathcal{I}$ in $AdS_3$ string theory.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Lagrangian Formulation of Stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Lagrangian formulation of stochastic inflation, where the path-integral approach is employed to derive the Langevin equation governing the dynamics of long-wavelength fields, in contrast to the standard method where the Langevin equation is derived directly from the equation of motion of the full quantum field. Focusing on a massless, minimally coupled scalar field with quartic self-interaction in a de Sitter background, we re-derive the formal expression for the influence functional that encapsulates the effects of short-wavelength fields up to second order in the coupling constant, and compare our results with those obtained in earlier works. In doing so, we highlight certain subtleties that have been previously overlooked, including the non-orthogonality between long- and short-wavelength modes, which we analyze in detail, as well as the absence of a consistent prescription for handling general interaction terms in the imaginary part of the influence functional. The latter issue points to a broader challenge: the lack of a universally accepted framework for treating the imaginary component of effective actions.</description>

      <title>The Anholonomic Frame and Connection Deformation Method for constructing off-diagonal solutions in (modified) Einstein gravity and nonassociative geometric flows and Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02321v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is a status report on the Anholonomic Frame and Connection Deformation Method, AFCDM, for constructing generic off-diagonal exact and parametric solutions in general relativity, GR, relativistic geometric flows, and modified gravity theories, MGTs. Such models can be generalized to nonassociative and noncommutative star products on phase spaces and modelled equivalently as nonassociative Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometries. Our approach involves a nonholonomic geometric reformulation of classical models of gravitational and matter fields described by Lagrange and Hamilton densities on relativistic phase spaces. Using nonholonomic dyadic variables, the Einstein equations in GR and MGTs can be formulated as systems of nonlinear partial differential equations(PDEs), which can be decoupled and integrated in some general off-diagonal forms. In this approach, the Lagrange and Hamilton dynamics and related models of classical and quantum evolution are equivalently described in terms of generalized Finsler-like or canonical metrics and (nonlinear) connection structures on deformed phase spaces defined by solutions of modified Einstein equations. New classes of exact and parametric solutions in (nonassociative) MGTs are formulated in terms of generating and integration functions and generating effective/ matter sources. The physical interpretation of respective classes of solutions depends on the type of (non) linear symmetries, prescribed boundary/ asymptotic conditions, or posed Cauchy problems.</description>

      <title>Statistical Signatures of Integrable and Non-Integrable Quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrability is a cornerstone of classical mechanics, where it has a precise meaning. Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and unresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed simply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet crucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and correlation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework that approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key observation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing energy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish integrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte Carlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert space and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain mixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical character of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which sharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure applies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their structure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space. As a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from the permutation group $\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and generality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional dilaton gravity provides a valuable framework to study the dynamics of quantum black holes. These models are often coupled to conformal scalar fields, which capture essential quantum effects such as the trace anomaly, while remaining analytically tractable. From the viewpoint of two-dimensional quantum field theory, unitary theories require a positive central charge. However, theories with a total negative central charge naturally arise from the contribution of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts to the effective action. Recent analyses of the Callan-Giddins-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) model with a Russo-Susskin-Thorlacius (RST) counterterm have shown that a negative central charge can remove curvature singularities in the backreacted geometry. In this work, we argue that singularity resolution arises from the negative central charge itself, rather than the particular dynamics of a given model. To support this, we present analogous results in spherically reduced Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Computational access to lattice and long-wavelength physics in quantum mutual information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mutual information is an important tool for characterizing correlations in quantum many-body systems, but its numerical evaluation is often prohibitively expensive. While some variants of R\'enyi Mutual Information (RMI) are computationally more tractable, it is not clear whether they correctly capture the long-wavelength physics or are dominated by UV effects, which is of key importance in lattice simulations. We analyze the relevance of lattice effects on the family of $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi mutual informations for ground states of models with conformal field theory descriptions. On the example of massless free fermions we identify distinct regions in the $\alpha$-$z$ plane, where RMI corrections due to the lattice are relevant or irrelevant. We further support these findings with MPS calculations on the transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Our results, accompanied by the open-source Julia package QMICalc.jl, provide guidance to using RMI in quantum-many body physics numerical computations.</description>

      <title>A Conceptual Introduction To Signature Change Through a Natural Extension of Kaluza-Klein Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of basic Kaluza-Klein theory in which the higher-dimensional Lorentzian manifold develops a Cauchy horizon rather than remaining globally hyperbolic as in the conventional framework. In this setting, the $U(1)$-generating Killing field, assumed to exist in Kaluza-Klein theory, undergoes a transition in its causal character, from spacelike in the globally hyperbolic region to timelike in an acausal extension through a horizon. This yields a (lower-dimensional) quotient manifold whose metric changes signature from Lorentzian to Riemannian. In this way, one observes a singular, signature changing transition emerging rather naturally from the projection of a globally smooth, even analytic, Lorentzian geometry "up in the bundle". This reveals a "signature change without signature change" scenario - a phrasing inspired by John Wheeler - and extends the usual Kaluza-Klein framework in a conceptually natural direction.</description>

      <title>Slant sums of quiver gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of slant sum of quiver gauge theories, a type of surgery on the underlying quiver. Under some mild assumptions, we relate torus fixed points on the corresponding Higgs branches, which are Nakajima quiver varieties. Then we prove a formula relating the quasimap vertex functions before and after a slant sum, which is a type of ``branching rule" for vertex functions.
  Our construction is motivated by a conjecture, which we make here, for the factorization of the vertex functions of zero-dimensional quiver varieties. The branching rule allows this conjecture to be approached inductively. In special cases, it also provides a formula for the $\hbar=q$ specialization of vertex functions for quiver varieties not necessarily of Dynkin type as a sum over reverse plane partitions. When passed through the quantum Hikita conjecture, such expressions provide conjectural formulas for graded traces of Verma modules on the 3d mirror dual side.
  We also consider the Coulomb side. We make some conjectures reflecting what can be seen on the Higgs side and prove them in ADE type. We study slant sums of Coulomb branches and their quantizations. We prove that for one-dimensional framing, slant sum operation on the Coulomb branch side corresponds to taking products.</description>

      <title>Missing Beats: Dark Matter Silences Short-Period Cepheids in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming near-infrared facilities (e.g., JWST/NIRCam, ELT/MICADO) will dramatically increase the detectability of galactic center Cepheids despite extreme extinction at optical wavelengths. In this work, we study the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on Cepheid stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way. We show that at densities $\rho \sim 10^5 \, \text{GeV} \, \text{cm}^{-3}$, blue-loop evolution can be suppressed, preventing the formation of low-mass ($3$-$6 \, M_\odot$) short-period ($1$-$6$ days) Cepheids. A dearth of such variables could provide indirect evidence for DM heating. Notably, this effect occurs at lower DM densities than required to impact main-sequence stars. Future surveys will thus offer a novel, complementary probe of DM properties in galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Relations and Pole-Skipping in a Holographic Charmonium Model with Rotating Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a bottom-up holographic QCD model to investigate the dissociation of charmonium states moving in a rotating medium by calculating their quasinormal modes. We begin by reviewing the holographic quarkonium spectrum at zero temperature. Then, we derive the equations of motion for heavy vector mesons propagating in a rotating plasma, separating the analysis into longitudinal and transverse directions relative to the wave vector. Additionally, we compute the charge diffusion constant in the rotating background and analyze the pole-skipping phenomenon, which emerges in the retarded Green's function. Finally, we investigate the impact of rotation on the spin alignment of the J/psi state in the helicity frame, utilizing the spectral function obtained from the holographic framework.</description>

      <title>Inverse magnetic catalysis in the linear sigma model: a beyond mean field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the restoration of chiral symmetry in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks under the influence of strong magnetic fields and finite temperature, incorporating screening effects through ring diagrams. While previous studies using tree-level thermal masses lead to magnetic catalysis across all temperature ranges, in tension with lattice QCD results, we go beyond this limitation by computing the bosonic masses self-consistently within the lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation. The self-consistent approach modifies the effective potential and allows us to accurately track the thermal evolution of the order parameter. Our results reveal the emergence of a critical end point (CEP) in the $T-|eB|$ phase diagram and, notably, exhibit inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) behavior: the (pseudo)critical temperature decreases with increasing magnetic field strength. This is in contrast to the magnetic catalysis behavior found when non-self-consistent masses are used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that self-consistent boson masses have been implemented in this context, offering a new framework for exploring the QCD phase diagram using effective models.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter we introduce the $\theta$-dependence and the topological properties of QCD, features of the strongly interacting sector which give rise to the strong CP problem in the more general context of the Standard Model of particle physics. We discuss the analytical approaches that can be used to obtain qualitative, or in some cases quantitative, information on the $\theta$-dependence of QCD and QCD-like models, discussing their range of validity and comparing their predictions with the numerical results obtained by means of lattice simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics in the radial quantization on the lattice, the lattice action is constructed and the free limit is studied on $S^2 \times \mathbb{R}$. With the overlap fermion, it is numerically verified that the important symmetries of the theory can be realized on the lattice. The analytic correlators are derived and compared to the lattice results, which agree including the overall normalization. The $O(a^2)$-scaling is confirmed toward the analytic value in the continuum limit, and the number of reproduced descendant states is estimated heuristically for the first few refinement levels. Our study helps us identify the features of the theory that we can study on the icosahedral lattice without fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the recently released B-mode polarisation data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) favour a non-vanishing contribution of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin which is in tension with the previous BICEP-Keck (BK) measurements. Our analysis uses the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra, with theoretically motivated priors, on the multifrequency SPT likelihoods complemented by the latest Planck satellite data products. The SPT measurements provide 1.0 bit of information gain on the first slow-roll parameter, which is higher than the 0.9 bit provided by BK even though the SPT sensitivity is five times lower. Moreover, the Bayesian dimensionality on the same parameter exceeds 1.5 for SPT versus 0.3 for BK showing that it is overconstrained by the SPT data. Even if this BB-tension could be the result of a yet to be understood foreground, our findings should motivate for a closer analysis of this unexpected B-modes excess.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for numerical modeling of the nuclear matter properties within the framework of relativistic heavy-ion collisions using a holographic equation of state. Machine learning methods were applied to address the regression and optimization issues during the calibration of the relevant parameters using the LQCD results for quark masses that approximate the physical values. Numerical simulations are performed using the iEBE-MUSIC and vHLLE-SMASH frameworks, which incorporate certain relativistic hydrodynamics solvers. We modify the code by implementing a tabulated holographic equation of state, enabling simulations of quark-gluon plasma evolution with dynamically generated initial conditions via the 3D Monte Carlo Glauber Model and SMASH. Finally, the spectra of produced hadrons are computed using a hybrid iSS+UrQMD and Hadron Sampler+SMASH approaches at the freeze-out stage.12 p</description>

Abstract: We examine the physical significance of torsion co-cycles in the cohomology of a projective Calabi-Yau three-fold for the (2,2) superconformal field theory (SCFT) associated to the non-linear sigma model with such a manifold as a target space. There are two independent torsion subgroups in the cohomology. While one is associated to an orbifold construction of the SCFT, the other encodes the possibility of turning on a topologically non-trivial flat gerbe for the NS-NS B-field. Inclusion of these data enriches mirror symmetry by providing a refinement of the familiar structures and points to a generalization of the duality symmetry, where the topology of the flat gerbe enters on the same footing as the topology of the underlying manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-extremal black holes are subject to large quantum effects, which modify their low-temperature thermodynamic behavior. Hitherto, these quantum effects were analyzed by separating the geometry into the near-horizon region and its exterior. It is desirable to understand and reproduce such corrections from the full higher-dimensional asymptotically flat or AdS geometry's perspective. We address this question in this article and fill this gap. Specifically, we find off-shell eigenmodes of the quadratic fluctuation operator of the Euclidean gravitational dynamics, with eigenvalues that vanish linearly with temperature. We illustrate this for BTZ and neutral black holes with hyperbolic horizons in AdS in Einstein-Hilbert theory, and for the charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory. The linear scaling with Matsubara frequency, which is a distinctive feature of the modes, together with the fact that their wavefunctions localize close to the horizon as we approach extremality, identifies them as responsible for the aforementioned quantum effects. We provide a contour prescription to deal with the sign indefiniteness of the Euclidean Einstein-Maxwell action, which we derive to aid our analysis. We also resolve a technical puzzle regarding modes associated with rotational isometries in stationary black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography imposes a lower bound on the Casimir effect. For simplicity, we focus on the Casimir effect between parallel planes for three-dimensional conformal field theories and briefly comment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions. Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound on the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, the Ising model, and $O(N)$ models with $N=2,3$ at critical points and prove it for the two-dimensional case. Remarkably, a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries also obeys the holographic bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a previously constructed class of massive Type IIA AdS$_2\times$S$^7\times I$ solutions with OSp$(8|2)$ symmetry, as well as OSp$(6|2)$-symmetric ones, by replacing the S$^7$ with the orbifold S$^7/\mathbb{Z}_k$. In both cases we construct global solutions for which the interval $I$ is bounded between physical singularities, by allowing D8-branes transverse to $I$. We also generate a new class of Type IIB AdS$_2\times \mathbb{CP}^3\times\text{S}^1\times I$ solutions by T-duality and establish a chain of dualities that maps the massless limit of these classes to AdS$_4/\mathbb{Z}_{k'}\times\text{S}^7/\mathbb{Z}_k$, thus identifying the brane configurations yielding these solutions. We propose that the ${\cal N}=8$ solutions are dual to a theory living on a D0-F1-D8 brane intersection which has a description in terms of disconnected quivers and similarly for the ${\cal N}=6$ solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a complete classification of AdS$_2$ solutions of Type II supergravity realising $\mathcal{N}=6$ supersymmetry and OSp$(6|2)$ superconformal symmetry on backgrounds that are foliations of AdS$_2 \times \mathbb{CP}^3$ over a Riemann surface $\Sigma_2$. Such solutions only exist in type IIB supergravity and are in 1 to 1 correspondence with a fourth order PDE that can be locally solved in terms of two holomorphic functions. Particular solutions in the class are the T-duals of the $\text{AdS}_3\times \mathbb{CP}^3$ and $\text{AdS}_2\times \text{S}^7$ solutions to massive Type IIA supergravity found in the literature. We discuss the field theory interpretation of the two sub-classes of solutions related to $\text{AdS}_3\times \mathbb{CP}^3$ by Abelian and non-Abelian T-duality, which provide explicit examples for the Riemann surface an annulus or a strip. In the second case we interpret the solutions as holographic duals to baryon vertex configurations realised in D2-brane box models.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Predicting pion dynamics from QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gauge Theory Bootstrap [arXiv:2309.12402, arXiv:2403.10772] computes the strongly coupled pion dynamics by considering the most general scattering matrix, form factors and spectral densities and matching them with perturbative QCD at high energy and with weakly coupled pions at low energy. In this work, we show that further constraints on the spectral densities significantly reduce the possible solutions to a small set of qualitatively similar ones. Quantitatively, the precise solution is controlled by the asymptotic value of the form factors and SVZ sum rules. We also introduce an iterative procedure that, starting from a generic feasible point, converges to a unique solution parameterized by the UV input. For the converged solution we compute masses and widths of resonances that appear, scattering lengths and effective ranges of partial waves, low energy coefficients in the effective action. Additionally, we use these results to discuss the thermodynamics of a pion gas including pair correlations of pions with same and opposite charge.</description>

      <title>Krylov operator complexity in holographic CFTs: Smeared boundary reconstruction and the dual proper radial momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by bulk reconstruction of smeared boundary operators, we study the Krylov complexity of local and non-local primary CFT$_d$ operators from the local bulk-to-bulk propagator of a minimally-coupled massive scalar field in Rindler-AdS$_{d+1}$ space. We derive analytic and numerical evidence on how the degree of non-locality in the dual CFT$_d$ observable affects the evolution of Krylov complexity and the Lanczos coefficients. Curiously, the near-horizon limit matches with the same observable for conformally-coupled probe scalar fields inserted at the asymptotic boundary of AdS$_{d+1}$ space. Our results also show that the evolution of the growth rate of Krylov operator complexity in the CFT$_d$ takes the same form as to the proper radial momentum of a probe particle inside the bulk to a good approximation. The exact equality only occurs when the probe particle is inserted in the asymptotic boundary or in the horizon limit. Our results capture a prosperous interplay between Krylov complexity in the CFT, thermal ensembles at finite bulk locations and their role in the holographic dictionary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that baryon number symmetry is spontaneously broken in a class of three-dimensional, ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric theories with a discrete mass spectrum. These models serve as lower-dimensional, less-supersymmetric analogs of the Klebanov-Strassler solution, sharing properties such as the presence of a cascade. The spontaneous symmetry breaking is evidenced by the appearance of a Goldstone mode, which corresponds to a vector fluctuation in the gravity dual.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric truncation of N=3 dilaton Weyl multiplet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform all possible supersymmetric truncations of the N=3 dilaton Weyl multiplet, with an R-symmetry $SU(2) \times U(1) \times U(1)$, to N=2. A particular truncation does not break any of the R-symmetries and leads to the N=2 vector-dilaton Weyl multiplet and the N=2 vector multiplet. A different truncation procedure breaks the SU(2) part of the R-symmetry to U(1) and leads to a 32+32 off-shell representation of N=2 conformal supergravity. Independently, we construct another 32+32 off-shell multiplet in N=2 conformal supergravity by coupling the N=2 scalar-tensor multiplet to the N=2 standard Weyl multiplet. We then establish the equivalence between these two multiplets through a mapping. We observe that this multiplet is gauge equivalent to a Poincar\'e supergravity multiplet as it has all the compensators necessary to go from conformal supergravity to Poincar{\'e} supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the classical gravitational entropy of a horizon as a Noether charge that does not require the notion of a temperature, and which is applicable to horizons that are not necessarily associated with black holes. This introduces a correction to the covariant phase space formalism that accounts for the configuration-dependence of the generating vector field conjugate to the charge. The vector field is related to the proposal of Bousso that the gravitational entropy of a region is determined by the lightsheet at its boundary. We test the formula on various black hole and cosmological horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformations may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. In this article, we present a mathematical framework which extends this symmetry reduction procedure to classical field theories described within the covariant De-Donder Weyl formalism. Both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are discussed; in the former case, the Lagrangian is introduced as a bundle morphism $\mathcal{L}:J^1E\rightarrow\wedge^mM$, whilst the Hamiltonian description takes as its multiphase space the restricted multimomentum bundle $J^1E^*$. The contact reduction process is implemented in a number of particular cases, and it is found that the geometry of the reduced space admits an elegant physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Higher structure of non-invertible symmetries from Lagrangian descriptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetry structure of a quantum field theory is determined not only by the topological defects that implement the symmetry and their fusion rules, but also by the topological networks they can form, which is referred to as the higher structure of the symmetry. In this paper, we consider theories with non-invertible symmetries that have an explicit Lagrangian description, and use it to study their higher structure. Starting with the 2d free compact boson theory and its non-invertible duality defects, we will find Lagrangian descriptions of networks of defects and use them to recover all the $F$-symbols of the familiar Tambara-Yamagami fusion category $\operatorname{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_N,+1)$. We will then use the same approach in 4d Maxwell theory to compute $F$-symbols associated with its non-invertible duality and triality defects, which are 2d topological field theories. In addition, we will also compute some of the $F$-symbols using a different (group theoretical) approach that is not based on the Lagrangian description, and find that they take the expected form.</description>

      <title>Holography vs. Scale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we point out a contradiction between holography and scale-separated AdS (i.e. parametrically large mass gap) in string theory, making the standard assumption that the holographic CFT describes the IR degrees of freedom on a brane that decouple from gravity. We show that the CFT can only decouple from gravity if the scalar potential in the dual AdS satisfies a certain criterion. Namely, there must exist a scalar field trajectory that follows the gradient of the scalar potential to the asymptotic region of the scalar field space in which limit $V\sim m^\alpha$, where $\alpha\leq 2$ is a constant and $m$ is the mass scale of the lightest tower of states. This condition, which implies lack of scale-separation, is satisfied in the standard examples of AdS/CFT. However, proposed attempts at achieving scale separation, such as DGKT, employ scalar potentials that scale as $m^\alpha$ with $\alpha&gt;2$ in the asymptotic region of moduli space. We therefore conclude that the CFT duals of DGKT vacua cannot exist in string theory. Barring fine-tuning, our conclusions apply to other Ricci-flat flux compactifications including the KKLT scenario which relies on scale separation to obtain a metastable de Sitter uplift.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation in maximally symmetric spaces and semiclassical gravity in Anti-de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain semiclassical gravity solutions in the Poincar\'e fundamental domain of $(3+1)$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime, PAdS$_4$, with a (massive or massless) Klein-Gordon field (with possibly non-trivial curvature coupling) with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary. Some results are explicitly and graphically presented for special values of the mass and curvature coupling (e.g. minimal or conformal coupling). In order to achieve this, we study in some generality how to perform the Hadamard renormalisation procedure for non-linear observables in maximally symmetric spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions, with emphasis on the stress-energy tensor. We show that, in this maximally symmetric setting, the Hadamard bi-distribution is invariant under the isometries of the spacetime, and can be seen as a `single-argument' distribution depending only on the geodesic distance, which significantly simplifies the Hadamard recursion relations and renormalisation computations.</description>

      <title>Modeling of acceleration in heavy-ion collisions: occurrence of temperature below the Unruh temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that extremely strong electric fields can be created in central collisions of heavy ions, due to which the Schwinger effect can be significant. A direct analogue of the electric field in hydrodynamics is the acceleration of the medium. Using the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) framework we model the Au-Au collisions at intermediate collision energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=4.5-11.5\,$GeV and obtain the spatial distribution of acceleration at different time moments. The present study demonstrates that extremely high acceleration of the order of 1 GeV may be generated in both central and non-central collisions, and that the distribution exhibits a core-corona structure. Consequently, in contrast to the case with an electric field, the Unruh effect is expected to be significant. It is demonstrated that for the confined phase the temperature is less than the Unruh temperature. Conversely, in the deconfined phase, the relationship is inverse. The obtained results thus support the prediction about the existence of states with $T&lt;T_U$ at the early stages of the collision and the associated complementary description of thermalization in terms of the novel phase transition at the Unruh temperature.</description>

      <title>Invariance under quantum permutations rules out parastatistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems invariant under particle exchange are either Bosons or Fermions, even though quantum theory in principle admits more general behavior under permutations. But why do we not observe such "paraparticles" in nature? The analysis of this question was previously limited primarily to specific quantum field theory models. Here we give two independent arguments that rule out parastatistics universally, originating in quantum information theory and recent research on internal quantum reference frames. First, we introduce a notion of complete invariance: quantum systems should not only preserve their local state under permutations, but also the quantum information they carry about other systems, in analogy to the notion of complete positivity in quantum information theory. Second, we demand that quantum systems are invariant under quantum permutations, i.e. permutations conditioned on values of permutation-invariant observables. For both, we show that the respective principle is fulfilled if and only if the particle is a Boson or Fermion. Our results show how quantum reference frames can shed light on a longstanding problem of quantum physics, they underline the crucial role played by the compositional structure of quantum information, and demonstrate the explanatory power but also subtle limitations of recently proposed quantum covariance principles.</description>

      <title>DESI results: Hint towards coupled dark matter and dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a scenario where a dark energy quintessence field $\phi$ with positive kinetic energy is coupled with dark matter. With two different self-interaction potentials for the field and a particular choice of the coupling function, we show explicitly how the observable effective equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ for the dark energy field crosses the phantom barrier ($w_{\rm eff} = -1$) while keeping the equation of state of the quintessence field $w_\phi &gt; -1$. With appropriate choices of parameters, $w_{\rm eff}$ crosses the phantom divide around redshift $z\sim 0.5$, transitioning from $w_{\rm eff} &lt;-1$ in the past to $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ today. This explains DESI observations well. Our analysis reveals that the model remains consistent within the $2\sigma$ confidence intervals provided by DESI for several combinations of the scalar field parameters, highlighting its potential in explaining the dynamics of dark energy arising from a simple Yukawa-type long-range interaction in the dark sector. While the current findings offer a promising framework for interpreting DESI observations, future work, including a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, is necessary to constrain the parameter space further and strengthen the statistical significance of the results.</description>

      <title>How much has DESI dark energy evolved since DR1?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DESI has reported a dynamical dark energy (DE) signal based on the $w_0 w_a$CDM model that is in conflict with Hubble tension. Recalling that the combination of DESI DR1 BAO and DR1 full-shape (FS) modeling are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, in this letter we comment on the status of fluctuations in DR1 BAO documented in \cite{DESI:2024mwx, Colgain:2024xqj} in the DR2 update. In particular, we note that neither DR1 BAO nor DR2 BAO nor DR2 BAO+CMB confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model with relaxed model parameter priors confirm late-time accelerated expansion today. Translating DESI BAO constraints into flat $\Lambda$CDM constraints, we observe that the LRG1 constraint remains the most prominent outlier, a distinction now held jointly with ELG1, LRG2 switches from smaller to larger $\Omega_m$ values relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM, and ELG data drive the relatively low $\Omega_m$ in the full DR2 BAO. We observe that one cannot restore $w_0 = -1$ within one $1 \sigma$ by removing either LRG1 or ELG1 or LRG2, but LRG2 in DR2, in contrast to LRG1 in DR1, now has the greatest bearing on $w_0 &gt; -1$. We conclude that BAO has yet to stabilise, but the general trend is towards greater consistency with DESI DR1 FS modeling results, where there may be no dynamical DE signal in DESI data alone.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon behavior of nonequatorial accelerated particle motion and high energy particle collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider motion of a particle in the background of a stationary axially symmetric generic black hole. A particle experiences the action of a force of unspecified nature. We require the force to remain finite in a comoving frame. The result is expressed in terms of several integers characterizing the Taylor expansion of the metric coefficients near the horizon. We show that the polar component of the four-velocity remains finite. As a result, the scenarios of high-energy particle collisions, found previously in the context of the BSW effect for equatorial motion, do not change qualitatively in the nonequatorial case. The fact that the polar component is finite, also enables us to fill some gaps in the description of the BSW effect in previous works. Our results have a quite general character and can be used not only in description of high energy particle collisions but also in diverse astrophysical problems for which motion is not constrained by the equatorial plane.</description>

      <title>Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems: Nonstabilizerness, entanglement, and fractal dimension in SYK and random matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in a holographic superfluid model with non-linear terms beyond the probe limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the holographic s-wave superfluid model with 4th and 6th power self-interaction terms $\lambda |\psi|^4$ and $\tau |\psi|^6$ with considering the full back-reaction of the matter fields on the metric in the 3+1 dimensional bulk. The self-interaction terms are good at controlling the condensate to realize various phase transitions, such as the zeroth-order, first-order, and second-order phase transitions within the single condensate s-wave superfluid model. Therefore, in this work, we are able to investigate the influence of the back-reaction strength on the various phase transitions, including the zeroth and first order phase transitions. In addition, we confirm that the influence of the 4th and 6th power terms on the superfluid phase transition in the case of finite back-reaction are qualitative the same as in the probe limit, thus present universality. We also plot the special value $\lambda_s$ of the parameter $\lambda$ at different back-reaction strength, below which the condensate grows to an opposite direction and is important in controlling the order of the superfluid phase transitions. Comparing the influence of the back-reaction parameter and that of the higher-order nonlinear coefficients, we see that the back-reaction strength brings in both the effective couplings similar to the 4th power and 6th power terms.</description>

      <title>Casimir Effect for Quantum Field theory in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies quantum field theories defined in networks, which are the multi-branch generalizations of interface conformal field theory (ICFT). We propose a novel junction condition on the node and show that it is consistent with energy conservation in the sense that the total energy flow into the node is zero. As an application, we explore the Casimir effect on networks. Remarkably, the Casimir force on one edge can be changed from attractive to repulsive by adjusting the lengths of the other edges, providing a straightforward way to control the Casimir effect. We begin by discussing the Casimir effect for $(1+1)$-dimensional free massless scalars on a simple network. We then extend this discussion to various types of networks and higher dimensions. Finally, we offer brief comments on some open questions.</description>

      <title>Generic EFT-motivated beyond General Relativity gravitational wave tests and their curvature dependence: from observation to interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a "dictionary" to expedite the identification of potential deviations in gravitational waveforms from those predicted by General Relativity (GR) during the inspiral phase of black hole binaries. Assuming deviations from GR can be described by a local Effective Field Theory (EFT) formulated in terms of curvature operators (and possibly additional scalar fields), this dictionary characterizes how deviations scale with the masses of the binary components and identifies the leading order Post-Newtonian corrections in generic theories constructed within the EFT framework. By establishing a direct connection between observations and candidate theories beyond GR, this dictionary also aids in distinguishing genuine physical effects from systematic errors. These results can be readily incorporated into essentially all existing tests for the inspiral regime and, in particular, facilitate a more efficient combination of data from multiple events.</description>

      <title>From geometry to cosmology: a pedagogical review of inflation in curvature, torsion, and extended gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified review of inflationary cosmology across various modified gravity theories. These include models based on curvature, torsion, and non-metricity. We explore how scalar fields interact with different geometric quantities and how these interactions affect inflationary dynamics. Key cosmological features such as background evolution, reheating, and observable parameters are discussed. We also examine exotic scenarios inspired by string theory, extra dimensions, and non-local models. This work aims to connect theoretical models with observational data and future missions, offering guidance for exploring inflation beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Detecting milli-Hz gravitational waves with optical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a gravitational wave detector based on ultrastable optical cavities enabling the detection of gravitational wave signals in the mostly unexplored $10^{-5}-1$ Hz frequency band. We illustrate the working principle of the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources, both of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection range of this instrument. Our work suggests that terrestrial gravitational wave detection in the milli-Hz frequency range is potentially within reach with current technology.</description>

      <title>Axions as Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and Dark Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous in extensions of the Standard Model and offer a unifying framework on open problems in cosmology. Depending on their mass and interactions, axions can act as dark matter, drive cosmic acceleration as dark energy, or contribute to the relativistic background as dark radiation. Motivated by the plenary talk at TAUP 2025, this proceeding reviews the phenomenology of light bosons in the early and late Universe, with a focus on the theoretical foundations, observational signatures, and experimental prospects.</description>

      <title>Double Wick rotations between symmetries of Taub-NUT, near-horizon extreme Kerr, and swirling spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly show that certain 4-dimensional infinitesimal group actions with 3-dimensional orbits are related by double Wick rotations. In particular, starting with the symmetries of the spherical/hyperbolic/planar Taub-NUT spacetimes, one can obtain symmetries of the near-horizon extreme Kerr (NHEK) geometry or swirling universe by complex analytic continuations of coordinates. Similarly, the static spherical/hyperbolic/planar symmetries (i.e., symmetries of the Schwarzschild spacetime and other A-metrics) are mapped to symmetries of the B-metrics (or Melvin spacetime). All these mappings are theory-independent -- they constitute relations among symmetries themselves, and, hence among the classes of symmetry-invariant metrics and electromagnetic field strengths, rather than among specific solutions. Consequently, finding, e.g., vacuum Taub-NUT-type solutions in a given gravitational theory automatically yields vacuum NHEK- or swirling-type solutions of that theory, with a possible extension to the electromagnetic case.</description>
