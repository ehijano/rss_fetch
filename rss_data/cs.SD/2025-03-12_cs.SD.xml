      <title>Contextual Speech Extraction: Leveraging Textual History as an Implicit Cue for Target Speech Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel approach for Target Speech Extraction (TSE), which relies solely on textual context to extract the target speech. We refer to this task as Contextual Speech Extraction (CSE). Unlike traditional TSE methods that rely on pre-recorded enrollment utterances, video of the target speaker's face, spatial information, or other explicit cues to identify the target stream, our proposed method requires only a few turns of previous dialogue (or monologue) history. This approach is naturally feasible in mobile messaging environments where voice recordings are typically preceded by textual dialogue that can be leveraged implicitly. We present three CSE models and analyze their performances on three datasets. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that even when the model relies purely on dialogue history, it can achieve over 90 % accuracy in identifying the correct target stream with only two previous dialogue turns. Furthermore, we show that by leveraging both textual context and enrollment utterances as cues during training, we further enhance our model's flexibility and effectiveness, allowing us to use either cue during inference, or combine both for improved performance.

      <title>Learning Control of Neural Sound Effects Synthesis from Physically Inspired Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound effects model design commonly uses digital signal processing techniques with full control ability, but it is difficult to achieve realism within a limited number of parameters. Recently, neural sound effects synthesis methods have emerged as a promising approach for generating high-quality and realistic sounds, but the process of synthesizing the desired sound poses difficulties in terms of control. This paper presents a real-time neural synthesis model guided by a physically inspired model, enabling the generation of high-quality sounds while inheriting the control interface of the physically inspired model. We showcase the superior performance of our model in terms of sound quality and control.</description>

      <title>Control Surfaces: Using the Commodore 64 and Analog Synthesizer to Expand Musical Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog-digital hybrid electronic music systems once existed out of necessity in order to facilitate a flexible work environment for the creation of live computer music. As computational power increased with the development of faster microprocessors, the need for digital functionality with analog sound production decreased, with the computer becoming more capable of handling both tasks. Given the exclusivity of these systems and the relatively short time they were in use, the possibilities of such systems were hardly explored. The work of Jos\'e Vicente Asuar best demonstrated a push for accessibility of such systems, but he never received the support of any institution in order to bring his machine widespread attention. Modeled after his approach, using a Commodore 64 (or freely available OS emulator) and analog modular hardware, this paper aims to fashion a system that is accessible, affordable, easy to use, educational, and musically rich in nature.</description>

      <title>Zero to 16383 Through the Wire: Transmitting High- Resolution MIDI with WebSockets and the Browser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper outlines how to leverage the Web MIDI API and web technologies to convert numerical data in JavaScript to Most Significant Byte and Least Significant Byte combos, stage the data as dual concurrent CC messages, use WebSockets to send it to multiple endpoints, and wire the browser to other music software. This method allows users to control their own native application via 14-bit MIDI messaging and even applications housed on a remote source. Because the technology utilizes WebSockets, it is not reliant on local networks for connectivity and opens the possibilities of remote software control and collaboration anywhere in the world. While no shortage of options exists for controlling music software from the web, the Web MIDI API allows for a more streamlined end user experience as it seamlessly links to core OS MIDI functionality. The paper will share a use case of transmitting high-resolution MIDI through the browser and translating it to control voltage data for use with a modular synthesizer.</description>

      <title>Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</description>

      <title>Performance Modeling for Correlation-based Neural Decoding of Auditory Attention to Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlation-based auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit neural tracking mechanisms to determine listener attention among competing speech sources via, e.g., electroencephalography signals. The correlation coefficients between the decoded neural responses and encoded speech stimuli of the different speakers then serve as AAD decision variables. A critical trade-off exists between the temporal resolution (the decision window length used to compute these correlations) and the AAD accuracy. This trade-off is typically characterized by evaluating AAD accuracy across multiple window lengths, leading to the performance curve. We propose a novel method to model this trade-off curve using labeled correlations from only a single decision window length. Our approach models the (un)attended correlations with a normal distribution after applying the Fisher transformation, enabling accurate AAD accuracy prediction across different window lengths. We validate the method on two distinct AAD implementations: a linear decoder and the non-linear VLAAI deep neural network, evaluated on separate datasets. Results show consistently low modeling errors of approximately 2 percent points, with 94% of true accuracies falling within estimated 95%-confidence intervals. The proposed method enables efficient performance curve modeling without extensive multi-window length evaluation, facilitating practical applications in, e.g., performance tracking in neuro-steered hearing devices to continuously adapt the system parameters over time.</description>

      <title>MERGE -- A Bimodal Dataset for Static Music Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Music Emotion Recognition (MER) field has seen steady developments in recent years, with contributions from feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning. The landscape has also shifted from audio-centric systems to bimodal ensembles that combine audio and lyrics. However, a severe lack of public and sizeable bimodal databases has hampered the development and improvement of bimodal audio-lyrics systems. This article proposes three new audio, lyrics, and bimodal MER research datasets, collectively called MERGE, created using a semi-automatic approach. To comprehensively assess the proposed datasets and establish a baseline for benchmarking, we conducted several experiments for each modality, using feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies. In addition, we propose and validate fixed train-validate-test splits. The obtained results confirm the viability of the proposed datasets, achieving the best overall result of 79.21% F1-score for bimodal classification using a deep neural network.</description>

      <title>M2R-Whisper: Multi-stage and Multi-scale Retrieval Augmentation for Enhancing Whisper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art models like OpenAI's Whisper exhibit strong performance in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), but they still face challenges in accurately recognizing diverse subdialects. In this paper, we propose M2R-whisper, a novel multi-stage and multi-scale retrieval augmentation approach designed to enhance ASR performance in low-resource settings. Building on the principles of in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented techniques, our method employs sentence-level ICL in the pre-processing stage to harness contextual information, while integrating token-level k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) retrieval as a post-processing step to further refine the final output distribution. By synergistically combining sentence-level and token-level retrieval strategies, M2R-whisper effectively mitigates various types of recognition errors. Experiments conducted on Mandarin and subdialect datasets, including AISHELL-1 and KeSpeech, demonstrate substantial improvements in ASR accuracy, all achieved without any parameter updates.</description>

      <title>Audio Large Language Models Can Be Descriptive Speech Quality Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ideal multimodal agent should be aware of the quality of its input modalities. Recent advances have enabled large language models (LLMs) to incorporate auditory systems for handling various speech-related tasks. However, most audio LLMs remain unaware of the quality of the speech they process. This limitation arises because speech quality evaluation is typically excluded from multi-task training due to the lack of suitable datasets. To address this, we introduce the first natural language-based speech evaluation corpus, generated from authentic human ratings. In addition to the overall Mean Opinion Score (MOS), this corpus offers detailed analysis across multiple dimensions and identifies causes of quality degradation. It also enables descriptive comparisons between two speech samples (A/B tests) with human-like judgment. Leveraging this corpus, we propose an alignment approach with LLM distillation (ALLD) to guide the audio LLM in extracting relevant information from raw speech and generating meaningful responses. Experimental results demonstrate that ALLD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art regression model in MOS prediction, with a mean square error of 0.17 and an A/B test accuracy of 98.6%. Additionally, the generated responses achieve BLEU scores of 25.8 and 30.2 on two tasks, surpassing the capabilities of task-specific models. This work advances the comprehensive perception of speech signals by audio LLMs, contributing to the development of real-world auditory and sensory intelligent agents.</description>

      <title>Optimizing tiny colorless feedback delay networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common bane of artificial reverberation algorithms is spectral coloration in the synthesized sound, typically manifesting as metallic ringing, leading to a degradation in the perceived sound quality. In delay network methods, coloration is more pronounced when fewer delay lines are used. This paper presents an optimization framework in which a tiny differentiable feedback delay network, with as few as four delay lines, is used to learn a set of parameters to iteratively reduce coloration. The parameters under optimization include the feedback matrix, as well as the input and output gains. The optimization objective is twofold: to maximize spectral flatness through a spectral loss while maintaining temporal density by penalizing sparseness in the parameter values. A favorable narrow distribution of modal excitation is achieved while maintaining the desired impulse response density. In a subjective assessment, the new method proves effective in reducing perceptual coloration of late reverberation. Compared to the author's previous work, which serves as the baseline and utilizes a sparsity loss in the time domain, the proposed method achieves computational savings while maintaining performance. The effectiveness of this work is demonstrated through two application scenarios where smooth-sounding synthetic room impulse responses are obtained via the introduction of attenuation filters and an optimizable scattering feedback matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that are robust and resilient to classroom conditions is paramount to the development of AI tools to aid teachers and students. In this work, we study the efficacy of continued pretraining (CPT) in adapting Wav2vec2.0 to the classroom domain. We show that CPT is a powerful tool in that regard and reduces the Word Error Rate (WER) of Wav2vec2.0-based models by upwards of 10%. More specifically, CPT improves the model's robustness to different noises, microphones and classroom conditions.</description>

      <title>Robust and Unbounded Length Generalization in Autoregressive Transformer-Based Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) Transformer-based sequence models are known to have difficulty generalizing to sequences longer than those seen during training. When applied to text-to-speech (TTS), these models tend to drop or repeat words or produce erratic output, especially for longer utterances. In this paper, we introduce enhancements aimed at AR Transformer-based encoder-decoder TTS systems that address these robustness and length generalization issues. Our approach uses an alignment mechanism to provide cross-attention operations with relative location information. The associated alignment position is learned as a latent property of the model via backpropagation and requires no external alignment information during training. While the approach is tailored to the monotonic nature of TTS input-output alignment, it is still able to benefit from the flexible modeling power of interleaved multi-head self- and cross-attention operations. A system incorporating these improvements, which we call Very Attentive Tacotron, matches the naturalness and expressiveness of a baseline T5-based TTS system, while eliminating problems with repeated or dropped words and enabling generalization to any practical utterance length.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection With Local Temporal Inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an audio-visual deepfake detection approach that aims to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies between audio and visual modalities. To achieve this, both architectural and data synthesis strategies are introduced. From an architectural perspective, a temporal distance map, coupled with an attention mechanism, is designed to capture these inconsistencies while minimizing the impact of irrelevant temporal subsequences. Moreover, we explore novel pseudo-fake generation techniques to synthesize local inconsistencies. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting audio-visual deepfakes.</description>

      <title>CS-Dialogue: A 104-Hour Dataset of Spontaneous Mandarin-English Code-Switching Dialogues for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a single conversation, presents significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Existing Mandarin-English code-switching datasets often suffer from limitations in size, spontaneity, and the lack of full-length dialogue recordings with transcriptions, hindering the development of robust ASR models for real-world conversational scenarios. This paper introduces CS-Dialogue, a novel large-scale Mandarin-English code-switching speech dataset comprising 104 hours of spontaneous conversations from 200 speakers. Unlike previous datasets, CS-Dialogue provides full-length dialogue recordings with complete transcriptions, capturing naturalistic code-switching patterns in continuous speech. We describe the data collection and annotation processes, present detailed statistics of the dataset, and establish benchmark ASR performance using state-of-the-art models. Our experiments, using Transformer, Conformer, and Branchformer, demonstrate the challenges of code-switching ASR, and show that existing pre-trained models such as Whisper still have the space to improve. The CS-Dialogue dataset will be made freely available for all academic purposes.</description>
