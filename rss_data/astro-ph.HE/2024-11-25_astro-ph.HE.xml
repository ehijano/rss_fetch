      <title>An NGC 1068-Informed Understanding of Neutrino Emission of the Active Galactic Nucleus TXS 0506+056</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present arguments that the neutrinos observed by IceCube from the active galactic nucleus TXS~0506+056 may originate near its core and not in the blazar jet. The origin of the neutrinos is consistent with the mechanism that produces the neutrino flux observed from the active galaxies NGC~1068 and NGC~4151, but requires an Eddington luminosity cosmic ray flux to compensate for its larger distance. Like NGC~1068, the source is characterized by episodes of high X-ray emission and is gamma-ray-obscured during the 2014 burst, and there is evidence that this is also the case during the short burst in 2017 that produced IC-170922. The observations may be explained as a flux originating in an obscured core within $10 \sim 100$ Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole, which is not transparent to gamma rays from neutral pions accompanying the neutrinos.</description>

      <title>CompactObject: An open-source Python package for full-scope neutron star equation of state inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CompactObject package is an open-source software framework developed to constrain the neutron star equation of state (EOS) through Bayesian statistical inference. It integrates astrophysical observational constraints from X-ray timing, gravitational wave events, and radio measurements, as well as nuclear experimental constraints derived from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) and Chiral Effective Field Theory ($\chi$EFT). The package supports a diverse range of EOS models, including meta-model like and several physics-motivated EOS models. It comprises three independent components: an EOS generator module that currently provides seven EOS choices, a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation solver, that allows the determination of the Mass Radius and Tidal deformability as observables, and a comprehensive Bayesian inference workflow module, including a complete pipeline for implementing EOS Bayesian inference. Each component can be used independently in different scientific research contexts, such as nuclear physics and astrophysics. In addition, CompactObject is designed to work in synergy with existing software such as CompOSE, allowing the use of the CompOSE EOS database to extend the EOS options available.</description>

      <title>GRB$\,$220831A: a hostless, intermediate Gamma-ray burst with an unusual optical afterglow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14749v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB$\,$220831A is a gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a duration and spectral peak energy that places it at the interface between the distribution of long-soft and short-hard GRBs. In this paper, we present the multi-wavelength follow-up campaign to GRB$\,$220831A and its optical, near-infrared, X-ray and radio counterparts. Our deep optical and near-infrared observations do not reveal an underlying host galaxy, and establish that GRB$\,$220831A is observationally hostless to depth, $m_i\gtrsim26.6$ AB mag. Based on the Amati relation and the non-detection of an accompanying supernova, we find that this GRB is most likely to have originated from a collapsar at $z&gt;2$, but it could also possibly be a compact object merger at $z&lt;0.4$ with a large separation distance from its host galaxy. Regardless of its origin, we show that its optical and near-infrared counterpart departs from the evolution expected from a forward shock dominated synchrotron afterglow, exhibiting a steep post-break temporal powerlaw index of $-3.83^{+0.62}_{-0.79}$, too steep to be the jet-break. By analysing a range of models, we find that the observed steep departure from forward shock closure relations is likely due to an internal process producing either a flare or a plateau.</description>

      <title>Unusual intra-burst variations of polarization states in FRB 20210912A and FRB 20230708A : Effects of plasma birefringence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic events of short-duration intense radio emission, the origin of which remains elusive till date. Polarization of the FRB signals carry information about the emission source as well as the magneto-ionic media the signal passes through before reaching terrestrial radio telescopes. Currently known FRBs show a diverse range of polarization, sometimes with complex features, making it challenging to describe them in a unified model. FRB 20230708A and FRB 20210912A are two bright and highly polarized FRBs detected in the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) that exhibit time-dependent conversion between linear and circular polarization as well as intra-burst (apparent) variation of Faraday rotation measure. We investigate the intra-burst temporal evolution of the polarization state of radio emission in these two events using the Poincar\'e sphere representation and find that the trajectories of the polarization state are well described by great circles on the Poincar\'e sphere. These polarization features may be signatures of a transition between two partially coherent orthogonal polarization modes or propagation through a birefringent medium. We find that the observed variations of the polarization states of these two FRBs are qualitatively consistent a magnetospheric origin of the bursts and the effects of propagation through a birefringent medium with linearly polarized modes in the outer magnetosphere or near-wind region of a neutron star.</description>

      <title>Stochastic acceleration in arbitrary astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent magnetic fields are to some extent a universal feature in astrophysical phenomena. Charged particles that encounter these turbulence get on average accelerated according to the so-called second-order Fermi process. However, in most astrophysical environments there are additional competing processes, such as different kinds of first-order energy changes and particle escape, that effect the resulting momentum distribution of the particles.
  In this work we provide to our knowledge the first semi-analytical solution of the isotropic steady-state momentum diffusion equation including continuous and catastrophic momentum changes that can be applied to any arbitrary astrophysical system of interest. Here, we adopt that the assigned magnetic turbulence is constrained on a finite range and the particle flux vanishes beyond these boundaries. Consequently, we show that the so-called pile-up bump -- that has for some special cases long been established -- is a universal feature of stochastic acceleration that emerges around the momentum $\chi_{\rm eq}$ where acceleration and continuous loss are in equilibrium if the particle's residence time in the system is sufficient at $\chi_{\rm eq}$. In general, the impact of continuous and catastrophic momentum changes plays a crucial role in the shape of the steady-state momentum distribution of the accelerated particles, where simplified unbroken power-law approximations are often not adequate.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 year Data Set: Removing pulsars one by one from the pulsar timing array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence has emerged for a stochastic signal correlated among 67 pulsars within the 15-year pulsar-timing data set compiled by the NANOGrav collaboration. Similar signals have been found in data from the European, Indian, Parkes, and Chinese PTAs. This signal has been interpreted as indicative of the presence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background. To explore the internal consistency of this result we investigate how the recovered signal strength changes as we remove the pulsars one by one from the data set. We calculate the signal strength using the (noise-marginalized) optimal statistic, a frequentist metric designed to measure correlated excess power in the residuals of the arrival times of the radio pulses. We identify several features emerging from this analysis that were initially unexpected. The significance of these features, however, can only be assessed by comparing the real data to synthetic data sets. After conducting identical analyses on simulated data sets, we do not find anything inconsistent with the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave background in the NANOGrav 15-year data. The methodologies developed here can offer additional tools for application to future, more sensitive data sets. While this analysis provides an internal consistency check of the NANOGrav results, it does not eliminate the necessity for additional investigations that could identify potential systematics or uncover unmodeled physical phenomena in the data.</description>

      <title>The non-equilibrium Marshak wave problem in non-homogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a family of similarity solutions to the nonlinear non-equilibrium Marshak wave problem for an inhomogeneous planar medium which is coupled to a time dependent radiation driving source. We employ the non-equilibrium gray diffusion approximation in the supersonic regime. The solutions constitute a generalization of the non-equilibrium nonlinear solutions that were developed recently for homogeneous media. Self-similar solutions are constructed for a power law time dependent surface temperature, a spatial power law density profile and a material model with power law temperature and density dependent opacities and specific energy density. The extension of the problem to non-homogeneous media enables the existence of similarity solutions for a general power law specific material energy. It is shown that the solutions exist for specific values of the temporal temperature drive and spatial density exponents, which depend on the material exponents. We also illustrate how the similarity solutions take various qualitatively different forms which are analyzed with respect to various parameters. Based on the solutions, we define a set of non-trivial benchmarks for supersonic non-equilibrium radiative heat transfer. The similarity solutions are compared to gray diffusion simulations as well as to detailed implicit Monte-Carlo and discrete-ordinate transport simulations in the optically-thick regime, showing a great agreement, which highlights the benefit of these solutions as a code verification test problem.</description>

      <title>Radio and gamma-ray timing of TRAPUM L-band Fermi pulsar survey discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a joint radio and gamma-ray timing campaign on the nine millisecond pulsars (MSPs) discovered as part of the L-band targeted survey of Fermi-LAT sources performed in the context of the Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM) Large Survey Project. Out of these pulsars, eight are members of binary systems; of these eight, two exhibit extended eclipses of the radio emission. Using an initial radio timing solution, pulsations were found in the gamma rays for six of the targets. For these sources, a joint timing analysis of radio times of arrival and gamma-ray photons was performed, using a newly developed code that optimises the parameters through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. This approach has allowed us to precisely measure both the short- and long-term timing parameters. This study includes a proper motion measurement for four pulsars, which a gamma ray-only analysis would not have been sensitive to, despite the 15-year span of Fermi data.</description>

      <title>Sources and Radiations of the Fermi Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two enigmatic gamma-ray features in the Galactic central region, known as Fermi Bubbles (FBs), were found from Fermi-LAT data. An energy release (e.g., by tidal disruption events in the Galactic center, GC), generates a cavity with a shock that expands into the local ambient medium of the Galactic halo. A decade or so ago, a phenomenological model of the FBs was suggested as a result of routine star disruptions by the supermassive black hole in the GC which might provide enough energy for large-scale structures, like the FBs. In 2020, analytical and numerical models of the FBs as a process of routine tidal disruption of stars near the GC were developed, which can provide enough cumulative energy to form and maintain large scale structures like the FBs. The disruption events are expected to be ten to hundred events per million years, providing the average power of energy release from the GC into the halo of 3E41 erg/s, which is needed to support the FBs. Analysis of the evolution of superbubbles in exponentially stratified disks concluded that the FB envelope would be destroyed by the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities at late stages. The shell is composed of a swept-up gas of the bubble, whose thickness is much thinner in comparison to the size of the envelope. We assume that hydrodynamic turbulence is excited in the FB envelope by the RT instability. In this case, the universal energy spectrum of turbulence may be developed in the inertial range of wavenumbers of fluctuations (the Kolmogorov-Obukhov spectrum). From our model we suppose the power of the FBs is transformed partly into the energy of hydrodynamic turbulence in the envelope. If so, hydrodynamic turbulence may generate MHD-fluctuations, which accelerate cosmic rays there and generate gamma-ray and radio emission from the FBs. We hope that this model may interpret the observed nonthermal emission from the bubbles.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of strangeon matter using the measurements of PSR J0437-4715 and GW190814</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14938v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observations of compact star inspirals from LIGO/Virgo combined with mass and radius measurements from NICER provide a valuable tool to study the highly uncertain equation of state (EOS) of dense matter at the densities characteristic of compact stars. In this work, we constrain the solid states of strange-cluster matter, called strangeon matter, as the putative basic units of the ground state of bulk strong matter using a Bayesian statistical method, incorporating the mass and radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, and the recent data for the $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0437-4715. We also include constraints from gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190814. Under the prior assumption of a finite number of quarks in a strangeon, $N_{\rm q}$, our analysis reveals that current mass-radius measurements favor a larger $N_{\rm q}$. Specifically, the results support the scenario where a strangeon forms a stable bound state with $N_{\rm q}=18$, symmetric in color, flavor, and spin spaces, compared to the minimum $N_{\rm q}$ prior. The comparative analyses of the posterior EOS parameter spaces derived from three-parameter model and two-parameter model demonstrate a consistent prediction under identical observational constraints. In particular, our results indicate that the most probable values of the maximum mass are found to be $3.58^{+0.16}_{-0.12}\ M_{\odot}$ ($3.65^{+0.18}_{-0.16}\ M_{\odot}$) at $90\%$ confidence level for three-parameter (two-parameter) EOS considering the constraints of GW190814. The corresponding radii for $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ and $2.1\ M_{\odot}$ stars are $12.04^{+0.27}_{-0.31}~\rm km$ ($12.16^{+0.26}_{-0.31}~\rm km$) and $13.43^{+0.31}_{-0.32}~\rm km$ ($13.60^{+0.29}_{-0.34}~\rm km$), respectively. This result may impact interestingly on the research of multiquark states, which could improve our understanding of the nonperturbative strong force.</description>

      <title>The role of XMM-Newton in the investigation of persistent BeXRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent BeXRBs are a class of High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXRBs), which are characterized by persistent low X-ray luminosities ($L_{\rm X} \sim 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and wide ($P_{\rm orb} &gt;$ 30 d), almost circular orbits. In these sources the NS is slowly rotating (with $P_{\rm spin}$ well above 100 s) and accretes matter directly from the wind of the companion Be star, without the formation of an accretion disk. Since the '90s, when the first four members of this class were identified, several other sources of the same type have been discovered and investigated. Thanks to follow-up XMM-Newton observations, we have verified that most of them share common spectral and timing properties, such as a pulsed fraction that does not vary with the photon energy and a hot (kT = 1-2 keV) blackbody spectral component which contributes for 20-40 % to the total flux and has a size consistent with the NS polar cap. Here we provide an overview of how XMM-Newton contributed to constrain the observational properties and the current understanding of this type of sources. We also report about the first results obtained with a very recent XMM-Newton observation of the poorly known BeXRB 4U 0728-25.</description>

      <title>On the effective spin-mass ratio '$\chi_{\rm eff}-q$' relation of binary black hole mergers that evolved in isolation</title>

Abstract: The ground-based measurement of gravitational waves (GW) from merging binary black holes (BBH) uniquely allows determination of spins of stellar-remnant black holes (BH), thereby offering insights into their formation mechanisms. The observed population of BBH mergers exhibits two intriguing peculiarities related to BH spins, namely, a positively biased distribution of effective spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, and an apparent anti-correlation between merger mass ratio, $q$, and $\chi_{\rm eff}$. Here we investigate the potential mechanisms for such observed properties, in BBH mergers via isolated binary evolution. We synthesize BBH mergers with the fast binary evolution code BSE. The role of various physical assumptions is explored, including tidal spin-up, compact remnant mass, and mass transfer physics. We compare the properties of WR-BH binaries that formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) and common envelope evolution (CE). We find that both the asymmetry in $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution and the $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ anti-correlation are natural outcomes of isolated-binary BBH formation with the standard assumptions on mass transfer physics. The anti-correlation is particularly pronounced for SMT-channel BBH mergers that experience a mass-ratio-reversal, i.e., those where the second-born BH is the more massive member. The anti-correlation arises from the dependence of orbital shrinking during mass transfer and the Roche lobe size on the system's mass ratio. This characteristic $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ trend diminishes with increasing metallicity and when the isolated-binary BBH merger population is mixed with a significant contribution of dynamically formed BBH mergers. Our results demonstrate that isolated massive binary evolution via the SMT sub-channel can reproduce the observable BBH merger population, with characteristic signatures in mass, mass ratio, and spin distributions.[abr.]</description>

      <title>Penrose and super-Penrose energy extraction from a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime with a cosmological constant through the BSW mechanism: Full story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Penrose process, a process that transfers energy from a black hole to infinity, together with the BSW mechanism, which uses collisions of ingoing particles at the event horizon of a black hole to locally produce large amounts of energy, is studied in a combined description for a $d$ dimensional extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime with negative, zero, or positive cosmological constant, i.e., for an asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS), flat, or de Sitter (dS) spacetime. In an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole background, in the vicinity of the horizon, several types of radial collisions between electrically charged particles can be considered. The most interesting one is between a critical particle, with its electric charge adjusted in a specific way, and a usual particle, as it gives a divergent center of mass frame energy locally, this being a favorable but not sufficient condition to extract energy from the black hole. To understand whether energy can be extracted in such a collisional Penrose process, we investigate in detail a collision between ingoing particles 1 and 2, from which particles 3 and 4 emerge, with the possibility that particle 3 can carry energy far out from the black hole horizon. One finds that the mass, energy, electric charge, and initial direction of motion of particle 3 can have different values, depending on the collision internal process, but these values lie within some range. Moreover, the energy of particle 3 can be arbitrarily high but not infinite, characterizing a super-Penrose process. It is also shown that particle 4 has negative energy, living in its own electric ergosphere before being engulfed by the event horizon. For zero cosmological constant the results do not depend on the number of dimensions, but they do for nonzero cosmological constant, which also introduces differences in the lower bound for the energy extracted.</description>

      <title>Constraining the progenitor of the nearby Type II-P SN 2024ggi with environmental analysis</title>

Abstract: The progenitors of Type II-P supernovae (SN) have been confirmed to be red supergiants. However, the upper mass limit of the directly probed progenitors is much lower than that predicted by current theories, and the accurate determination of the progenitor masses is key to understand the final fate of massive stars. Located at a distance of only 6.72 Mpc, the Type II-P SN 2024ggi is one of the closest SN in the last decade. Previous studies have analyzed its progenitor by direct detection, but the derived progenitor mass may be influenced by the very uncertain circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability. In this work, we try to constrain the progenitor mass with an environmental analysis based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We found that stars in the progenitor environment have a uniform spatial distribution without significant clumpiness, and we derived the star formation history of the environment with a hierarchical Bayesian method. The progenitor is associated with the youngest population in the SN environment with an age of log($t$/yr) = 7.41 (i.e. 25.7 Myr), which corresponds to an initial mass of $10.2^{+0.06}_{-0.09}$ $M_\odot$. Our work provides an independent measurement of the progenitor mass, which is not affected by circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Assessment of Data Volume Reduction for IACTs</title>

Abstract: High energy cosmic-rays generate air showers when they enter Earth's atmosphere. Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is possible using either direct detection of shower particles at mountain altitudes, or with arrays of imaging air-Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). Advances in the technique and larger collection areas have increased the rate at which air-shower events can be captured, and the amount of data produced by modern high-time-resolution Cherenkov cameras. Therefore, Data Volume Reduction (DVR) has become critical for such telescope arrays, ensuring that only useful information is stored long-term. Given the vast amount of raw data, owing to the highest resolution and sensitivity, the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will need robust data reduction strategies to ensure efficient handling and analysis. The CTAO data rates needs be reduced from hundreds of Petabytes (PB) per year to a few PB/year.
  This paper presents algorithms tailored for CTAO but also applicable for other arrays, focusing on selecting pixels likely to contain shower light. It describes and evaluates multiple algorithms based on their signal efficiency, noise rejection, and shower reconstruction. With a focus on a time-based clustering algorithm which demonstrates a notable enhancement in the retention of low-level signal pixels. Moreover, the robustness is assessed under different observing conditions, including detector defects. Through testing and analysis, it is shown that these algorithms offer promising solutions for efficient volume reduction in CTAO, addressing the challenges posed by the array's very large data volume and ensuring reliable data storage amidst varying observational conditions and hardware issues.</description>

      <title>A detailed investigation of particle energisation mechanisms in models of collapsing magnetic traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a detailed investigation of the energisation processes in two-dimensional, two and a half-dimensional and three-dimensional collapsing magnetic trap models. Using kinematic magnetohydrodynamic models of collapsing magnetic traps, we examine the importance of Fermi acceleration in comparison with betatron acceleration in these models. We extend previous work by investigating particle orbits in two-dimensional models without and with a guide field component and from full three-dimensional models. We compare the outcomes for the different models and how they depend on the chosen initial conditions. While in the literature betatron acceleration has been emphasised as the major mechanism for particle energisation in collapsing magnetic traps, we find that Fermi acceleration can play a significant role as well for particle orbits with suitable initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Determining proto-neutron stars' minimal mass with chirally constrained nuclear equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal masses and radii of proto-neutron stars during different stages of their evolution are investigated. In our work we focus on two stages, directly after the supernova shock wave moves outwards, where neutrinos are still captured in the core and the lepton per baryon ratio is fixed to $Y_L = 0.4$, and a few seconds afterwards, when all neutrinos have left the star. All nuclear equations of state used for this purpose fulfill the binding energy constraints from chiral effective field theory for neutron matter at zero temperature. We find for the neutrino-trapped case higher minimal masses than for the case when neutrinos have left the proto-neutron star. Thermal effects, here in the form of a given constant entropy per baryon $s$, have a smaller effect on increasing the minimal mass. The minimal proto-neutron star mass for the first evolutionary stage with $Y_L = 0.4$ and $s = 1$ amounts to $M_{min} \sim 0.62M_{\odot}$ and for the stage without neutrinos and $s = 2$ to $M_{min} \sim 0.22M_{\odot}$ rather independent on the nuclear equation of state used. We also study the case related to an accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf where the initial lepton fraction is $Y_L = 0.5$ and observe large discrepancies in the results of the different tables of nuclear equations of state used. Our finding points towards a thermodynamical inconsistent treatment of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition for nuclear equations of state in tabular form demanding a fully generalized three-dimensional Gibbs construction for a proper treatment. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a universal relation for the increase of the proto-neutron star minimal mass with the lepton fraction for all nuclear equations of state used.</description>

      <title>Outer Solar System spacecraft without drag-free control to probe the $\mu$Hz gravitational wave frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require substantial development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10$ AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30$ AU and $10$ Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks should be achievable with 20 cm mirrors or 5 m radio dishes. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$ Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concept requires two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.</description>

Abstract: Tornadoes are severe weather phenomena characterized by a violently rotating column of air connecting the ground to a parent storm. Within the United States, hundreds of tornadoes occur every year. Despite this, the dynamics of tornado formation and propagation are not particularly well understood, in part due to the challenge of instrumentation: many existing instruments for measuring atmospheric properties are in-situ detectors, making deployment in or near an active or developing tornado difficult. Here, we combine local atmospheric and cosmic ray air shower simulation to explore the potential for remote measurement of the pressure field within tornado-producing supercell thunderstorms by examining directional variations of the atmospheric muon flux.</description>

      <title>The impact of dark matter on tidal signatures in neutron star mergers with Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) accumulates inside neutron stars (NS), it changes their internal structure and causes a shift of the tidal deformability from the value predicted by the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In principle, this shift could be observable in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We investigate the effect of fermionic, non-interacting DM when observing a large number of GW events from DM-admixed BNSs with the precision of the proposed Einstein telescope (ET). Specifically, we study the impact on the recovery of the baryonic EOS and whether DM properties can be constrained. For this purpose, we create event catalogues of BNS mock events with DM fraction up to 1%, from which we reconstruct the posterior uncertainties with the Fisher matrix approach. Using this data, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the baryonic EOS, DM particle mass, and DM particle fraction in each event. Our results reveal that when falsely ignoring DM effects, the EOS posterior is biased towards softer EOSs, though the offset is rather small. Further, we find that within our assumptions of our DM model and population, ET will likely not be able to test the presence of DM in BNSs, even when combining many events and adding Cosmic Explorer (CE) to the next-generation detector network. Likewise, the potential constraints on the DM particle mass will remain weak because of degeneracies with the fraction and EOS.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Hadronic Code Comparison for Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the first dedicated comparison of five hadronic codes (AM$^3$, ATHE$\nu$A, B13, LeHa-Paris, and LeHaMoC) that have been extensively used in modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of jetted active galactic nuclei. The purpose of this comparison is to identify the sources of systematic errors (e.g., implementation method of proton-photon interactions) and to quantify the expected dispersion in numerical SED models computed with the five codes. The outputs from the codes are first tested in synchrotron self-Compton scenarios that are the simplest blazar emission models used in the literature. We then compare the injection rates and spectra of secondary particles produced in pure hadronic cases with monoenergetic and power-law protons interacting on black-body and power-law photon fields. We finally compare the photon SEDs and the neutrino spectra for realistic proton-synchrotron and leptohadronic blazar models. We find that the codes are in excellent agreement with respect to the spectral shape of the photons and neutrinos. There is a remaining spread in the overall normalization that we quantify, at its maximum, at the level of $\pm 40\%$. This value should be used as an additional, conservative, systematic uncertainty term when comparing numerical simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>Inferring Interference: Identifying a Perturbing Tertiary with Eccentric Gravitational Wave Burst Timing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07278v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] Binary black holes may form and merge dynamically. These binaries are likely to become bound with high eccentricities, resulting in a burst of gravitational radiation at their point of closest approach. When such a binary is perturbed by a third body, the evolution of the orbit is affected, and gravitational-wave burst times are altered. The bursts times therefore encode information about the tertiary. In order to extract this information, we require a prescription for the relationship between the tertiary properties and the gravitational-wave burst times. In this paper, we demonstrate a toy model for the burst times of a secular three-body system. We show how Bayesian inference can be employed to deduce the tertiary properties when the bursts are detected by next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. We study the bursts from an eccentric binary with a total mass of $60$~M$_\odot$ orbiting an $6 \times 10^{8}$~M$_\odot$ supermassive black hole. When we assume no knowledge of the eccentric binary, we are unable to tightly constrain the existence or properties of the tertiary, and we recover biased posterior probability distributions for the parameters of the eccentric binary. However, when the properties of the binary are already well-known -- as is likely if the late inspiral and merger are also detected -- we are able to more accurately infer the mass of the perturber, $m_3$, and its distance from the binary, $R$. When we assume measurement precision on the binary parameters consistent with expectations for next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, we can be greater than $90\%$ confident that the binary is perturbed.

      <title>A novel numerical method for mixed-frame multigroup radiation-hydrodynamics with GPU acceleration implemented in the QUOKKA code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed-frame formulations of radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD), where the radiation quantities are computed in an inertial frame but matter quantities are in a comoving frame, are advantageous because they admit algorithms that conserve energy and momentum to machine precision and combine more naturally with adaptive mesh techniques, since unlike pure comoving-frame methods they do not face the problem that radiation quantities must change frame every time a cell is refined or coarsened. However, implementing multigroup RHD in a mixed-frame formulation presents challenges due to the complexity of handling frequency-dependent interactions and the Doppler shift of radiation boundaries. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for multigroup RHD that integrates a mixed-frame formulation with a piecewise powerlaw approximation for frequency dependence within groups. This approach ensures the exact conservation of total energy and momentum while effectively managing the Lorentz transformation of group boundaries and evaluation of group-averaged opacities. Our method takes advantage of the locality of matter-radiation coupling, allowing the source term for $N_g$ frequency groups to be handled with simple equations with a sparse Jacobian matrix of size $N_g + 1$, which can be inverted with $O(N_g)$ complexity. This results in a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N_g$ and requires no more communication than a pure hydrodynamics update, making it highly efficient for massively parallel and GPU-based systems. We implement our method in the GPU-accelerated RHD code QUOKKA and demonstrate that it passes a wide range of numerical tests, including preserving the asymptotic diffusion limit. We demonstrate that the piecewise powerlaw method shows significant advantages over traditional opacity averaging methods for handling rapidly variable opacities with modest frequency resolution.</description>

Abstract: The rates of flavor-changing weak processes are crucial in determining the conditions of beta equilibrium in neutron stars and mergers, influencing the damping of oscillations, the stability of rotating pulsars, and the emission of gravitational waves. We derive a formula for these rates at nonzero temperature, to leading order in the Fermi coupling and exact in the QCD coupling. Utilizing a simple phenomenological holographic model dual to QCD, we study massless unpaired quark matter at high densities. We numerically compute the rate for small deviations from beta equilibrium and derive an analytic approximation for small temperatures. Our findings reveal that, compared to the perturbative result, the rate is suppressed by logarithmic factors of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Shaping Outflows and Jets by Ambient Pressure: a Unified Framework</title>

Abstract: Astrophysical outflows are ubiquitous across cosmic scales, from stellar to galactic systems. While diverse launching mechanisms have been proposed, we demonstrate that these outflows share a fundamental commonality: their morphology follows the physics of pressure-confined supersonic flows. By extending classical deLaval nozzle theory to account for ambient pressure gradients, we present a unified framework that successfully describes outflows from young stellar objects to active galactic nuclei. Our model reveals a remarkable consistency in pressure profiles, characterized by a power-law exponent near minus two, independent of the internal characteristics of the outflow or the nature of central engine. This discovery suggests a universal mechanism for outflow collimation and acceleration, bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational features across a wide range of astronomical scales.</description>
