      <title>Universal Diffusion in Coulomb Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion coefficients for crystallized Coulomb plasmas are essential microphysics input for modeling white dwarf cores and neutron star crusts but are poorly understood. In this work we present a model for diffusion in Coulomb crystals. We show that melting and diffusion follow the same universal scaling such that diffusion is independent of screening. Our simulations show, contrary to prevailing wisdom, that the formation of vacancies is not suppressed by the large pressure. Rather, vacancy formation and hole diffusion is the dominant mode of self diffusion in Coulomb crystals.</description>

      <title>Two-plasmon decay instability and 3/2 harmonic generation in inhomogeneous magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-plasmon decay instability emerges as the parametric decay of laser beams into two plasma waves which is expected for hohlraum in inertial confinement fusion. The behavior of this instability in magnetized plasma is investigated in the present study where the thermal effects are considered. The study demonstrates that the applying of a dc magnetic field significantly increases the rate at which the instability develops, while the increase of electron temperature has the opposite effect. The generation of 3/2 harmonic, which results from the beating of the incident laser and plasma wave, is also studied in the present study. The intensity of this harmonic, which appears in the spectrum as a sideband derived analytically, indicates that an increase in the dc magnetic field increases the intensity of this sideband.</description>

      <title>Probing the radiation-dominated regime of laser-plasma interaction in multi-beam configurations of petawatt lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model numerically the ultrarelativistic dynamics of a dense plasma microtarget in a focus of several intersecting femtosecond laser pulses of multi-petawatt power each. The aim is to examine perspective future experimental approaches to the search of the Inverse Faraday Effect induced by radiation friction. We show that multi-beam configurations allow lowering the peak laser power required to generate a detectable quasi-static longitudinal magnetic field excited due to the radiation reaction force. The effect remains significant at angles around $10^{\rm o}$ between the beams, vanishes when the angle exceeds $20^{\rm o}$, and remains rather stable with respect to variations of relative phases and amplitudes of the beams. We conclude that using four infrared femtosecond linearly polarized pulses, 15 petawatt power each, crossing at angles $\approx 10^{\rm o}$, the radiation-dominated regime of laser-plasma interaction can be experimentally demonstrated.</description>

      <title>$E\times B$ shear suppression of microtearing based transport in spherical tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic microtearing modes (MTMs) have been observed in many different spherical tokamak regimes. Understanding how these and other electromagnetic modes nonlinearly saturate is likely critical in understanding the confinement of a high $\beta$ spherical tokamak (ST). Equilibrium $E\times B$ sheared flows have sometimes been found to significantly suppress low $\beta$ ion scale transport in both gyrokinetic simulations and in experiment. This work aims to understand the conditions under which $E\times B$ sheared flow impacts on the saturation of MTM simulations. Two experimental regimes are examined from MAST and NSTX, on surfaces that have unstable MTMs. The MTM driven transport on a local flux surface in MAST is shown to be more resilient to suppression via $E\times B$ shear, compared to the case from NSTX where the MTM transport is found to be significantly suppressed. This difference in the response to flow shear is explained through the impact of magnetic shear, $\hat{s}$ on the MTM linear growth rate dependence on ballooning angle, $\theta_0$. At low $\hat{s}$, the growth rate depends weakly on $\theta_0$, but at higher $\hat{s}$, the MTM growth rate peaks at $\theta_0 = 0$, with regions of stability at higher $\theta_0$. Equilibrium $E\times B$ sheared flows act to advect the $\theta_0$ of a mode in time, providing a mechanism which suppresses the transport from these modes when they become stable. The dependence of $\gamma^{MTM}$ on $\theta_0$ is in qualitative agreement with a recent theory [M.R. Hardman et al (2023)] at low $\beta$ when $q\sim1$, but the agreement worsens at higher $q$ where the theory breaks down. This work highlights the important role of the safety factor profile in determining the impact of equilibrium $E\times B$ shear on the saturation level of MTM turbulence.</description>

      <title>Design Optimization of Nuclear Fusion Reactor through Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize the design of a nuclear fusion reactor. DRL can efficiently address the challenging issues attributed to multiple physics and engineering constraints for steady-state operation. The fusion reactor design computation and the optimization code applicable to parallelization with DRL are developed. The proposed framework enables finding the optimal reactor design that satisfies the operational requirements while reducing building costs. Multi-objective design optimization for a fusion reactor is now simplified by DRL, indicating the high potential of the proposed framework for advancing the efficient and sustainable design of future reactors.</description>

      <title>The April 2023 SYM-H = -233 nT Geomagnetic Storm: A Classical Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 23-24 April 2023 double-peak (SYM-H intensities of -179 and -233 nT) intense geomagnetic storm was caused by interplanetary magnetic field southward component Bs associated with an interplanetary fast-forward shock-preceded sheath (Bs of 25 nT), followed by a magnetic cloud (MC) (Bs of 33 nT), respectively. At the center of the MC, the plasma density exhibited an order of magnitude decrease, leading to a sub-Alfvenic solar wind interval for ~2.1 hr. Ionospheric Joule heating accounted for a significant part (~81%) of the magnetospheric energy dissipation during the storm main phase. Equal amount of Joule heating in the dayside and nightside ionosphere is consistent with the observed intense and global-scale DP2 (disturbance polar) currents during the storm main phase. The sub-Alfvenic solar wind is associated with disappearance of substorms, a sharp decrease in Joule heating dissipation, and reduction in electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave amplitude. The shock/sheath compression of the magnetosphere led to relativistic electron flux losses in the outer radiation belt between L* = 3.5 and 5.5. Relativistic electron flux enhancements were detected in the lower L* &lt; 3.5 region during the storm main and recovery phases. Equatorial ionospheric plasma anomaly structures are found to be modulated by the prompt penetration electric fields. Around the anomaly crests, plasma density at ~470 km altitude and altitude-integrated ionospheric total electron content are found to increase by ~60% and ~80%, with ~33% and ~67% increases in their latitudinal extents compared to their quiet-time values, respectively.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional mapping of femtosecond laser filaments using coherent microwave scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports on the use of coherent microwave scattering (CMS) for spatially resolved electron number density measurements of elongated plasma structures induced at mid-IR femtosecond filamentation in air. The presented studies comprise one-dimensional mapping of laser filaments induced via 3.9 um, 127.3 fs laser pulses at output energies up to 15 mJ. The axial electron number density was measured to be invariant (about 2x10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$) along the entire filament length and for all tested laser pulse energies 5-15 mJ, and the corresponding laser intensity in the middle portion of the filament was estimated to be nearly constant for 5-15 mJ pulse energies (about 30-40 TW/cm$^2$). These fundings support that intensity clamping conditions were achieved in the experiments. The proposed approach enables capabilities that are currently unavailable to perform absolute and longitudinally resolved measurements of electron number density in laser filaments and to precisely characterize conditions associated with self-focusing and intensity clamping.</description>

      <title>Integrated modeling of boron powder injection for real-time plasma-facing component conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An integrated modeling framework for investigating the application of solid boron powder injection for real-time surface conditioning of plasma-facing components in tokamak environments is presented. Utilizing the DIII-D impurity powder dropper setup, this study simulates B powder injection scenarios ranging from mg/s to tens of mg/s, corresponding to B flux rates of $10^{20}-10^{21}$ B/s in standard L-mode conditions. The comprehensive modeling approach combines EMC3-EIRENE for simulating the D plasma background and DIS for the ablation and transport of the B powder particles. The results show substantial transport of B to the inboard lower divertor, predominantly influenced by the main ion plasma flow. The dependency on powder particle size (5-250 $\mu$m) was found to be insignificant for the scenario considered. The effects of erosion and redeposition were considered to reconcile the discrepancies with experimental observations, which saw substantial deposition on the outer divertor PFCs. For this purpose, the WallDYN3D code was updated to include B sources within the plasma domain and integrated into the modeling framework. The mixed-material migration modeling shows evolving B deposition patterns, suggesting the formation of mixed B-C layers or predominantly B coverage depending on the powder mass flow rate. While the modeling outcomes at lower B injection rates tend to align with experimental observations, the prediction of near-pure B layers at higher rates has yet to be experimentally verified in the C environment of the DIII-D tokamak. The extensive reach of B layers found in the modeling suggests the need for modeling that encompasses the entire wall geometry for more accurate experimental correlations. This integrated approach sets a precedent for analyzing and applying real-time in-situ boron coating techniques in advanced tokamak scenarios, potentially extendable to ITER.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Chemistry Reduction in N$_2$-H$_2$ Low-Temperature Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-temperature plasmas are partially ionized gases, where ions and neutrals coexist in a highly reactive environment. This creates a rich chemistry, which is often difficult to understand in its full complexity. In this work, we develop a machine learning model to identify the most important reactions in a given chemical scheme. The training data are an initial distribution of species and a final distribution of species, which can be obtained from either experiments or simulations. The model is trained to provide a set of reaction weights, which become the basis for reducing the chemical scheme. The approach is applied to N$_2$-H$_2$ plasmas, created by an electric discharge at low pressure, where the main goal is to produce NH$_3$. The interplay of multiple species, as well as of volume and surface reactions, make this chemistry especially challenging to understand. Reducing the chemical scheme via the proposed model helps identify the main chemical pathways.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigations on Dilute Cold Plasma Potential and Electron Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation results are presented to demonstrate electron temperature and electrical potential development in dilute and cold plasma development. The simulation method is a hybrid method which adopted fluid model for electrons due to their high mobility, while heavy ions and neutrals are modelled with the direct simulation Monte Carlo and Particle-In-Cell methods. The flows include steady, starting-up and shutting-down scenarios. The goal is to illustrate the exponential behaviors which were predicted in several recently developed formulas. Those formulas include many coefficients related with local properties, and they are difficult to determine. Hence, those trends can only efficiently demonstrate by numerical simulations which are more convenient than experimental measurements. The results confirm several facts. For steady plasma flows, the electron temperature and potential profiles are smooth, very likely, they can be approximated with exponential functions. For unsteady flows, the property developing trends in the shutting down or starting-up processes change monotonically. Further, at locations with large gradients, the property change trends are less ideal than those formulas. This is consistent with the assumptions with which those formulas were developed.</description>
