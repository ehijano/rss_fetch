      <title>Economic Capacity Withholding Bounds of Competitive Energy Storage Bidders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic withholding in electricity markets refers to generators bidding higher than their true marginal fuel cost, and is a typical approach to exercising market power. However, existing market designs require storage to design bids strategically based on their own future price predictions, motivating storage to conduct economic withholding without assuming market power. As energy storage takes up more significant roles in wholesale electricity markets, understanding its motivations for economic withholding and the consequent effects on social welfare becomes increasingly vital. This paper derives a theoretical framework to study the economic capacity withholding behavior of storage participating in competitive electricity markets and validate our results in simulations based on the ISO New England system. We demonstrate that storage bids can reach unbounded high levels under conditions where future price predictions show bounded expectations but unbounded deviations. Conversely, in scenarios with peak price limitations, we show the upper bounds of storage bids are grounded in bounded price expectations. Most importantly, we show that storage capacity withholding can potentially lower the overall system cost when price models account for system uncertainties. Our paper reveals energy storage is not a market manipulator but an honest player contributing to the social welfare. It helps electricity market researchers and operators better understand the economic withholding behavior of storage and reform market policies to maximize storage contributing to a cost-efficient decolonization.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Effective AI Recommendations in Cyber-Physical-Human Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many cyber-physical-human systems (CPHS) involve a human decision-maker who may receive recommendations from an artificial intelligence (AI) platform while holding the ultimate responsibility of making decisions. In such CPHS applications, the human decision-maker may depart from an optimal recommended decision and instead implement a different one for various reasons. In this letter, we develop a rigorous framework to overcome this challenge. In our framework, we consider that humans may deviate from AI recommendations as they perceive and interpret the system's state in a different way than the AI platform. We establish the structural properties of optimal recommendation strategies and develop an approximate human model (AHM) used by the AI. We provide theoretical bounds on the optimality gap that arises from an AHM and illustrate the efficacy of our results in a numerical example.</description>

      <title>On stochastic string stability with applications to platooning over additive noise channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the string stabilization of vehicular platooning when stochastic phenomena are inherent in inter-vehicle communication. To achieve this, we first provide two definitions to analytically assess the string stability in stochastic scenarios, considering the mean and variance of tracking errors as the platoon size grows. Subsequently, we analytically derive necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve this notion of string stability in predecessor-following linear platoons that communicate through additive white noise channels. We conclude that the condition ensuring string stability with ideal communication is essentially the same that achieves stochastic string stability when additive noise channels are in place and guarantees that the tracking error means and variances converge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present an approach for learning human driving behavior, without relying on specific model structures or prior distributions, in a mixed-traffic environment where connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). We employ conformal prediction to obtain theoretical safety guarantees and use real-world traffic data to validate our approach. Then, we design a controller that ensures effective merging of CAVs with HDVs with safety guarantees. We provide numerical simulations to illustrate the efficacy of the control approach.</description>

      <title>Bounding Stochastic Safety: Leveraging Freedman's Inequality with Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When deployed in the real world, safe control methods must be robust to unstructured uncertainties such as modeling error and external disturbances. Typical approaches either leverage worst-case uncertainty bounds to provide safety guarantees for an expanded (overly conservative) safe set or synthesize controllers that always assume the worst-case disturbance will occur. In contrast, this paper utilizes Freedman's inequality in the context of discrete-time control barrier functions (DTCBFs) to provide stronger (less conservative) safety guarantees for stochastic systems. Our approach accounts for the underlying disturbance distribution instead of relying exclusively on its worst-case bound and does not require the barrier function to be upper-bounded, which makes the resulting safety probability bounds more directly useful for intuitive constraints such as signed distance. We compare our results with existing safety guarantees, such as Input-to-State-Safety (ISSf) and martingale results that rely on Ville's inequality. When the assumptions for all methods hold, we provide a range of parameters for which our guarantee is less conservative. Finally, we present simulation examples, including a bipedal walking robot, that demonstrate the utility and tightness of our safety guarantee.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Flow Complexity in Transportation Networks using Graph Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Series-parallel network topologies generally exhibit simplified dynamical behavior and avoid high combinatorial complexity. A comprehensive analysis of how flow complexity emerges with a graph's deviation from series-parallel topology is therefore of fundamental interest. We introduce the notion of a robust $k$-path on a directed acycylic graph, with increasing values of the length $k$ reflecting increasing deviations. We propose a graph homology with robust $k$-paths as the bases of its chain spaces. In this framework, the topological simplicity of series-parallel graphs translates into a triviality of higher-order chain spaces. We discuss a correspondence between the space of order-three chains and sites within the network that are susceptible to the Braess paradox, a well-known phenomenon in transportation networks. In this manner, we illustrate the utility of the proposed graph homology in sytematically studying the complexity of flow networks.</description>

      <title>Measuring Robustness in Cyber-Physical Systems under Sensor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contributes a formal framework for quantitative analysis of bounded sensor attacks on cyber-physical systems, using the formalism of differential dynamic logic. Given a precondition and postcondition of a system, we formalize two quantitative safety notions, quantitative forward and backward safety, which respectively express (1) how strong the strongest postcondition of the system is with respect to the specified postcondition, and (2) how strong the specified precondition is with respect to the weakest precondition of the system needed to ensure the specified postcondition holds. We introduce two notions, forward and backward robustness, to characterize the robustness of a system against sensor attacks as the loss of safety. To reason about robustness, we introduce two simulation distances, forward and backward simulation distances, which are defined based on the behavioral distances between the original system and the system with compromised sensors. Forward and backward distances, respectively, characterize upper bounds of the degree of forward and backward safety loss caused by the sensor attacks. We verify the two simulation distances by expressing them as modalities, i.e., formulas of differential dynamic logic, and develop an ad-hoc proof system to reason with such formulas. We showcase our formal notions and reasoning techniques on two non-trivial case studies: an autonomous vehicle that needs to avoid collision and a water tank system.</description>

      <title>On constructive extractability of measurable selectors of set-valued maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the possibility of constructive extraction of measurable selector from set-valued maps which may commonly arise in viability theory, optimal control, discontinuous systems etc. For instance, existence of solutions to certain differential inclusions, often requires iterative extraction of measurable selectors. Next, optimal controls are in general non-unique which naturally leads to an optimal set-valued function. Finally, a viable control law can be seen, in general, as a selector. It is known that selector theorems are non-constructive and so selectors cannot always be extracted. In this work, we analyze under which particular conditions selectors are constructively extractable. An algorithm is derived from the theorem and applied in a computational study with a three-wheel robot model.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of direct and indirect data-driven predictive control approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several direct Data-Driven Predictive Control (DDPC) methods have been proposed, advocating the possibility of designing predictive controllers from historical input-output trajectories without the need to identify a model. In this work, we show that these approaches are equivalent to an indirect approach. Reformulating the direct methods in terms of estimated parameters and covariance matrices allows us to give new insights into how they work in comparison with, for example, Subspace Predictive Control (SPC). In particular, we show that for unconstrained problems the direct methods are equivalent to SPC with a reduced weight on the tracking cost. Via a numerical experiment, motivated by the reformulation, we also illustrate why the performance of direct DDPC methods with fixed regularization tends to degrade as the number of training samples increases.</description>

      <title>Frequency Domain Auto-tuning of Structured LPV Controllers for High-Precision Motion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion systems are a vital part of many industrial processes. However, meeting the increasingly stringent demands of these systems, especially concerning precision and throughput, requires novel control design methods that can go beyond the capabilities of traditional solutions. Traditional control methods often struggle with the complexity and position-dependent effects inherent in modern motion systems, leading to compromises in performance and a laborious task of controller design. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel structured feedback control auto-tuning approach for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) motion systems. By leveraging frequency response function (FRF) estimates and the linear-parameter-varying (LPV) control framework, the proposed approach automates the controller design, while providing local stability and performance guarantees. Key innovations include norm-based magnitude optimization of the sensitivity functions, an automated stability check through a novel extended factorized Nyquist criterion, a modular structured MIMO LPV controller parameterization, and a controller discretization approach which preserves the continuous-time (CT) controller parameterization. The proposed approach is validated through experiments using a state-of-the-art moving-magnet planar actuator prototype.</description>

      <title>BEACON: A Bayesian Evolutionary Approach for Counterexample Generation of Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rigorous safety verification of control systems in critical applications is essential, given their increasing complexity and integration into everyday life. Simulation-based falsification approaches play a pivotal role in the safety verification of control systems, particularly within critical applications. These methods systematically explore the operational space of systems to identify configurations that result in violations of safety specifications. However, the effectiveness of traditional simulation-based falsification is frequently limited by the high dimensionality of the search space and the substantial computational resources required for exhaustive exploration. This paper presents BEACON, a novel framework that enhances the falsification process through a combination of Bayesian optimization and covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy. By exploiting quantitative metrics to evaluate how closely a system adheres to safety specifications, BEACON advances the state-of-the-art in testing methodologies. It employs a model-based test point selection approach, designed to facilitate exploration across dynamically evolving search zones to efficiently uncover safety violations. Our findings demonstrate that BEACON not only locates a higher percentage of counterexamples compared to standalone BO but also achieves this with significantly fewer simulations than required by CMA-ES, highlighting its potential to optimize the verification process of control systems. This framework offers a promising direction for achieving thorough and resource-efficient safety evaluations, ensuring the reliability of control systems in critical applications.</description>

      <title>Fault Classification in Electrical Distribution Systems using Grassmann Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical fault classification is vital for ensuring the reliability and safety of power systems. Accurate and efficient fault classification methods are essential for timely and effective maintenance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for effective fault classification through Grassmann manifolds, which is a non-Euclidean space that captures the intrinsic structure of high-dimensional data and offers a robust framework for feature extraction. We use simulated data for electrical distribution systems with various types of electrical faults. The proposed method involves transforming the measurement fault data into Grassmann manifold space using techniques from differential geometry. This transformation aids in uncovering the underlying fault patterns and reducing the computational complexity of subsequent classification steps. To achieve fault classification, we employ a machine learning technique optimized for the Grassmann manifold. The support vector machine classifier is adapted to operate within the Grassmann manifold space, enabling effective discrimination between different fault classes. The results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed Grassmann manifold-based approach for electrical fault classification which showcases its ability to accurately differentiate between various fault types.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fault Detection and Categorization in Electrical Distribution Systems Using Hessian Locally Linear Embedding on Measurement Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faults on electrical power lines could severely compromise both the reliability and safety of power systems, leading to unstable power delivery and increased outage risks. They pose significant safety hazards, necessitating swift detection and mitigation to maintain electrical infrastructure integrity and ensure continuous power supply. Hence, accurate detection and categorization of electrical faults are pivotal for optimized power system maintenance and operation. In this work, we propose a novel approach for detecting and categorizing electrical faults using the Hessian locally linear embedding (HLLE) technique and subsequent clustering with t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM). First, we employ HLLE to transform high-dimensional (HD) electrical data into low-dimensional (LD) embedding coordinates. This technique effectively captures the inherent variations and patterns in the data, enabling robust feature extraction. Next, we perform the Mann-Whitney U test based on the feature space of the embedding coordinates for fault detection. This statistical approach allows us to detect electrical faults providing an efficient means of system monitoring and control. Furthermore, to enhance fault categorization, we employ t-SNE with GMM to cluster the detected faults into various categories. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive simulations on an electrical system integrated with solar farm. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits effective fault detection and clustering across a range of fault types with different variations of the same fault. Overall, this research presents an effective methodology for robust fault detection and categorization in electrical systems, contributing to the advancement of fault management practices and the prevention of system failures.</description>

      <title>Matrix Concentration Inequalities for Sensor Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of sensor selection for state estimation via Kalman filtering. We consider a linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical system subject to process and measurement noise, where the sensors we use to perform state estimation are randomly drawn according to a sampling with replacement policy. Since our selection of sensors is randomly chosen, the estimation error covariance of the Kalman filter is also a stochastic quantity. Fortunately, concentration inequalities (CIs) for the estimation error covariance allow us to gauge the estimation performance we intend to achieve when our sensors are randomly drawn with replacement. To obtain a non-trivial improvement on existing CIs for the estimation error covariance, we first present novel matrix CIs for a sum of independent and identically-distributed (i.i.d.) and positive semi-definite (p.s.d.) random matrices, whose support is finite. Next, we show that our guarantees generalize an existing matrix CI. Also, we show that our generalized guarantees require significantly fewer number of sampled sensors to be applicable. Lastly, we show through a numerical study that our guarantees significantly outperform existing ones in terms of their ability to bound (in the semi-definite sense) the steady-state estimation error covariance of the Kalman filter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of ensuring safety with a few shots of samples for partially unknown systems. We first characterize a fundamental limit when producing safe actions is not possible due to insufficient information or samples. Then, we develop a technique that can generate provably safe actions and recovery behaviors using a minimum number of samples. In the performance analysis, we also establish Nagumos theorem - like results with relaxed assumptions, which is potentially useful in other contexts. Finally, we discuss how the proposed method can be integrated into a policy gradient algorithm to assure safety and stability with a handful of samples without stabilizing initial policies or generative models to probe safe actions.</description>

      <title>Decentralized P2P Trading based on Blockchain for Retail Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces peer to peer (P2P) trading mechanisms based on decentralized Blockchain to facilitate retail electricity market for ever-increasing distributed energy resources (DERs). The Blockchain network supports fast and secure retail trading among DERs and facilitates a sustainable local P2P trading platform. In this decentralized Blockchain architecture no single entity or organization has control over the entire system rather all users collectively maintain control. The effectiveness of the proposed automated market design and optimization is simulated using different use case scenarios in an open source Blockchain Simulator and MATLAB. The results show the efficacy of the trading mechanism in achieving demand response through strategies such as peak load shaving, load shifting, and integration of DERs.</description>

      <title>Control Strategies for Recommendation Systems in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A closed-loop control model to analyze the impact of recommendation systems on opinion dynamics within social networks is introduced. The core contribution is the development and formalization of model-free and model-based approaches to recommendation system design, integrating the dynamics of social interactions within networks via an extension of the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model. Comparative analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies in maximizing user engagement and their potential for influencing opinion formation processes.</description>

      <title>Direct Shooting Method for Numerical Optimal Control: A Modified Transcription Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct shooting is an efficient method to solve numerical optimal control. It utilizes the Runge-Kutta scheme to discretize a continuous-time optimal control problem making the problem solvable by nonlinear programming solvers. However, conventional direct shooting raises a contradictory dynamics issue when using an augmented state to handle {high-order} systems. This paper fills the research gap by considering the direct shooting method for {high-order} systems. We derive the modified Euler and Runge-Kutta-4 methods to transcribe the system dynamics constraint directly. Additionally, we provide the global error upper bounds of our proposed methods. A set of benchmark optimal control problems shows that our methods provide more accurate solutions than existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Pursuit Winning Strategies for Reach-Avoid Games with Polygonal Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a multiplayer reach-avoid differential game in the presence of general polygonal obstacles that block the players' motions. The pursuers cooperate to protect a convex region from the evaders who try to reach the region. We propose a multiplayer onsite and close-to-goal (MOCG) pursuit strategy that can tell and achieve an increasing lower bound on the number of guaranteed defeated evaders. This pursuit strategy fuses the subgame outcomes for multiple pursuers against one evader with hierarchical optimal task allocation in the receding-horizon manner. To determine the qualitative subgame outcomes that who is the game winner, we construct three pursuit winning regions and strategies under which the pursuers guarantee to win against the evader, regardless of the unknown evader strategy. First, we utilize the expanded Apollonius circles and propose the onsite pursuit winning that achieves the capture in finite time. Second, we introduce convex goal-covering polygons (GCPs) and propose the close-to-goal pursuit winning for the pursuers whose visibility region contains the whole protected region, and the goal-visible property will be preserved afterwards. Third, we employ Euclidean shortest paths (ESPs) and construct a pursuit winning region and strategy for the non-goal-visible pursuers, where the pursuers are firstly steered to positions with goal visibility along ESPs. In each horizon, the hierarchical optimal task allocation maximizes the number of defeated evaders and consists of four sequential matchings: capture, enhanced, non-dominated and closest matchings. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>A Tunable Universal Formula for Safety-Critical Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sontag's universal formula is a widely-used technique for stabilizing control through control Lyapunov functions, and it has been extended to address safety-critical control in recent years by incorporating control barrier functions (CBFs). However, how to derive a universal formula that satisfies requirements on essential properties, including safety, robustness, and smoothness, is still an open problem. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel solution - a tunable universal formula - incorporating a (state-dependent) tunable scaling term into Sontag's universal formula. This tunable scaling term enables the regulation of safety control performances, allowing the attainment of desired properties through a proper selection. Furthermore, we extend this tunable universal formula to address safety-critical control problems with norm-bounded input constraints, showcasing its applicability across diverse control scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method through a collision avoidance example, investigating the essential properties including safety, robustness, and smoothness under various tunable scaling terms.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Resilience from Robustness: Contextual Dualism, Interactionism, and Game-Theoretic Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explains the distinctions between robustness and resilience in control systems. Resilience confronts a distinct set of challenges, posing new ones for designing controllers for feedback systems, networks, and machines that prioritize resilience over robustness. The concept of resilience is explored through a three-stage model, emphasizing the need for a proactive preparation and automated response to elastic events. A toy model is first used to illustrate the tradeoffs between resilience and robustness. Then, it delves into contextual dualism and interactionism, and introduces game-theoretic paradigms as a unifying framework to consolidate resilience and robustness. The article concludes by discussing the interplay between robustness and resilience, suggesting that a comprehensive theory of resilience and quantification metrics, and formalization through game-theoretic frameworks are necessary. The exploration extends to system-of-systems resilience and various mechanisms, including the integration of AI techniques and non-technical solutions, like cyber insurance, to achieve comprehensive resilience in control systems. As we approach 2030, the systems and control community is at the opportune moment to lay scientific foundations of resilience by bridging feedback control theory, game theory, and learning theory. Resilient control systems will enhance overall quality of life, enable the development of a resilient society, and create a societal-scale impact amid global challenges such as climate change, conflicts, and cyber insecurity.</description>

      <title>Multi-gated perimeter flow control for monocentric cities: Efficiency and equity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A control scheme for the multi-gated perimeter traffic flow control problem of cities is presented. The proposed scheme determines feasible and optimally distributed input flows for the various gates located at the periphery of a protected network. A parsimonious model is employed to describe the traffic dynamics of the protected network. To describe traffic dynamics outside of the protected area, the state-space model is augmented with additional state variables to account for vehicle queues at store-and-forward origin links at the periphery. The perimeter flow control problem is formulated as a convex optimisation problem with finite horizon, and constrained control and state variables. It aims to equalise the relative queues at origin links and to maintain the vehicle accumulation in the protected network around a desired set point, while the system's throughput is maximised. For real-time control, the optimal control problem is embedded in a rolling-horizon scheme using the current state of the system as the initial state as well as predicted demand flows at entrance links. Furthermore, practical flow allocation policies for single-region perimeter control without explicitly considering entrance link dynamics are presented. These policies allocate a global perimeter-ordered flow to candidate gates at the periphery of a protected network by taking into account the different geometric characteristics of origin links. The proposed flow allocation policies are then benchmarked against the multi-gated perimeter flow control. A study is carried out for a 2.5 square mile protected network area of San Francisco, CA, including fifteen gates of different geometric characteristics. The results have showed that the proposed scheme is able to manage excessive queues outside of the protected network and to optimally distribute the input flows, which confirms its efficiency and equity properties.</description>

      <title>A prediction-based forward-looking vehicle dispatching strategy for dynamic ride-pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For on-demand dynamic ride-pooling services, e.g., Uber Pool and Didi Pinche, a well-designed vehicle dispatching strategy is crucial for platform profitability and passenger experience. Most existing dispatching strategies overlook incoming pairing opportunities, therefore suffer from short-sighted limitations. In this paper, we propose a forward-looking vehicle dispatching strategy, which first predicts the expected distance saving that could be brought about by future orders and then solves a bipartite matching problem based on the prediction to match passengers with partially occupied or vacant vehicles or keep passengers waiting for next rounds of matching. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed strategy, a number of simulation experiments and comparisons are conducted based on the real-world road network and historical trip data from Haikou, China. Results show that the proposed strategy outperform the baseline strategies by generating approximately 31\% more distance saving and 18\% less average passenger detour distance. It indicates the significant benefits of considering future pairing opportunities in dispatching, and highlights the effectiveness of our innovative forward-looking vehicle dispatching strategy in improving system efficiency and user experience for dynamic ride-pooling services.</description>

      <title>Ride-pooling Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand: Joint Optimization of Operations and Fleet and Infrastructure Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a modeling and design optimization framework for an Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand system that allows for ride-pooling, i.e., multiple users can be transported at the same time towards a similar direction to decrease vehicle hours traveled by the fleet at the cost of additional waiting time and delays caused by detours. In particular, we first devise a multi-layer time-invariant network flow model that jointly captures the position and state of charge of the vehicles. Second, we frame the time-optimal operational problem of the fleet, including charging and ride-pooling decisions as a mixed-integer linear program, whereby we jointly optimize the placement of the charging infrastructure. Finally, we perform a case-study using Manhattan taxi-data. Our results indicate that jointly optimizing the charging infrastructure placement allows to decrease overall energy consumption of the fleet and vehicle hours traveled by approximately 1% compared to an heuristic placement. Most significantly, ride-pooling can decrease such costs considerably more, and up to 45%. Finally, we investigate the impact of the vehicle choice on the energy consumption of the fleet, comparing a lightweight two-seater with a heavier four-seater, whereby our results show that the former and latter designs are most convenient for low- and high-demand areas, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for identifying and quantifying the flexibility of electricity demand in a production plant is reported. The plant is equipped with electric machines, product storage silos, distributed generation, and electrical storage systems. The method aims to minimize production costs. To achieve this, the plant is mathematically modeled, and an economic optimization problem is formulated by managing these plant equipment. From this optimal schedule (base schedule), the feasibility of modifying it to sell or buy energy in the electricity balancing regulation markets is evaluated, thus obtaining the so called flexibility schedule. Finally, this method was successfully applied to a real case using data from a Spanish cement production plant.</description>

      <title>Edge Information Hub: Orchestrating Satellites, UAVs, MEC, Sensing and Communications for 6G Closed-Loop Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of field robots would be used for mission-critical tasks in remote or post-disaster areas. Due to usually-limited individual abilities, these robots require an edge information hub (EIH), which is capable of not only communications but also sensing and computing. Such EIH could be deployed on a flexibly-dispatched unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Different from traditional aerial base stations or mobile edge computing (MEC), the EIH would direct the operations of robots via sensing-communication-computing-control ($\textbf{SC}^3$) closed-loop orchestration. This paper aims to optimize the closed-loop control performance of multiple $\textbf{SC}^3$ loops, under the constraints of satellite-backhaul rate, computing capability, and on-board energy. Specifically, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control cost is used to measure the closed-loop utility, and a sum LQR cost minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the splitting of sensor data and allocation of communication and computing resources. We first derive the optimal splitting ratio of sensor data, and then recast the problem to a more tractable form. An iterative algorithm is finally proposed to provide a sub-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. We also uncover the influence of $\textbf{SC}^3$ parameters on closed-loop controls, highlighting more systematic understanding.</description>

      <title>AC/DC optimal power flow and techno-economic assessment for hybrid microgrids: TIGON CEDER demonstrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent years, the interest in electric direct current (DC) technologies (such as converters, batteries, electric vehicles, etc.) is increasing due to its potential on energy efficiency and sustainability. However, the vast majority of electric systems and networks are based on alternating current (AC), as they also have certain advantages regarding cost-effective transport and robustness. In this paper, an AC/DC optimal power flow method for hybrid microgrids and several key performance indicators (KPIs) for its techno-economic assessment are presented. The combination of both calculations allows users to clearly determine the viability of their hybrid microgrids. AC/DC networks have been modelled considering their most common elements. For the power flow method, a polynomial optimisation is formulated considering four different objective functions: the minimisation of energy losses, voltage deviation and operational costs, and also the maximisation of the microgrid generation. The power flow method and the techno-economic analysis have been implemented in Python and validated in the Centro de Desarrollo de Energ\'ias Renovables (CEDER) demonstrator for TIGON. The results show that the calculated power flow variables and the ones measured at CEDER are practically the same. In addition, the KPIs have been obtained and compared for four operating scenarios: baseline, no battery, battery flexibility and virtual battery (VB) flexibility. The last one result in the most profitable option.</description>

      <title>Aggregated distribution grid flexibilities in subtransmission grid operational management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregated flexibilities or PQ-capabilities (active and reactive power capabilities) are termed in literature as Feasible Operating Regions (FORs). The FORs from underlying active distribution grids can effectively contribute to the operational management at the HV grid level. The HV buses are allocated aggregated FORs from the underlying MV grids, which are inherently nonlinear and non-convex. Therefore, two approaches are proposed in the paper to apply the FOR constraints in the HV grid operational management. First, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based optimization approach for alleviating the HV grid constraint violations is proposed, which addresses the non-convexity of the FOR using piecewise segmentation. Furthermore, the MILP method is enhanced to consider the influence of the HV bus voltage on the underlying MV grid flexibilities resulting in a three dimensional PQ(V)-FOR. Second, a convexification approach is proposed, which uses a convex approximation of the non-convex 3D PQ(V)-FOR shape for implementation in a linear optimization method. Results reveal a robust utilization of the distribution flexibilities to maintain grid security and reliability at the HV grid level. Comparisons present increased computation times for the MILP method which are significantly improved using the convexification based approach.</description>

      <title>Robust and fast backbone tracking via phase-locked loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-locked loops are commonly used for shaker-based backbone tracking of nonlinear structures. The state of the art is to tune the control parameters by trial and error. In the present work, an approach is proposed to make backbone tracking much more robust and faster. A simple PI controller is proposed, and closed-form expressions for the gains are provided that lead to an optimal settling of the phase transient. The required input parameters are obtained from a conventional shaker-based linear modal test, and an open-loop sine test at a single frequency and level. For phase detection, an adaptive filter based on the LMS algorithm is used, which is shown to be superior to the synchronous demodulation commonly used. Once the phase has locked, one can directly take the next step along the backbone, eliminating the hold times. The latter are currently used for recording the steady state, and to estimate Fourier coefficients in the post-process, which becomes unnecessary since the adaptive filter yields a highly accurate estimation at runtime. The excellent performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated for a doubly clamped beam undergoing bending-stretching coupling leading to a 20 percent shift of the lowest modal frequency. Even for fixed control parameters, designed for the linear regime, only about 100 periods are needed per backbone point, also in the nonlinear regime. This is much faster than what has been reported in the literature so far. In fact, the nonlinear backbone test becomes faster than the linear modal test, shifting the established paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the design of a new class of passive iFIR controllers given by the parallel action of an integrator and a finite impulse response filter. iFIRs are more expressive than PID controllers but retain their features and simplicity. The paper provides a model-free data-driven design for passive iFIR controllers based on virtual reference feedback tuning. Passivity is enforced through constrained optimization (three different formulations are discussed). The proposed design does not rely on large datasets or accurate plant models.</description>

Abstract: Developers have to obtain a sound understanding of existing risk potentials already in the concept phase of driverless vehicles. Deductive as well as inductive SOTIF analyses of potential triggering conditions for hazardous behavior help to achieve this goal. In this regard, ISO 21448 suggests conducting a System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). In this article, we introduce German terminology for SOTIF considerations and critically discuss STPA theory in the course of an example application, while also proposing methodological additions. -- --

      <title>Efficient dual-scale generalized Radon-Fourier transform detector family for long time coherent integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long Time Coherent Integration (LTCI) aims to accumulate target energy through long time integration, which is an effective method for the detection of a weak target. However, for a moving target, defocusing can occur due to range migration (RM) and Doppler frequency migration (DFM). To address this issue, RM and DFM corrections are required in order to achieve a well-focused image for the subsequent detection. Since RM and DFM are induced by the same motion parameters, existing approaches such as the generalized Radon-Fourier transform (GRFT) or the keystone transform (KT)-matching filter process (MFP) adopt the same search space for the motion parameters in order to eliminate both effects, thus leading to large redundancy in computation. To this end, this paper first proposes a dual-scale decomposition of the target motion parameters, consisting of well designed coarse and fine motion parameters. Then, utilizing this decomposition, the joint correction of the RM and DFM effects is decoupled into a cascade procedure, first RM correction on the coarse search space and then DFM correction on the fine search spaces. As such, step size of the search space can be tailored to RM and DFM corrections, respectively, thus avoiding large redundant computation effectively. The resulting algorithms are called dual-scale GRFT (DS-GRFT) or dual-scale GRFT (DS-KTMFP) which provide comparable performance while achieving significant improvement in computational efficiency compared to standard GRFT (KT-MFP). Simulation experiments verify their effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control Strategies for Electric Endurance Race Cars Accounting for Competitors Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents model predictive control strategies for battery electric endurance race cars accounting for interactions with the competitors. In particular, we devise an optimization framework capturing the impact of the actions of the ego vehicle when interacting with competitors in a probabilistic fashion, jointly accounting for the optimal pit stop decision making, the charge times and the driving style in the course of the race. We showcase our method for a simulated 1h endurance race at the Zandvoort circuit, using real-life data of internal combustion engine race cars from a previous event. Our results show that optimizing both the race strategy as well as the decision making during the race is very important, resulting in a significant 21s advantage over an always overtake approach, whilst revealing the competitiveness of e-race cars w.r.t. conventional ones.</description>

      <title>Grid Monitoring and Protection with Continuous Point-on-Wave Measurements and Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose This article presents a case for a next-generation grid monitoring and control system, leveraging recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and statistical inference. Advancing beyond earlier generations of wide-area monitoring systems built upon supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and synchrophasor technologies, we argue for a monitoring and control framework based on the streaming of continuous point-on-wave (CPOW) measurements with AI-powered data compression and fault detection.
  Methods and Results: The architecture of the proposed design originates from the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of a random process that transforms causally a stationary random process into an innovation sequence with independent and identically distributed random variables. This work presents a generative AI approach that (i) learns an innovation autoencoder that extracts innovation sequence from CPOW time series, (ii) compresses the CPOW streaming data with innovation autoencoder and subband coding, and (iii) detects unknown faults and novel trends via nonparametric sequential hypothesis testing.
  Conclusion: This work argues that conventional monitoring using SCADA and phasor measurement unit (PMU) technologies is ill-suited for a future grid with deep penetration of inverter-based renewable generations and distributed energy resources. A monitoring system based on CPOW data streaming and AI data analytics should be the basic building blocks for situational awareness of a highly dynamic future grid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we address the problem of improving the feasible domain of the solution of a decentralized control framework for coordinating connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at signal-free intersections as the traffic volume increases. The framework provides the optimal trajectories of CAVs to cross the intersection safely without stop-and-go driving. However, as the traffic volume increases, the domain of the feasible trajectories decreases. We use concepts of numerical interpolation to identify appropriate polynomials that can serve as alternative trajectories of the CAVs, expanding the domain of the feasible CAV trajectories. We provide the conditions under which such polynomials exist. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Providing Safety Assurances for Systems with Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As autonomous systems become more complex and integral in our society, the need to accurately model and safely control these systems has increased significantly. In the past decade, there has been tremendous success in using deep learning techniques to model and control systems that are difficult to model using first principles. However, providing safety assurances for such systems remains difficult, partially due to the uncertainty in the learned model. In this work, we aim to provide safety assurances for systems whose dynamics are not readily derived from first principles and, hence, are more advantageous to be learned using deep learning techniques. Given the system of interest and safety constraints, we learn an ensemble model of the system dynamics from data. Leveraging ensemble uncertainty as a measure of uncertainty in the learned dynamics model, we compute a maximal robust control invariant set, starting from which the system is guaranteed to satisfy the safety constraints under the condition that realized model uncertainties are contained in the predefined set of admissible model uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a simulated case study with an inverted pendulum and a hardware experiment with a TurtleBot. The experiments show that our method robustifies the control actions of the system against model uncertainty and generates safe behaviors without being overly restrictive. The codes and accompanying videos can be found on the project website.</description>

      <title>Towards Multiphase Clocking in Single-Flux Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid single-flux quantum (RSFQ) is one of the most advanced superconductive electronics technologies. SFQ systems operate at tens of gigahertz with up to three orders of magnitude smaller power as compared to CMOS. In conventional SFQ systems, most gates require clock signal. Each gate should have the fanins with equal logic depth, necessitating insertion of path-balancing (PB) DFFs, incurring prohibitive area penalty. Multiphase clocking is the effective method for reducing the path-balancing overhead at the cost of reduced throughput. However, existing tools are not directly applicable for technology mapping of multiphase systems. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we propose a technology mapping tool for multiphase systems. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate a phase assignment as a Constraint Programming with Satisfiability (CP-SAT) problem, to determine the phase of each element within the network. Second, we formulate the path balancing problem as a CP-SAT to optimize the number of DFFs within an asynchronous datapath. Finally, we integrate these methods into a technology mapping flow to convert a logic network into a multiphase SFQ circuit. In our case studies, by using seven phases, the size of the circuit (expressed as the number of Josephson junctions) is reduced, on average, by 59.94 % as compared to the dual (fast-slow) clocking method, while outperforming the state-of-the-art single-phase SFQ mapping tools.</description>

      <title>Online Identification of Stochastic Continuous-Time Wiener Models Using Sampled Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that ignoring the presence of stochastic disturbances in the identification of stochastic Wiener models leads to asymptotically biased estimators. On the other hand, optimal statistical identification, via likelihood-based methods, is sensitive to the assumptions on the data distribution and is usually based on relatively complex sequential Monte Carlo algorithms. We develop a simple recursive online estimation algorithm based on an output-error predictor, for the identification of continuous-time stochastic parametric Wiener models through stochastic approximation. The method is applicable to generic model parameterizations and, as demonstrated in the numerical simulation examples, it is robust with respect to the assumptions on the spectrum of the disturbance process.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of T1-cells in SFQ Arithmetic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid single-flux quantum (RSFQ), a leading cryogenic superconductive electronics (SCE) technology, offers extremely low power dissipation and high speed. However, implementing RSFQ systems at VLSI complexity faces challenges, such as substantial area overhead from gate-level pipelining and path balancing, exacerbated by RSFQ's limited layout density. T1 flip-flop (T1-FF) is an RSFQ logic cell operating as a pulse counter. Using T1-FF the full adder function can be realized with only 40% of the area required by the conventional realization. This cell however imposes complex constraints on input signal timing, complicating its use. Multiphase clocking has been recently proposed to alleviate gate-level pipelining overhead. The fanin signals can be efficiently controlled using multiphase clocking. We present the novel two-stage SFQ technology mapping methodology supporting the T1-FF. Compatible parts of the SFQ network are first replaced by the efficient T1-FFs. Multiphase retiming is next applied to assign clock phases to each logic gate and insert DFFs to satisfy the input timing. Using our flow, the area of the SFQ networks is reduced, on average, by 6% with up to 25% reduction in optimizing the 128-bit adder.</description>

      <title>Robust Predictive Motion Planning by Learning Obstacle Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe motion planning for robotic systems in dynamic environments is nontrivial in the presence of uncertain obstacles, where estimation of obstacle uncertainties is crucial in predicting future motions of dynamic obstacles. The worst-case characterization gives a conservative uncertainty prediction and may result in infeasible motion planning for the ego robotic system. In this paper, an efficient, robust, and safe motion-planing algorithm is developed by learning the obstacle uncertainties online. More specifically, the unknown yet intended control set of obstacles is efficiently computed by solving a linear programming problem. The learned control set is used to compute forward reachable sets of obstacles that are less conservative than the worst-case prediction. Based on the forward prediction, a robust model predictive controller is designed to compute a safe reference trajectory for the ego robotic system that remains outside the reachable sets of obstacles over the prediction horizon. The method is applied to a car-like mobile robot in both simulations and hardware experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe Multi-agent reinforcement learning (safe MARL) has increasingly gained attention in recent years, emphasizing the need for agents to not only optimize the global return but also adhere to safety requirements through behavioral constraints. Some recent work has integrated control theory with multi-agent reinforcement learning to address the challenge of ensuring safety. However, there have been only very limited applications of Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods in this domain, primarily due to the complex and implicit dynamics characteristic of multi-agent environments. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method called Deep Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DeepSafeMPC). The key insight of DeepSafeMPC is leveraging a entralized deep learning model to well predict environmental dynamics. Our method applies MARL principles to search for optimal solutions. Through the employment of MPC, the actions of agents can be restricted within safe states concurrently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using the Safe Multi-agent MuJoCo environment, showcasing significant advancements in addressing safety concerns in MARL.</description>

      <title>A SysML Profile for the Standardized Description of Processes during System Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key aspect in creating models of production systems with the use of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) lies in the description of system functions. These functions shouldbe described in a clear and standardized manner.The VDI/VDE 3682 standard for Formalised Process De-scription (FPD) provides a simple and easily understandable representation of processes. These processes can be conceptualized as functions within the system model, making the FPD particularly well-suited for the standardized representation ofthe required functions. Hence, this contribution focuses on thedevelopment of a Domain-Specific Modeling Language(DSML) that facilitates the integration of VDI/VDE 3682 into the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The presented approach not onlyextends classical SysML with domain-specific requirements but also facilitates model verification through constraints modeled in Object Constraint Language (OCL). Additionally, it enables automatic serialization of process descriptions into the Extensible Markup Language (XML) using the Velocity Template Language (VTL). This serialization enables the use of process modeling in applications outside of MBSE. The approach was validated using an collar screwing use case in the major component assembly in aircraft production.</description>

Abstract: Trajectory tracking for an Omni-drive robot presents a challenging task that demands an efficient controller design. To address the limitations of manual tuning, we introduce a self-optimizing controller named fuzzyPID, leveraging the analysis of responses from various dynamic and static systems. The rule-based controller design is implemented using Matlab/Simulink, and trajectory tracking simulations are conducted within the CoppeliaSim environment. Similarly, a non-linear model predictive controller(NMPC) is proposed to compare tracking performance with fuzzyPID. We also assess the impact of tunable parameters of NMPC on its tracking accuracy. Simulation results validate the precision and effectiveness of NMPC over fuzzyPID controller while trading computational complexity.</description>

      <title>On the Global Convergence of Policy Gradient in Average Reward Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first finite time global convergence analysis of policy gradient in the context of infinite horizon average reward Markov decision processes (MDPs). Specifically, we focus on ergodic tabular MDPs with finite state and action spaces. Our analysis shows that the policy gradient iterates converge to the optimal policy at a sublinear rate of $O\left({\frac{1}{T}}\right),$ which translates to $O\left({\log(T)}\right)$ regret, where $T$ represents the number of iterations. Prior work on performance bounds for discounted reward MDPs cannot be extended to average reward MDPs because the bounds grow proportional to the fifth power of the effective horizon. Thus, our primary contribution is in proving that the policy gradient algorithm converges for average-reward MDPs and in obtaining finite-time performance guarantees. In contrast to the existing discounted reward performance bounds, our performance bounds have an explicit dependence on constants that capture the complexity of the underlying MDP. Motivated by this observation, we reexamine and improve the existing performance bounds for discounted reward MDPs. We also present simulations to empirically evaluate the performance of average reward policy gradient algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Over-the-air aggregation has attracted widespread attention for its potential advantages in task-oriented applications, such as distributed sensing, learning, and consensus. In this paper, we develop a communication-efficient distributed average consensus protocol by utilizing over-the-air aggregation, which exploits the superposition property of wireless channels rather than combat it. Noisy channels and non-coherent transmission are taken into account, and only half-duplex transceivers are required. We prove that the system can achieve average consensus in mean square and even almost surely under the proposed protocol. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the scenarios with time-varying topology. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bilevel Optimization for Generating Maximally Representative OPF Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New generations of power systems, containing high shares of renewable energy resources, require improved data-driven tools which can swiftly adapt to changes in system operation. Many of these tools, such as ones using machine learning, rely on high-quality training datasets to construct probabilistic models. Such models should be able to accurately represent the system when operating at its limits (i.e., operating with a high degree of ``active constraints"). However, generating training datasets that accurately represent the many possible combinations of these active constraints is a particularly challenging task, especially within the realm of nonlinear AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF), since most active constraints cannot be enforced explicitly. Using bilevel optimization, this paper introduces a data collection routine that sequentially solves for OPF solutions which are ``optimally far" from previously acquired voltage, power, and load profile data points. The routine, termed RAMBO, samples critical data close to a system's boundaries much more effectively than a random sampling benchmark. Simulated test results are collected on the 30-, 57-, and 118-bus PGLib test cases.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the design of hybrid feedback for a class of affine nonlinear systems with topological constraints that prevent global asymptotic stability. A new hybrid control strategy is introduced, which differs conceptually from the commonly used synergistic hybrid approaches. The key idea involves the construction of a generalized synergistic Lyapunov function whose switching variable can either remain constant or dynamically change between jumps. Based on this new hybrid mechanism, a generalized synergistic hybrid feedback control scheme, endowed with global asymptotic stability guarantees, is proposed. This hybrid control scheme is then improved through a smoothing mechanism that eliminates discontinuities in the feedback term. Moreover, the smooth hybrid feedback is further extended to a larger class of systems through the integrator backstepping approach. The proposed hybrid feedback schemes are applied to solve the global obstacle avoidance problem using a new concept of synergistic navigation functions. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed hybrid controllers.</description>

Abstract: We consider the online control problem with an unknown linear dynamical system in the presence of adversarial perturbations and adversarial convex loss functions. Although the problem is widely studied in model-based control, it remains unclear whether data-driven approaches, which bypass the system identification step, can solve the problem. In this work, we present a novel data-driven online adaptive control algorithm to address this online control problem. Our algorithm leverages the behavioral systems theory to learn a non-parametric system representation and then adopts a perturbation-based controller updated by online gradient descent. We prove that our algorithm guarantees an $\tmO(T^{2/3})$ regret bound with high probability, which matches the best-known regret bound for this problem. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm and performance guarantee to the cases with output feedback.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis for large-scale multi-agent molecular communication systems</title>

Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is recently featured as a novel communication tool to connect individual biological nanorobots. It is expected that a large number of nanorobots can form large multi-agent MC systems through MC to accomplish complex and large-scale tasks that cannot be achieved by a single nanorobot. However, most previous models for MC systems assume a unidirectional diffusion communication channel and cannot capture the feedback between each nanorobot, which is important for multi-agent MC systems. In this paper, we introduce a system theoretic model for large-scale multi-agent MC systems using transfer functions, and then propose a method to analyze the stability for multi-agent MC systems. The proposed method decomposes the multi-agent MC system into multiple single-input and single-output (SISO) systems, which facilitates the application of simple analysis technique for SISO systems to the large-scale multi-agent MC system. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed method by analyzing the stability of a specific large-scale multi-agent MC system and clarify a parameter region to synchronize the states of nanorobots, which is important to make cooperative behaviors at a population level.</description>

      <title>Robust Conformal Prediction for STL Runtime Verification under Distribution Shift</title>

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) designed in simulators behave differently in the real-world. Once they are deployed in the real-world, we would hence like to predict system failures during runtime. We propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks for general stochastic CPS. The RPRV problem faces several challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data of the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models are based on a distribution over system trajectories encountered during the design phase, i.e., there may be a distribution shift during deployment. To address these challenges, we assume to know an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the distributions at deployment and design time, and we utilize techniques based on robust conformal prediction. Motivated by our results in [1], we construct an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm. We use a trajectory prediction model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. We precisely quantify the relationship between calibration data, desired confidence, and permissible distribution shift. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms under distribution shift in this setting. We empirically validate our algorithms on a Franka manipulator within the NVIDIA Isaac sim environment.</description>

      <title>Control of complex systems with generalized embedding and empirical dynamic modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback control is ubiquitous in complex systems. Effective control requires knowledge of the dynamics informing feedback compensation to guide the system toward desired states. In many control applications this knowledge is expressed mathematically or through data-driven models, however, as complexity grows obtaining a satisfactory mathematical representation is increasingly difficult. Further, many data-driven approaches consist of abstract internal representations that may have no obvious connection to the underlying dynamics and control, or, require extensive model design and training. Here, we remove these constraints. We demonstrate that generalized state space embedding and prediction of model dynamics within the state space provide a data-driven process model for control of complex systems and a new paradigm of model predictive control. Generalized embedding naturally encompasses multivariate dynamics and representation of multivariate interactions. Specifically, state space kernel regression of the dynamics allows inspection of intervariable dependencies. We demonstrate this with state space variable cross mapping directly quantifying multivariate contributions to the dynamics. Since generalized embedding provides a data-driven model of dynamics entirely in state space, no model design or training are required. Generalized embedding and model predictive control is demonstrated on nonlinear dynamics generated by an agent based model of 1200 interacting agents. The proposed method provides an alternative model of the process dynamics with no constraints on the the controller and is therefore generally applicable to any type of controller. The method should be applicable to any dynamic system representable in a state space.</description>

      <title>Tuning of Online Feedback Optimization for setpoint tracking in centrifugal compressors</title>

Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controllers steer a system to its optimal operating point by treating optimization algorithms as auxiliary dynamic systems. Implementation of OFO controllers requires setting the parameters of the optimization algorithm that allows reaching convergence, posing a challenge because the convergence of the optimization algorithm is often decoupled from the performance of the controlled system. OFO controllers are also typically designed to ensure steady-state tracking by fixing the sampling time to be longer than the time constants of the system. In this paper, we first quantify the impact of OFO parameters and the sampling time on the tracking error and number of oscillations of the controlled system, showing that adjusting them without waiting for steady state allows good tracking. We then propose a tuning method for the sampling time of the OFO controller together with the parameters to allow tracking fast trajectories while reducing oscillations. We validate the proposed tuning approach in a pressure controller in a centrifugal compressor, tracking trajectories faster than the time needed to reach the steady state by the compressor. The results of the validation confirm that simultaneous tuning of the sampling time and the parameters of OFO yields up to 87% times better tracking performance than manual tuning based on steady state.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Design Methodology for Control, Simulation, and Monitoring of Fluidic Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a synthesis method for the design of digital twins applicable to various systems (pneumatic, hydraulic, electrical/electronic circuits). The methodology allows representing the operation of these systems through an active digital twin, thereby enabling a more suitable and easier computer-aided design, simulation, control, and monitoring. Furthermore, our methodology enables the detection of a system's actions on its own inputs (for example, in pneumatics: backflow of gases trapped in part of a fluidic system onto its own inputs). During the simulation or monitoring phase, the approach also facilitates real-time diagnosis of the controlled system. The outputs, on the controlled physical system or its digital twin, do not depend only on the current inputs but also on the history of the inputs and the history of internal states and variables. In other words, the underlying sequential logic has a memory while an only combinational logic approach does not. These capabilities can contribute to the digital transformation of the factory of the future.</description>

      <title>Age of Computing: A Metric of Computation Freshness in Communication and Computation Cooperative Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In communication and computation cooperative networks (3CNs), timely computation is crucial but not always guaranteed. There is a strong demand for a computational task to be completed within a given time. The time taken involves both processing time and communication time. However, a measure of such timeliness in 3CNs is lacking. In this letter, we introduce the novel concept, Age of Computing (AoC), to capture computation freshness in 3CNs. We develop two methods for calculating this metric, applicable to a wide range of 3CNs. These calculations are applied to a queue-theoretic system comprising a task-initiating source, a task-executing computational node and a communication link, resulting in the derivation of two expressions for the AoC. Then a tight upper bound and a tight lower bound are derived. Subsequently, we investigate the communication-computation tradeoff and the AoC-delay tradeoff. While our models are simpler than their real-world counterparts, they provide comprehensive insight in understanding computation freshness in 3CNs and the relationships between computing and communications.</description>

      <title>Exploiting polar symmetry in designing equivariant observers for vision-based motion estimation</title>

Abstract: Accurately estimating camera motion from image sequences poses a significant challenge in computer vision and robotics. Many computer vision methods first compute the essential matrix associated with a motion and then extract orientation and normalized translation as inputs to pose estimation, reconstructing the scene scale (that is unobservable in the epipolar construction) from separate information. In this paper, we design a continuous-time filter that exploits the same perspective by using the epipolar constraint to define pseudo-measurements. We propose a novel polar symmetry on the pose of the camera that makes these measurements equivariant. This allows us to apply recent results from equivariant systems theory to estimating pose. We provide a novel explicit persistence of excitation condition to characterize observability of the full pose, ensuring reconstruction of the scale parameter that is not directly observable in the epipolar construction.</description>

      <title>Visual CPG-RL: Learning Central Pattern Generators for Visually-Guided Quadruped Locomotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for learning visually-guided quadruped locomotion by integrating exteroceptive sensing and central pattern generators (CPGs), i.e. systems of coupled oscillators, into the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Through both exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensing, the agent learns to coordinate rhythmic behavior among different oscillators to track velocity commands, while at the same time override these commands to avoid collisions with the environment. We investigate several open robotics and neuroscience questions: 1) What is the role of explicit interoscillator couplings between oscillators, and can such coupling improve sim-to-real transfer for navigation robustness? 2) What are the effects of using a memory-enabled vs. a memory-free policy network with respect to robustness, energy-efficiency, and tracking performance in sim-to-real navigation tasks? 3) How do animals manage to tolerate high sensorimotor delays, yet still produce smooth and robust gaits? To answer these questions, we train our perceptive locomotion policies in simulation and perform sim-to-real transfers to the Unitree Go1 quadruped, where we observe robust navigation in a variety of scenarios. Our results show that the CPG, explicit interoscillator couplings, and memory-enabled policy representations are all beneficial for energy efficiency, robustness to noise and sensory delays of 90 ms, and tracking performance for successful sim-to-real transfer for navigation tasks.

      <description>arXiv:2301.06136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to the quantitative verification of probabilistic programs and stochastic dynamical models. Our approach leverages neural networks to compute tight and sound bounds for the probability that a stochastic process hits a target condition within finite time. This problem subsumes a variety of quantitative verification questions, from the reachability and safety analysis of discrete-time stochastic dynamical models, to the study of assertion-violation and termination analysis of probabilistic programs. We rely on neural networks to represent supermartingale certificates that yield such probability bounds, which we compute using a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis loop: we train the neural certificate while tightening the probability bound over samples of the state space using stochastic optimisation, and then we formally check the certificate's validity over every possible state using satisfiability modulo theories; if we receive a counterexample, we add it to our set of samples and repeat the loop until validity is confirmed. We demonstrate on a diverse set of benchmarks that, thanks to the expressive power of neural networks, our method yields smaller or comparable probability bounds than existing symbolic methods in all cases, and that our approach succeeds on models that are entirely beyond the reach of such alternative techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider online reinforcement learning in episodic Markov decision process (MDP) with unknown transition function and stochastic rewards drawn from some fixed but unknown distribution. The learner aims to learn the optimal policy and minimize their regret over a finite time horizon through interacting with the environment. We devise a simple and efficient model-based algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{O}(LX\sqrt{TA})$ regret with high probability, where $L$ is the episode length, $T$ is the number of episodes, and $X$ and $A$ are the cardinalities of the state space and the action space, respectively. The proposed algorithm, which is based on the concept of ``optimism in the face of uncertainty", maintains confidence sets of transition and reward functions and uses occupancy measures to connect the online MDP with linear programming. It achieves a tighter regret bound compared to the existing works that use a similar confidence set framework and improves computational effort compared to those that use a different framework but with a slightly tighter regret bound.</description>

      <title>A Mixing-Accelerated Primal-Dual Proximal Algorithm for Distributed Nonconvex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a distributed mixing-accelerated primal-dual proximal algorithm, referred to as MAP-Pro, which enables nodes in multi-agent networks to cooperatively minimize the sum of their nonconvex, smooth local cost functions in a decentralized fashion. The proposed algorithm is constructed upon minimizing a computationally inexpensive augmented-Lagrangian-like function and incorporating a time-varying mixing polynomial to expedite information fusion across the network. The convergence results derived for MAP-Pro include a sublinear rate of convergence to a stationary solution and, under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewics (P-{\L}) condition, a linear rate of convergence to the global optimal solution. Additionally, we may embed the well-noted Chebyshev acceleration scheme in MAP-Pro, which generates a specific sequence of mixing polynomials with given degrees and enhances the convergence performance based on MAP-Pro. Finally, we illustrate the competitive convergence speed and communication efficiency of MAP-Pro via a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12553v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new framework of Markov $\alpha$-potential games to study Markov games. In this new framework, Markov games are shown to be Markov $\alpha$-potential games, and the existence of an associated $\alpha$-potential function is established. Any optimizer of an $\alpha$-potential function is shown to be an $\alpha$-stationary NE. Two important classes of practically significant Markov games, Markov congestion games and the perturbed Markov team games, are studied via this framework of Markov $\alpha$-potential games, with explicit characterization of an upper bound for $\alpha$ and its relation to game parameters. Additionally, a semi-infinite linear programming based formulation is presented to obtain an upper bound for $\alpha$ for any Markov game. Furthermore, two equilibrium approximation algorithms, namely the projected gradient-ascent algorithm and the sequential maximum improvement algorithm, are presented along with their Nash regret analysis, and corroborated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations of Carbon-Aware Temporal and Spatial Workload Shifting in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cloud platforms have been focusing on reducing their carbon emissions by shifting workloads across time and locations to when and where low-carbon energy is available. Despite the prominence of this idea, prior work has only quantified the potential of spatiotemporal workload shifting in narrow settings, i.e., for specific workloads in select regions. In particular, there has been limited work on quantifying an upper bound on the ideal and practical benefits of carbon-aware spatiotemporal workload shifting for a wide range of cloud workloads. To address the problem, we conduct a detailed data-driven analysis to understand the benefits and limitations of carbon-aware spatiotemporal scheduling for cloud workloads. We utilize carbon intensity data from 123 regions, encompassing most major cloud sites, to analyze two broad classes of workloads -- batch and interactive -- and their various characteristics, e.g., job duration, deadlines, and SLOs. Our findings show that while spatiotemporal workload shifting can reduce workloads' carbon emissions, the practical upper bounds of these carbon reductions are currently limited and far from ideal. We also show that simple scheduling policies often yield most of these reductions, with more sophisticated techniques yielding little additional benefit. Notably, we also find that the benefit of carbon-aware workload scheduling relative to carbon-agnostic scheduling will decrease as the energy supply becomes "greener".</description>

Abstract: For nonlinear (control) systems, extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a popular method to obtain data-driven surrogate models. Its theoretical foundation is the Koopman framework, in which one propagates observable functions of the state to obtain a linear representation in an infinite-dimensional space. In this work, we prove practical asymptotic stability of a (controlled) equilibrium for EDMD-based model predictive control, in which the optimization step is conducted using the data-based surrogate model. To this end, we derive novel bounds on the estimation error that are proportional to the norm of state and control. This enables us to show that, if the underlying system is cost controllable, this stabilizablility property is preserved. We conduct numerical simulations illustrating the proven practical asymptotic stability.</description>

      <title>Task-Aware Machine Unlearning and Its Application in Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data privacy and security have become a non-negligible factor in load forecasting. Previous researches mainly focus on training stage enhancement. However, once the model is trained and deployed, it may need to `forget' (i.e., remove the impact of) part of training data if the these data are found to be malicious or as requested by the data owner. This paper introduces the concept of machine unlearning which is specifically designed to remove the influence of part of the dataset on an already trained forecaster. However, direct unlearning inevitably degrades the model generalization ability. To balance between unlearning completeness and model performance, a performance-aware algorithm is proposed by evaluating the sensitivity of local model parameter change using influence function and sample re-weighting. Furthermore, we observe that the statistical criterion such as mean squared error, cannot fully reflect the operation cost of the downstream tasks in power system. Therefore, a task-aware machine unlearning is proposed whose objective is a trilevel optimization with dispatch and redispatch problems considered. We theoretically prove the existence of the gradient of such an objective, which is key to re-weighting the remaining samples. We tested the unlearning algorithms on linear, CNN, and MLP-Mixer based load forecasters with a realistic load dataset. The simulation demonstrates the balance between unlearning completeness and operational cost. All codes can be found at https://github.com/xuwkk/task_aware_machine_unlearning.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Networks for Power Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential application of quantum and hybrid quantum-classical neural networks in power flow analysis. Experiments are conducted using two datasets based on 4-bus and 33-bus test systems. A systematic performance comparison is also conducted among quantum, hybrid quantum-classical, and classical neural networks. The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) training dataset size needed, (iv) training error, and (v) training process stability. The results show that the developed hybrid quantum-classical neural network outperforms both quantum and classical neural networks, and hence can improve deep learning-based power flow analysis in the noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) and fault-tolerant quantum (FTQ) era.</description>

      <title>Conjectural Online Learning with First-order Beliefs in Asymmetric Information Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric information stochastic games (\textsc{aisg}s) arise in many complex socio-technical systems, such as cyber-physical systems and IT infrastructures. Existing computational methods for \textsc{aisg}s are primarily offline and can not adapt to equilibrium deviations. Further, current methods are limited to special classes of \textsc{aisg}s to avoid belief hierarchies. To address these limitations, we propose conjectural online learning (\textsc{col}), an online method for generic \textsc{aisg}s. \textsc{col} uses a forecaster-actor-critic (\textsc{fac}) architecture where subjective forecasts are used to conjecture the opponents' strategies within a lookahead horizon, and Bayesian learning is used to calibrate the conjectures. To adapt strategies to nonstationary environments, \textsc{col} uses online rollout with cost function approximation (actor-critic). We prove that the conjectures produced by \textsc{col} are asymptotically consistent with the information feedback in the sense of a relaxed Bayesian consistency. We also prove that the empirical strategy profile induced by \textsc{col} converges to the Berk-Nash equilibrium, a solution concept characterizing rationality under subjectivity. Experimental results from an intrusion response use case demonstrate \textsc{col}'s superiority over state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods against nonstationary attacks.</description>

      <title>Continuous Approximations of Projected Dynamical Systems via Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projected Dynamical Systems (PDSs) form a class of discontinuous constrained dynamical systems, and have been used widely to solve optimization problems and variational inequalities. Recently, they have also gained significant attention for control purposes, such as high-performance integrators, saturated control and feedback optimization. In this work, we establish that locally Lipschitz continuous dynamics, involving Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), namely CBF-based dynamics, approximate PDSs. Specifically, we prove that trajectories of CBF-based dynamics uniformly converge to trajectories of PDSs, as a CBF-parameter is taken to infinity. Towards this, we also prove that CBF-based dynamics are perturbations of PDSs, with quantitative bounds on the perturbation. Our results pave the way to implement discontinuous PDS-based controllers in a continuous fashion, employing CBFs. Moreover, they can be employed to numerically simulate PDSs, overcoming disadvantages of existing discretization schemes, such as computing projections to possibly non-convex sets. Finally, this bridge between CBFs and PDSs may yield other potential benefits, including novel insights on stability.</description>

      <title>Smooth Computation without Input Delay: Robust Tube-Based Model Predictive Control for Robot Manipulator Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has exhibited remarkable capabilities in optimizing objectives and meeting constraints. However, the substantial computational burden associated with solving the Optimal Control Problem (OCP) at each triggering instant introduces significant delays between state sampling and control application. These delays limit the practicality of MPC in resource-constrained systems when engaging in complex tasks. The intuition to address this issue in this paper is that by predicting the successor state, the controller can solve the OCP one time step ahead of time thus avoiding the delay of the next action. To this end, we compute deviations between real and nominal system states, predicting forthcoming real states as initial conditions for the imminent OCP solution. Anticipatory computation stores optimal control based on current nominal states, thus mitigating the delay effects. Additionally, we establish an upper bound for linearization error, effectively linearizing the nonlinear system, reducing OCP complexity, and enhancing response speed. We provide empirical validation through two numerical simulations and corresponding real-world robot tasks, demonstrating significant performance improvements and augmented response speed (up to $90\%$) resulting from the seamless integration of our proposed approach compared to conventional time-triggered MPC strategies.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Control for Safe Spacecraft Autonomy: Convex Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust path-planning framework for safe spacecraft autonomy under uncertainty and develops a computationally tractable formulation based on convex programming. We utilize chance-constrained control to formulate the problem. It provides a mathematical framework to solve for a sequence of control policies that minimizes a probabilistic cost under probabilistic constraints with a user-defined confidence level (e.g., safety with 99.9% confidence). The framework enables the planner to directly control state distributions under operational uncertainties while ensuring the vehicle safety. This paper rigorously formulates the safe autonomy problem, gathers and extends techniques in literature to accommodate key cost/constraint functions that often arise in spacecraft path planning, and develops a tractable solution method. The presented framework is demonstrated via two representative numerical examples: safe autonomous rendezvous and orbit maintenance in cislunar space, both under uncertainties due to navigation error from Kalman filter, execution error via Gates model, and imperfect force models.</description>
