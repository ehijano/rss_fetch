      <title>Impact of Network Geometry on Large Networks with Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless networks assisted by intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), jointly modeling the signal received over the direct and indirect (reflected) paths is a difficult problem. In this work, we show that the network geometry (locations of serving base station, IRS, and user) can be captured using the so-called triangle parameter $\Delta$. We introduce a decomposition of the effect of the combined link into a signal amplification factor and an effective channel power coefficient $G$. The amplification factor is monotonically increasing with both the number of IRS elements $N$ and $\Delta$. For $G$, since an exact characterization of the distribution seems unfeasible, we propose three approximations depending on the value of the product $N\Delta$ for Nakagami fading and the special case of Rayleigh fading. For two relevant models of IRS placement, we prove that their performance is identical if $\Delta$ is the same given an $N$. We also show that no gains are achieved from IRS deployment if $N$ and $\Delta$ are both small. We further compute bounds on the diversity gain to quantify the channel hardening effect of IRSs. Hence only with a judicious selection of IRS placement and other network parameters, non-trivial gains can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning via Cross-Prediction-Powered Inference for Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many wireless application scenarios, acquiring labeled data can be prohibitively costly, requiring complex optimization processes or measurement campaigns. Semi-supervised learning leverages unlabeled samples to augment the available dataset by assigning synthetic labels obtained via machine learning (ML)-based predictions. However, treating the synthetic labels as true labels may yield worse-performing models as compared to models trained using only labeled data. Inspired by the recently developed prediction-powered inference (PPI) framework, this work investigates how to leverage the synthetic labels produced by an ML model, while accounting for the inherent bias with respect to true labels. To this end, we first review PPI and its recent extensions, namely tuned PPI and cross-prediction-powered inference (CPPI). Then, we introduce a novel variant of PPI, referred to as tuned CPPI, that provides CPPI with an additional degree of freedom in adapting to the quality of the ML-based labels. Finally, we showcase two applications of PPI-based techniques in wireless systems, namely beam alignment based on channel knowledge maps in millimeter-wave systems and received signal strength information-based indoor localization. Simulation results show the advantages of PPI-based techniques over conventional approaches that rely solely on labeled data or that apply standard pseudo-labeling strategies from semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, the proposed tuned CPPI method is observed to guarantee the best performance among all benchmark schemes, especially in the regime of limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Indexed Minimum Empirical Divergence-Based Algorithms for Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Indexed Minimum Empirical Divergence (IMED) algorithm is a highly effective approach that offers a stronger theoretical guarantee of the asymptotic optimality compared to the Kullback--Leibler Upper Confidence Bound (KL-UCB) algorithm for the multi-armed bandit problem. Additionally, it has been observed to empirically outperform UCB-based algorithms and Thompson Sampling. Despite its effectiveness, the generalization of this algorithm to contextual bandits with linear payoffs has remained elusive. In this paper, we present novel linear versions of the IMED algorithm, which we call the family of LinIMED algorithms. We demonstrate that LinIMED provides a $\widetilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ upper regret bound where $d$ is the dimension of the context and $T$ is the time horizon. Furthermore, extensive empirical studies reveal that LinIMED and its variants outperform widely-used linear bandit algorithms such as LinUCB and Linear Thompson Sampling in some regimes.</description>

      <title>MambaVC: Learned Visual Compression with Selective State Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learned visual compression is an important and active task in multimedia. Existing approaches have explored various CNN- and Transformer-based designs to model content distribution and eliminate redundancy, where balancing efficacy (i.e., rate-distortion trade-off) and efficiency remains a challenge. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) have shown promise due to their long-range modeling capacity and efficiency. Inspired by this, we take the first step to explore SSMs for visual compression. We introduce MambaVC, a simple, strong and efficient compression network based on SSM. MambaVC develops a visual state space (VSS) block with a 2D selective scanning (2DSS) module as the nonlinear activation function after each downsampling, which helps to capture informative global contexts and enhances compression. On compression benchmark datasets, MambaVC achieves superior rate-distortion performance with lower computational and memory overheads. Specifically, it outperforms CNN and Transformer variants by 9.3% and 15.6% on Kodak, respectively, while reducing computation by 42% and 24%, and saving 12% and 71% of memory. MambaVC shows even greater improvements with high-resolution images, highlighting its potential and scalability in real-world applications. We also provide a comprehensive comparison of different network designs, underscoring MambaVC's advantages.</description>

      <title>CAFe: Cost and Age aware Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many federated learning (FL) models, a common strategy employed to ensure the progress in the training process, is to wait for at least $M$ clients out of the total $N$ clients to send back their local gradients based on a reporting deadline $T$, once the parameter server (PS) has broadcasted the global model. If enough clients do not report back within the deadline, the particular round is considered to be a failed round and the training round is restarted from scratch. If enough clients have responded back, the round is deemed successful and the local gradients of all the clients that responded back are used to update the global model. In either case, the clients that failed to report back an update within the deadline would have wasted their computational resources. Having a tighter deadline (small $T$) and waiting for a larger number of participating clients (large $M$) leads to a large number of failed rounds and therefore greater communication cost and computation resource wastage. However, having a larger $T$ leads to longer round durations whereas smaller $M$ may lead to noisy gradients. Therefore, there is a need to optimize the parameters $M$ and $T$ such that communication cost and the resource wastage is minimized while having an acceptable convergence rate. In this regard, we show that the average age of a client at the PS appears explicitly in the theoretical convergence bound, and therefore, can be used as a metric to quantify the convergence of the global model. We provide an analytical scheme to select the parameters $M$ and $T$ in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new weight and corresponding metric over finite extension fields for asymmetric error correction. The weight distinguishes between elements from the base field and the ones outside of it, which is motivated by asymmetric quantum codes. We set up the theoretic framework for this weight and metric, including upper and lower bounds, asymptotic behavior of random codes, and we show the existence of an optimal family of codes achieving the Singleton-type upper bound.</description>

      <title>How do correlations shape the landscape of information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a few common models on how correlations affect information. The main model considered is the Shannon mutual information $I(S:R_1,\cdots, R_i)$ over distributions with marginals $P_{S,R_i}$ fixed for each $i$, with the analogy in which $S$ is the stimulus and $R_i$'s are neurons. We work out basic models in details, using algebro-geometric tools to write down discriminants that separate distributions with distinct qualitative behaviours in the probability simplex into toric chambers and evaluate the volumes of them algebraically. As a byproduct, we provide direct translation between a decomposition of mutual information inspired by a series expansion and one from partial information decomposition (PID) problems, characterising the synergistic terms of the former. We hope this paper serves for communication between communities especially mathematics and theoretical neuroscience on the topic.

      <title>AdaSem: Adaptive Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications for End-to-End Camera Relocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, deep autoencoders have gained traction as a powerful method for implementing goal-oriented semantic communications systems. The idea is to train a mapping from the source domain directly to channel symbols, and vice versa. However, prior studies often focused on rate-distortion tradeoff and transmission delay, at the cost of increasing end-to-end complexity and thus latency. Moreover, the datasets used are often not reflective of real-world environments, and the results were not validated against real-world baseline systems, leading to an unfair comparison. In this paper, we study the problem of remote camera pose estimation and propose AdaSem, an adaptive semantic communications approach that optimizes the tradeoff between inference accuracy and end-to-end latency. We develop an adaptive semantic codec model, which encodes the source data into a dynamic number of symbols, based on the latent space distribution and the channel state feedback. We utilize a lightweight model for both transmitter and receiver to ensure comparable complexity to the baseline implemented in a real-world system. Extensive experiments on real-environment data show the effectiveness of our approach. When compared to a real implementation of a client-server camera relocalization service, AdaSem outperforms the baseline by reducing the end-to-end delay and estimation error by over 75% and 63%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Capacity-Achieving Private Information Retrieval with Non-Colluding and Colluding Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13624v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a mechanism for efficiently downloading messages while keeping the index secret. Here, PIRs in which servers do not communicate with each other are called standard PIRs, and PIRs in which some servers communicate with each other are called colluding PIRs. The information-theoretic upper bound on efficiency has been given in previous studies. However, the conditions for PIRs to keep privacy, to decode the desired message, and to achieve that upper bound have not been clarified in matrix form. In this paper, we prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for the properties of standard PIR and colluding PIR. Further, we represent the properties in matrix form.</description>

      <title>On the Rate-Distortion Function for Sampled Cyclostationary Gaussian Processes with Memory: Extended Version with Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the rate-distortion function (RDF) for lossy compression of asynchronously-sampled continuous-time (CT) wide-sense cyclostationary (WSCS) Gaussian processes with memory. As the case of synchronous sampling, i.e., when the sampling interval is commensurate with the period of the cyclostationary statistics, has already been studied, we focus on discrete-time (DT) processes obtained by asynchronous sampling, i.e., when the sampling interval is incommensurate with the period of the cyclostationary statistics of the CT WSCS source process. It is further assumed that the sampling interval is smaller than the maximal autocorrelation length of the CT source process, which implies that the DT process possesses memory. Thus, the sampled process is a DT wide-sense almost cyclostationary (WSACS) processes with memory. This problem is motivated by the fact that man-made communications signals are modelled as CT WSCS processes; hence, applications of such sampling include, e.g., compress-and-forward relaying and recording systems. The main challenge follows because, with asynchronous sampling, the DT sampled process is not information-stable, and hence the characterization of its RDF should be carried out within the information-spectrum framework instead of using conventional information-theoretic arguments. This work expands upon our previous work which addressed the special case in which the DT process is independent across time. The existence of dependence between the samples requires new tools to obtain the characterization of the RDF.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Relative Entropy Coding with Space Partitioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relative entropy coding (REC) algorithms encode a random sample following a target distribution $Q$, using a coding distribution $P$ shared between the sender and receiver. Sadly, general REC algorithms suffer from prohibitive encoding times, at least on the order of $2^{D_{\text{KL}}[Q||P]}$, and faster algorithms are limited to very specific settings. This work addresses this issue by introducing a REC scheme utilizing space partitioning to reduce runtime in practical scenarios. We provide theoretical analyses of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness with both toy examples and practical applications. Notably, our method successfully handles REC tasks with $D_{\text{KL}}[Q||P]$ about three times greater than what previous methods can manage, and reduces the bitrate by approximately 5-15% in VAE-based lossless compression on MNIST and INR-based lossy compression on CIFAR-10, compared to previous methods, significantly improving the practicality of REC for neural compression.</description>

      <title>On the existence of powerful p-values and e-values for composite hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a composite null $ \mathcal P$ and composite alternative $ \mathcal Q$, when and how can we construct a p-value whose distribution is exactly uniform under the null, and stochastically smaller than uniform under the alternative? Similarly, when and how can we construct an e-value whose expectation exactly equals one under the null, but its expected logarithm under the alternative is positive? We answer these basic questions, and other related ones, when $ \mathcal P$ and $ \mathcal Q$ are convex polytopes (in the space of probability measures). We prove that such constructions are possible if and only if $ \mathcal Q$ does not intersect the span of $ \mathcal P$. If the p-value is allowed to be stochastically larger than uniform under $P\in \mathcal P$, and the e-value can have expectation at most one under $P\in \mathcal P$, then it is achievable whenever $ \mathcal P$ and $ \mathcal Q$ are disjoint. More generally, even when $ \mathcal P$ and $ \mathcal Q$ are not polytopes, we characterize the existence of a bounded nontrivial e-variable whose expectation exactly equals one under any $P \in \mathcal P$. The proofs utilize recently developed techniques in simultaneous optimal transport. A key role is played by coarsening the filtration: sometimes, no such p-value or e-value exists in the richest data filtration, but it does exist in some reduced filtration, and our work provides the first general characterization of this phenomenon. We also provide an iterative construction that explicitly constructs such processes, and under certain conditions it finds the one that grows fastest under a specific alternative $Q$. We discuss implications for the construction of composite nonnegative (super)martingales, and end with some conjectures and open problems.</description>

Abstract: We study channel estimation for a beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) aided multiple input single output system. We first describe the channel estimation strategy based on the least square (LS) method, derive the mean square error (MSE) of the LS estimator, and formulate the BD-RIS design problem that minimizes the estimation MSE with unique constraints induced by group-connected architectures of BD-RIS. Then, we propose an efficient BD-RIS design which theoretically guarantees to achieve the MSE lower bound. Finally, we provide simulation results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation scheme.</description>

Abstract: This work studies the modeling and optimization of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) aided wireless communication systems in the presence of mutual coupling among the RIS elements. Specifically, we first derive the mutual coupling aware BD-RIS aided communication model using scattering and impedance parameter analysis. Based on the obtained communication model, we propose a general BD-RIS optimization algorithm applicable to different architectures of BD-RIS to maximize the channel gain. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed design and demonstrate that the larger the mutual coupling the larger the gain offered by BD-RIS over conventional diagonal RIS.</description>

Abstract: An orientable sequence of order $n$ is a cyclic binary sequence such that each length-$n$ substring appears at most once \emph{in either direction}. Maximal length orientable sequences are known only for $n\leq 7$, and a trivial upper bound on their length is $2^{n-1} - 2^{\lfloor(n-1)/2\rfloor}$. This paper presents the first efficient algorithm to construct orientable sequences with asymptotically optimal length; more specifically, our algorithm constructs orientable sequences via cycle-joining and a successor-rule approach requiring $O(n)$ time per bit and $O(n)$ space. This answers a longstanding open question from Dai, Martin, Robshaw, Wild [Cryptography and Coding III (1993)]. Applying a recent concatenation-tree framework, the same sequences can be generated in $O(1)$-amortized time per bit using $O(n^2)$ space. Our sequences are applied to find new longest-known (aperiodic) orientable sequences for $n\leq 20$.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization of memory sampling in status updating systems, where source updates are published in shared memory, and reader process samples the memory for source updates by paying a sampling cost. We formulate a discrete-time decision problem to find a sampling policy that minimizes average cost comprising age at the client and the cost incurred due to sampling. We establish that an optimal policy is a stationary and deterministic threshold-type policy, and subsequently derive optimal threshold and the corresponding optimal average cost.</description>

      <title>Perfect codes over non-prime power alphabets: an approach based on Diophantine equations</title>

Abstract: Perfect error correcting codes allow for an optimal transmission of information while guaranteeing error correction. For this reason, proving their existence has been a classical problem in both pure mathematics and information theory. Indeed, the classification of the parameters of $e-$error correcting perfect codes over $q-$ary alphabets was a very active topic of research in the late 20th century. Consequently, all parameters of perfect $e-$error correcting codes were found if $e \ge 3$, and it was conjectured that no perfect $2-$error correcting codes exist over any $q-$ary alphabet, where $q &gt; 3$. In the 1970s, this was proved for $q$ a prime power, for $q = 2^r3^s$ and for only $7$ other values of $q$. Almost $50$ years later, it is surprising to note that there have been no new results in this regard and the classification of $2-$error correcting codes over non-prime power alphabets remains an open problem. In this paper, we use techniques from the resolution of generalised Ramanujan--Nagell equation and from modern computational number theory to show that perfect $2-$error correcting codes do not exist for $172$ new values of $q$ which are not prime powers, substantially increasing the values of $q$ which are now classified. In addition, we prove that, for any fixed value of $q$, there can be at most finitely many perfect $2-$error correcting codes over an alphabet of size $q$.</description>
