      <title>Uncertainty Quantification and Propagation for ACORN, a geometric deep learning tracking pipeline for HEP experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed an Uncertainty Quantification process for multistep pipelines and applied it to the ACORN particle tracking pipeline. All our experiments are made using the TrackML open dataset. Using the Monte Carlo Dropout method, we measure the data and model uncertainties of the pipeline steps, study how they propagate down the pipeline, and how they are impacted by the training dataset's size, the input data's geometry and physical properties. We will show that for our case study, as the training dataset grows, the overall uncertainty becomes dominated by aleatoric uncertainty, indicating that we had sufficient data to train the ACORN model we chose to its full potential. We show that the ACORN pipeline yields high confidence in the track reconstruction and does not suffer from the miscalibration of the GNN model.</description>

      <title>Objective comparison of methods to decode anomalous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.06766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deviations from Brownian motion leading to anomalous diffusion are found in transport dynamics from quantum physics to life sciences. The characterization of anomalous diffusion from the measurement of an individual trajectory is a challenging task, which traditionally relies on calculating the trajectory mean squared displacement. However, this approach breaks down for cases of practical interest, e.g., short or noisy trajectories, heterogeneous behaviour, or non-ergodic processes. Recently, several new approaches have been proposed, mostly building on the ongoing machine-learning revolution. To perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition, the Anomalous Diffusion challenge (AnDi). Participating teams applied their algorithms to a commonly-defined dataset including diverse conditions. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, machine-learning-based approaches achieved superior performance for all tasks. The discussion of the challenge results provides practical advice for users and a benchmark for developers.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multi-wavelength Imaging of the LMC SN1987A with SRG/eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) and eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) data have already revealed a remarkable number of undiscovered X-ray sources. Using Bayesian inference and generative modeling techniques for X-ray imaging, we aim to increase the sensitivity and scientific value of these observations by denoising, deconvolving, and decomposing the X-ray sky. Leveraging information field theory, we can exploit the spatial and spectral correlation structures of the different physical components of the sky with non-parametric priors to enhance the image reconstruction. By incorporating instrumental effects into the forward model, we develop a comprehensive Bayesian imaging algorithm for eROSITA pointing observations. Finally, we apply the developed algorithm to EDR data of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SN1987A, fusing data sets from observations made by five different telescope modules. The final result is a denoised, deconvolved, and decomposed view of the LMC, which enables the analysis of its fine-scale structures, the identification of point sources in this region, and enhanced calibration for future work.</description>

      <title>Short-Term Forecasting of Energy Production and Consumption Using Extreme Learning Machine: A Comprehensive MIMO based ELM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel methodology for short-term energy forecasting using an Extreme Learning Machine ($\mathtt{ELM}$) is proposed. Using six years of hourly data collected in Corsica (France) from multiple energy sources (solar, wind, hydro, thermal, bioenergy, and imported electricity), our approach predicts both individual energy outputs and total production (including imports, which closely follow energy demand, modulo losses) through a Multi-Input Multi-Output ($\mathtt{MIMO}$) architecture. To address non-stationarity and seasonal variability, sliding window techniques and cyclic time encoding are incorporated, enabling dynamic adaptation to fluctuations. The $\mathtt{ELM}$ model significantly outperforms persistence-based forecasting, particularly for solar and thermal energy, achieving an $\mathtt{nRMSE}$ of $17.9\%$ and $5.1\%$, respectively, with $\mathtt{R^2} &gt; 0.98$ (1-hour horizon). The model maintains high accuracy up to five hours ahead, beyond which renewable energy sources become increasingly volatile. While $\mathtt{MIMO}$ provides marginal gains over Single-Input Single-Output ($\mathtt{SISO}$) architectures and offers key advantages over deep learning methods such as $\mathtt{LSTM}$, it provides a closed-form solution with lower computational demands, making it well-suited for real-time applications, including online learning. Beyond predictive accuracy, the proposed methodology is adaptable to various contexts and datasets, as it can be tuned to local constraints such as resource availability, grid characteristics, and market structures.</description>
