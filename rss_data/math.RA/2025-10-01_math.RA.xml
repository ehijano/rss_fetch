      <title>Classification and Ideal Lattices of Leavitt Path Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leavitt path algebras are free algebras subject to relations induced by directed graphs. This paper investigates the ideals of Leavitt path algebras, with an emphasis on the relationship between graph-theoretic properties of a directed graph and the ideals of the associated Leavitt path algebra. We begin by presenting a new proof of a fundamental result characterizing graded and non-graded ideals of a Leavitt path algebra using a condition on the number of closed paths at each vertex in its directed graph. Appealing to this result, we then classify the Leavitt path algebras of directed graphs with two vertices up to isomorphism and determine all possible lattice structures of a class of well-behaved ideals possessed by such algebras.</description>

      <title>Twisted Rota-Baxter families on Lie-Yamaguti algebras and NS-Lie-Yamaguti family algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce twisted Rota-Baxter families on Lie-Yamaguti algebras indexed by a commutative semigroup $\Omega$. Then, we study NS-Lie-Yamaguti family algebras as the underlying structures of twisted Rota-Baxter families. Finally, we investigate the cohomology of a twisted Rota-Baxter family. This cohomology can also be seen as the cohomology of a certain $\Omega$-Lie-Yamaguti algebras with coefficients in an appropriate representation. As applications, we consider the deformations of twisted Rota-Baxter families from the cohomological points of view.</description>

      <title>A symmetric biderivation structure on polynomial algebras and a class of modules over the special Jordan algebra $H_n(K)$ of symmetric matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exists a biderivation structure on the polynomial algebra $\mathscr{A}[n] = K[x_1,\dots,x_n],$ where $K$ is a field with $\operatorname{char}(K)\ne 2$, defined by $f \circ h = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\,\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_i}.$ Let $\mathscr{A}_k[n]$ denote the subspace of homogeneous polynomials of degree $k$. Then $(\mathscr{A}_2[n],\circ)$ is a Jordan algebra, isomorphic to the special Jordan algebra $H_n(K)$ of $n\times n$ symmetric matrices. Each $\mathscr{A}_k[n]$ is a natural $\mathscr{A}_2[n]$-bimodule, which admits a weight space decomposition with respect to a complete set of mutually orthogonal idempotents. In particular, the weight space decomposition of $\mathscr{A}_2[n]$ coincides with its Peirce decomposition. $\mathscr{A}_k[n]$ is a Jordan bimodule if and only if $k=0,1,2$. Equivalently, for all $k\ge 3$, $\mathscr{A}_k[n]$ is not a Jordan bimodule. The group of algebra automorphisms of $(\mathscr{A}[n],\cdot,\circ)$ that preserve each homogeneous component $\mathscr{A}_k[n]$ is isomorphic to the orthogonal group $O(n,K)$. If $\operatorname{char}(K)=0$, then the algebra $(\mathscr{A}[n],\cdot,\circ)$ is simple, i.e., it has no nonzero proper ideals. Moreover, in this case, each $\mathscr{A}_k[n]$ is a simple $\mathscr{A}_2[n]$-bimodule.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Technique for the Wedderburn Decomposition of Rational Group Algebras of Nested GVZ $p$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a combinatorial formula for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using this formula, we derive an explicit combinatorial expression for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of all two-generator $p$-groups of class $2$. Additionally, we provide explicit combinatorial formulas for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of certain families of nested GVZ $p$-groups with arbitrarily large nilpotency class. We also classify all nested GVZ $p$-groups of order at most $p^5$ and compute the Wedderburn decomposition of their rational group algebras. Finally, we determine a complete set of primitive central idempotents for the rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Contrastive Learning for Privacy-Preserving Representation Learning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels. However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE, a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving graph representation learning.</description>

      <title>On the Foundations of Approximate Algebra: Axioms, Extensions, and Geometric Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the recent works of Inan [4] and Almahareeq-Peters-Vergili [1], we develop a rigorous axiomatic foundation for approximate algebra via an algebra-compatible closure operator $\Phi^{\!*}$ satisfying (C1)-(C4a) together with the balanced multiplicativity axiom (C4b) (and absorption required only for ideals). Our framework encompasses a theory of approximate modules with their isomorphism theorems, the construction of an approximate Zariski topology on the prime spectrum, and a compatible theory of localization. Key results include a $\mathrm{T}_0$ property and a $\mathrm{T}_1$-criterion for the spectrum, an extension-contraction bijection for approximate prime ideals in localizations, and the equality of the approximate prime radical and the nilradical. The theory's utility is illustrated by computing $\mathrm{Spec}_{\!\Phi}(\mathbb{Z})$ for the modular closure $\Phi^{\!*}(A)=\langle A\rangle+m\mathbb{Z}$, which yields a finite discrete space -- in stark contrast to the classical $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, which is infinite and not even $\mathrm{T}_1$. We also outline a pathway toward an Approximate Nullstellensatz and record model classes of closures that ensure its evaluation-separation hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Involutive Brauer groups and Poincar\'e rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the formalism of Poincar\'e $ \infty $-categories, as developed by Calm\`es-Dotto-Harpaz-Hebestreit-Land-Moi-Nardin-Nikolaus-Steimle, to define and study moduli stacks of line bundles with $ \lambda $-hermitian pairings and of Morita equivalence classes of Azumaya algebras equipped with an involution. Our moduli spaces give rise to enhancements of the ordinary Picard and Brauer groups which incorporate the data of an involution on the base; we will refer to these new invariants as the Poincar\'e Picard group and the Poincar\'e Brauer group. We show that we can recover the involutive Brauer group of Parimala-Srinivas from the Poincar\'e Brauer group when the former is defined; however, they no longer agree even for closed points due to the existence of shifted perfect pairings. A natural context for Poincar\'e Picard and Poincar\'e Brauer groups is a category of highly structured ring spectra which we refer to as Poincar\'e rings. We also compute these invariants for the sphere spectrum and other examples. As a consequence, we deduce a derived enhancement of a classical theorem of Saltman.</description>

      <title>A new super integrable hierarchy and a generalized super-AKNS hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a non-isospectral problem on the loop algebra of the Lie superalgebra osp(1,6), and construct an super integrable system using the supertrace identity. The resulting super integrable system can be reduced to the super-AKNS hierarchy under certain conditions. By reconsidering a new (2 + 1)-dimensional non-isospectral problem with spectral matrices satisfying these conditions, we obtain a (2+1)-dimensional generalization of the superAKNS hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Kapranov $L_{\infty}[1]$ algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given any K\"ahler manifold $X$, Kapranov discovered an $L_\infty[1]$ algebra structure on $\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X(T^{1,0}_X)$. Motivated by this result, we introduce, as a generalization of $L_\infty[1]$ algebras, a notion of $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra, where $\mathfrak{R}$ is a differential graded commutative algebra with unit. We show that standard notions (such as quasi-isomorphism and linearization) and results (including homotopy transfer theorems) can be extended to this context. For instance, we provide a linearization theorem.
  As an application, we prove that, given any DG Lie algebroid $(\mathcal{L},Q_{\mathcal{L}})$ over a DG manifold $(\mathcal{M},Q)$, there exists an induced $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra structure on $\Gamma(\mathcal{L})$, where $\mathfrak{R}$ is the DG commutative algebra $(C^\infty(\mathcal{M}),Q)$ -- its unary bracket is $Q_{\mathcal{L}}$ while its binary bracket is a cocycle representative of the Atiyah class of the DG Lie algebroid. This $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra $\Gamma(\mathcal{L})$ is linearizable if and only if the Atiyah class of the DG Lie algebroid vanishes. However, the $L_\infty[1]$ ($\mathbb{K}$-)algebra $\Gamma(\mathcal{L})$ induced by this $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra is necessarily homotopy abelian.
  As a special case, we prove that, given any complex manifold $X$, the Kapranov $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra $\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X(T^{1,0}_X)$, where $\mathfrak{R}$ is the DG commutative algebra $(\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X,\bar{\partial})$, is linearizable if and only if the Atiyah class of the holomorphic tangent bundle $T_X$ vanishes. Nevertheless, the induced $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathbb{C}$-algebra structure on $\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X(T^{1,0}_X)$ is necessarily homotopy abelian.</description>

      <title>Derived equivalences, matrix equivalences, and homological conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Centralizer matrix algebras were investigated initially by Georg Ferdinand Frobenius in the Crelle's Journal around 1877. By introducing three new equivalence relations on all square matrices over a field, we completely characterize Morita, derived and almost $\nu$-stable derived equivalences between centralizer matrix algebras in terms of these matrix equivalences, respectively. Thus the categorical equivalences are reduced to matrix equivalences in linear algebra. Further, we show that a derived equivalence between centralizer matrix algebras of permutation matrices induces both a Morita equivalence and additional derived equivalences for $p$-regular parts and for $p$-singular parts. As applications, we show that the finitistic dimension conjecture and Nakayama conjecture are valid for centralizer matrix algebras.</description>

      <title>Roots and right factors of polynomials and left eigenvalues of matrices over Cayley-Dickson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16704v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over a composition algebra $A$, a polynomial $f(x) \in A[x]$ has a root $\alpha$ if and only $f(x)=g(x)\cdot (x-\alpha)$ for some $g(x) \in A[x]$. We examine whether this is true for general Cayley-Dickson algebras. The conclusion is that it is when $f(x)$ is linear or monic quadratic, but it is false in general. Similar questions about the connections between $f$ and its companion $C_f(x)=f(x)\cdot \overline{f(x)}$ are studied. Finally, we compute the left eigenvalues of $2\times 2$ octonion matrices.</description>

      <title>Composing Global Solutions to Reasoning Tasks via Algebraic Objects in Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables \emph{analytical} construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGS (\emph{\underline{Co}mposing \underline{G}lobal \underline{S}olutions}). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of \emph{sum potentials}, which are ring homomorphisms, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global solutions constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that overparameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global solutions such as perfect memorization are unfavorable.
