      <title>Robust Bernoulli mixture models for credit portfolio risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents comparison results and establishes risk bounds for credit portfolios within classes of Bernoulli mixture models, assuming conditionally independent defaults that are stochastically increasing with a common risk factor. We provide simple and interpretable conditions for conditional default probabilities that imply a comparison of credit portfolio losses in convex order. In the case of threshold models, the ranking of portfolio losses is based on a pointwise comparison of the underlying copulas. Our setting includes as special case the well-known Gaussian copula model but allows for general tail dependencies, which are crucial for modeling credit portfolio risks. Moreover, our results extend the classical parameterized models, such as the industry models CreditMetrics and KMV Portfolio Manager, to a robust setting where individual parameters or the copula modeling the dependence structure can be ambiguous. A simulation study and a real data example under model uncertainty offer evidence supporting the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Measuring Name Concentrations through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new deep learning approach for the quantification of name concentration risk in loan portfolios. Our approach is tailored for small portfolios and allows for both an actuarial as well as a mark-to-market definition of loss. The training of our neural network relies on Monte Carlo simulations with importance sampling which we explicitly formulate for the CreditRisk${+}$ and the ratings-based CreditMetrics model. Numerical results based on simulated as well as real data demonstrate the accuracy of our new approach and its superior performance compared to existing analytical methods for assessing name concentration risk in small and concentrated portfolios.</description>

      <title>The role of debt valuation factors in systemic risk assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fragility of financial systems was starkly demonstrated in early 2023 through a cascade of major bank failures in the United States, including the second, third, and fourth largest collapses in the US history. The highly interdependent financial networks and the associated high systemic risk have been deemed the cause of the crashes. The goal of this paper is to enhance existing systemic risk analysis frameworks by incorporating essential debt valuation factors. Our results demonstrate that these additional elements substantially influence the outcomes of risk assessment. Notably, by modeling the dynamic relationship between interest rates and banks' credibility, our framework can detect potential cascading failures that standard approaches might miss. The proposed risk assessment methodology can help regulatory bodies prevent future failures, while also allowing companies to more accurately predict turmoil periods and strengthen their survivability during such events.</description>
