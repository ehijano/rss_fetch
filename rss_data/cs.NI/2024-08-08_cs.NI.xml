      <title>Coverage-aware and Reinforcement Learning Using Multi-agent Approach for HD Map QoS in a Realistic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One effective way to optimize the offloading process is by minimizing the transmission time. This is particularly true in a Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET) where vehicles frequently download and upload High-definition (HD) map data which requires constant updates. This implies that latency and throughput requirements must be guaranteed by the wireless system. To achieve this, adjustable contention windows (CW) allocation strategies in the standard IEEE802.11p have been explored by numerous researchers. Nevertheless, their implementations demand alterations to the existing standard which is not always desirable. To address this issue, we proposed a Q-Learning algorithm that operates at the application layer. Moreover, it could be deployed in any wireless network thereby mitigating the compatibility issues. The solution has demonstrated a better network performance with relatively fewer optimization requirements as compared to the Deep Q Network (DQN) and Actor-Critic algorithms. The same is observed while evaluating the model in a multi-agent setup showing higher performance compared to the single-agent setup.</description>

      <title>Communication-Aware Consistent Edge Selection for Mobile Users and Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offloading time-sensitive, computationally intensive tasks-such as advanced learning algorithms for autonomous driving-from vehicles to nearby edge servers, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, or other collaborating vehicles via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication enhances service efficiency. However, whence traversing the path to the destination, the vehicle's mobility necessitates frequent handovers among the access points (APs) to maintain continuous and uninterrupted wireless connections to maintain the network's Quality of Service (QoS). These frequent handovers subsequently lead to task migrations among the edge servers associated with the respective APs. This paper addresses the joint problem of task migration and access-point handover by proposing a deep reinforcement learning framework based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. A joint allocation method of communication and computation of APs is proposed to minimize computational load, service latency, and interruptions with the overarching goal of maximizing QoS. We implement and evaluate our proposed framework on simulated experiments to achieve smooth and seamless task switching among edge servers, ultimately reducing latency.</description>

      <title>Optimizing NOMA Transmissions to Advance Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse critical data, such as location information and driving patterns, can be collected by IoT devices in vehicular networks to improve driving experiences and road safety. However, drivers are often reluctant to share their data due to privacy concerns. The Federated Vehicular Network (FVN) is a promising technology that tackles these concerns by transmitting model parameters instead of raw data, thereby protecting the privacy of drivers. Nevertheless, the performance of Federated Learning (FL) in a vehicular network depends on the joining ratio, which is restricted by the limited available wireless resources. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to apply Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) to improve the joining ratio in a FVN. Specifically, a vehicle selection and transmission power control algorithm is developed to exploit the power domain differences in the received signal to ensure the maximum number of vehicles capable of joining the FVN. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NOMA-based strategy increases the joining ratio and significantly enhances the performance of the FVN.</description>

      <title>Home Energy Management Systems: Challenges, Heterogeneity &amp; Integration Architecture Towards A Smart City Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contemporary era is marked by rapid urban growth and increasing population. A significant, and constantly growing, portion of the global population now resides in major cities, leading to escalating energy demands in urban centers. As urban population is expected to keep on expanding in the near future, the same is also expected to happen with the associated energy requirements. The situation with the continuously increasing energy demand, along with the emergence of smart grids and the capabilities that are already -- or can be -- offered by Home Energy Management System (HEMS), has created a lot of opportunities towards a more sustainable future, with optimized energy consumption and demand response, which leads to economic and environmental benefits, based on the actual needs of the consumers. In this paper, we begin by providing an analytical exploration of the challenges faced at both the development and deployment levels. We proceed with a thorough analysis and comparison between the abundance of devices, smart home technologies, and protocols currently used by various products. Following, aiming to blunt the currently existing challenges, we propose a reliable, flexible, and extendable architectural schema. Finally, we analyze a number of potential ways in which the data deriving from such implementations can be analyzed and leveraged, in order to produce services that offer useful insights and smart solutions towards enhanced energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Traffic and Obstacle-aware UAV Positioning in Urban Environments Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are suited as cost-effective and adaptable platforms for carrying Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base Stations (BSs). Implementing aerial networks in disaster management scenarios and crowded areas can effectively enhance Quality of Service (QoS). In such environments, maintaining Line-of-Sight (LoS), especially at higher frequencies, is crucial for ensuring reliable communication networks with high capacity, particularly in environments with obstacles. The main contribution of this paper is a traffic- and obstacle-aware UAV positioning algorithm named Reinforcement Learning-based Traffic and Obstacle-aware Positioning Algorithm (RLTOPA), for such environments. RLTOPA determines the optimal position of the UAV by considering the positions of ground users, the coordinates of obstacles, and the traffic demands of users. This positioning aims to maximize QoS in terms of throughput by ensuring optimal LoS between ground users and the UAV. The network performance of the proposed solution, characterized in terms of mean delay and throughput, was evaluated using the ns- 3 simulator. The results show up to 95% improvement in aggregate throughput and 71% in delay without compromising fairness.</description>

Abstract: Future wireless communication systems must simultaneously address multiple challenges to ensure accurate data detection, deliver high Quality of Service (QoS), adding enable a high data transmission with low system design. Additionally, they need to reduce energy consumption and latency without increasing system complexity. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a commonly used waveform in 4G and 5G systems, it has limitations in handling significant delay and Doppler spread in high mobility scenarios. To overcome these weaknesses, a novel waveform named Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) has been proposed, which aims to improve upon OFDM by closely matching signals to channel behavior. In this study, we propose a novel strategy that enables operators to dynamically select the best waveform based on estimated mobile user parameters. We use an Integrated Radar Sensing and Communication System (ISAC) to estimate delay and Doppler, as well as speed and range. This approach allows the base station to adapt to the mobile target, thereby enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems in high mobility and low complexity scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and show that it outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>MTDSense: AI-Based Fingerprinting of Moving Target Defense Techniques in Software-Defined Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moving target defenses (MTD) are proactive security techniques that enhance network security by confusing the attacker and limiting their attack window. MTDs have been shown to have significant benefits when evaluated against traditional network attacks, most of which are automated and untargeted. However, little has been done to address an attacker who is aware the network uses an MTD. In this work, we propose a novel approach named MTDSense, which can determine when the MTD has been triggered using the footprints the MTD operation leaves in the network traffic. MTDSense uses unsupervised clustering to identify traffic following an MTD trigger and extract the MTD interval. An attacker can use this information to maximize their attack window and tailor their attacks, which has been shown to significantly reduce the effectiveness of MTD. Through analyzing the attacker's approach, we propose and evaluate two new MTD update algorithms that aim to reduce the information leaked into the network by the MTD. We present an extensive experimental evaluation by creating, to our knowledge, the first dataset of the operation of an IP-shuffling MTD in a software-defined network. Our work reveals that despite previous results showing the effectiveness of MTD as a defense, traditional implementations of MTD are highly susceptible to a targeted attacker.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Image Semantic Communication with GenAI: Explainablity, Controllability, and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image semantic communication (ISC) has garnered significant attention for its potential to achieve high efficiency in visual content transmission. However, existing ISC systems based on joint source-channel coding face challenges in interpretability, operability, and compatibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel trustworthy ISC framework. This approach leverages text extraction and segmentation mapping techniques to convert images into explainable semantics, while employing Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for multiple downstream inference tasks. We also introduce a multi-rate ISC transmission protocol that dynamically adapts to both the received explainable semantic content and specific task requirements at the receiver. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework achieves explainable learning, decoupled training, and compatible transmission in various application scenarios. Finally, some intriguing research directions and application scenarios are identified.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Prediction Approach for 3D Geometry-based communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03975v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of mobile user requirements in shadowing and multi-fading environments, focusing on the Downlink (DL) radio node selection based on Uplink (UL) channel estimation. One of the key issues tackled in this research is the prediction performance in scenarios where estimated channels are integrated. An adaptive deep learning approach is proposed to improve performance, offering a compelling alternative to traditional interpolation techniques for air-to-ground link selection on demand. Moreover, our study considers a 3D channel model, which provides a more realistic and accurate representation than 2D models, particularly in the context of 3D network node distributions. This consideration becomes crucial in addressing the complex multipath fading effects within geometric stochastic 3D 3GPP channel models in urban environments. Furthermore, our research emphasises the need for adaptive prediction mechanisms that carefully balance the trade-off between DL link forecasted frequency response accuracy and the complexity requirements associated with estimation and prediction. This paper contributes to advancing 3D radio resource management by addressing these challenges, enabling more efficient and reliable communication for energy-constrained flying network nodes in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Congestion or No Congestion: Packet Loss Identification and Prediction Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Packet losses in the network significantly impact network performance. Most TCP variants reduce the transmission rate when detecting packet losses, assuming network congestion, resulting in lower throughput and affecting bandwidth-intensive applications like immersive applications. However, not all packet losses are due to congestion; some occur due to wireless link issues, which we refer to as non-congestive packet losses. In today's hybrid Internet, packets of a single flow may traverse wired and wireless segments of a network to reach their destination. TCP should not react to non-congestive packet losses the same way as it does to congestive losses. However, TCP currently can not differentiate between these types of packet losses and lowers its transmission rate irrespective of packet loss type, resulting in lower throughput for wireless clients. To address this challenge, we use machine learning techniques to distinguish between these types of packet losses at end hosts, utilizing easily available features at the host. Our results demonstrate that Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers perform better in predicting the type of packet loss, offering a promising solution to enhance network performance.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Mobile Edge Generation (MEG) by Constrained Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel accelerated mobile edge generation (MEG) framework is proposed for generating high-resolution images on mobile devices. Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs.</description>

      <title>Diffie-Hellman Picture Show: Key Exchange Stories from Commercial VoWiFi Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voice over Wi-Fi (VoWiFi) uses a series of IPsec tunnels to deliver IP-based telephony from the subscriber's phone (User Equipment, UE) into the Mobile Network Operator's (MNO) core network via an Internet-facing endpoint, the Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG). IPsec tunnels are set up in phases. The first phase negotiates the cryptographic algorithm and parameters and performs a key exchange via the Internet Key Exchange protocol, while the second phase (protected by the above-established encryption) performs the authentication. An insecure key exchange would jeopardize the later stages and the data's security and confidentiality.
  In this paper, we analyze the phase 1 settings and implementations as they are found in phones as well as in commercially deployed networks worldwide. On the UE side, we identified a recent 5G baseband chipset from a major manufacturer that allows for fallback to weak, unannounced modes and verified it experimentally. On the MNO side -- among others -- we identified 13 operators (totaling an estimated 140 million subscribers) on three continents that all use the same globally static set of ten private keys, serving them at random. Those not-so-private keys allow the decryption of the shared keys of every VoWiFi user of all those operators. All these operators deployed their core network from one common manufacturer.</description>
