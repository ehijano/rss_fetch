      <title>Transabdominal Fetal Oximetry via Diffuse Optics: Principled Analysis and Demonstration in Pregnant Ovine Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffuse optics has the potential to offer a substantial advancement in fetal health monitoring via enabling continuous measurement of fetal blood oxygen saturation (fSpO$_2$). Aiming to enhance the sensing accuracy and to elucidate the foundational limits of Transabdominal Fetal Oximetry (TFO) via diffuse optics, we introduce a theoretical derivation, and a comprehensive pipeline for fSpO$_2$ estimation from non-invasively sensed diffuse light intensity values, which are leveraged to analyze datasets obtained through both simulations and in-vivo experiments in gold standard large animal model of pregnancy. We propose the Exponential Pulsation Ratio (EPR) as a key feature, and develop machine-learning models to fuse the information collected across multiple detectors. Our proposed method demonstrates a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.81% and 6.85% with a Pearson's r correlation of 0.81 (p&lt;0.001) and 0.71 (p&lt;0.001) for estimation of fSpO$_2$ in simulated dataset and in-vivo dataset, respectively. Across both datasets, our method outperforms the existing approaches, enhancing the accuracy of the fSpO$_2$ estimation and demonstrates its viability as a supplemental technology for intrapartum fetal monitoring.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Vendi score in genomic epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vendi score (VS), a diversity metric recently conceived in the context of machine learning, with applications in a wide range of fields, has a few distinct advantages over the metrics commonly used in ecology. It is classification-independent, incorporates abundance information, and has a tunable sensitivity to rare/abundant types. Using rich COVID-19 sequence data as a paradigm, we develop methods for applying the VS to time-resolved sequence data. We show how the VS allows for characterization of the overall diversity of circulating viruses and for discernment of emerging variants prior to formal identification. Furthermore, applying the VS to phylogenetic trees provides a convenient overview of within-clade diversity which can aid viral variant detection.</description>

      <title>Simulation of snakes using vertical body bending to traverse terrain with large height variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Snake moves across various terrains by bending its elongated body. Recent studies discovered that snakes can use vertical bending to traverse terrain of large height variation, such as horizontally oriented cylinders, a wedge (Jurestovsky, Usher, Astley, 2021, J. Exp. Biol.), and uneven terrain (Fu &amp; Li, 2020, Roy. Soc. Open Sci.; Fu, Astley, Li, 2022 Bioinspiration &amp; Biomimetics). Here, to understand how vertical bending generates propulsion, we developed a dynamic simulation of a snake traversing a wedge (height = 0.05 body length, slope = 27 degrees) and a half cylindrical obstacle (height = 0.1 body length). By propagating down the body an internal torque profile with a maximum around the obstacle, the simulated snake moved forward as observed in the animal. Remarkably, even when frictional drag is low (snake-terrain kinetic friction coefficient of 0.20), the body must push against the wedge with a pressure 5 times that from body weight to generate sufficient forward propulsion to move forward. This indicated that snakes are highly capable of bending vertically to push against the environment to generate propulsion. Testing different controllers revealed that contact force feedback further helps generate and maintain propulsion effectively under unknown terrain perturbations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Indicators of Adherence and Retention in Digital Health Studies: A Longitudinal Observational Analysis from the Brighten Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Effective use of mobile health technologies requires high participant adherence and retention. However, remote digital health studies often face high attrition and low adherence, potentially introducing bias and limiting generalizability. Objective: This study aims to identify longitudinal indicators of participant retention and adherence to develop strategies for improving data collection in digital health studies and understanding how cohorts are shaped by participant withdrawal and non-adherence. Methods: We conducted analyses on the Brighten study, a smartphone-based randomized controlled trial evaluating apps for depression treatment. Participants were asked to complete seven digital questionnaires regularly. Outcomes included adherence (questionnaire completion), engagement (post-baseline participation), and retention (continued participation over time). We analyzed relationships between these outcomes, static factors (e.g., demographics, average questionnaire scores) and dynamic factors (e.g., questionnaire score changes over time). Results: Of 2,201 participants, 1,093 completed at least one non-baseline questionnaire (median completion rate: 37.6%). Adherence was higher among participants with lower average depression severity (P&lt;.001) and those perceiving improvement (P=.001). Demographic factors significantly influenced adherence and engagement. Participants with greater baseline depressive symptoms were more likely to withdraw before completing non-baseline questionnaires (t=-2.53, P=.01). However, symptom improvement was linked to better adherence (U=127,084; P&lt;.001) and retention (HR=0.78, P=.002). Conclusion: Clinical trajectories and perceived improvements in depressive symptoms are key indicators of engagement, adherence, and retention. These findings may enhance data interpretation and inform strategies to boost retention and adherence in future trials.</description>

      <title>Universal scale-free representations in human visual cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How does the human brain encode complex visual information? While previous research has characterized individual dimensions of visual representation in cortex, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how visual information is organized across the full range of neural population activity. Here, analyzing fMRI responses to natural scenes across multiple individuals, we discover that neural representations in human visual cortex follow a remarkably consistent scale-free organization -- their variance systematically decays as a power law, detected across four orders of magnitude of latent dimensions. This scale-free structure appears consistently across multiple visual regions and across individuals, suggesting it reflects a fundamental organizing principle of visual processing. Critically, when we align neural responses across individuals using hyperalignment, we find that these representational dimensions are largely shared between people, revealing a universal high-dimensional spectrum of visual information that emerges despite individual differences in brain anatomy and visual experience. Traditional analysis approaches in cognitive neuroscience have focused primarily on a small number of high-variance dimensions, potentially missing crucial aspects of visual representation. Our results demonstrate that visual information is distributed across the full dimensionality of cortical activity in a systematic way, suggesting we need to move beyond low-dimensional characterizations to fully understand how the brain represents the visual world. This work reveals a new fundamental principle of neural coding in human visual cortex and highlights the importance of examining neural representations across their full dimensionality.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Framework for Co-Mediators of Zero-Inflated Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed molecular profiling at the individual cell level. However, integrating high-dimensional single-cell data into causal mediation analysis remains challenging due to zero inflation and complex mediator structures. We propose a novel mediation framework leveraging zero-inflated negative binomial models to characterize cell-level mediator distributions and beta regression for zero-inflation proportions. The model can identify expression level as well as expressed proportion that could mediate disease-leading causal pathway. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate improved power and controlled false discovery rates. We further illustrate the utility of this approach through application to ROSMAP single-cell transcriptomic data, uncovering biologically meaningful mediation effects that enhance understanding of disease mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Lightweight MSA Design Advances Protein Folding From Evolutionary Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein structure prediction often hinges on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), which underperform on low-homology and orphan proteins. We introduce PLAME, a lightweight MSA design framework that leverages evolutionary embeddings from pretrained protein language models to generate MSAs that better support downstream folding. PLAME couples these embeddings with a conservation--diversity loss that balances agreement on conserved positions with coverage of plausible sequence variation. Beyond generation, we develop (i) an MSA selection strategy to filter high-quality candidates and (ii) a sequence-quality metric that is complementary to depth-based measures and predictive of folding gains. On AlphaFold2 low-homology/orphan benchmarks, PLAME delivers state-of-the-art improvements in structure accuracy (e.g., lDDT/TM-score), with consistent gains when paired with AlphaFold3. Ablations isolate the benefits of the selection strategy, and case studies elucidate how MSA characteristics shape AlphaFold confidence and error modes. Finally, we show PLAME functions as a lightweight adapter, enabling ESMFold to approach AlphaFold2-level accuracy while retaining ESMFold-like inference speed. PLAME thus provides a practical path to high-quality folding for proteins lacking strong evolutionary neighbors.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Neural Networks for Windkessel Parameter Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK) parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly, when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by noise.</description>
