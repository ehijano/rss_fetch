      <title>Regimes of Steady-State Turbulence in a Quantum Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to model the development of turbulence in a quantum fluid confined by a cuboid box potential, and forced by shaking along one axis. We observe the development of isotropic turbulence from anisotropic forcing for a broad range of forcing amplitudes, and characterise the states through their Fourier spectra, vortex distributions, and spatial correlations. For weak forcing the steady-state wave-action spectrum exhibits a $k^{-3.5}$ scaling over wavenumber $k$; further decomposition uncovers the same power law in both compressible kinetic energy and quantum pressure, while the bulk superfluid remains phase coherent and free from extended vortices. As the forcing energy exceeds the chemical potential, extended vortices develop in the bulk, disrupting the $k^{-3.5}$ scaling. The spectrum then transitions to a $k^{-7/3}$ regime for compressible kinetic energy only, associated with dense vortex turbulence, and phase coherence limited to the healing length. The strong forcing regime is consistent with an inverse cascade of compressible energy driven by small-scale vortex annihilation.</description>

      <title>Observation of Shapiro steps in an ultracold atomic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current-voltage characteristic of a driven superconducting Josephson junction displays discrete steps. This phenomenon, discovered by Sydney Shapiro, forms today's voltage standard. Here, we report the observation of Shapiro steps in a driven Josephson junction in a gas of ultracold atoms. We demonstrate that the steps exhibit universal features, and provide key insight into the microscopic dissipative dynamics that we directly observe in the experiment. Most importantly, the steps are directly connected to phonon emission and soliton nucleation. The experimental results are underpinned by extensive numerical simulations based on classical-field dynamics and represent the transfer of the voltage standard to the realm of ultracold quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Medium-enhanced polaron repulsion in a dilute Bose mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental problem of a small density of bosonic impurities immersed in a dilute Bose gas at zero temperature. Within the perturbative regime of weak interactions, we show that the presence of the surrounding medium can lead to an enhanced repulsion between dressed bosonic impurities (polarons) rather than an induced attraction, in contrast to prevailing theories. Moreover, we find that the induced polaron-polaron interactions only become attractive when the impurity-boson interactions are sufficiently strong that the system is unstable towards either phase separation or collapse/droplet formation. Our work highlights the role of polaron condensation in polaron-polaron interactions, and it has important implications for theories of induced interactions in general.</description>

      <title>Shapiro steps in strongly-interacting Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of Shapiro steps in a periodically driven Josephson junction between strongly-interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. We observe quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics, the height and width of which mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations, overall providing a clear understanding of Shapiro dynamics in atomic Fermi superfluids. Our work demonstrates phase-coherent and synchronization effects in driven strongly-interacting superfluids, opening prospects for studying emergent non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems under external drives.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Nonlinear Thouless Pumping of Temporal Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and soliton is a central topic in nonlinear topological physics. So far, most studies have been confined to conservative settings. Here, we explore Thouless pumping of dissipative temporal solitons in a nonconservative one-dimensional optical system with gain and spectral filtering, described by the paradigmatic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Two dissipatively induced nonlinear topological phase transitions are identified. First, when varying dissipative parameters across a threshold, the soliton transitions from being trapped in time to quantized drifting. This quantized temporal drift remains robust, even as the system evolves from a single-soliton state into multi-soliton state. Second, a dynamically emergent phase transition is found: the soliton is arrested until a critical point of its evolution, where a transition to topological drift occurs. Both phenomena uniquely arise from the dynamical interplay of dissipation, nonlinearity and topology.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits based on topological pumping in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis of digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate between nearest neighbours, many circuits require non-local connectivity, necessitating some form of quantum information transport, such as the repeated application of SWAP gates or qubit shuttling. Preserving motional coherence during such transport remains a key challenge to improve gate fidelity and qubit connectivity, as well as to connect local fermionic modes. Here we combine tuneable gate operations between fermionic potassium-40 atoms - based on superexchange interaction - with their bidirectional transport via topological Thouless pumping in an optical lattice. We demonstrate shuttling of atomic singlet pairs with a single-shift fidelity of 99.57(4)% over 50 lattice sites. We spatially and coherently split a large number of randomly distributed fermionic spin singlet pairs and show $($SWAP$)^\alpha$-gate operations between atoms encountering each other during transport. As a signature of entanglement between fermions separated over large distances and interwoven with each other, we observe multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Topological pumping is generally applicable to long-lived atomic and molecular states, and specifically overcomes lifetime limitations inherent to transport using state-dependent optical lattices. Our work opens up new avenues for transport of quantum information and offers unprecedented possibilities for engineering connectivity in quantum circuits, including approaches based on fermionic modes, as well as for atom interferometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions offer long coherence times and high fidelity, programmable quantum operations, making them a promising platform for quantum simulation of condensed matter systems, quantum dynamics, and problems related to high-energy physics. We review selected developments in trapped-ion qubits and architectures and discuss quantum simulation applications that utilize these emerging capabilities. This review emphasizes developments in digital (gate-based) quantum simulations that exploit trapped-ion hardware capabilities, such as flexible qubit connectivity, selective mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedback, to simulate models with long-range interactions, explore non-unitary dynamics, compress simulations of states with limited entanglement, and reduce the circuit depths required to prepare or simulate long-range entangled states.</description>

      <title>Towards scalable bound-to-resonance extrapolations for few- and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In open quantum many-body systems, the theoretical description of resonant states of many particles strongly coupled to the continuum can be challenging. Such states are commonplace in, for example, exotic nuclei and hadrons, and can reveal important information about the underlying forces at play in these systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the complex-augmented eigenvector continuation (CA-EC) method, originally formulated for the two-body problem with uniform complex scaling, can reliably perform bound-to-resonance extrapolations for genuine three-body resonances having no bound subsystems. We first establish that three-body bound-to-resonance extrapolations are possible by benchmarking different few-body approaches, and we provide arguments to explain how the extrapolation works in the many-body case. We furthermore pave the way towards scalable resonance extrapolations in many-body systems by showing that the CA-EC method also works in the Berggren basis, studying a realistic application using the Gamow shell model.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated quantum gates in trapped ions coupled to an ultracold atomic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of phonon-mediated qubit-qubit interactions between trapped ions in the presence of an ultracold atomic gas. By deriving and solving a master equation to describe the combined system, we show that the presence of the atoms causes the quantum gate quality to reduce because of motional decoherence. On the other hand, we calculate that the gas may be used to keep the ion crystal cold in the presence of external heating due to electric field noise. We show that tuning the atom-ion scattering length allows to tune the cooling rate of the ions and would make it possible to temporarily reduce the effects of the gas during a quantum gate while keeping the ions cold over long timescales. In this way, the trapped ion quantum computer may be buffer gas cooled. The system may also be used for quantum-enhanced measurements of the atom-ion interactions or properties of the atomic bath.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: Simulating Fermions, Bosons, and Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid oscillator-qubit processor framework for quantum simulation of strongly correlated fermions and bosons that avoids the boson-to-qubit mapping overhead encountered in qubit hardware. This framework gives exact decompositions of particle interactions such as density-density terms and gauge-invariant hopping, as well as approximate methods based on the Baker-Campbell Hausdorff formulas including the magnetic field term for the $U(1)$ quantum link model in $(2+1)$D. We use this framework to show how to simulate dynamics using Trotterisation, perform ancilla-free partial error detection using Gauss's law, measure non-local observables, estimate ground state energies using a oscillator-qubit variational quantum eigensolver as well as quantum signal processing, and we numerically study the influence of hardware errors in circuit QED experiments. To show the advantages over all-qubit hardware, we perform an end-to-end comparison of the gate complexity for the gauge-invariant hopping term and find an improvement of the asymptotic scaling with the boson number cutoff $S$ from $\mathcal{O}(\log(S)^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in our framework as well as, for bosonic matter, a constant factor improvement of better than $10^4$. We also find an improvement from $\mathcal{O}(\log(S))$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for the $U(1)$ magnetic field term. While our work focusses on an implementation in superconducting hardware, our framework can also be used in trapped ion, and neutral atom hardware. This work establishes digital quantum simulation with hybrid oscillator-qubit hardware as a viable and advantageous method for the study of qubit-boson models in materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict a rich excitation spectrum of a binary dipolar supersolid in a linear crystal geometry, where the ground state consists of two partially immiscible components with alternating, interlocking domains. We identify three Goldstone branches, each with first-sound, second-sound or spin-sound character. In analogy with a diatomic crystal, the resulting lattice has a two-domain primitive basis and we find that the crystal (first-sound-like) branch is split into optical and acoustic phonons. We also find a spin-Higgs branch that is associated with the supersolid modulation amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the relaxation dynamics in an open system, composed by a quantum gas of bosons in a lattice interacting via both contact and global interactions. We report the onset of periodic oscillations of the atomic coherences exhibiting hallmarks of synchronization after a quantum quench. The dynamical behavior exhibits the many-body collapse and revival of atomic coherences and emerges from the interplay of the quantum dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate) strong symmetry in the dissipative system. We further show that the approximate symmetry can dynamically self-organize. We argue that the approximate symmetry can be tailored to obtain long-lived coherences. These insights provide a general recipe to engineer the dynamics of globally-interacting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices, mean-field energy can support the existence of period-doubled density waves, which are similar to Bloch waves but have the double periodicity of the underlying lattice potentials. However, they are dynamically unstable. Here, we propose to use the spin-orbit coupling to stabilize the period-doubled density waves. The stabilization mechanism is revealed to relate to interaction-induced spontaneous symmetry breaking of the spin-flip parity symmetry.</description>

      <title>Topological floating phase of dipolar bosons in an optical ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar hard-core bosons in optical ladders provide exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of anisotropic XXZ spin ladders. We show that introducing a tilt along the rungs results in a rich phase diagram at unit filling. In particular, for a sufficiently strong dipolar strength, the interplay between the long-range tail of the dipolar interactions and the tilting leads to the emergence of a quantum floating phase, a critical phase with incommensurate density-density correlations. Interestingly, the study of the entanglement spectrum, reveals that the floating phase is topological, constituting an intermediate gapless stage in the melting of a crystal into a gapped topological Haldane phase. This novel scenario for topological floating phases in dipolar XXZ ladders can be investigated in on-going experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resource-efficient quantum state tomography is one of the key ingredients of future quantum technologies. In this work, we propose a new tomography protocol combining standard quantum state reconstruction methods with an attention-based neural network architecture. We show how the proposed protocol is able to improve the averaged fidelity reconstruction over linear inversion and maximum-likelihood estimation in the finite-statistics regime, reducing at least by an order of magnitude the amount of necessary training data. We demonstrate the potential use of our protocol in physically relevant scenarios, in particular, to certify metrological resources in the form of many-body entanglement generated during the spin squeezing protocols. This could be implemented with the current quantum simulator platforms, such as trapped ions, and ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Magnetic correlations of a doped and frustrated Hubbard model: benchmarking the two-particle self-consistent theory against a quantum simulator</title>

Abstract: Recently a quantum simulator for the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice has been realized, where both geometrical frustration and doping can be continuously tuned. Here we provide a comprehensive comparison between the magnetic correlations calculated by the two-particle self-consistent (TPSC) theory and those measured in this quantum simulator, at temperatures comparable to the spin exchange energy and Hubbard interactions comparable to the bandwidth. We find overall excellent agreements between the TPSC calculations and the measurements from the quantum simulator at all levels of frustration and doping. This is quite remarkable considering that the Hubbard model is already in the intermediate to strong coupling regime, for which very few methods yield reliable results. Our work showcases the potential of TPSC as a theoretical approach capable of providing reasonably accurate descriptions of the Hubbard model even at fairly strong interactions and when the frustration is present.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Spin-up: 3D Simulations of Post-Glitch Dynamics in Neutron Star Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a neutron star after a glitch involve the transfer of angular momentum from the crust (where the glitch is presumed to originate) to the liquid core, causing the core to spin up. The crust-core coupling, which determines how quickly this spin-up proceeds, can be achieved through various physical processes, including Ekman pumping, superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction, and magnetic fields. Although the complex nature of these mechanisms has made it difficult to study their combined effects, analytical estimations for individual processes reveal that spin-up timescales vary according to the relative strength of Coriolis, viscous, and mutual friction forces, as well as the magnetic field. However, experimental and numerical validations of those analytical predictions are limited. In this paper, we focus on viscous effects and mutual friction. We conduct non-linear hydrodynamical simulations of the spin-up problem in a two-component fluid by solving the incompressible Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) equations in the full sphere (i.e., including $r=0$) for the first time. We find that the viscous (normal) component accelerates due to Ekman pumping, although the mutual friction coupling to the superfluid component alters the spin-up dynamics compared to the single-fluid scenario. Close to the sphere's surface, the response of the superfluid is accurately described by the mutual friction timescale irrespective of its coupling strength with the normal component. However, as we move deeper into the sphere, the superfluid accelerates on different timescales due to the slow viscous spin-up of the internal normal fluid layers. We discuss potential implications for neutron stars and requirements for future work to build more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Generalised BBGKY hierarchy for near-integrable dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum or classical many-body Hamiltonian systems, whose dynamics is given by an integrable, contact interactions, plus another, possibly long-range, generic two-body potential. We show how the dynamics of local observables is given in terms of a generalised version of Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy, which we denote as gBBGKY, which is built for the densities, and their correlations, of the quasiparticles of the underlying integrable model. Unlike the usual cases of perturbation theory from free gases, the presence of local interactions in the integrable model "lifts" the so-called kinetic blocking, and the second layer of the hierarchy reproduces the dynamics at all time-scales. The latter consists of a fast pre-equilibration to a non-thermal steady state, and its subsequent thermalisation to a Gibbs ensemble. We show how the final relaxation is encoded into a Boltzmann scattering integral involving three or higher body-scatterings, and which, remarkably, is entirely determined by the diffusion constants of the underlying integrable model. We check our results with exact molecular dynamics simulations, finding perfect agreement. Our results show how gBBGKY can be successfully employed in quantum systems to compute scattering integrals and Fermi's golden rule transition rates.</description>
