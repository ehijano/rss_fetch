      <title>Binary Hypothesis Testing-Based Low-Complexity Beamspace Channel Estimation for mmWave Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications have gained attention as a key technology for high-capacity wireless systems, owing to the wide available bandwidth. However, mmWave signals suffer from their inherent characteristics such as severe path loss, poor scattering, and limited diffraction, which necessitate the use of large antenna arrays and directional beamforming, typically implemented through massive MIMO architectures. Accurate channel estimation is critical in such systems, but its computational complexity increases proportionally with the number of antennas. This may become a significant burden in mmWave systems where channels exhibit rapid fluctuations and require frequent updates. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel denoiser based on Bayesian binary hypothesis testing and beamspace sparsity. By modeling each sparse beamspace component as a mixture of signal and noise under a Bernoulli-complex Gaussian prior, we formulate a likelihood ratio test to detect signal-relevant elements. Then, a hard-thresholding rule is applied to suppress noise-dominant components in the noisy channel vector. Despite its extremely low computational complexity, the proposed method achieves channel estimation accuracy that is comparable to that of complex iterative or learning-based approaches. This effectiveness is supported by both theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, suggesting that the method can be a viable option for mmWave systems with strict resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Decentralized Resource Optimization for Cell-Free ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for 6G wireless networks, allowing the joint use of spectrum and infrastructure for both communication and sensing. While prior ISAC solutions have addressed resource optimization, including power allocation, beamforming, and waveform design, they often rely on centralized architectures with full network knowledge, limiting their scalability in distributed systems. In this paper, we propose two coordinated decentralized optimization algorithms for beamforming and power allocation tailored to cell-free ISAC networks. The first algorithm employs locally designed fixed beamformers at access points (APs), combined with a centralized power allocation scheme computed at a central server (CS). The second algorithm jointly optimizes beamforming and power control through a fully decentralized consensus ADMM framework. Both approaches rely on local information at APs and limited coordination with the CS. Simulation results obtained using our proposed Python-based simulation framework evaluate their fronthaul overhead and system-level performance, demonstrating their practicality for scalable ISAC deployment in decentralized, cell-free architectures.</description>

      <title>On the Characterization and Evaluation of Doppler Squint in Wideband ODDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation has been demonstrated to enjoy excellent reliability over doubly-dispersive channels. However, most of the prior analysis tends to ignore the interactive dispersion caused by the wideband property of ODDM signal, which possibly leads to performance degradation. To solve this problem, we investigate the input-output relation of ODDM systems considering the wideband effect, which is also known as the Doppler squint effect (DSE) in the literature. The extra delay-Doppler (DD) dispersion caused by the DSE is first explicitly explained by employing the time-variant frequency response of multipath channels. Its characterization is then derived for both reduced cyclic prefix (RCP) and zero padded (ZP)-based wideband ODDM systems, where the extra DD spread and more complicated power leakage outside the peak region are presented theoretically. Numerical results are finally provided to confirm the significance of DSE. The derivations in this paper are beneficial for developing accurate signal processing techniques in ODDM-based integrated sensing and communication systems.</description>

      <title>DIY hybrid SSVEP-P300 LED stimuli for BCI platform using EMOTIV EEG headset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully customisable chip-on board (COB) LED design to evoke two brain responses simultaneously (steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and transient evoked potential, P300) is discussed in this paper. Considering different possible modalities in braincomputer interfacing (BCI), SSVEP is widely accepted as it requires a lesser number of electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes and minimal training time. The aim of this work was to produce a hybrid BCI hardware platform to evoke SSVEP and P300 precisely with reduced fatigue and improved classification performance. The system comprises of four independent radial green visual stimuli controlled individually by a 32-bit microcontroller platform to evoke SSVEP and four red LEDs flashing at random intervals to generate P300 events. The system can also record the P300 event timestamps that can be used in classification, to improve the accuracy and reliability. The hybrid stimulus was tested for realtime classification accuracy by controlling a LEGO robot to move in four directions.</description>

      <title>Balancing Latency and Model Accuracy for Fluid Antenna-Assisted LM-Embedded MIMO Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of large model (LM)-embedded wireless network for handling the trade-off problem of model accuracy and network latency. To guarantee a high-quality of users' service, the network latency should be minimized while maintaining an acceptable inference accuracy. To meet this requirement, LM quantization is proposed to reduce the latency. However, the excessive quantization may destroy the accuracy of LM inference. To this end, a promising fluid antenna (FA) technology is investigated for enhancing the transmission capacity, leading to a lower network latency in the LM-embedded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network. To design the FA-assisted LM-embedded network with the lower latency and higher accuracy requirements, the latency and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) are considered in the objective function. Then, an efficient optimization algorithm is proposed under the block coordinate descent framework. Simulation results are provided to show the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm, and the performance gains from the proposed FA-assisted LMembedded network over the other benchmark networks in terms of network latency and PSNR.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sensing with Deep Clustering: Label-Free Radio Access Technology Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of the number of connected devices and network densification is driving an increasing demand for radio network resources, particularly Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum. Given the dynamic and complex nature of contemporary wireless environments, characterized by a wide variety of devices and multiple RATs, spectrum sensing is envisioned to become a building component of future 6G, including as a component within O-RAN or digital twins. However, the current SotA research for RAT classification predominantly revolves around supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach that require extensive labeled dataset. Due to this, it is unclear how existing models behave in environments for which training data is unavailable thus leaving open questions regarding their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a new spectrum sensing workflow in which the model training does not require any prior knowledge of the RATs transmitting in that area (i.e. no labelled data) and the class assignment can be easily done through manual mapping. Furthermore, we adapt a SSL deep clustering architecture capable of autonomously extracting spectrum features from raw 1D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) data. We evaluate the proposed architecture on three real-world datasets from three European cities, in the 868 MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5.9 GHz bands containing over 10 RATs and show that the developed model achieves superior performance by up to 35 percentage points with 22% fewer trainable parameters and 50% less floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) compared to an SotA AE-based reference architecture.</description>

      <title>ModFus-DM: Explore the Representation in Modulated Signal Diffusion Generated Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is essential for wireless communication systems in both military and civilian applications. However, existing deep learning-based AMC methods often require large labeled signals and struggle with non-fixed signal lengths, distribution shifts, and limited labeled signals. To address these challenges, we propose a modulation-driven feature fusion via diffusion model (ModFus-DM), a novel unsupervised AMC framework that leverages the generative capacity of diffusion models for robust modulation representation learning. We design a modulated signal diffusion generation model (MSDGM) to implicitly capture structural and semantic information through a progressive denoising process. Additionally, we propose the diffusion-aware feature fusion (DAFFus) module, which adaptively aggregates multi-scale diffusion features to enhance discriminative representation. Extensive experiments on RML2016.10A, RML2016.10B, RML2018.01A and RML2022 datasets demonstrate that ModFus-DM significantly outperforms existing methods in various challenging scenarios, such as limited-label settings, distribution shifts, variable-length signal recognition and channel fading scenarios. Notably, ModFus-DM achieves over 88.27% accuracy in 24-type recognition tasks at SNR $\geq $ 12dB with only 10 labeled signals per type.</description>

      <title>FAS Enabled UAV for Energy-Efficient WPCNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents an innovative scheme to enhance the communication rate and energy efficiency (EE) of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) by deploying the emerging fluid antenna system (FAS) technology onto the UAV. Our proposed approach leverages the dynamic port switching capability of FAS, enabling the UAV to adaptively select the optimal antenna location that maximizes channel gain for both downlink wireless power transfer (WPT) and uplink wireless data transfer (WDT). We derive both exact analytical expression of the ergodic spectral rate, and asymptotic expression at high signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime under Nakagami-m correlated fading channels. The Mont-Carlo simulation results confirms the accuracy of the analytical expressions and demonstrate the substantial increase in energy efficiency of UAV with FAS compared to fixed antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical Multiport-Network Modeling and Efficient Discrete Optimization of RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter fills the research gap on physics-consistent optimization for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with mutual coupling (MC) and 1-bit-tunable elements, a common hardware constraint in existing RIS prototypes. We compare a model-based method (temperature-annealed back-propagation) and model-agnostic methods (coordinate descent, genetic algorithm), and evaluate potential benefits of intelligently initializing these methods. To facilitate our evaluation, we introduce a technique for generating statistical ensembles of multiport-network model parameters, wherein a single hyper-parameter adjusts the MC strength. The technique is a generalization of Rayleigh fading to radio environments with deterministic programmability, and it accounts for passivity constraints as well as the coherent-backscattering effect. We find that, except when MC is negligible, coordinate descent with random initialization yields the most favorable trade-off in terms of performance, execution time and memory usage. We expect our findings to extend to beyond-diagonal RIS, stacked intelligent metasurfaces, dynamic metasurface antennas, and wave-domain physical neural networks.</description>

      <title>A Heuristic Method for Simplified Resource Allocation based on Comparative Advantage in Wireless Access Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a heuristic method for simplifying resource allocation in access systems, leveraging the concept of comparative advantage to reduce computational complexity while maintaining near-optimal performance. Using power-division non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) as an example, we demonstrate how this approach mitigates the challenge of power allocation in multi-cell networks. Our method reduces the search space for optimization, significantly decreasing computational overhead while ensuring efficient spectrum utilization. In principle, the method reduces the dimensions of search space by half. Extensive analysis and simulations validate its effectiveness, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in next-generation wireless networks. The proposed framework can help streamline resource allocation in complex communication environments, enhancing system performance and scalability.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Near-Field Channel Estimation under Mutual Coupling and Spatial Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays at the base station has emerged as a key enabler for enhancing wireless network performance. However, this setup introduces high-dimensional channel matrices, leading to increased computational complexity and pilot overhead in channel estimation. Mutual coupling (MC) effects among densely packed unit cells, spatial correlation, and near-field propagation conditions further complicate the estimation process. Conventional estimators, such as linear minimum mean square error (MMSE), require channel statistics that are challenging to acquire for high-dimensional arrays, while least squares (LS) estimators suffer from performance limitations. To address these challenges, the reduced-subspace least squares (RS-LS) estimator leverages array geometry to enhance estimation accuracy. This work advances the promising RS-LS estimation algorithm by explicitly incorporating MC effects into the more realistic and challenging near-field propagation environment within the increasingly relevant generalized RIS-aided MIMO framework. Additionally, we investigate the impact of MC on the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). Our analysis reveals that accounting for MC effects provides a significant performance gain of approximately 5 dB at an SNR of 5 dB, compared to conventional methods that ignore MC.</description>

      <title>Feature Reconstruction Aided Federated Learning for Image Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research in semantic communication has garnered considerable attention, particularly in the area of image transmission, where joint source-channel coding (JSCC)-based neural network (NN) modules are frequently employed. However, these systems often experience performance degradation over time due to an outdated knowledge base, highlighting the need for periodic updates. To address this challenge in the context of training JSCC modules for image transmission, we propose a federated learning (FL) algorithm with semantic feature reconstruction (FR), named FedSFR. This algorithm more efficiently utilizes the available communication capacity by allowing some of the selected FL participants to transmit smaller feature vectors instead of local update information. Unlike conventional FL methods, our approach integrates FR at the parameter server (PS), stabilizing training and enhancing image transmission quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances both the stability and effectiveness of the FL process compared to other algorithms. Furthermore, we mathematically derive the convergence rate to validate the improved performance.</description>

      <title>Scoring ISAC: Benchmarking Integrated Sensing and Communications via Score-Based Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems, aiming to support both high-throughput communication and high-accuracy environmental sensing using shared spectrum and hardware. Theoretical performance metrics, such as mutual information (MI), minimum mean squared error (MMSE), and Bayesian Cram\'{e}r--Rao bound (BCRB), play a key role in evaluating ISAC system performance limits. However, in practice, hardware impairments, multipath propagation, interference, and scene constraints often result in nonlinear, multimodal, and non-Gaussian distributions, making it challenging to derive these metrics analytically. Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying score-based generative models to characterize these metrics from data, although not discussed for ISAC. This paper provides a tutorial-style summary of recent advances in score-based performance evaluation, with a focus on ISAC systems. We refer to the summarized framework as scoring ISAC, which not only reflects the core methodology based on score functions but also emphasizes the goal of scoring (i.e., evaluating) ISAC systems under realistic conditions. We present the connections between classical performance metrics and the score functions and provide the practical training techniques for learning score functions to estimate performance metrics. Proof-of-concept experiments on target detection and localization validate the accuracy of score-based performance estimators against ground-truth analytical expressions, illustrating their ability to replicate and extend traditional analyses in more complex, realistic settings. This framework demonstrates the great potential of score-based generative models in ISAC performance analysis, algorithm design, and system optimization.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Algorithms for Contactless Cardiac Feature Extraction from Radar Signals: Advances and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contactless cardiac monitoring has vast potential to replace contact-based monitoring in various future scenarios such as smart home and in-cabin monitoring. Various contactless sensors can be potentially implemented for cardiac monitoring, such as cameras, acoustic sensors, Wi-Fi routers and radars. Among all these sensors, radar could achieve unobtrusive monitoring with high accuracy and robustness at the same time. The research about radar-based cardiac monitoring can be generally divided into the radar architecture design and signal-processing parts, where the former has been thoroughly reviewed in the literature but not the latter. To the best of the author knowledge, this is the first review paper that focuses on elaborating the algorithms for extracting cardiac features from the received radar signal. In addition, a new taxonomy is proposed to reveal the core feature of each algorithm, with the pros and cons evaluated in detail. Furthermore, the public datasets containing the received radar signal and ground-truth cardiac feature signal are listed with detailed configurations, and the corresponding evaluations may help the researchers select the suitable dataset. At last, several unsolved challenges and future directions are suggested and discussed in detail to encourage future research on solving the main obstacles in this field. In summary, this review can be served as a guide for researchers and practitioners to quickly understand the research trend and recent development of the cardiac feature extraction algorithms, and it is worth further investigating the relative area based on the proposed challenges and future directions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Broad Beam Beamforming for Collocated and Distributed MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad beam beamforming (BF) design in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) can be convenient for initial access, synchronization, and sensing capabilities in cellular networks by avoiding overheads of sweeping methods while making efficient use of resources. Phase-only BF is key for maximizing power efficiency across antennas. A successful method to produce broad beams is the phase-only dual-polarization BF (DPBF). However, its efficiency has not been proved in non-line-of-sight (NLoS). Therefore, this paper contributes by evaluating DPBF in collocated and distributed MIMO configurations under both line-of-sight (LoS) and NLoS channel conditions. We model the reflection coefficients for different materials in NLoS conditions and propose the use of orthogonal space-time block code to improve the coverage compared to the DPBF in collocated MIMO (C-MIMO). We further propose a DPBF method for distributed MIMO and show that it achieves better coverage than C-MIMO with DPBF.</description>

      <title>The ECME Algorithm Using Factor Analysis for DOA Estimation in Nonuniform Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum likelihood factor analysis has been used for direction of arrival estimation in unknown nonuniform noise and some iterative approaches have been developed. In particular, the Factor Analysis for Anisotropic Noise (FAAN) method proposed by Stoica and Babu has excellent convergence properties. In this letter, the Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm, an extension of the expectation-maximization algorithm, is designed, which has almost the same computational complexity at each iteration as the FAAN method. However, numerical results show that the ECME algorithm yields faster stable convergence and is computationally more efficient.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Phase-Shifted Pilot Design for Uplink Multiple Access in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, pilot signal design is crucial for enabling accurate channel estimation and reliable radar sensing. In orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based frameworks, conventional pilot allocation schemes face a trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and sensing performance. Interleaved pilots improve user equipment (UE) multiplexing through sparse allocation but reduce the maximum unambiguous range. Conversely, orthogonal block-based pilots reduce range ambiguity but degrade sensing resolution due to limited delay granularity. To address this trade-off, the phase-shifted ISAC (PS-ISAC) scheme was recently proposed for uplink multiple access in ISAC systems. However, PS-ISAC suffers from spectral inefficiency due to the fixed cyclic prefix (CP) constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose adaptive phase-shifted-ISAC (APS-ISAC), an enhanced pilot scheme that employs an overlapped block-pilot structure with UE-specific phase shifts determined by maximum excess delay of each UE. This design enables UEs to share the same time-frequency resources while preserving separable and contiguous channel impulse responses (CIRs) at the base station (BS). Simulation results show that APS-ISAC significantly outperforms conventional pilot allocation methods in terms of SE, approximately doubling the number of multiplexed UEs. It also achieves lower mean square error (MSE) under power constraints with reduced complexity. Furthermore, it yields maximum range resolution and unambiguous sensing performance. These results establish APS-ISAC as a scalable, spectrally efficient, ambiguity-resilient, and low-complexity pilot design paradigm for future uplink ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting and measuring respiratory events in horses during exercise with a microphone: deep learning vs. standard signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring respiration parameters such as respiratory rate could be beneficial to understand the impact of training on equine health and performance and ultimately improve equine welfare. In this work, we compare deep learning-based methods to an adapted signal processing method to automatically detect cyclic respiratory events and extract the dynamic respiratory rate from microphone recordings during high intensity exercise in Standardbred trotters. Our deep learning models are able to detect exhalation sounds (median F1 score of 0.94) in noisy microphone signals and show promising results on unlabelled signals at lower exercising intensity, where the exhalation sounds are less recognisable. Temporal convolutional networks were better at detecting exhalation events and estimating dynamic respiratory rates (median F1: 0.94, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) $\pm$ Confidence Intervals (CI): 1.44$\pm$1.04 bpm, Limits Of Agreements (LOA): 0.63$\pm$7.06 bpm) than long short-term memory networks (median F1: 0.90, MAE$\pm$CI: 3.11$\pm$1.58 bpm) and signal processing methods (MAE$\pm$CI: 2.36$\pm$1.11 bpm). This work is the first to automatically detect equine respiratory sounds and automatically compute dynamic respiratory rates in exercising horses. In the future, our models will be validated on lower exercising intensity sounds and different microphone placements will be evaluated in order to find the best combination for regular monitoring.</description>

      <title>Toward a reliable PWM-based light-emitting diode visual stimulus for improved SSVEP response with minimal visual fatigue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints. Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95% generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of SSVEP for practical applications.</description>

      <title>The Role of Review Process Failures in Affective State Estimation: An Empirical Investigation of DEAP Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability of affective state estimation using EEG data is in question, given the variability in reported performance and the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. To investigate this, we reviewed 101 studies, focusing on the widely used DEAP dataset for emotion recognition. Our analysis revealed widespread methodological issues that include data leakage from improper segmentation, biased feature selection, flawed hyperparameter optimization, neglect of class imbalance, and insufficient methodological reporting. Notably, we found that nearly 87% of the reviewed papers contained one or more of these errors. Moreover, through experimental analysis, we observed that such methodological flaws can inflate the classification accuracy by up to 46%. These findings reveal fundamental gaps in standardized evaluation practices and highlight critical deficiencies in the peer review process for machine learning applications in neuroscience, emphasizing the urgent need for stricter methodological standards and evaluation protocols.</description>

      <title>Secure Energy Efficient Wireless Transmission: A Finite v/s Infinite-Horizon RL Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a joint optimal allocation of transmit power at the source and jamming power at the destination is proposed to maximize the average secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of a wireless network within a finite time duration. The destination transmits the jamming signal to improve secrecy by utilizing full-duplex capability. The source and destination both have energy harvesting (EH) capability with limited battery capacity. Due to the Markov nature of the system, the problem is formulated as a finite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) problem. We propose the finite-horizon joint power allocation (FHJPA) algorithm for the finite-horizon RL problem and compare it with a low-complexity greedy algorithm (GA). An infinite-horizon joint power allocation (IHJPA) algorithm is also proposed for the corresponding infinite-horizon problem. A comparative analysis of these algorithms is carried out in terms of SEE, expected total transmitted secure bits, and computational complexity. The results show that the FHJPA algorithm outperforms the GA and IHJPA algorithms due to its appropriate modelling in finite horizon transmission. When the source node battery has sufficient energy, the GA can yield performance close to the FHJPA algorithm despite its low-complexity. When the transmission time horizon increases, the accuracy of the infinite-horizon model improves, resulting in a reduced performance gap between FHJPA and IHJPA algorithms. The computational time comparison shows that the FHJPA algorithm takes $16.6$ percent less time than the IHJPA algorithm.</description>

      <title>Inverse harmonic clustering for multi-pitch estimation: an optimal transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of multi-pitch estimation, i.e., identifying super-imposed truncated harmonic series from noisy measurements. We phrase this as recovering a harmonically-structured measure on the unit circle, where the structure is enforced using regularizers based on optimal transport theory. In the resulting framework, a signal's spectral content is simultaneously inferred and assigned, or transported, to a small set of harmonic series defined by their corresponding fundamental frequencies. In contrast to existing methods from the compressed sensing paradigm, the proposed framework decouples regularization and dictionary design and mitigates coherency problems. As a direct consequence, this also introduces robustness to the phenomenon of inharmonicity. From this framework, we derive two estimation methods, one for stochastic and one for deterministic signals, and propose efficient numerical algorithms implementing them. In numerical studies on both synthetic and real data, the proposed methods are shown to achieve better estimation performance as compared to other methods from statistical signal processing literature. Furthermore, they perform comparably or better than network-based methods, except when the latter are specially trained on the data-type considered and are given access to considerably more data during inference.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bound for Direct Position Estimation in OFDM Based Cellular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although direct position estimation (DPE) has been demonstrated to offer enhanced robustness in GNSS receivers, its theoretical limits and performance in OFDM based positioning systems remain largely unexplored. In this paper, the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for DPE using OFDM based cellular signals is derived and benchmarked against the conventional two-step positioning method to assess their relative performance in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) dominated multipath environments. Numerical results reveal that 1) the DPE method consistently outperforms the two-step approach in OFDM systems under all evaluated conditions; 2) a large bandwidth is crucial in both methods, and increasing subcarrier spacing is more beneficial for a fixed bandwidth; 3) utilizing multiple OFDM symbols for positioning leads to substantial improvements in localization accuracy compared to relying on a single symbol. However, further increasing the number of symbols yields marginal improvements while significantly increasing computational complexity.</description>

      <title>RestAware: Non-Invasive Sleep Monitoring Using FMCW Radar and AI-Generated Summaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring sleep posture and behavior is critical for diagnosing sleep disorders and improving overall sleep quality. However, traditional approaches, such as wearable devices, cameras, and pressure sensors, often compromise user comfort, fail under obstructions like blankets, and raise privacy concerns. To overcome these limitations, we present RestAware, a non-invasive, contactless sleep monitoring system based on a 24GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. Our system is evaluated on 25 participants across eight common sleep postures, achieving 92% classification accuracy and an F1-score of 0.91 using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. In addition, we integrate instruction-tuned large language models (Mistral, Llama, and Falcon) to generate personalized, human-readable sleep summaries from radar-derived posture data. This low-cost ($ 35), privacy-preserving solution offers a practical alternative for real-time deployment in smart homes and clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Likelihood Functions with Parameter-Dependent Support: A Survey of the Cram\'{e}r-Rao-Leibniz Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. In many safety-critical applications, one is not only interested in a {\it point} estimator, but also the uncertainty bound that can self-assess the accuracy of the estimator. In this regard, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is of great importance, as it provides a lower bound on the variance of {\it any} unbiased estimator. In many cases, it is the only way of evaluating, without recourse to simulations, the expected accuracy of numerically obtainable estimates. For the existence of the CRLB, there have been widely accepted regularity conditions, one of which is that the support of the likelihood function (LF) -- the pdf of the observations conditioned on the parameter of interest -- should be independent of the parameter to be estimated. This paper starts from reviewing the derivations of the classical CRLB under the condition that the LF has parameter-independent support. To cope with the case of parameter-dependent support, we generalize the CRLB to the {\it Cram\'{e}r-Rao-Leibniz lower bound (CRLLB)}, by leveraging the general Leibniz integral rule. Notably, the existing results on CRLLB and CRLB are unified under the framework of CRLLB with multidimensional parameters. Then, we survey existing examples of LFs to illustrate the usefulness of the CRLLB in providing valid covariance bounds.</description>

      <title>Towed Movable Antenna (ToMA) Array for Ultra Secure Airborne Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel towed movable antenna (ToMA) array architecture to enhance the physical layer security of airborne communication systems. Unlike conventional onboard arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the ToMA array employs multiple subarrays mounted on flexible cables and towed by distributed drones, enabling agile deployment in three-dimensional (3D) space surrounding the central aircraft. This design significantly enlarges the effective array aperture and allows dynamic geometry reconfiguration, offering superior spatial resolution and beamforming flexibility. We consider a secure transmission scenario where an airborne transmitter communicates with multiple legitimate users in the presence of potential eavesdroppers. To ensure security, zero-forcing beamforming is employed to nullify signal leakage toward eavesdroppers. Based on the statistical distributions of locations of users and eavesdroppers, the antenna position vector (APV) of the ToMA array is optimized to maximize the users' ergodic achievable rate. Analytical results for the case of a single user and a single eavesdropper reveal the optimal APV structure that minimizes their channel correlation. For the general multiuser scenario, we develop a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm by leveraging Riemannian manifold optimization. Simulation results confirm that the proposed ToMA array achieves significant performance gains over conventional onboard FPA arrays, especially in scenarios where eavesdroppers are closely located to users under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant channels.</description>

      <title>Implementing Neural Networks Over-the-Air via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) OAC systems designed to emulate the fully-connected (FC) layer of a neural network (NN) via analog OAC, where the RIS and the transceivers are jointly adjusted to engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment to emulate the weights of the target FC layer. We refer to this novel computational paradigm as AirFC. We first study the case in which the precoder, combiner, and RIS phase shift matrices are jointly optimized to minimize the mismatch between the OAC system and the target FC layer. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all optimization variables are derived. Next, we consider training of the system parameters using two distinct learning strategies, namely centralized training and distributed training. In the centralized training approach, training is performed at either the transmitter or the receiver, whichever possesses the channel state information (CSI), and the trained parameters are provided to the other terminal. In the distributed training approach, the transmitter and receiver iteratively update their parameters through back and forth transmissions by leveraging channel reciprocity, thereby avoiding CSI acquisition and significantly reducing computational complexity. Subsequently, we extend our analysis to a multi-RIS scenario by exploiting its spatial diversity gain to enhance the system performance. Simulation results show that the AirFC system realized by the RIS-aided MIMO configuration achieves satisfactory classification accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements. In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and \textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM (teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec, trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs. Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Pigeon-SL: Robust Split Learning Framework for Edge Intelligence under Malicious Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy. To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future intelligent wireless networks.</description>

      <title>CSI Obfuscation: Single-Antenna Transmitters Can Not Hide from Adversarial Multi-Antenna Radio Localization Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of modern telecommunication systems to locate users and objects in the radio environment raises justified privacy concerns. To prevent unauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal by convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters the channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this strategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying single-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel identification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna receivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization regardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of signal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization performance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical triangulation using real-world channel measurements. This work aims to demonstrate the necessity for further efforts to protect the location privacy of users from adversarial radio-based localization systems.</description>

      <title>Perception of dynamic multi-speaker auditory scenes under different modes of attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention is not monolithic; rather, it operates in multiple forms to facilitate efficient cognitive processing. In the auditory domain, attention enables the prioritization of relevant sounds in an auditory scene and can be either attracted by elements in the scene in a bottom-up fashion or directed towards features, objects, or the entire scene in a top-down fashion. How these modes of attention interact and whether their neural underpinnings are distinct remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the perceptual and neural correlates of different attentional modes in a controlled "cocktail party" paradigm, where listeners listen to the same stimuli and attend to either a spatial location (feature-based), a speaker (object-based), or the entire scene (global or free-listening) while detecting deviations in pitch of a voice in the scene. Our findings indicate that object-based attention is more perceptually effective than feature-based or global attention. Furthermore, object-based and spatial-based attention engage distinct neural mechanisms and are differentially modulated by bottom-up salience. Notably, while bottom-up salience aids in the initial segregation of auditory objects, it plays a reduced role in object tracking once attention has been voluntarily allocated. In addition, decoding the stimulus envelope from the EEG data revealed a source-sampling scheme in the global attention mode that is not present in the object or spatial modes. Overall, the study shows that the perception of the same acoustic scene differs according to the listening task, guided by an interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes.</description>

      <title>RC-Gossip: Information Freshness in Clustered Networks with Rate-Changing Gossip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A clustered gossip network is considered in which a source updates its information over time, and end-nodes, organized in clusters through clusterheads, are keeping track of it. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., have the same information as the source, which we assess by the long-term average binary freshness metric. We introduce a smart mechanism of information dissemination which we coin rate-changing gossip (RC-Gossip). Its main idea is that gossiping is directed towards nodes that need it the most, and hence the rate of gossiping changes based on the number of fresh nodes in the network at a given time. While Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) analysis has been the norm in studying freshness of gossip networks, we present an equivalent way to analyze freshness using a renewal-reward-based approach. Using that, we show that RC-gossip significantly increases freshness of nodes in different clustered networks, with optimal cluster sizes, compared to traditional gossiping techniques.</description>

      <title>Timely Requesting for Time-Critical Content Users in Decentralized F-RANs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02930v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rising demand for high-rate and timely communications, fog radio access networks (F-RANs) offer a promising solution. This work investigates age of information (AoI) performance in F-RANs, consisting of multiple content users (CUs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), and content providers (CPs). Time-critical CUs need rapid content updates from CPs but cannot communicate directly with them; instead, eRRHs act as intermediaries. CUs decide whether to request content from a CP and which eRRH to send the request to, while eRRHs decide whether to command CPs to update content or use cached content. We study two general classes of policies: (i) oblivious policies, where decision-making is independent of historical information, and (ii) non-oblivious policies, where decisions are influenced by historical information. First, we obtain closed-form expressions for the average AoI of eRRHs under both policy types. Due to the complexity of calculating closed-form expressions for CUs, we then derive general upper bounds for their average AoI. Next, we identify optimal policies for both types. Under both optimal policies, each CU requests content from each CP at an equal rate, consolidating all requests to a single eRRH when demand is low or resources are limited, and distributing requests evenly among eRRHs when demand is high and resources are ample. eRRHs command content from each CP at an equal rate under an optimal oblivious policy, while prioritize the CP with the highest age under an optimal non-oblivious policy. Our numerical results validate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>MIMO Channel Shaping and Rate Maximization Using Beyond-Diagonal RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the limits to which a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can reshape a point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel in terms of singular values and their functions (e.g., achievable rate and harvestable power) for improved wireless performance. We depart from the Diagonal (D) scattering model and adopt a Beyond-Diagonal (BD) model that exploits element-wise connections for passive signal amplitude and phase manipulation. Specifically, analytical tight bounds are derived under typical RIS deployment scenarios to unveil the channel shaping potentials of BD-RIS regarding communication Degrees of Freedom (DoF), singular value spread, power gain, and capacity. An efficient numerical method is then proposed to optimize BD-RIS for any locally Lipschitz function of channel singular values, and showcased to characterize the achievable singular value region. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) approach and a low-complexity shaping approach. Results show that BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of channel singular values and the tradeoff in manipulating them, thus offering enhanced data rate, harvestable power, and physical-layer security. These advantages become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements, group size, or MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission and achieve the asymptotic DoF at much lower transmit power than D-RIS thanks to its proficiency in channel shaping.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Jamming Power Optimization for Secrecy in Energy Harvesting Networks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of joint allocation of transmit and jamming power at the source and destination, respectively, to enhance the long-term cumulative secrecy performance of an energy-harvesting wireless communication system until it stops functioning in the presence of an eavesdropper. The source and destination have energy-harvesting devices with limited battery capacities. The destination also has a full-duplex transceiver to transmit jamming signals for secrecy. We frame the problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) problem and propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimal joint power allocation (OJPA) algorithm that employs a policy iteration (PI) algorithm. Since the optimal algorithm is computationally expensive, we develop a low-complexity sub-optimal joint power allocation (SJPA) algorithm, namely, reduced state joint power allocation (RSJPA). Two other SJPA algorithms, the greedy algorithm (GA), and the naive algorithm (NA) are implemented as benchmarks. In addition, the OJPA algorithm outperforms the individual power allocation (IPA) algorithms termed individual transmit power allocation (ITPA) and individual jamming power allocation (IJPA), where the transmit and jamming powers, respectively, are optimized individually. The results show that the OJPA algorithm is also more energy efficient.Results also show that the OJPA algorithm significantly improves the secrecy performance compared to all SJPA algorithms. The OJPA algorithm also outperforms the secrecy performance of a genetic algorithm-based RL algorithm and a finite-horizon RL algorithm.The proposed RSJPA algorithm achieves nearly optimal performance with significantly less computational complexity marking it the balanced choice between the complexity and the performance.</description>

      <title>ADformer: A Multi-Granularity Spatial-Temporal Transformer for EEG-Based Alzheimer Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a cost-effective and efficient tool to support neurologists in the detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual feature engineering or data transformation. While such techniques may provide benefits when working with small-scale datasets, they often lead to information loss and distortion when applied to large-scale data, ultimately limiting model performance. Moreover, the limited subject scale and demographic diversity of datasets used in prior studies hinder comprehensive evaluation of model robustness and generalizability, thus restricting their applicability in real-world clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose ADformer, a novel multi-granularity spatial-temporal transformer designed to capture both temporal and spatial features from raw EEG signals, enabling effective end-to-end representation learning. Our model introduces multi-granularity embedding strategies across both spatial and temporal dimensions, leveraging a two-stage intra-inter granularity self-attention mechanism to learn both local patterns within each granularity and global dependencies across granularities. We evaluate ADformer on 4 large-scale datasets comprising a total of 1,713 subjects, representing one of the largest corpora for EEG-based AD detection to date, under a cross-validated, subject-independent setting. Experimental results demonstrate that ADformer consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving subject-level F1 scores of 92.82%, 89.83%, 67.99%, and 83.98% on the 4 datasets, respectively, in distinguishing AD from healthy control (HC) subjects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces an innovative approach for adaptive power allocation in Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems, enhanced by the integration of spaceborne and terrestrial signals through a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS). We develop an adaptive mechanism to adjust the power distribution between spaceborne and terrestrial signals according to variations in environmental conditions and elevation angles. This mechanism employs a sophisticated transition model that combines Gaussian Mixture Models with Log-Normal distributions to adaptively counteract the detrimental impacts of atmospheric attenuation and urban shadowing. These adaptive power adjustments significantly enhance system capacity, particularly improving the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio under diverse operational scenarios. Simulation studies confirm the efficacy of our method within an RIS-enhanced framework, showing an approximate 20\% increase in system capacity through optimized power management between spaceborne and terrestrial signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 5G cellular networks are now a reality and promise to improve key performance indicators (KPIs), such as Gbps data rates and latencies in the order of milliseconds. While some of these KPIs are achievable in urban scenarios, rural areas often face challenging connectivity conditions due to the lack of terrestrial network (TN) infrastructure. To solve this problem, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) such as satellite-based solutions, have been introduced to provide coverage in remote regions. Therefore, a multi-connectivity approach can be integrated to simultaneously serve an end-user by merging satellite and cellular links in a joint approach. This study explores, using experimental data, the benefits of both TN-TN and TN-NTN multi-connectivity in rural environments. The results obtained demonstrate that a traditional single-connectivity approach may not be sufficient to provide service to rural environments due to the KPIs requirements given several use cases within these rural areas. The multi-connectivity strategy, which jointly integrates 5G and satellite networks, meets the network availability requirements for latency, downlink throughput, and uplink throughput KPIs at least 98%, 99%, and 95% of the time, respectively, for several use cases, such as precision agriculture, livestock monitoring, and forest management. These include applications like microclimate monitoring, remote operational support, early pest detection, and real-time tracking of livestock transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fluid Antenna System (FAS) overcomes the spatial degree-of-freedom limitations of conventional static antenna arrays in wireless communications.This capability critically depends on acquiring full Channel State Information across all accessible ports. Existing studies focus exclusively on narrowband FAS, performing channel estimation solely in the spatial domain. This work proposes a channel estimation and spatial equalization framework for wideband FAS, revealing for the first time an inherent group-sparse structure in aperture-limited FAS channels. First, we establish a group-sparse recovery framework for space-frequency characteristics in FAS, formally characterizing leakage-induced sparsity degradation from limited aperture and bandwidth as a structured group-sparsity problem. By deriving dictionary-adapted group restricted isometry property, we prove tight recovery bounds for a convex $\ell_1/\ell_2$-mixed norm optimization formulation that preserves leakage-aware sparsity patterns. Second, we develop a descending correlation group orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that systematically relaxes leakage constraints to reduce subcoherence. This approach enables FSC recovery with accelerated convergence and superior performance compared to conventional compressive sensing methods like OMP or GOMP. Third, we formulate spatial equalization as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, complement this with a greedy algorithm maintaining near-optimal performance. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed channel estimation algorithm effectively resolves energy misallocation and enables recovery of weak details, achieving superior recovery accuracy and convergence rate. The SE framework suppresses deep fading phenomena and largely reduces time consumption overhead while maintaining equivalent link reliability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) has gained significant attention due to its high-speed data transmission and throughput. Optical wireless channels are often assumed to be flat, but we evaluate frequency selective channels to consider high data rate optical wireless or very dispersive environments. To address this for optical scenarios, this paper presents a robust channel estimation framework with low-complexity to mitigate frequency-selective effects, then to improve system reliability and performance. This channel estimation framework contains a neural network that can estimate general optical wireless channels without prior channel information about the environment. Based on this estimate and the corresponding delay spread, one of several candidate offline-trained neural networks will be activated to predict this channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has improved and robust normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional estimation methods while maintaining computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of neural network solutions in enhancing the performance of OWC systems under indoor channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Analog OFDM based on Real-Time Fourier Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an analog orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture based on the real-time Fourier transform (RTFT). The core enabling component is a linear-chirp phaser with engineered group velocity dispersion (GVD), which realizes RTFT and performs frequency-to-time mapping in the analog domain. In this architecture, conventional digital fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) processors are replaced by two linear-chirp phasers with opposite group delay dispersions, respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under specific phaser conditions, the OFDM signal generated by the RTFT-based analog system is mathematically equivalent to that of a conventional digital OFDM system. This equivalence is further supported by simulation results, which confirm accurate symbol transmission and recovery, as well as robustness to multipath fading when a prefix is applied. Benefiting from the use of passive microwave components, the analog OFDM system offers ultra-fast processing with reduced power consumption.

Abstract: A procedure for the determination of the optimal group-delay of a Linearly-Constrained Minimum-Variance (LCMV) beamformer is proposed. Two ways of selecting the optimal delay are recommended: the first is the solution that minimizes the noise power; the second is the solution that minimizes the processing delay. The potential of this hitherto unexplored degree of design freedom is investigated using simulated Very-High-Frequency (VHF) communication, and Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) bistatic radar, applications</description>

      <title>PPAAS: PVT and Pareto Aware Analog Sizing via Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Device sizing is a critical yet challenging step in analog and mixed-signal circuit design, requiring careful optimization to meet diverse performance specifications. This challenge is further amplified under process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, which cause circuit behavior to shift across different corners. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in automating sizing for fixed targets, training a generalized policy that can adapt to a wide range of design specifications under PVT variations requires much more training samples and resources. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{Goal-conditioned RL framework} that enables efficient policy training for analog device sizing across PVT corners, with strong generalization capability. To improve sample efficiency, we introduce Pareto-front Dominance Goal Sampling, which constructs an automatic curriculum by sampling goals from the Pareto frontier of previously achieved goals. This strategy is further enhanced by integrating Conservative Hindsight Experience Replay to stabilize training and accelerate convergence. To reduce simulation overhead, our framework incorporates a Skip-on-Fail simulation strategy. Experiments on benchmark circuits demonstrate $\sim$1.6$\times$ improvement in sample efficiency and $\sim$4.1$\times$ improvement in simulation efficiency compared to existing sizing methods.

      <title>Exploration of Low-Cost but Accurate Radar-Based Human Motion Direction Determination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague. The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map (DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset. The open-source code of this work is released at: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/Low-Cost-Accurate-Radar-Based-Human-Motion-Direction-Determination.</description>

      <title>PRIME: Phase Reversed Interleaved Multi-Echo acquisition enables highly accelerated distortion-free diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a new pulse sequence for highly accelerated distortion-free diffusion MRI (dMRI) by inserting additional echoes without prolonging TR, when generalized slice dithered enhanced resolution (gSlider) radiofrequency encoding is used for volumetric acquisition. Methods: A phase-reversed interleaved multi-echo acquisition (PRIME) was developed for rapid, high-resolution, and distortion-free dMRI, which includes several echoes where the first echo is for target diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) acquisition with high-resolution and additional echoes are acquired with either lower resolution for 1) high-fidelity field map estimation, 2) phase navigation for shot-to-shot phase correction, 3) motion navigation across diffusion directions, or with high resolution to enable 4) high fidelity diffusion relaxometry acquisitions. The sequence was evaluated on in vivo data acquired from healthy volunteers on clinical and Connectome 2.0 scanners. Results: In vivo experiments demonstrated that 1) high in-plane acceleration (Rin-plane of 5-fold with 2D partial Fourier) was achieved using the high-fidelity field maps estimated from the second echo, which was made at a lower resolution/acceleration to increase its SNR while matching the effective echo spacing of the first readout, 2) high-resolution diffusion relaxometry parameters were estimated from triple-echo PRIME data using a white matter model of multi-TE spherical mean technique (MTE-SMT), and 3) high-fidelity mesoscale DWI at 490 um isotropic resolution was obtained in vivo by capitalizing on the high-performance gradients of the Connectome 2.0 scanner. Conclusion: The proposed PRIME sequence enabled highly accelerated, high-resolution, and distortion-free dMRI using additional echoes without prolonging scan time when gSlider encoding is utilized.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-based Speed of Sound Recovery for Aberration-Corrected Photoacoustic Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10876v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a non-invasive imaging modality, similar to ultrasound, with wide-ranging medical applications. Conventional PACT images are degraded by wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue. Accounting for these effects can improve image quality and provide medically useful information, but measuring the SOS directly is burdensome and the existing joint reconstruction method is computationally expensive. Traditional supervised learning techniques are currently inaccessible in this data-starved domain. In this work, we introduce an efficient, self-supervised joint reconstruction method that recovers SOS and high-quality images for ring array PACT systems. To solve this semi-blind inverse problem, we parametrize the SOS using either a pixel grid or a neural field (NF) and update it directly by backpropagating the gradients through a differentiable imaging forward model. Our method removes SOS aberrations more accurately and 35x faster than the current SOTA. We demonstrate the success of our method quantitatively in simulation and qualitatively on experimentally-collected and in vivo data. Our code and synthetic numerical phantoms are available on our project page: https://lukeli0425.github.io/Coord-SoS-PACT/.</description>

      <title>An Electrocardiogram Foundation Model Built on over 10 Million Recordings with External Evaluation across Multiple Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04133v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in ECG analysis and cardiovascular disease assessment. Recently, foundation models have played a remarkable role in advancing medical AI. The development of an ECG foundation model holds the promise of elevating AI-ECG research to new heights. However, building such a model faces several challenges, including insufficient database sample sizes and inadequate generalization across multiple domains. Additionally, there is a notable performance gap between single-lead and multi-lead ECG analyses. We introduced an ECG Foundation Model (ECGFounder), a general-purpose model that leverages real-world ECG annotations from cardiology experts to broaden the diagnostic capabilities of ECG analysis. ECGFounder was trained on over 10 million ECGs with 150 label categories from the Harvard-Emory ECG Database, enabling comprehensive cardiovascular disease diagnosis through ECG analysis. The model is designed to be both an effective out-of-the-box solution, and a to be fine-tunable for downstream tasks, maximizing usability. Importantly, we extended its application to lower rank ECGs, and arbitrary single-lead ECGs in particular. ECGFounder is applicable to supporting various downstream tasks in mobile monitoring scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGFounder achieves expert-level performance on internal validation sets, with AUROC exceeding 0.95 for eighty diagnoses. It also shows strong classification performance and generalization across various diagnoses on external validation sets. When fine-tuned, ECGFounder outperforms baseline models in demographic analysis, clinical event detection, and cross-modality cardiac rhythm diagnosis. The trained model and data will be publicly released upon publication through the bdsp.io. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/ECGFounder</description>

Abstract: The successful deployment of deep learning-based acoustic echo and noise reduction (AENR) methods in consumer devices has spurred interest in developing low-complexity solutions, while emphasizing the need for robust performance in real-life applications. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to enhance the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ULCNet model by integrating time alignment and parallel encoder blocks for the model inputs, resulting in better echo reduction and comparable noise reduction performance to existing SOTA methods. We also propose a channel-wise sampling-based feature reorientation method, ensuring robust performance across many challenging scenarios, while maintaining overall low computational and memory requirements.</description>

      <title>CSI-BERT2: A BERT-inspired Framework for Efficient CSI Prediction and Classification in Wireless Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental component in both wireless communication and sensing systems, enabling critical functions such as radio resource optimization and environmental perception. In wireless sensing, data scarcity and packet loss hinder efficient model training, while in wireless communication, high-dimensional CSI matrices and short coherent times caused by high mobility present challenges in CSI estimation.To address these issues, we propose a unified framework named CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks. Building on CSI-BERT, we introduce a two-stage training method that first uses a mask language model (MLM) to enable the model to learn general feature extraction from scarce datasets in an unsupervised manner, followed by fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. Specifically, we extend MLM into a mask prediction model (MPM), which efficiently addresses the CSI prediction task. We also introduce an adaptive re-weighting layer (ARL) to enhance subcarrier representation and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based temporal embedding module to mitigate permutation invariance issues in time-series CSI data. This significantly improves the CSI classification performance of the original CSI-BERT model. Extensive experiments on both real-world collected and simulated datasets demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. Our results further show that CSI-BERT2 generalizes effectively across varying sampling rates and robustly handles discontinuous CSI sequences caused by packet loss-challenges that conventional methods fail to address.</description>

Abstract: The IMT-2030 framework provides the vision and conceptual foundation for the next-generation of mobile broadband systems, colloquially known as Sixth-Generation (6G) cellular networks. Academic circles, industry players, and Standard Developing Organizations (SDOs) are already engaged in early standardization discussions for the system, providing key insights for future technical specifications. In this context, a structured thematic synthesis aligned with IMT-2030 is essential to inform the discussions and assist collaboration among 6G stakeholders -- including scholars, professionals, regulators, and SDO officials. This review intends to offer a concise yet informative synthesis of well-established 6G literature, viewed through the IMT-2030 lens, for both specialists and generalists engaged in shaping future standards and advancing 6G research.</description>

      <title>Prompting Large Language Models for Training-Free Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate total electricity consumption into individual appliance usage, thus enabling more effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of explainability. This paper introduces the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, contextual information, and representative time-series examples through extensive case studies. Extensive experiments on the REDD and UK-DALE datasets show that LLMs guided solely by prompts deliver only basic NILM capabilities, with performance that lags behind traditional deep-learning models in complex scenarios. However, the experiments also demonstrate strong generalization across different houses and even regions by simply adapting the injected appliance features. It also provides clear, human-readable explanations for the inferred appliance states. Our findings define the capability boundaries of using prompt-only LLMs for NILM tasks. Their strengths in generalization and explainability present a promising new direction for the field.</description>

      <title>Wi-CBR: Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge in WiFi-based cross-domain Behavior Recognition lies in the significant interference of domain-specific signals on gesture variation. However, previous methods alleviate this interference by mapping the phase from multiple domains into a common feature space. If the Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS) signal is used to dynamically supplement the phase features to achieve better generalization, enabling model to not only explore a wider feature space but also avoid potential degradation of gesture semantic information. Specifically, we propose a novel Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition (Wi-CBR}, which constructs a dual-branch self-attention module that captures temporal features from phase information reflecting dynamic path length variations, while extracting spatial features from DFS correlated with motion velocity. Moreover, we design a Saliency Guidance Module that employs group attention mechanisms to mine critical activity features, and utilizes gating mechanisms to optimize information entropy, facilitating feature fusion and enabling effective interaction between salient and non-salient behavior characteristics. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets (Widar3.0 and XRF55) demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Advances in Intelligent Hearing Aids: Deep Learning Approaches to Selective Noise Cancellation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence into hearing assistance marks a paradigm shift from traditional amplification-based systems to intelligent, context-aware audio processing. This systematic literature review evaluates advances in AI-driven selective noise cancellation (SNC) for hearing aids, highlighting technological evolution, implementation challenges, and future research directions. We synthesize findings across deep learning architectures, hardware deployment strategies, clinical validation studies, and user-centric design. The review traces progress from early machine learning models to state-of-the-art deep networks, including Convolutional Recurrent Networks for real-time inference and Transformer-based architectures for high-accuracy separation. Key findings include significant gains over traditional methods, with recent models achieving up to 18.3 dB SI-SDR improvement on noisy-reverberant benchmarks, alongside sub-10 ms real-time implementations and promising clinical outcomes. Yet, challenges remain in bridging lab-grade models with real-world deployment - particularly around power constraints, environmental variability, and personalization. Identified research gaps include hardware-software co-design, standardized evaluation protocols, and regulatory considerations for AI-enhanced hearing devices. Future work must prioritize lightweight models, continual learning, contextual-based classification and clinical translation to realize transformative hearing solutions for millions globally.</description>

      <title>Handoff Design in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks Using DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff (HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA) observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF). Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a response time less than 0.4 ms.</description>

      <title>Distributed Iterative ML and Message Passing for Grant-Free Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell-Free (CF) Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MaMIMO) is considered one of the leading candidates for enabling next-generation wireless communication. With the growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), the Grant-Free (GF) access scheme has emerged as a promising solution to support massive device connectivity. The integration of GF and CF-MaMIMO introduces significant challenges, particularly in designing distributed algorithms for activity detection and pilot contamination mitigation. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm that addresses these challenges. Our method first employs a component-wise iterative distributed Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach for activity detection, which considers both the pilot and data portions of the received signal. This is followed by a Pseudo-Prior Hybrid Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation (PP-VB-EP) algorithm for joint data detection and channel estimation. Compared to conventional VB-EP, the proposed PP-VB-EP demonstrates improved convergence behavior and reduced sensitivity to initialization, especially when data symbols are drawn from a finite alphabet. The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated posterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing (MP) algorithm from diverging. To compute the pseudo prior in a distributed fashion, we further develop a distributed version of the Variable-Level Expectation Propagation (VL-EP) algorithm.</description>

      <title>Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks: Stochastic Performance Analysis</title>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the stochastic security performance of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a downlink scenario. A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to simultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target's angular location, and counteract eavesdropping threats. The attack model considers a passive single-antenna communication eavesdropper intercepting communication data, as well as a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target's location. We also consider a malicious target scenario where the target plays the role of the communication eavesdropper. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers channels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target's azimuth angle is uniformly distributed. To evaluate the performance in this random network, we derive the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB), for target localization, at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves computing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability. We characterize the boundary of the CRB-secrecy rate region, and interpret the performance tradeoffs between communication and sensing while guaranteeing a level of security and privacy in the random ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO SWIPT with Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BDRISs) into cell free massive multiple input multiple output (CFmMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users energy receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving ERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A protective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs to manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently, closed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average sum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power control, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power control design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully connected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in the average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix design is employed.</description>
