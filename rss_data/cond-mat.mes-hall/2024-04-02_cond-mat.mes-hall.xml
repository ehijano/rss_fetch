      <title>NMR of a single nuclear spin detected by a scanning tunneling microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate ionization of a molecule with the bias voltage of a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM) resulting in a coexistence of a neutral and ionic molecules, i.e. radical (paramagnetic) and non-radical (diamagnetic) states. This coexistence may be facilitated by a periodic switching between two bias voltages. The precession of the nucleus in the diamagnetic state modulates the nuclear polarization as well as the hyperfine transitions as seen in electron spin resonance (ESR). We analyze the power spectrum of a selected hyperfine intensity and obtain the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum. We have observed this phenomenon in three types of molecules: TEMPO, toluene and triphenylphosphine, showing NMR of $^{14}$N, $^{13}$C, $^{31}$P and $^1$H nuclei. The spectra are detailed and show signatures of the chemical environment, i.e. chemical shifts. A master equation including off-diagonal hyperfine interactions accounts for these observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Viscosity of the ABC-stacked Multilayer Graphene in the Collisionless Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamic shear viscosity of the undoped ABC-stacked multilayer graphene based on the chiral-$N$ effective Hamiltonian, where the chirality $N$ is equivalent to the layer number. We investigate the dependence of the dynamic shear viscosity on the frequency in the collisionless regime and calculate Coulomb interaction corrections by three leading order Feynman diagrams: self-energy diagram, vertex diagram, and honey diagram. We propose that the dynamic shear viscosity is generated by the relaxation of momentum flux polarization through electron-hole excitations, and that the interaction can amplify this effect. Furthermore, our research indicates that the dynamic shear viscosity exhibits a robust linear positive dependence on $N$. This finding suggests that by making modifications to the number of layers in graphene, it is possible to finely tune the electron viscous effects.</description>

      <title>Electron Collimation in Twisted Bilayer Graphene via Gate-defined Moir\'e Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron collimation via a graphene pn-junction allows electrostatic control of ballistic electron trajectories akin to that of an optical circuit. Similar manipulation of novel correlated electronic phases in twisted-bilayer graphene (tBLG) can provide additional probes to the underlying physics and device components towards advanced quantum electronics. In this work, we demonstrate collimation of the electron flow via gate-defined moir\'e barriers in a tBLG device, utilizing the band-insulator gap of the moir\'e superlattice. A single junction can be tuned to host a chosen combination of conventional pseudo barrier and moir\'e tunnel barriers, from which we demonstrate improved collimation efficiency. By measuring transport through two consecutive moir\'e collimators separated by 1 um, we demonstrate evidence of electron collimation in tBLG in the presence of realistic twist-angle inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous charge-ordered state in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that a weakly spontaneous charge-ordered insulating state probably exists in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene which can account for experimentally observed non-monotonic behavior of resistance as a function of the gated field, namely, the gap closes and reopens at a critical gated field. The underlying physics is demonstrated by a simple model on a corresponding lattice that contains the nearest intralayer and interlayer hoppings, electric field, and staggered potential between different sublattices. Combining density functional theory calculations with model analyses, we argue that the interlayer van der Waals interactions cooperating with ripples may be responsible for the staggered potential which induces a charge-ordered insulating state in the absence of the electric field.</description>

      <title>Hidden-Rashba-driven Absence of Odd-integer Quantized States in an Oxide Quantum Hall System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the quantum Hall effect in 1980, a turning point in condensed matter physics, has inspired exploring emergent quantized states regarding novel electron states, band topologies and spin textures. Owing to the lifted degeneracies universally-existing, most quantum Hall systems host both even- and odd-integer quantum Hall plateaus simultaneously. Selective control of these quantized states is of great significance to understand the exotic ground states and manipulate the spin textures in quantum Hall systems; however, it remains challenging. Here we demonstrate the absence of odd-integer state in inversion-symmetric Bi2O2Se quantum Hall system driven by the unique hidden Rashba effect. Pronounced quantum oscillations and only even-integer quantized plateaus were observed in the few-layer Bi2O2Se films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3. However, after reducing the thickness of epitaxial Bi2O2Se film to one unit cell limit with giant Rashba parameter of 440 meV.A, both odd- and even-integer states can show up simultaneously in this 2D Janus film. Theoretical calculations revealed that such absence of odd-integer states, i.e., a suppressed Zeeman splitting, stems from a unique hidden Rashba effect in the inversion-symmetric Bi2O2Se. However, this hidden Rashba effect can be further broken down due to tunable inversion-symmetry breaking. Our work highlights the extraordinary controllability of quantized states at the atomic level and further provides an unprecedented path to explore and handle novel spin textures and ground states.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal superfluidlike topological spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superfluidlike spin transport facilitated by thermal diffusion of magnetic domain walls, where the positive and negative chiralities of domain walls act as opposite topological charges. The topological charge conservation leads to algebraic decay of the topological current, allowing for the transport of spin over extended distances. We demonstrate that the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can lead to nonreciprocity in topological flow. In one scenario, the nonreciprocity arises due to diode-like behavior where the nucleation of domain walls is governed by thermal activation for one direction of spin current and by viscous injection for the other direction of spin current. We confirm our predictions by micromagnetic simulations of domain walls in TmIG nanowire.</description>

      <title>Easy-to-configure zero-dimensional valley-chiral modes in a graphene point junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in 2D materials can be manipulated for low-dissipation quantum electronics called valleytronics. At the boundary between two regions of bilayer graphene with different atomic or electrostatic configuration, valley-polarized current has been realized. However, the demanding fabrication and operation requirements limit device reproducibility and scalability toward more advanced valleytronics circuits. We demonstrate a new device architecture of a point junction where a valley-chiral 0D PN junction is easily configured, switchable, and capable of carrying valley current with an estimated polarization of ~80%. This work provides a new building block in manipulating valley quantum numbers and scalable valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Wiedemann-Franz law violation domain for graphene and nonrelativistic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic and comparative research on Lorenz ratios for graphene and nonrelativistic systems has been studied to identify their Wiedemann-Franz law violation domain. Fermi energy and temperature are the main governing parameters for deciding the values of the Lorenz ratio, which is basically thermal conductivity divided by electrical conductivity times temperature times Lorenz number. Metals as three-dimensional nonrelativistic electron gas locate at higher Fermi-energy by temperature domain, where Lorenz ratio remains one. Hence, they obey the Wiedemann-Franz law. By creating higher doping in a two-dimensional graphene system, one can again reach a higher Fermi-energy by temperature domain and get a constant Lorenz ratio. For both graphene and non-relativistic systems, the Lorenz ratio goes below one if we go lower Fermi-energy by temperature domain, which is possible for the graphene system by decreasing the doping concentration. Experimentally observed greater than one Lorenz ratio in this lower Fermi-energy by temperature domain or Dirac Fluid domain indicates that non-fluid expressions of Lorenz ratio should be replaced by fluid-type expressions. We have noticed a divergent trend of Lorenz ratio in the Dirac Fluid domain using its fluid-type expression, and it matches with the trend of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Topological phases and edge modes of an uneven ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of a two-chain quantum ladder with uneven legs, i.e. the two chains differ in their periods by a factor of two. Such an uneven ladder presents rich band structures classified by the closure of either direct or indirect bandgaps. It also provides opportunities to explore fundamental concepts concerning band topology and edge modes, including the difference of intracellular and intercellular Zak phases, and the role of the inversion symmetry (IS). We calculate the Zak phases of the two kinds and find excellent agreement with the dipole moment and extra charge accumulation, respectively. We also find that configurations with IS feature a pair of degenerate two-side edge modes emerging as the closure of the direct bandgap, while configurations without IS feature one-side edge modes emerging as not only the closure of both direct and indirect bandgap but also within the band continuum. Furthermore, by projecting to the two sublattices, we find that the effective Bloch Hamiltonian corresponds to that of a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model or Rice-Mele model whose hopping amplitudes depend on the quasimomentum. In this way, the topological phases can be efficiently extracted through winding numbers. We propose that uneven ladders can be realized by spin-dependent optical lattices and their rich topological characteristics can be examined by near future experiments.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Screening Inside Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric screening plays a vital role for the physical properties in the nanoscale and also alters our ability to detect and characterize nanomaterials by optical techniques. We study the dielectric screening inside of carbon nanotubes and how it changes electromagnetic fields and many-body effects for encapsulated nanostructures. First, we show that the local electric field inside a nanotube is altered by one-dimensional screening with dramatic effects on the effective Raman scattering efficiency of the encapsulated species for metallic walls. The scattering intensity of the inner tube is two orders of magnitude weaker than for the tube in air, which is nicely reproduced by local field calculations. Secondly, we find that the optical transition energies of the inner nanotubes shift to lower energies compared to a single-walled carbon nanotubes of the same chirality. The shift is higher if the outer tube is metallic than when it is semiconducting. The magnitude of the shift suggests that the excitons of small diameter inner metallic tubes are thermally dissociated at room temperate if the outer tube is also metallic and in essence we observe band-to-band transitions.</description>

      <title>Maximal quantum interaction between free electrons and photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of free-electron quantum optics enables electron-photon entanglement and holds the potential for generating nontrivial photon states for quantum information processing. Although recent experimental studies have entered the quantum regime, rapid theoretical developments predict that qualitatively unique phenomena only emerge beyond a certain interaction strength. It is thus pertinent to identify the maximal electron-photon interaction strength and the materials, geometries, and particle energies that enable one to approach it. We derive an upper limit to the quantum vacuum interaction strength between free electrons and single-mode photons, which illuminates the conditions for the strongest interaction. Crucially, we obtain an explicit energy selection recipe for electrons and photons to achieve maximal interaction at arbitrary separations and identify two optimal regimes favoring either fast or slow electrons over those with intermediate velocities. We validate the limit by analytical and numerical calculations on canonical geometries and provide near-optimal designs indicating the feasibility of strong quantum interactions. Our findings offer fundamental intuition for maximizing the quantum interaction between free electrons and photons and provide practical design rules for future experiments on electron-photon and electron-mediated photon-photon entanglement. They should also enable the evaluation of key metrics for applications such as the maximum power of free-electron radiation sources and the maximum acceleration gradient of dielectric laser accelerators.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Nanoelectromechanical Coupling at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface hosts a plethora of gate-tunable electronic phases. Gating of LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces are usually assumed to occur electrostatically. However, increasing evidence suggests that non-local interactions can influence and, in some cases, dominate the coupling between applied gate voltages and electronic properties. Here, we sketch quasi-1D ballistic electron waveguides at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface as a probe to understand how gate tunability varies as a function of spatial separation. Gate tunability measurements reveal the scaling law to be at odds with the pure electrostatic coupling observed in traditional semiconductor systems. The non-Coulombic gating at the interface is attributed to the existence of a long-range nanoelectromechanical coupling between the gate and electron waveguide, mediated by the ferroelastic domains in SrTiO$_3$. The long-range interactions at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface add unexpected richness and complexity to this correlated electron system.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin textures driven by emergent spin-orbit interaction: a numerical study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore numerically the intricate interplay between Berry phases in both real and momentum spaces within itinerant magnets. This interplay manifests as an emergent spin-orbit coupling, where charge carriers occupying a Berry-curved band generate an orbital magnetization, inducing a pseudo-magnetic field originating in chiral spin textures. Using density-matrix-renormalization-group techniques, we demonstrate that switching on a band Berry curvature in a metallic ferromagnetic phase results in chiral magnetic textures. Furthermore, employing a two-leg strip geometry, we establish a connection between charge and spin chirality, further supporting this emergent spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin current pumping by ultrafast demagnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surprising discovery of ultrafast demagnetization -- where electric field of femtosecond laser pulse couples to electrons of a ferromagnetic (FM) layer causing its magnetization vector {\em to shrink while not rotating}, is also assumed to be accompanied by generation of spin current in the direction orthogonal to electric field. However, understanding of the microscopic origin of such spin current and how efficiently it can be converted into charge current, as the putative source of THz radiation, is lacking despite nearly three decades of intense studies. Here we connect the standard pumping phenomena driven by microwave precession of magnetization vector replacing periodic time-dependence of magnetization precession with nonperiodic time-dependence of demagnetization, as obtained from experiments on ultrafast-light-driven Ni layer. Applying time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions, able to evolve such setup with arbitrary time dependence, reveals how demagnetization dynamics pumps both charge and spin currents in directions both parallel and orthogonal to electric field of laser pulse, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and thereby induced spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms. Although pumped currents follow $dM_z/dt$ in some setups, this becomes obscured when NM layers are disconnected and pumped currents start to reflect from FM boundaries (as is the case of experimental setups). Finally, we use the Jefimenko equations to compute electromagnetic radiation by charge current pumped in disconnected setup during demagnetization, or later during its slow recovery, unraveling that radiated electric field only in the former time interval exhibits features in 0.1--30 THz frequency range probed experimentally or explored for applications of spintronic THz emitters.</description>

      <title>Study of Curved Domain-wall Fermions on a Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we consider fermion systems on square lattice spaces with a curved domain-wall mass term. In a similar way to the flat case, we find massless and chiral states localized at the wall. In the case of $S^1$ and $S^2$ domain-wall embedded into a square lattice, we find that these edge states feel gravity through the induced spin connection. In the conventional continuum limit of the higher dimensional lattice, we find a good consistency with the analytic results in the continuum theory. We also confirm that the rotational symmetry is recovered automatically.
  We also discuss the effect of a $U(1)$ gauge connection on a two-dimensional lattice fermion with the $S^1$ domain-wall mass term. We find that the gauge field changes the eigenvalue spectrum of the boundary system by the Aharanov-Bohm effect and generates an anomaly of the time-reversal ($T$) symmetry. Our numerical evaluation is consistent with the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index, which describes the cancellation of the $T$ anomaly by the topological term on the bulk system. When we squeeze the flux inside one plaquette while keeping the total flux unchanged, the anomaly inflow undergoes a drastic change. The intense flux gives rise to an additional domain wall around the flux. We observe a novel localized mode at the flux, canceling the $T$ anomaly on the wall instead of the topological term in the bulk.
  We apply the study to a problem in condensed matter physics. It is known that inside topological insulators, a vortex or monopole acquires a fractional electric charge and turns into a dyon. Describing the topological insulator as a negative mass region of a Dirac fermion, we provide a microscopic description of this phenomenon in terms of the dynamical domain-wall creation.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of quasiparticle tunneling with a charge-sensitive superconducting sensor coupled to a waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting quasiparticle tunneling events in superconducting circuits provides information about the population and dynamics of non-equilibrium quasiparticles. Such events can be detected by monitoring changes in the frequency of an offset-charge-sensitive superconducting qubit. This monitoring has so far been performed by Ramsey interferometry assisted by a readout resonator. Here, we demonstrate a quasiparticle detector based on a superconducting qubit directly coupled to a waveguide. We directly measure quasiparticle number parity on the qubit island by probing the coherent scattering of a microwave tone, offering simplicity of operation, fast detection speed, and a large signal-to-noise ratio. We observe tunneling rates between 0.8 and $7~\rm{s}^{-1}$, depending on the average occupation of the detector qubit, and achieve a temporal resolution below $10~\mu\rm{s}$ without a quantum-limited amplifier. Our simple and efficient detector lowers the barrier to perform studies of quasiparticle population and dynamics, facilitating progress in fundamental science, quantum information processing, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Understanding and utilizing the inner bonds of process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Process tensor matrix product operators (PT-MPOs) enable numerically exact simulations for an unprecedentedly broad range of open quantum systems. By representing environment influences in MPO form, they can be efficiently compressed using established algorithms. The dimensions of inner bonds of the compressed PT-MPO may be viewed as an indicator of the complexity of the environment. Here, we show that the inner bonds themselves, not only their dimensions, have a concrete physical meaning: They represent the subspace of the full environment Liouville space which hosts environment excitations that may influence the subsequent open quantum systems dynamics the most. This connection can be expressed in terms of lossy linear transformations, whose pseudoinverses facilitate the extraction of environment observables. We demonstrate this by extracting the environment spin of a central spin problem, the current through a quantum system coupled to two leads, the number of photons emitted from quantum emitters into a structured environment, and the distribution of the total absorbed energy in a driven non-Markovian quantum system into system, environment, and interaction energy terms. Numerical tests further indicate that different PT-MPO algorithms compress environments to similar subspaces. Thus, the physical interpretation of inner bonds of PT-MPOs both provides a conceptional understanding and it enables new practical applications.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of hot-electron pair emission from a driven quantum dot</title>

Abstract: On-demand emission of individual electrons for the implementation of flying qubits and quantum electron-optics experiments requires precise knowledge and tunability of emission times and energies. Crucially, for confined electron sources such as driven quantum dots, the effect of local Coulomb interaction on these emission properties needs to be understood, in particular if multiple particles are emitted close in time or near-simultaneously. This paper theoretically analyzes electron-pair emission from an ac driven quantum dot, detailing the competing effects of the electron-electron interaction, the time-dependent potential forming the quantum dot, and of the quantum-state properties such as degeneracy on the emission times and energies. We complement a numerical analysis of the coherent Schr\"odinger evolution of two particles in a driven potential with a master-equation description for strongly interacting electrons tunneling stochastically into a weakly coupled conductor. This captures a broad range of different influences on the emitted particles and thereby guides the development of single-electron sources higher control over two-particle emission properties.</description>

      <title>Double-Free-Layer Stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions with Synthetic Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (sMTJ) using low-barrier nanomagnets have shown promise as fast, energy-efficient, and scalable building blocks for probabilistic computing. Despite recent experimental and theoretical progress, sMTJs exhibiting the ideal characteristics necessary for probabilistic bits (p-bit) are still lacking. Ideally, the sMTJs should have (a) voltage bias independence preventing read disturbance (b) uniform randomness in the magnetization angle between the free layers, and (c) fast fluctuations without requiring external magnetic fields while being robust to magnetic field perturbations. Here, we propose a new design satisfying all of these requirements, using double-free-layer sMTJs with synthetic antiferromagnets (SAF). We evaluate the proposed sMTJ design with experimentally benchmarked spin-circuit models accounting for transport physics, coupled with the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for magnetization dynamics. We find that the use of low-barrier SAF layers reduces dipolar coupling, achieving uncorrelated fluctuations at zero-magnetic field surviving up to diameters exceeding ($D\approx 100$ nm) if the nanomagnets can be made thin enough ($\approx 1$-$2$ nm). The double-free-layer structure retains bias-independence and the circular nature of the nanomagnets provides near-uniform randomness with fast fluctuations. Combining our full sMTJ model with advanced transistor models, we estimate the energy to generate a random bit as $\approx$ 3.6 fJ, with fluctuation rates of $\approx$ 3.3 GHz per p-bit. Our results will guide the experimental development of superior stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions for large-scale and energy-efficient probabilistic computation for problems relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Localized Floquet states in gated bilayer graphene induced by a focused optical beam with orbital angular momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically studied the Floquet state of gated bilayer graphene, which is irradiated by normally incident focused Gaussian beam with orbital angular momentum (OAM). According to the Floquet theory, in-plane and out-of-plane electric field of the OAM beam periodically perturbs the intralayer and interlayer hopping, which are equivalent to the presence of effective staggered sublattice potential and next-nearest neighboring interlayer hopping within the light spot region, respectively. The combination of the effective terms and the gated voltage form an effective trapping potential, which hosts localized quantum states with energy level being within the energy gap of the non-irradiated gated bilayer graphene. The energy spectrum can be tuned by the amplitude of the optical beam and additional static magnetic field. By engineering the parameters, valley-polarized two-fold degenerated zero energy Floquet states can be induced.</description>

      <title>Strictly one dimensional behavior emerging from dispersive two dimensional system: implications on metallic nanowires on semiconducting substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied single and two Su-Shreiffer-Heeger wires on a simple cubic semiconducting substrate. The wire-wire coupling is either perpendicular or diagonal hopping respecting the particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries. The hybridization to the substrate renormalizes the model parameters of the wires towards the hopping parameter of the substrate without changing the basic nature of perpendicular or diagonal coupling and it can mediate effective perpendicular hopping but not diagonal hopping in the absence of direct wire-wire coupling. This justifies the investigation of multi uniform tight binding wires with perpendicular or diagonal hopping parameters while neglecting the substrate. Perpendicularly coupled uniform wires reveal an anisotropic two dimensional band dispersion. Diagonally coupled uniform wires reveal strictly one dimensional bands parallel to the wires direction if the intra-wire hopping parameter is larger than twice the diagonal hopping parameter despite strong dispersion perpendicular to the wires. Otherwise, they reveal strictly one dimensional bands parallel and perpendicular to the wires direction simultaneously. We established the possibility of realizing strictly one dimensional properties emerging from dispersive two dimensional systems if time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries are respected. This can facilitate the investigations of Luttinger liquid in the Au/Ge(001) and Bi/InSb(001) surface reconstructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study hydrodynamic thermal transport in high-mobility two-dimensional electron systems placed in an in-plane magnetic field, and identify a new mechanism of thermal magnetotransport. This mechanism is caused by drag between the electron populations with opposite spin polarization, which arises in the presence of a hydrodynamic flow of heat. In high mobility systems, spin drag results in strong thermal magnetoresistance, which becomes of the order of 100% at relatively small spin polarization of the electron liquid. We express the thermal magnetoresistance in terms of intrinsic dissipative coefficients of electron fluid and show that it is primarily determined by the spin diffusion constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High In content InGaAs quantum wells (In $\geq$ 75%) are potentially useful for topological quantum computing and spintronics applications. In high mobility InGaAs quantum wells, alloy disorder scattering is a limiting factor. In this report, we demonstrate that by growing the InGaAs quantum wells as a digital alloy, or a short period superlattice, we can reduce the alloy disorder scattering within the quantum well and increase the peak 2 K electron mobility to 545,000 cm^2/V s, which is the highest reported mobility for high In content InGaAs quantum wells to the best of the authors' knowledge. Our results demonstrate that the digital alloy approach can be used to increase the mobility of quantum wells in random alloy ternary materials.</description>

      <title>Origin of Charge Density Wave in Topological Semimetals SrAl4 and EuAl4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological semimetals in BaAl4-type structure show many interesting behaviors, such as charge density wave (CDW) in SrAl4 and EuAl4, but not the isostructural and isovalent BaAl4, SrGa4 and BaGa4. Here using Wannier functions based on density functional theory, we calculate the susceptibility functions with millions of k-points to reach the small q-vector and study the origin and driving force behind the CDW. Our comparative study reveals that the origin of the CDW in SrAl4 and EuAl4 is the strong electron-phonon coupling interaction for the transverse acoustic mode at small q-vector along the \{Gamma}-Z direction besides the maximum of the real part of the susceptibility function from the nested Fermi surfaces of the Dirac-like bands, which explains well the absence of CDW in the other closely related compounds in a good agreement with experiment. We also connect the different CDW behaviors in the Al compounds to the macroscopic elastic properties.</description>

      <title>Exact asymptotics of long-range quantum correlations in a nonequilibrium steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium states of many-body systems tend to evade a description by standard statistical mechanics, and their uniqueness is epitomized by the possibility of certain long-range correlations that cannot occur in equilibrium. In quantum many-body systems, coherent correlations of this sort may lead to the emergence of remarkable entanglement structures. In this work, we analytically study the asymptotic scaling of quantum correlation measures -- the mutual information and the fermionic negativity -- within the zero-temperature steady state of voltage-biased free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice containing a noninteracting impurity. Previously, we have shown that two subsystems on opposite sides of the impurity exhibit volume-law entanglement, which is independent of the absolute distances of the subsystems from the impurity. Here we go beyond that result and derive the exact form of the subleading logarithmic corrections to the extensive terms of correlation measures, in excellent agreement with numerical calculations. In particular, the logarithmic term of the mutual information asymptotics can be encapsulated in a concise formula, depending only on simple four-point ratios of subsystem length-scales and on the impurity scattering probabilities at the Fermi energies. This echoes the case of equilibrium states, where such logarithmic terms may convey universal information about the physical system. To compute these exact results, we devise a hybrid method that relies on Toeplitz determinant asymptotics for correlation matrices in both real space and momentum space, successfully circumventing the inhomogeneity of the system. This method can potentially find wider use for analytical calculations of entanglement measures in similar scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic spin splittings and altermagnetism in twisted bilayers of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetism-driven nonrelativistic spin splittings (NRSS) are promising for highly efficient spintronics applications. Although 2D centrosymmetric (in four-dimensional spacetime) antiferromagnets are abundant, they have not received extensive research attention owing to symmetry-forbidden spin polarization and magnetization. Here, we demonstrate a paradigm to harness NRSS by twisting the bilayer of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets with commensurate twist angles. We observe $i$-wave altermagnetism and spin-momentum locking by first-principles simulations and symmetry analysis on prototypical MnPSe$_3$ and MnSe antiferromagnets. The strength of NRSS (up to 80 meV\AA) induced by twisting is comparable to SOC-induced linear Rashba-Dresselhaus effects. The results also demonstrate how applying biaxial strain and a vertical electric field tune the NRSS. The findings reveal the untapped potential of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets and thus expand the material's horizons in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the frequency space: Discretization schemes for the dynamic-matrix approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamic matrix method addresses the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation in the frequency domain by transforming it into an eigenproblem. Subsequent numerical solutions are derived from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamic matrix. In this work we explore discretization methods needed to obtain a matrix representation of the dynamic operator, a fundamental counterpart of the dynamic matrix. Our approach opens a new set of linear algebra tools for the dynamic matrix method and expose the approximations and limitations intrinsic to it. Moreover, our discretization algorithms can be applied to various discretization schemes, extending beyond micromagnetism problems. We present some application examples, including a technique to obtain the dynamic matrix directly from the magnetic free energy function of an ensemble of macrospins, and an algorithmic method to calculate numerical micromagnetic kernels, including plane wave kernels. We also show how to exploit symmetries and reduce the numerical size of micromagnetic dynamic-matrix problems by a change of basis. This procedure significantly reduces the size of the dynamic matrix by several orders of magnitude while maintaining high numerical precision. Additionally, we calculate analytical approximations for the dispersion relations in magnonic crystals. This work contributes to the understanding of the current magnetization dynamics methods, and could help the development and formulations of novel analytical and numerical methods for solving the LLG equation within the frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Explaining the thickness-dependent dielectric permittivity of thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dielectric properties of thin films are of paramount important in a variety of technological applications, and of fundamental importance for solid state research. In spite of this, there is currently no theoretical understanding of the dependence of the dielectric permittivity on the thickness of thin films. We develop a confinement model within the Lorentz-field framework for the microscopic Langevin-equation description of dielectric response in terms of the atomic-scale vibrational modes of the solid. Based on this, we derive analytical expressions for the dielectric permittivity as a function of thin film thickness, in excellent agreement with experimental data of Barium-Strontium-Titanate (BST) thin films of different stoichiometry. The theory shows that the decrease of dielectric permittivity with decreasing thickness is directly caused by the restriction in $k$-space of the available eigenmodes for field-induced alignment of ions and charged groups.</description>
