      <title>FORTE: An Open-Source System for Cost-Effective and Scalable Environmental Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forests are an essential part of our biosphere, regulating climate, acting as a sink for greenhouse gases, and providing numerous other ecosystem services. However, they are negatively impacted by climatic stressors such as drought or heat waves. In this paper, we introduce FORTE, an open-source system for environmental monitoring with the aim of understanding how forests react to such stressors. It consists of two key components: (1) a wireless sensor network (WSN) deployed in the forest for data collection, and (2) a Data Infrastructure for data processing, storage, and visualization. The WSN contains a Central Unit capable of transmitting data to the Data Infrastructure via LTE-M and several spatially independent Satellites that collect data over large areas and transmit them wirelessly to the Central Unit. Our prototype deployments show that our solution is cost-effective compared to commercial solutions, energy-efficient with sensor nodes lasting for several months on a single charge, and reliable in terms of data quality. FORTE's flexible architecture makes it suitable for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications beyond forest monitoring. The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we describe the high-level requirements necessary for developing an environmental monitoring system. Second, we present an architecture and prototype implementation of the requirements by introducing our FORTE platform and demonstrating its effectiveness through multiple field tests. Lastly, we provide source code, documentation, and hardware design artifacts as part of our open-source repository.</description>

      <title>Effects and biological consequences of the predator-mediated apparent competition I: ODE models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to investigating the effects and biological consequences of the predator-mediated apparent competition based on a two prey species (one is native and the other is invasive) and one predator model with Holling type I and II functional response functions. Through the analytical results and case studies alongside numerical simulations, we find that the initial mass of the invasive prey species, capture rates of prey species, and the predator's mortality rate are all important factors determining the success/failure of invasions and the species coexistence/extinction. The global dynamics can be completely classified for the Holling type I functional response function, but can only be partially determined for the Holling type II functional response function. For the Holling type I response function, we find that whether the invasive prey species can successfully invade to promote the predator-mediated apparent competition is entirely determined by the capture rates of prey species. If the Holling type II response function is applied, then the dynamics are more complicated. First, if two prey species have the same ecological characteristics, then the initial mass of the invasive prey species is the key factor determining the success/failure of the invasion and hence the effect of the predator-mediated apparent competition. Whereas if two prey species have different ecological characteristics, say different capture rates, then the success of the invasion no longer depends on the initial mass of the invasive prey species, but on the capture rates. In all cases, if the invasion succeeds, then the predator-mediated apparent competition's effectiveness essentially depends on the predator's mortality rate.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Global Genomic Surveillance for Early Detection of Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global spread of viruses underscores the critical need for effective genomic surveillance to detect emerging variants and guide interventions. However, high costs and uneven resource distribution hinder its global implementation. This study demonstrates that optimizing genomic surveillance by targeting resources on international travelers in travel hubs, significantly improves the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using a metapopulation multiple-strain model calibrated with extensive data, we show that targeting travelers effectively reduces detection delays without additional costs in retrospective analyses of the Omicron variant outbreak. Further, simulations indicate that focusing surveillance on key travel hubs outperform baseline practices in detecting future variants, even with reduced resources. This approach also remains effective in future pandemic scenarios with varying reproductive numbers (R_eff) and vaccine effectiveness. These findings provide a sustainable framework for strengthening health security, offering actionable insights for optimizing genomic surveillance and improving preparedness for emerging infectious threats.</description>

      <title>The number of immune defense and counter-defense systems sustained in the arms race between procaryotes and viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prokaryotes have evolved various mechanisms to counter viruses, which in their turn developed numerous strategies to avoid defenses of the hosts. Dozens of such defense and counter-defense mechanisms have recently been discovered, yet the number of such systems held by a given virus or its host is limited. Here, we present numerical and theoretical arguments for the existence of the maximal number of ecologically and evolutionary sustainable defense and counter-defense systems maintained by both sides at any time of the never-ending evolutionary arms race. We find that the number of such systems is of the order of 10 for a broad range of assumptions about the costs and benefits of defense and counter-defense mechanisms and their specificity. This optimum in the number of defense and counter-defense systems appears as a result of a compromise between the metabolic and autoimmune costs of adding a new layer of defense and the benefits it conveys.</description>

      <title>From Data to Action: Charting A Data-Driven Path to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) microbes are a growing challenge in healthcare, rendering modern medicines ineffective. AMR arises from antibiotic production and bacterial evolution, but quantifying its transmission remains difficult. With increasing AMR-related data, data-driven methods offer promising insights into its causes and treatments. This paper reviews AMR research from a data analytics and machine learning perspective, summarizing the state-of-the-art and exploring key areas such as surveillance, prediction, drug discovery, stewardship, and driver analysis. It discusses data sources, methods, and challenges, emphasizing standardization and interoperability. Additionally, it surveys statistical and machine learning techniques for AMR analysis, addressing issues like data noise and bias. Strategies for denoising and debiasing are highlighted to enhance fairness and robustness in AMR research. The paper underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and awareness of data challenges in advancing AMR research, pointing to future directions for innovation and improved methodologies.</description>

      <title>Including frameworks of public health ethics in computational modelling of infectious disease interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decisions on public health interventions to control infectious disease are often informed by computational models. Interpreting the predicted outcomes of a public health decision requires not only high-quality modelling, but also an ethical framework for assessing the benefits and harms associated with different options. The design and specification of ethical frameworks matured independently of computational modelling, so many values recognised as important for ethical decision-making are missing from computational models. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept approach to incorporate multiple public health values into the evaluation of a simple computational model for vaccination against a pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2. By examining a bounded space of alternative prioritisations of values (outcome equity and aggregate benefit) we identify value trade-offs, where the outcomes of optimal strategies differ depending on the ethical framework. This work demonstrates an approach to incorporating diverse values into decision criteria used to evaluate outcomes of models of infectious disease interventions.</description>

      <title>Fractional differential equations of a reaction-diffusion SIR model involving the Caputo-fractional time-derivative and a nonlinear diffusion operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this study is to analyze a fractional parabolic SIR epidemic model of a reaction-diffusion, by using the nonlocal Caputo fractional time-fractional derivative and employing the $p$-Laplacian operator. The immunity is imposed through the vaccination program, which is regarded as a control variable. Finding the optimal control pair that reduces the number of sick people, the associated vaccination, and treatment expenses across a constrained time and space is our main study. The existence and uniqueness of the nonnegative solution for the spatiotemporal SIR model are established. It is also demonstrated that an optimal control exists. In addition, we obtain a description of the optimal control in terms of state and adjoint functions. Then, the optimality system is resolved by a discrete iterative scheme that converges after an appropriate test, similar to the forward-backward sweep method. Finally, numerical approximations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control program, which provides meaningful results using different values of the fractional order and $p$, respectively the order of the Caputo derivative and the $p$-Laplacian operators.</description>

      <title>On an RNA-membrane protogenome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selected ribonucleotide sequences bind well to zwitterionic phospholipid bilayer membranes, though randomized RNAs do not. There are no evident repeated sequences in selected membrane binding RNAs. This implies small and varied motifs responsible for membrane affinity. Such subsequences have been partially defined. Bound RNAs require divalents like Mg2+ and/or Ca2+, preferring more ordered phospholipids: gel, ripple or rafted membranes, in that order. RNAs also bind and stabilize bilayers that are bent or sharply deformed. In contrast, RNA binding without divalents extends to negatively charged membranes formed from simpler anionic phospholipids, and to plausibly prebiotic fatty acid bilayers. RNA-membranes also retain RNA function, such as base pairing, passive transport of tryptophan, specific affinity for peptide side chains, like arginine, and catalysis by ribozymic ligase. Multiple membrane-bound RNAs with biochemical functions, linked by specific base-pairing are readily constructed. Given these experimental facts, genetic effects seem plausible. RNA functions often reside in few nucleotides, and are easily joined in a small RNA. Base-paired groups of these can evolve to be purposeful, joining related RNA functions. Such RNA groups permit complex genome functions, but require only replication of short RNAs. RNA-membranes facilitate accurate RNA segregation at cell division, and quickly evolve by appending new base-paired functions. Thus, ancient RNA-membranes could act as a protogenome, supporting orderly encoded RNA expression, inheritance and evolution before DNA and the DNA genome.</description>

      <title>Genetic contribution of advantaged ancestors in the biparental Moran model -- finite selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a population of N individuals evolving according to a biparental Moran model with two types, one being advantaged compared to the other. The advantage is conferred by a Mendelian mutation, that reduces the death probability of individuals carrying it. We assume that a proportion a of individuals initially carry this mutation, which therefore eventually gets fixed with high probability. After a long time, we sample a gene uniformly from the population, at a new locus, independent of the locus under selection, and calculate the probability that this gene originated from one of the initially advantaged individuals, when population size is large. Our theorem provides quantitative insights, such as the observation that under strong selection, if only 1% of the individuals are initially advantaged, approximately 19% of the population's genome will originate from them after a long time.</description>
