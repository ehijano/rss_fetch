      <title>Interactions of a Continuous-Spin Field with a Spin-1/2 Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism for coupling a bosonic Continuous-Spin field to familiar spin-1/2 matter. To do this, we describe the matter using the supersymmetric worldline formalism. We construct currents that are local functions of worldline kinematics, and respect both the worldline supersymmetry and the conservation condition required for consistent couplings to Abelian CSP fields. As the spin Casimir $\rho$ of the CSP vanishes, the interactions reduce to that of familiar QED in one case, and to a Yukawa interaction with a spin-1/2 fermion in another case. Our formalism is applicable to computing deviations from QED if the photon is a CSP, thereby enabling a range of phenomenological studies.</description>

      <title>Absolute entropy and the observer's no-boundary state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the no-boundary proposal for closed universes with an observer. We argue that the observer's no-boundary state is the identity operator on the physical Hilbert space, i.e. the maximum entropy state. Geometrically, the no-boundary state is a bra-ket wormhole. Our result is consistent with all previously discussed cases of traces for invariantly defined regions. We explicitly show that the observer's no-boundary state is an identity operator in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Expectation values in the no-boundary state provide a trace for the observer's algebra, which allows one to define von Neumann entropy for observers in different universes as the relative entropy with respect to the no-boundary state.</description>

      <title>(-1)-Form Symmetries and Anomaly Shifting from SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate (-1)-form symmetries using the framework of symmetry topological field theories. Previous studies of (-1)-form symmetries have primarily focused on SymTFTs with topological point operators. Here we examine SymTFTs devoid of point operators, constructed to realize zero-form symmetries of some physical theory. In this context we identify codimension-one defects within the bulk of SymTFT constructed via higher gauging which can be interpreted as the generators of the (-1)-form symmetry of the absolute theory. In addition, we present examples where (-1)-form symmetries exhibit the novel ability to shift the 't Hooft anomalies of the theory.</description>

      <title>Serendipitous Syzygies of Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear relations between color-ordered all-plus amplitudes at one loop in Yang--Mills theory. We show that on general grounds, there are $(n-1)!/2-2$ relations for $n\ge 5$, leaving only two independent color-ordered amplitudes. We present two complementary approaches to finding such relations: one using numerical linear algebra and the other using syzygies in computational algebraic geometry. We obtain explicit forms for all relations through $n=7$. We also study relations for the tree-level MHV amplitudes through $n=8$. The latter relations include the well-known color and Bern--Carrasco--Johansson identities.</description>

      <title>Fortuity within Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BPS states in holographic CFTs naturally split into those describing black holes in the bulk and those that do not, with black hole states only existing above a certain energy threshold. In the context of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ duality this can be seen from the agreement of the CFT and supergraviton supersymmetric indices up to a certain central charge-scaling conformal dimension. However, there also exist additional smooth horizonless bulk configurations called singletons that have not been previously accounted for when distinguishing black hole states from non-black hole states. These singletons describe bulk degrees of freedom that are non-trivial on the AdS$_3$ boundary. From a detailed analysis of BPS states in the D1-D5 system we identify singleton states in $\mathrm{Sym}^N(T^4)$ and $\mathrm{Sym}^N(K3)$ and explicitly incorporate them into a generalised supergraviton index for $N=2$, leading to an enhanced matching with the CFT index in the case of $T^4$. These singleton states are fortuitous despite corresponding to smooth horizonless solutions in the bulk, suggesting that fortuity on its own is not always sufficient for distinguishing black hole states.</description>

      <title>On the information behavior from quadratically coupled accelerated detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to investigate the information behavior of quantum systems through accelerated detectors quadratically coupled with a massless scalar field. In addition, we made detailed comparisons with the case of linear coupling. The perturbative method was used to evolve the density matrix that describes the interaction of the detector-field system during a finite time. The systems studied were: accelerated single-qubit, quantum interferometric circuit, and the which-path distinguishability circuit. The results on the probability transition rates show that quadratic coupling amplifies the Unruh effect. This is due to the modification of the interaction structure, allowing the simultaneous absorption of multiple quanta. Our findings showed that the information is degraded more quickly in the case of quadratic coupling, when compared to the linear case. Furthermore, this change is mainly given by the coupling constant and by an additional factor that arises in the case of quadratic coupling. Therefore, these results indicate that the nature of the coupling between the detector and the field plays a fundamental role in the behavior of quantum information in high acceleration regimes.</description>

      <title>Beyond Noether: A Covariant Study of Poisson-Lie Symmetries in Low Dimensional Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore global Poisson-Lie (PL) symmetries using a Lagrangian, or ``covariant phase space" approach, that manifestly preserves spacetime covariance. PL symmetries are the classical analog of quantum-group symmetries. In the Noetherian framework symmetries leave the Lagrangian invariant up to boundary terms and necessarily yield (on closed manifolds) $\mathfrak{g}^{*}$-valued conserved charges which serve as Hamiltonian generators of the symmetry itself. Non-trivial PL symmetries transcend this framework by failing to be symplectomorphisms and by admitting (conserved) non-Abelian group-valued momentum maps. In this paper we discuss various structural and conceptual challenges associated with the implementation of PL symmetries in field theory, focusing in particular on non-locality. We examine these issues through explicit examples of low-dimensional field theories with non-trivial PL symmetries: the deformed spinning top (or, the particle with curved momentum and configuration space) in 0+1D; the non-linear $\sigma$-model by Klim\v{c}\'ik and \v{S}evera (KS) in 1+1D; and gravity with a cosmological constant in 2+1D. Although these examples touch on systems of different dimensionality, they are all ultimately underpinned by 2D $\sigma$-models, specifically the A-model and KS model.</description>

      <title>S-duality of boundary lines in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theories and supersymmetric indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the supersymmetric defect indices of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang Mills theories which are simultaneously decorated by the BPS line operators and the boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the two-point functions of the boundary 't Hooft lines of magnetic charges associated with the minuscule representations in the presence of the regular Nahm pole boundary conditions can be obtained by applying the Higgsing prescription to the half-indices of the Dirichlet boundary conditions. Accordingly, we find precise matching of the indices for pairs of the S-dual configurations with the Wilson lines and Neumann boundary conditions and those with the 't Hooft lines and the regular Nahm pole boundary conditions. Alternatively, we analytically compute the indices by means of the inner product of the Macdonald polynomials to find the exact closed-form expressions.</description>

      <title>Non-Factorizing Interface in the Two-Dimensional Long-Range Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The factorization proposal claims that the co-dimension one "pinning defect", on which a local relevant operator is integrated, factorizes the space into two halves in general conformal field theories in the infrared limit. In this letter, we study a two-dimensional long-range Ising model at criticality with a line defect or an interface, which physically corresponds to changing the local temperature on it. We show that in the perturbative regime, it is not factorizing even in the infrared limit. An intuitive explanation of the non-factorization is that the long-range Ising model is equivalent to a local conformal field theory in higher dimensions. In this picture, the space is still connected through the "extra dimension" across the defect line.</description>

      <title>More on 8d non-supersymmetric branes and heterotic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the maximal gauge groups arising in $E_8$ heterotic string theory on $T^2$. Our analysis proceeds along two approaches. First, we start the moduli space of the supersymmetric heterotic string theory on $T^2$ focusing on points of maximal gauge enhancement. At these special points, the charge lattice can exhibit a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ outer automorphism corresponding to the bulk gauge symmetry. By orbifolding the worldsheet theory by it with the fermion parity, we obtain the maximal gauge group of the $E_8$ theory. Second, we directly study the toroidal compactification of 10d $E_8$ heterotic string. Both approaches agree, yielding a classification of $22$ maximal gauge groups. For each case, we present the corresponding massless spectrum. In light of the no global symmetry/cobordism conjecture in quantum gravity, our result also offer a classification of non-supersymmetric branes in 8d supersymmetric heterotic string theories.</description>

      <title>Geometric duality between effective field theories I: scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel type of duality that connects a sequence of well-known theories with even-multiplicity scalar amplitudes: it relates the Yang-Mills theory coupled to a specific scalar matter sector to the nonlinear sigma model on a symmetric coset space, the (multiflavor) Dirac-Born-Infeld theory, and the special Galileon theory. The duality is manifested with the help of a covariant formulation of the classical equations of motion that features a contact quartic scalar self-coupling combined with propagation on a dynamical background of elementary or composite gauge fields. This is augmented with a set of constitutive relations that reflect the intrinsic or extrinsic geometry of the target space of the theory. The universality of the underlying geometric structure allows for an unambiguous mapping between different theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic monopole is one of the important problems in the early stage of universe as well as observations and experiments on Earth. We study the existence or non-existence of the Dirac and the 't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopole theories using the pre-potential $\boldsymbol{C}$, which is defined to derive the vector potential by the curl operation as $\boldsymbol{A}=\nabla \times \boldsymbol{C}$ . We assert that the magnetic singularity exists for the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole in SO(3) gauge theory, as well as for the Dirac monopole in U(1) gauge theory. The regularization method confirms our assertion.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Tunneling from Conifold Transitions in IIB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum tunneling process through a topology transition near a conifold singularity, in the setup of IIB CY3 orientifold compactification. We propose a novel method to do moduli stabilization in an extended moduli space, parametrized by both the geometric moduli and the light D3-brane wrapping modes arisen from the brane quantization. Assuming the absence of flux through the vanishing exceptional 3-cycle, we find two types of vacuum solutions, one corresponds to the resolved conifold and the other one is interpreted as a novel non-geometric phase. We compute the quantum tunneling rate between these two solutions and find that it is difficult to achieve a significantly large tunneling rate in the controllable regime.</description>

      <title>A Deep Dive into classical and Topological CFT Thermodynamics in Lifshitz and Hyperscaling Violating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To effectively utilize the AdS/CFT correspondence, a precise set of rules must be established to guide the translation of computed quantities in the gravitational sector into their CFT counterparts, and vice versa. This framework is commonly referred to as the holographic dictionary. The formulation of such dictionaries opens a two-way gateway, allowing researchers to extend theoretical principles and findings from one domain into the other for further exploration and study. The development of a holographic dictionary for Lifshitz black holes and hyperscaling violation (HSV) models \cite{6} has provided an essential foundation for studying CFT thermodynamics and phase behavior of these black holes. Based on this framework, we will investigate their thermodynamic properties using two distinct approaches. In the first step, we adopt the classical and traditional method, identifying critical points to examine the behavior of the free energy function as a function of temperature near the critical boundary. By analyzing its behavior, we will study phase transitions and then proceed to evaluate the stability of the models. In the next step, to compare both methodologies and highlight their equivalence, particularly demonstrating the accessibility of the topological method compared to the classical approach, we will analyze phase behavior through the lens of topological charges.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By formulating the renormalization group as a quantum channel acting on density matrices in Quantum Field Theories (QFTs), we show that ground-state expectation values of observables supported on slow momentum modes can be approximated by their averages on the fixed-point theories to which the QFTs flow. This is done by studying the fidelity between ground states of different QFTs and arriving at certain hyperscaling relations satisfied at criticality. Our results allow for a clear identification of cases in which one can replace a QFT by its scale-invariant limit in the calculation of expectation values, opening the way for the application of numerical and analytical methods to as of yet difficult computer simulation of critical models.</description>

      <title>Detector Based Evaluation of Extractable Entanglement in Flat spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) is widely used to quantify quantum correlations in field theory, with the well-known result in two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) predicting a logarithmic divergence with the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff. However, this expression lacks operational meaning: it remains unclear how much of the entanglement is physically extractable via local measurements. In this work, we investigate the operationally accessible entanglement by employing a pair of Unruh-DeWitt detectors, each interacting with complementary regions of a quantum field. We derive an upper bound on the entanglement that can be harvested by such detectors and show that it scales as a double logarithm with respect to the UV cutoff-significantly weaker than the single-logarithmic divergence of the standard CFT result. This work provides an operational perspective on field-theoretic entanglement and sets fundamental limits on its extractability.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Bremsstrahlung in Black-Hole Scattering at $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$: Quadratic-in-Spin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are employing a supersymmetric variant of the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) formalism to compute the far-field momentum-space gravitational waveform emitted during the scattering of two spinning black holes at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the post-Minkowskian expansion. Our results are accurate up to quadratic-in-spin contributions, which means we report for the very first time the waveform observable at the order $\mathcal{O}(G^3\mathcal{S}^2)$. Our computation is based on mapping $n$-body tree-level amplitudes in such a way that we can obtain the $(n-2)$-loop two-body waveform integrand. We discuss in detail this procedure and highlight the similarity of the resulting structures with those obtained in the scattering-amplitude approach. As a by product of our computational approach, we also obtain, for the first time, the leading-order waveform for three-body scattering of spinning black holes. We validated our results in various ways but most notably, we find exact agreement for the NLO waveform integrand obtained from the WQFT and the classical limit of scattering amplitudes in QFT.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic grand unification in SO(10) with one extra dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic grand unification provides an alternative approach to gradually unify gauge couplings in the UV limit, where they reach a non-trivial UV fixed point. Using an economical and realistic particle content setup, we demonstrate that asymptotic grand unification can be achieved in a 5D SO(10) model with one extra dimension. The top, bottom and tau masses are split, and the smallness of the neutrino mass is explained via inverse seesaw. One intermediate scale, the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale, is included below the compactification scale. Due to the absence of large-dimensional Higgs representations, gauge couplings exhibit asymptotic safety and are thus asymptotically unified, regardless of their initial values. In contrast, Yukawa couplings can achieve asymptotic freedom if the negative gauge contributions dominate over the positive Yukawa terms, requiring exact unification at the compactification scale. The widely-used 126-dimensional Higgs is not recommended in this 5D asymptotic SO(10) GUT, as it tends to drive the gauge beta function positive, compromising asymptotic safety.</description>

      <title>Alternative Action for Generalized Unimodular Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an alternative formulation of generalized unimodular gravity (GUMG), a class of modifications to general relativity characterized by a special partial breaking of general coordinate covariance. The action for this formulation is derived constructively through a sequence of equivalent representations, starting from the original GUMG setup and extending the configuration space and gauge structure by introducing time parametrization. Our approach, based on a canonical formalism, parallels the method used by Henneaux and Teitelboim to covariantize the action of unimodular gravity (UMG), which was generalized to consistently accommodate a parameterization via local fields for the entire GUMG family. For completeness, we explore the dynamical structure of the theory and provide a detailed account of its gauge properties. A notable consequence of the consistent parametrization is the emergence of explicit spatial delocalization in the action, manifestations of which we carefully examine. Within the GUMG family, we identify a subfamily of models described by a local action. While preserving the essential structural features, these models avoid the complications of spatial nonlocality allowing a clearer analysis. The dynamical and constraint structures of GUMG family models are different from those of UMG, however the latter appears as an exceptional special case within the family, providing valuable comparative insights.</description>

      <title>Ordering the topological order in the fractional quantum Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possible topological order/topological quantum field theory of different quantum Hall systems. Given the value of the Hall conductivity, we constrain the global symmetry of the low-energy theory and its anomaly. Specifically, the one-form global symmetry and its anomaly are presented as the organizing principle of these systems. This information is powerful enough to lead to a unique minimal topological order (or a small number of minimal topological orders). Almost all of the known experimentally discovered topological orders are these minimal theories. Since this work is interdisciplinary, we made a special effort to relate to people with different backgrounds by providing translations between different perspectives.</description>

      <title>Are magnetic fields in cosmic voids primordial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of magnetic fields in the voids of the large-scale structure of the Universe has been a multifaceted open puzzle for decades. On one hand, their origin is not clear with most of the magnetogenesis models using physics beyond the standard model in the early Universe, and on the other hand, their existence and potential role in explaining the spectra of TeV blazars have been intensely debated in the past decade. Here, we show that void fields must exist and can be generated using classical electrodynamics in the late Universe. Specifically, we use the dipole component of the galactic fields, decaying as $r^{-3}$, and show that this generates space-filling magnetic fields in voids with sufficient amplitude to explain the blazar spectra and the lack of GeV halos observed by Fermi-LAT. Our results also show that the void fields might be too strong even for Cherenkov Telescope Array to observe the GeV halos. While primordial magnetic fields could still have been generated through some non-standard physics in the early Universe, our results show that the need for primordial magnetic fields is not strengthened by the presence of void magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Radiative neutrino mass models from non-invertible selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply non-invertible selection rules coming from a fusion algebra to radiative neutrino mass models where fields are labeled by the elements in the algebra. Since non-invertible selection rules only hold at tree level, radiative corrections naturally explain the origin of tiny neutrino masses. Furthermore, a remnant symmetry of the fusion algebra protects the stability of dark matter, which is conventionally imposed in radiative neutrino models. We also find that interesting neutrino mass textures are realized by assigning fields to family-dependent elements in the algebra.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Large-Scale Structures in the Anisotropies of the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the cross-correlation between the anisotropies of the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB) and the galaxy density contrast. We show that the cross-correlation is non-zero due to the {\it late} integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect experienced by tensor modes. We study the detection prospects of the cross-correlation signal against cosmic variance (CV), and in the light of incoming LSS and GW surveys, where we found that the signal under certain conditions could be distinguishable from noise. In addition, by considering a CGWB sourced by scalar-induced gravitational waves, and the inclusion of a scale-dependent galaxy bias, we use the cross-correlation to forecast local primordial non-Gaussianity, where we find $\sigma(f_\text{NL}^\text{loc})\sim10$ for CV only and a LSST-like survey. Moreover, by combining the Fisher information of CGWB$\times$LSS with LSS, we are able to improve the constraints by 4\% compared to an LSS-only analysis. Our results imply that a cross-correlation between GW anisotropies and LSS can indeed come from a stochastic background of cosmological origin and could be used to distinguish it from an astrophysical one.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes from EFT of Black Hole Perturbations in Vector-Tensor Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric black hole background with a timelike vector field based on the effective field theory (EFT) approach. We derive the quadratic Lagrangian written in terms of two master variables, corresponding to the tensor and vector gravitons, which are coupled in general, while they can be decoupled on a stealth Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) background. For the stealth Schwarzschild background, we find that the quasinormal mode frequencies for both degrees of freedom are obtained from those in general relativity by simple scaling. Nonetheless, due to the fact that the metric perturbation is a non-trivial linear combination of the two degrees of freedom with different QNM spectra, the ringdown gravitational waves may exhibit characteristic modulation that can in principle be a signature of vector-tensor gravity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate hidden symmetries in minimally coupled scalar field cosmology within the FLRW universe, and a perfect fluid with and without interaction to the scalar field. We show that for an exponential potential there exists a set of canonical transformations through which the cosmological field equations can be recast in the form of a free particle in flat space. Based on this equivalence, we construct a mapping that generates cosmological solutions with interaction terms, corresponding to a chameleon mechanism. Finally, we discuss how this class of canonical transformations can relate the solution spaces of different cosmological models, such as of the scalar field and of the $\Lambda$-Cosmology.</description>

Abstract: It has recently been shown that one can derive consistent thermodynamical expressions in the Lorentzian Taub--NUT spacetime keeping the Misner-string singularities and taking into account their contributions in the Komar integrals. We show how the same results are obtained when the Mister-string singularities are removed by using Misner's procedure because, even though the complete spacetime has no such singularities anymore, they are unavoidable in all spacelike hypersurfaces which are used in the Komar integrals. Different choices of hypersurfaces may contain different strings and lead to different physics, though.</description>

Abstract: In this Letter, we numerically present the possibility of the first-order phase transition occurring through the thermal fluctuation in the early universe. We find that when the temperature is slightly higher than the mass scale of the background field, the bubble-like field configurations appear proceeded by oscillons, which expand and collide to finish the phase transition. We provide the false vacuum decay rate and the accompanied gravitational waves. We also present the vacuum phase transition comparison of the quantum tunneling case and thermal fluctuation case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotically Weyl-invariant gravity (AWIG) is further developed within the Palatini formalism as a power-counting renormalizable alternative to general relativity (GR). An expression for the dimensionless exponent n(R) is derived based on dynamical dimensional reduction. We show that this version of AWIG naturally resolves several theoretical issues normally associated with the Palatini formalism. A falsifiable prediction regarding the frequency of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is made. A preliminary analysis of gravitational wave GW150914 yields a maximum tension of 0.9{\sigma} with GR and marginally favours AWIG. A similar analysis of gravitational wave GW151226 yields a maximum tension of 2.7{\sigma} with GR and favours AWIG more significantly.</description>

      <title>A fast deep-learning approach to probing primordial black hole populations in gravitational wave events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), envisioned as a compelling dark matter candidate and a window onto early-Universe physics, may contribute to the part of the gravitational-wave (GW) signals detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. Traditional hierarchical Bayesian analysis, which relies on precise GW-event posterior estimates, for extracting the information of potential PBH population from GW events become computationally prohibitive for catalogs of hundreds of events. Here, we present a fast deep-learning framework, leveraging Transformer and normalizing flows, that maps GW-event posterior samples to joint posterior distributions over the hyperparameters of the PBH population. Our approach yields accurate credible intervals while reducing end-to-end inference time to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ s on a single GPU. These results underscore the potential of deep learning for fast, high-accurately PBH population studies in the era of next-generation GW detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ground-state entanglement entropy in inhomogeneous free-boson models in one spatial dimension. We develop a powerful method to extract the leading term in the entanglement scaling, based on the analytic properties of the inhomogeneous potential. This method is applicable to a broad class of models with smooth spatial inhomogeneities. As a case study, we apply this approach for a family of exactly-solvable models characterized by orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme, finding a perfect match between the numerical and analytical results.</description>

      <title>Rescuing 331 bileptons from the Landau pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the particles being searched for at the LHC beyond the Standard Model are bileptons, which are doubly charged gauge bosons. Bileptons are predicted by several Standard Model extensions, including the so-called 331 models with $\beta = \sqrt 3$. The minimal formulation of these models is generally plagued by a "low energy" Landau pole, which can undermine current predictions for TeV-scale bileptons. We analyze this issue and investigate the possibility to shift the Landau pole at higher energy scales by extending the troublesome minimal 331 models.</description>

      <title>Landau Instability and soliton formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.06232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider at a finite temperature $T$ a superfluid moving with a velocity $v$ relative to the thermal bath or its normal component. From Landau's argument there exists a critical $v_c (T)$ beyond which excitations can be spontaneously generated and the system becomes unstable. Identifying the final state induced by such an instability has been an outstanding open question. Using holographic duality we perform dynamical simulations of evolutions from initial unstable states, and find that the system settles to a homogenous superfluid state with a final velocity below the critical velocity. The dynamical evolution process appears to be highly chaotic, exhibiting transient turbulence. Nevertheless we are able to identify from the simulations a universal physical mechanism for the reduction of superfluid velocity, in terms of spontaneous nucleation of solitons. We also derive a simple analytic formula which relates the final velocity to the number of solitons nucleated during the evolution.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking mechanisms of the 3BF action for the Standard Model coupled to gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the details of the explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking of the constrained 3BF action representing the Standard Model coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravity. First we discuss how each particular constraint breaks the original symmetry of the topological 3BF action. Then we investigate the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism for the electroweak theory in the constrained 3BF form, in order to demonstrate that they can indeed be performed in the framework of higher gauge theory. A formulation of the Proca action as a constrained 3BF theory is also studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Modified 3D Massive Abelian 2-From Theory with a Single Pseudo-Scalar Field as a Phantom Field: BRST Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the off-shell nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry transformations (corresponding to the infinitesimal classical gauge symmetry transformations) for the modified massive three $(2+1)$-dimensional (3D) Abelian 2-form gauge theory with a single pseudo-scalar field. The latter field (having the negative kinetic term and a well-defined mass) has already been shown (i) to exist in the modified version of the standard 3D St${\ddot u}$ckelberg formalism (on the solid mathematical grounds), (ii) to be a possible candidate for the ``phantom" field of some of the cosmological models of the Universe, and (iii) to be a possible candidate for dark matter. A couple of highlights of our present endeavor are (i) the observation that, even though the pseudo-scalar field does not transform under the gauge and (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations, it appears in the first-class constraints which annihilate the physical states at the quantum level, and (ii) the Noether conserved (anti-)BRST charges are found to be non-nilpotent. In our present investigation, we derive (i) the coupled (but equivalent) BRST and anti-BRST invariant Lagrangian densities, (ii) the conserved and off-shell nilpotent versions of the (anti-)BRST charges and the conserved ghost charge, (iii) the (anti-)BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions, and (iv) the standard BRST algebra amongst the conserved and nilpotent (anti-)BRST charges and conserved ghost charge of our theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the question of whether holographic entropy inequalities obeyed in static states (by the RT formula) are always obeyed in time-dependent states (by the HRT formula), focusing on the case where the bulk spacetime is 2+1 dimensional. An affirmative answer to this question was previously claimed by Czech-Dong. We point out an error in their proof when the bulk is multiply connected. We nonetheless find strong support, of two kinds, for an affirmative answer in that case. We extend the Czech-Dong proof for simply-connected spacetimes to spacetimes with $\pi_1=\mathbb{Z}$ (i.e. 2-boundary, genus-0 wormholes). Specializing to vacuum solutions, we also numerically test thousands of distinct inequalities (including all known RT inequalities for up to 6 regions) on millions of randomly chosen configurations of regions and bulk spacetimes, including three different multiply-connected topologies; we find no counterexamples. In an appendix, we prove some (dimension-independent) facts about degenerate HRT surfaces and symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brick wall model is a semi-classical approach to understanding the microscopic origin of black hole entropy. We outline the formalism for the brick wall model in arbitrary number of dimensions and generalize it to include both charged spacetimes and charged probes in order to systematically show how to calculate the entropy for any black hole, in higher orders of the WKB approximation. We calculate the entropy for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and charged BTZ black holes, and by looking at the chargeless limits we recover the entropy of the Schwarzschild and neutral BTZ black holes. We also study noncommutative corrections to the black hole entropy by using a Drinfeld twist to deform spacetime symmetries. Using the noncommutative action for a charged scalar field, we derive the noncommutative Klein-Gordon equation and the radial equation in arbitrary dimension on which we generalize the brick wall method. We study case by case the noncommutative Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and noncommutative charged BTZ black holes, the entropy of which we calculate using the generalized brick wall method. Corrections due to higher order in the WKB approximation arise, and they are given by the logarithms of the black hole area. The corrections in the lowest order of WKB due to noncommutativity are also given by the logarithms of the black hole area.</description>

      <title>Black Mirrors: CPT-Symmetric Alternatives to Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein's equations imply that a gravitationally collapsed object forms an event horizon. But what lies on the other side of this horizon? In this paper, we question the reality of the conventional solution (the black hole), and point out another, topologically distinct solution: the black mirror. In the black hole solution, the horizon connects the exterior metric to an interior metric which contains a curvature singularity. In the black mirror, the horizon instead connects the exterior metric to its own CPT mirror image, yielding a solution with smooth, bounded curvature. We give the general stationary (charged, rotating) black mirror solution explicitly, and also describe the general black mirror formed by gravitational collapse. The black mirror is the relevant stationary point when the quantum path integral is equipped with suitably CPT-symmetric boundary conditions, that we propose. It appears to avoid many vexing puzzles which plague the conventional black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an alternative description of generalized unimodular gravity (GUMG), extending the Henneaux-Teitelboim approach to unimodular gravity (UMG). The central feature of this formulation is the consistent incorporation of time reparameterization, which enhances the gauge structure and reveals a spatial nonlocality hidden in the dynamics of the original formulation. We examine the resulting dynamics, emphasizing the effects of spatial nonlocality, and outline the constraint structure. We show that the gauge symmetry in the gravitational sector is extended by a functionally incomplete symmetry, as occurs in the unimodular gravity. However, in contrast to the latter, the resulting action is not fully diffeomorphism-invariant.</description>

      <title>Large quark mass Euler-Heisenberg type action for QCD with quark sources and its Abelian limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quark determinant in the presence of a background gluon field is calculated in a large quark mass approach within a derivative expansion by considering quark sources. The resulting low-energy QCD Effective Field Theory (EFT) is valid for non-homogeneous fields and it presents, besides the usual Euler-Heisenberg type gluon self-interactions, different types of corrections to the minimal quark-gluon interaction among which there are several imaginary terms. The Abelian limit of this effective action, i.e. an expanded Euler-Heisenberg effective action with fermion sources, is also found and it is shown to contain, therefore, corrections to the fermion-photon interactions, including imaginary terms. Different resulting properties are calculated such as: their contributions to the energy-momentum tensor and its trace, the Poynting vector, the chromo-electric permittivity and chromo-magnetic permeability. Conditions for these quantities, as well as for the corresponding Abelian limits, to be real are exhibited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the growth and saturation of Krylov spread (K-) complexity under random quantum circuits. In Haar-random unitary evolution, we show that, for large system sizes, K-complexity grows linearly before saturating at a late-time value of $D/2$, where $D$ is the Hilbert space dimension, at timescales $\sim D$. Our numerical analysis encompasses two classes of random circuits: brick-wall random unitary circuits and Floquet random circuits. In brick-wall case, K-complexity exhibits dynamics consistent with Haar-random unitary evolution, while the inclusion of measurements significantly slows its growth down. For Floquet random circuits, we show that localized phases lead to reduced late-time saturation values of K-complexity, forbye we utilize these saturation values to probe the transition between thermal and many-body localized phases.</description>

Abstract: Massive scalar fields are promising candidates to address many unresolved problems in fundamental physics. We report the first model-agnostic Bayesian search of massive scalar fields in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational-wave data. We find no evidence for such fields and place the most stringent upper limits on their coupling for scalar masses $\lesssim 2\times10^{-12}\,{\rm eV}$. We exemplify the strength of these bounds by applying them to massive scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, finding the tightest constraints on the coupling constant to date, $\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm GB}}\lesssim 1\,{\rm km}$ for scalar masses $\lesssim 10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ to 90% confidence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the bitstring probabilities of ground states of bipartitioned ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the mutual information which is a lower bound on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. We show that in many cases, these lower bounds can be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). We propose a heuristic based on the change of the conditional entropy under filtering that very effectively improves the estimate of $S^{vN}_A$. We consider various sizes, lattice spacings and bipartitions. Our numerical investigation suggest that the filtered mutual information obtained with samples having just a few thousand bitstrings can provide reasonably close estimates of $S^{vN}_A$. We briefly discuss practical implementations with the QuEra's Aquila device.</description>

      <title>Beyond Buchdahl's limit: bilayered stars and thin-shell configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the theoretical motivations behind the belief that black holes as described by general relativity exist in nature is that it is hard to find matter configurations that mimic their properties, especially their compactness. One of the classic results that goes in this direction is the socalled Buchdahl limit: a bound for the maximum compactness that spherically symmetric isotropic fluid spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium can possibly achieve with an outward-decreasing energy density. However, physically realistic situations could violate both isotropy and the monotonicity of the density profile. Notably, Bondi already showed that if the density profile is allowed to be arbitrary (but remains non-negative), a less restrictive compactness bound emerges. Furthermore, if negative energy densities are permitted, configurations can approach the black hole compactness limit arbitrarily closely. In this work we introduce a set of simple bilayered and thin-shell toy models designed to illustrate the effect of relaxing separately the assumptions of Buchdahl's theorem. Within these models we highlight the existence of two special examples that we have called AdS stars and Einstein Static stars. We also discuss how these toy models may represent some of the main features of realistic systems, and how they could be extended to find more refined models.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Primordial Curvature Perturbations via Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many early universe scenarios predict an enhancement of scalar perturbations at scales currently unconstrained by cosmological probes. These perturbations source gravitational waves (GWs) at second order in perturbation theory, leading to a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background. The LISA detector, sensitive to mHz GWs, will be able to constrain curvature perturbations in a new window corresponding to scales $k \in [10^{10}, 10^{14}] \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, difficult to probe otherwise. In this work, we forecast the capabilities of LISA to constrain the source of SIGWs using different approaches: i) agnostic, where the spectrum of curvature perturbations is binned in frequency space; ii) template-based, modeling the curvature power spectrum based on motivated classes of models; iii) ab initio, starting from first-principles model of inflation featuring an ultra-slow roll phase. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We also discuss the impact on the SIGW spectrum of non-standard thermal histories affecting the kernels of SIGW emission and non-Gaussianity in the statistics of the curvature perturbations. Finally, we propose simple tests to assess whether the signal is compatible with the SIGW hypothesis. The pipeline used is built into the SIGWAY code.</description>

      <title>Late-time cosmic acceleration from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

      <title>Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in classical many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Integrability and Chaos via fractal analysis of Spectral Form Factors: Gaussian approximations and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.</description>

      <title>Classical integrable spin chains of Landau-Lifshitz type from R-matrix identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a family of 1+1 classical integrable space-discrete models of the Landau-Lifshitz type through the usage of ansatz for $U$-$V$ (Lax) pair with spectral parameter satisfying the semi-discrete Zakharov-Shabat equation. The ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair is based on $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation and certain additional properties. Equations of motion are obtained using a set of $R$-matrix identities. In the continuous limit we reproduce the previously known family of the higher rank Landau-Lifshitz equations.</description>

      <title>Precise calculation of the EFT likelihood with primordial non-Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a precise calculation of the effective field theory (EFT) conditional likelihood for large-scale structure (LSS) using the saddle-point expansion method in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG). The precision is manifested at two levels: one corresponding to the consideration of higher-order noise terms, and the other to the inclusion of contributions around the saddle points. In computing the latter, we encounter the same issue of the negative modes as in the context of false vacuum decay, which necessitates deforming the original integration contour into a combination of the steepest descent contours to ensure a convergent and real result. We demonstrate through detailed calculations that, upon incorporating leading-order PNG, both types of extensions introduce irreducible field-dependent contributions to the conditional likelihood. This insight motivates the systematic inclusion of additional effective terms within the forward modeling framework. Our work facilitates Bayesian forward modeling under non-Gaussian initial conditions, thereby enabling more stringent constraints on the parameters describing PNG.</description>
