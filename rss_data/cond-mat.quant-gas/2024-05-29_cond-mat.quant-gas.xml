      <title>Photonic Bose-Einstein condensation in the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the photon Bose-Einstein condensate in the limit of small mode spacing. Alongside the well-known threshold of the phase transition at large mode spacings, we find an emergence of a second threshold for sufficiently small mode spacings, defining the crossover to a fully condensed state. Furthermore, we present our findings for the mode occupations in the precondensate or supercooling region towards the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Synthetic non-Abelian charges in degenerate Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases associated with non-Abelian charges can exhibit a distinguished bulk-edge correspondence compared to Abelian phases, although elucidating this relationship remains challenging in traditional solid-state systems. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for synthesizing non-Abelian quaternion charges in degenerate Fermi gases. By designing artificial spin-orbit coupling patterns, the topological edge modes demonstrate a clear correspondence with the band topology determined by various quaternion charges. This paves the way for observing the interface modes whose existence is attributed to the non-conservation multiplication relation, which is fundamental to non-Abelian charges. This scheme can be readily implemented using current ultracold atom techniques, offering a promising approach to explore the intriguing non-Abelian characteristics of the system.</description>

      <title>A correspondence between Maxwell--Einstein theory and superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A planar superfluid is considered and interpreted in terms of electromagnetism and gravity. It has previously been suggested that the superfluid flow can be regarded as analogous to an electromagnetic field and that a non-vanishing density gradient give rise to a gravity-like force. The present work seeks to reconcile these hitherto distinct pictures into a unified exposition of vortex electrodynamics in a curved analogue space-time. By constructing a theory in which the planar Maxwell's equations are coupled to a (d+1)-dimensional conformally curved space-time, we expose a correspondence between the resulting equations of motion of the embedded fields and the dynamics of a quantum fluid. Finally, an effective vortex metric whose connection components are torsional is studied and its effect on the superfluid Maxwell's equations is elucidated upon.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of long-range interacting Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem of out-of-equilibrium physics is the speed at which the order parameter grows upon crossing a phase transition. Here, we investigate the dynamics of ordering in a Fermi gas undergoing a density-wave phase transition induced by quenching of long-range, cavity-mediated interactions. We observe in real-time the exponential rise of the order parameter and track its growth over several orders of magnitude. Remarkably, the growth rate is insensitive to the contact interaction strength from the ideal gas up to the unitary limit and can exceed the Fermi energy by an order of magnitude, in quantitative agreement with a linearized instability analysis. We then generalize our results to linear interaction ramps, where deviations from the adiabatic behaviour are captured by a simple dynamical ansatz. Our study offers a paradigmatic example of the interplay between non-locality and non-equilibrium dynamics, where universal scaling behaviour emerges despite strong interactions at the microscopic level.</description>

      <title>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phase and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu$ = 1/2 filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta $M$ and $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF($M$) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class and more exotic beyond-Landau ones. Our work thence presents a direct numerical evidence of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topological ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling the interactions in a cold atom quantum impurity system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement an experimental architecture in which a single atom of K is trapped in an optical tweezer, and is immersed in a bath of Rb atoms at ultralow temperatures. In this regime, the motion of the single trapped atom is confined to the lowest quantum vibrational levels. This realizes an elementary and fully controllable quantum impurity system. For the trapping of the K atom, we use a species-selective dipole potential, that allows us to independently manipulate the quantum impurity and the bath. We concentrate on the characterization and control of the interactions between the two subsystems. To this end, we perform Feshbach spectroscopy, detecting several inter-dimensional confinement-induced Feshbach resonances for the KRb interspecies scattering length, that parametrizes the strength of the interactions. We compare our data to a theory for inter-dimensional scattering, finding good agreement. Notably, we also detect a series of p-wave resonances stemming from the underlying free-space s-wave interactions. We further determine how the resonances behave as the temperature of the bath and the dimensionality of the interactions change. Additionally, we are able to screen the quantum impurity from the bath by finely tuning the wavelength of the light that produces the optical tweezer, providing us with a new effective tool to control and minimize the interactions. Our results open a range of new possibilities in quantum simulations of quantum impurity models, quantum information, and quantum thermodynamics, where the interactions between a quantized system and the bath is a powerful yet largely underutilized resource.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Droplets at 3D-1D Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate beyond-mean-field corrections to the energy of a one-dimensional Bose gas confined by a box potential with dipoles aligned along the unconfined direction. When the dipolar interaction reaches its critical strength, the system becomes unstable at the mean-field level. Then, similarly to the free space case, the beyond-mean-field contribution significantly alters the ground state of the system, leading to the formation of a self-bound atomic cloud known as a quantum droplet. Our analysis demonstrates that the beyond-mean-field correction can be understood as an effective three-body repulsion stabilizing the gas, preventing its collapse and leading to a finite-density solution. The quasi-1D dipolar droplets bring into play yet another subtle quantum effect: the effective three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Wehrl Entropy and Entanglement Complexity of Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wehrl entropy of a quantum state is the entropy of the coherent-state distribution function (Husimi function), and is non-zero even for pure states. We investigate the Wehrl entropy for $N$ spin-1/2 particles with respect to SU(2)$^{\otimes N}$ coherent states (i.e., the direct products of spin coherent states of each particle). We focus on: (1) The statistical interpretation of this Wehrl entropy. (2) The relationship between the Wehrl entropy and quantum entanglement. For (1), despite the coherent states not forming a group of orthonormal bases, we prove that the Wehrl entropy can still be interpreted as the entropy of a probability distribution with clear physical meaning. For (2), we numerically calculate the Wehrl entropy of various entangled pure states with particle number $2\leq N\leq 20$. Our results show that for the large-$N$ ($N\gtrsim 10$) systems the Wehrl entropy of the highly chaotic entangled states are much larger than that of the regular ones (e.g., the GHZ state). These results, together with the fact that the Wehrl entropy is invariant under local unitary transformations, indicate that the Wehrl entropy can reflect the complexity of the quantum entanglement (entanglement complexity) of many-body pure states, as A. Sugita proposed directly from the definitions of the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy (Jour. Phys. A 36, 9081 (2003)). Furthermore, the Wehrl entropy per particle can serve as a quantitative description of this complexity. We further show that the many-body pure entangled states can be classified into three types, according to the behaviors of the Wehrl entropy per particle in the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, with the states of each type having very different entanglement complexity.</description>
