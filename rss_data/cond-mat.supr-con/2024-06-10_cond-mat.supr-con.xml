      <title>Explainable Machine Learning Identification of Superconductivity from Single-Particle Spectral Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional method of identifying symmetry-breaking phase transitions through the emergence of a single-particle gap encounters significant challenges in quantum materials with strong fluctuations. To address this, we have developed a data-driven approach using a domain-adversarial neural network trained on simulated spectra of cuprates. This model compensates for the scarcity of experimental data -- a significant barrier to the wide deployment of machine learning in physical research -- by leveraging the abundance of theoretically simulated data. When applied to unlabeled experimental spectra, our model successfully distinguishes the true superconducting states from gapped fluctuating states, without the need for fine temperature sampling across the transition. Further, the explanation of our machine learning model reveals the crucial role of the Fermi-surface spectral intensity even in gapped states. It paves the way for robust and direct spectroscopic identification of fluctuating orders, particularly in low-dimensional, strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Candidate platform for studying flatband-induced spin-triplet superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential for spin-triplet superconductivity in molecular beam epitaxy-grown IV-VI semiconductor superlattices. The findings present compelling evidence for spin-triplet pairing in PbTe/SnTe by the method of soft point-contact spectroscopy and spin-polarised point-contact spectroscopy. The experimental data are understood with the Anderson-Brinkman-Morel model of p-wave electron pairing. It is pointed out that emergent superconductivity can have its origin in topological flat bands obtained due to internal stresses of the sample similar to twisted layer graphene.</description>

      <title>Vortex entropy and superconducting fluctuations in ultrathin underdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortices in superconductors can help identify emergent phenomena but certain fundamental aspects of vortices, such as their entropy, remain poorly understood. Here, we study the vortex entropy in underdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ by measuring both magneto-resistivity and Nernst effect on ultrathin flakes ($\le$2 unit-cell). We extract the London penetration depth from the magneto-transport measurements on samples with different doping levels. It reveals that the superfluid phase stiffness $\rho_s$ scales linearly with the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, down to the extremely underdoped case. On the same batch of ultrathin flakes, we measure the Nernst effect via on-chip thermometry. Together, we obtain the vortex entropy and find that it decays exponentially with $T_c$ or $\rho_s$. We further analyze the Nernst signal above $T_c$ in the framework of Gaussian superconducting fluctuations. The combination of electrical and thermoelectric measurements in the two-dimensional limit provides fresh insight into high temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>$T_c$ and the elastocaloric effect of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under $\langle 110 \rangle$ uniaxial stress: no indications of transition splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is considerable evidence that the superconductivity of Sr2RuO4 has two components. Among this evidence is a jump in the shear elastic modulus $c_{66}$ at the critical temperature $T_c$, observed in ultrasound measurements. Such a jump is forbidden for homogeneous single-component order parameters, and implies that $T_c$ should develop as a cusp under the application of shear strain with $\langle 110 \rangle$ principal axes. This shear strain should split the onset temperatures of the two components, if they coexist, or select one component if they do not. Here, we report measurements of $T_c$ and the elastocaloric effect of Sr2RuO4 under uniaxial stress applied along the $[110]$ lattice direction. Within experimental resolution, we resolve neither a cusp in the stress dependence of $T_c$, nor any second transition in the elastocaloric effect data. We show that reconciling these null results with the observed jumps in $c_{66}$ requires extraordinarily fine tuning to a triple point of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter space. In addition, our results are inconsistent with homogeneous time reversal symmetry breaking at a temperature $T_2 \leq T_c$ as identified in muon spin relaxation experiments.</description>

      <title>Normal and superconducting properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review provides a comprehensive overview of current research on the structural, electronic, and magnetic characteristics of the recently discovered high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressures. We present the experimental results for synthesizing and characterizing this material, derived from measurements of transport, thermodynamics, and various spectroscopic techniques, and discuss their physical implications. We also explore theoretical models proposed to describe the electronic structures and superconducting pairing symmetry in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, highlighting the intricate interplay between electronic correlations and magnetic interactions. Despite these advances, challenges remain in growing high-quality samples free of extrinsic phases and oxygen deficiencies and in developing reliable measurement tools for determining diamagnetism and other physical quantities under high pressures. Further investigations in these areas are essential to deepening our understanding of the physical properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and unlocking its superconducting pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the quantum nature of high spin YSR excitations in transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitations of individual and coupled spins on superconductors provide a platform to study quantum spin impurity models as well as a pathway toward realizing topological quantum computing. Here, we characterize, using ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states of individual manganese phthalocyanine molecules with high spin character on the surface of an ultra-thin lead film in variable transverse magnetic field. We observe two types of YSR excitations, depending on the adsorption geometry of the molecule. Using a zero-bandwidth model, we detail the role of the magnetic anisotropy, spin-spin exchange, and Kondo exchange. We illustrate that one molecular type can be treated as an individual spin akin to an isolated spin on the metal center, whereas the other molecular type invokes a coupled spin system represented by a spin on the center and the ligand. Using the field-dependent evolution of the YSR excitations and comparisons to modeling, we describe the quantum phase of each of the molecules. These results provide an insight into the quantum nature of YSR excitations in magnetic field, and a platform to study spin impurity models on superconductors in magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Qubit Readout with Intrinsic Resonator Reset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04891v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in quantum computing is speeding up measurement and initialization. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a dispersive measurement method for superconducting qubits that simultaneously measures the qubit and returns the readout resonator to its initial state. The approach is based on universal analytical pulses and requires knowledge of the qubit and resonator parameters, but needs no direct optimization of the pulse shape, even when accounting for the nonlinearity of the system. Moreover, the method generalizes to measuring an arbitrary number of modes and states. For the qubit readout, we can drive the resonator to $\sim 10^2$ photons and back to $\sim 10^{-3}$ photons in less than $3 \kappa^{-1}$, while still achieving a $T_1$-limited assignment error below 1\%. We also present universal pulse shapes and experimental results for qutrit readout.</description>

      <title>Intra-Family Transformation of The Bi-Te Family via in-situ Chemical Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10408v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bi-Te binary system, characterized by the homologous series of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n, has always attracted research interest for its layered structures and potential in advanced materials applications. Despite Bi2Te3 has been extensively studied, exploration of other compounds has been constrained by synthesis challenges. This study reports the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of FeTe on Bi2Te3, demonstrating that varying growth conditions can turn the Bi2Te3 layer into different Bi-Te phases and form corresponding FeTe/Bi-Te heterostructures. Our combined analysis using reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD), and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM), indicates that specific growth conditions used for the growth of the FeTe layer can facilitate the extraction of Te from Bi2Te3, leading to the formation of Bi4Te3 and Bi6Te3. Additionally, by lowering the FeTe growth temperature to 230 oC, Te extraction from the Bi2Te3 layer could be avoided, preserving the Bi2Te3 structure. Notably, all the three FeTe/Bi-Te structures exhibit superconductivity with the FeTe/Bi2Te3 heterostructure enjoying the highest superconductivity quality. These findings introduce a novel method for realizing Bi4Te3 and Bi6Te3 through Te extraction by growing FeTe on Bi2Te3, driven by the high reactivity between Fe and Te. This approach holds promise for synthesizing other members of the Bi-Te series, expanding the functional potential of these materials.</description>

      <title>Interfacial spin-orbit coupling driven enhancement of superconductivity by parallel magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that time reversal symmetry breaking perturbations such as magnetic field or scattering on magnetic impurities destruct superconductivity and suppress the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition. However, in the recent experimental studies significant enhancement of superconducting critical temperature by parallel magnetic field was found for several thin superconducting systems [H.J. Gardner, et al., Nature Physics {\bf 7}, 895 (2011); T. Asaba, et al., Scientific Reports {\bf 8}, 1 (2018) ]. Here we present a possible explanation of the observed phenomenon showing that combination of interfacial spin-orbit interaction and external magnetic field can cause the increase of the superconducting critical temperature of thin superconducting film in wide range of magnetic fields. We use the Ginzburg-Landau formalism taking into account Lifshitz invariant originated from Rashba spin-orbit interaction, which is also responsible for the superconducting diode effect. We also calculate the modification of the Little-Parks oscillations of the critical temperature of hollow superconducting cylinder at the presence of Rashba interfacial spin-orbit interaction.</description>
