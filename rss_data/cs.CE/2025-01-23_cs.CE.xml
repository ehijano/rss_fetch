      <title>A Smart IoT Framework for Climate-Resilient and Sustainable Maize Farming In Uganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a framework that incorporates the Internet of Things (IoT) technology into maize farming activities in Central Uganda as a solution to various challenges including climate change, sub-optimal resource use and low crop yields. Using IoT-based modeling and simulation, the presented solution recommends cost-effective and efficient approaches to irrigation, crop yield improvement enhancement and prevention of drinking water loss while being practical for smallholder farmers. The framework is developed in a manner that is appropriate for low resource use regions by using local strategies that are easily understandable and actionable for the farmers thus solving the issue of technology access and social economic constraints. Research in this area brought to light the promise that the IoT holds for the evolution of agriculture into a more data-informed, climate-smart sector, contributes to the much-needed food in the world, is economically viable, facilitates sustainable rural development and is a huge step for the agriculture modernization of Uganda.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Blockchain Analysis: Tackling Temporality and Scalability with an Incremental Approach with Metropolis-Hastings Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology, with implications in the financial domain, offers data in the form of large-scale transaction networks. Analyzing transaction networks facilitates fraud detection, market analysis, and supports government regulation. Despite many graph representation learning methods for transaction network analysis, we pinpoint two salient limitations that merit more investigation. Existing methods predominantly focus on the snapshots of transaction networks, sidelining the evolving nature of blockchain transaction networks. Existing methodologies may not sufficiently emphasize efficient, incremental learning capabilities, which are essential for addressing the scalability challenges in ever-expanding large-scale transaction networks. To address these challenges, we employed an incremental approach for random walk-based node representation learning in transaction networks. Further, we proposed a Metropolis-Hastings-based random walk mechanism for improved efficiency. The empirical evaluation conducted on blockchain transaction datasets reveals comparable performance in node classification tasks while reducing computational overhead. Potential applications include transaction network monitoring, the efficient classification of blockchain addresses for fraud detection or the identification of specialized address types within the network.</description>

      <title>The Finite Element Neural Network Method: One Dimensional Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of neural networks (NN) in engineering is rooted in their capacity to understand intricate patterns and complex systems, leveraging their universal nonlinear approximation capabilities and high expressivity. Meanwhile, conventional numerical methods, backed by years of meticulous refinement, continue to be the standard for accuracy and dependability. Bridging these paradigms, this research introduces the finite element neural network method (FENNM) within the framework of the Petrov-Galerkin method using convolution operations to approximate the weighted residual of the differential equations. The NN generates the global trial solution, while the test functions belong to the Lagrange test function space. FENNM introduces several key advantages. Notably, the weak-form of the differential equations introduces flux terms that contribute information to the loss function compared to VPINN, hp-VPINN, and cv-PINN. This enables the integration of forcing terms and natural boundary conditions into the loss function similar to conventional finite element method (FEM) solvers, facilitating its optimization, and extending its applicability to more complex problems, which will ease industrial adoption. This study will elaborate on the derivation of FENNM, highlighting its similarities with FEM. Additionally, it will provide insights into optimal utilization strategies and user guidelines to ensure cost-efficiency. Finally, the study illustrates the robustness and accuracy of FENNM by presenting multiple numerical case studies and applying adaptive mesh refinement techniques.</description>

      <title>Chasing price drains liquidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming that the price in a Uniswap v3 style Automated Market Maker (AMM) follows a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), we prove that the strategy that adjusts the position of liquidity to track the current price leads to a deterministic and exponentially fast decay of liquidity. Next, assuming that there is a Centralized Exchange (CEX), in which the price follows a GBM and the AMM price mean reverts to the CEX price, we show numerically that the same strategy still leads to decay. Last, we propose a strategy that increases the liquidity even without compounding fees earned through liquidity provision.</description>

      <title>A topology optimisation framework to design test specimens for one-shot identification or discovery of material models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of full-field displacement data from imaging techniques in experimental mechanics is determining a gradual shift in the paradigm of material model calibration and discovery, from using several simple-geometry tests towards a few, or even one single test with complicated geometry. The feasibility of such a "one-shot" calibration or discovery heavily relies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability to probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the stresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient for an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of the displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In this paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to optimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an anisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic, high-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of the inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy displacement measurements from digital image correlation. We discuss the choice of the cost function and the design of the topology optimisation framework, and we analyse a range of optimised topologies generated for the identification of isotropic and anisotropic elastic responses.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Historic Blackout: Decoding Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Power Outages and Disparities During Hurricane Beryl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the spatial patterns and temporal variations in outage duration, intensity, and restoration/recovery following the 2024 Hurricane Beryl in Houston, Texas. This historic blackout caused widespread power disruptions across the Houston metropolitan area, leaving more than 2 million customers without power over several days, resulting in more than 143 million total customer-out hours.The findings reveal that areas with higher population density and proximity to the hurricane's path experienced more severe initial impacts. Regions with higher median income showed faster recovery, while lower-income areas exhibited prolonged restoration periods, even with favorable infrastructural conditions, suggesting disparities in restoration speed. The study also highlights how urban development features, such as road density and land elevation, explain spatial disparities in power outage impacts and recovery. This research advances the understanding of power outage dynamics in large metropolitan regions through four key contributions: (1) empirical characterization of outages from a historic hurricane, highlighting infrastructure vulnerabilities in a high-density urban context; (2) comprehensive analysis using multiple metrics to capture spatiotemporal dynamics of outages and restoration; (3) leveraging of high-resolution outage data at fine geographic scales and frequent intervals to quantify and reveal previously masked spatial disparities; and (4) systematic examination of socioeconomic, urban development, and environmental factors in shaping disparities in outage impacts and recovery timelines. These findings provide infrastructure managers, operators, utilities, and decision-makers with crucial empirical insights to quantify power outage impacts, justify resilience investments, and address vulnerability and equity issues in the power infrastructure during hazard events.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Optimization with Implicit Constraints for Public Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18449v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) has become increasingly relevant for tackling complex decision-making problems, especially in public policy domains such as police redistricting. However, its broader application in public policymaking is hindered by the complexity of defining feasible regions and the high-dimensionality of decisions. This paper introduces a novel BBO framework, termed as the Conditional And Generative Black-box Optimization (CageBO). This approach leverages a conditional variational autoencoder to learn the distribution of feasible decisions, enabling a two-way mapping between the original decision space and a simplified, constraint-free latent space. The CageBO efficiently handles the implicit constraints often found in public policy applications, allowing for optimization in the latent space while evaluating objectives in the original space. We validate our method through a case study on large-scale police redistricting problems in Atlanta, Georgia. Our results reveal that our CageBO offers notable improvements in performance and efficiency compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>Biomedical Knowledge Graph: A Survey of Domains, Tasks, and Real-World Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) have emerged as powerful tools for organizing and leveraging the vast and complex data found across the biomedical field. Yet, current reviews of BKGs often limit their scope to specific domains or methods, overlooking the broader landscape and the rapid technological progress reshaping it. In this survey, we address this gap by offering a systematic review of BKGs from three core perspectives: domains, tasks, and applications. We begin by examining how BKGs are constructed from diverse data sources, including molecular interactions, pharmacological datasets, and clinical records. Next, we discuss the essential tasks enabled by BKGs, focusing on knowledge management, retrieval, reasoning, and interpretation. Finally, we highlight real-world applications in precision medicine, drug discovery, and scientific research, illustrating the translational impact of BKGs across multiple sectors. By synthesizing these perspectives into a unified framework, this survey not only clarifies the current state of BKG research but also establishes a foundation for future exploration, enabling both innovative methodological advances and practical implementations.</description>
