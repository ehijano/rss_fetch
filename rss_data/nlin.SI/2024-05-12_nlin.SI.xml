      <title>Pentagram maps over rings, Grassmannians, and skewers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pentagram map is a discrete dynamical system on planar polygons. By definition, the image of a polygon $P$ under the pentagram map is the polygon $P'$ whose vertices are the intersection points of consecutive shortest diagonals of $P$. The pentagram map was introduced by R. Schwartz in 1992, and is now one of the most renowned discrete integrable systems. Several authors proposed generalizations of the pentagram map to other geometries, in particular to Grassmannians, where the role of points and lines is played by higher-dimensional subspaces, as well to skewer geometry, where both points and lines are affine lines in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. In the present paper, we develop a common framework for these kinds of generalizations. Specifically, we show that those maps can be viewed as pentagram maps in the projective plane over an appropriate ring. In general, those rings need not be division rings or commutative. We show that the Grassmannian pentagram map corresponds to the ring of matrices, while the skewer map is the pentagram map over the ring of dual numbers. Furthermore, we prove that the pentagram map remains integrable for any stably finite ground ring $R$.</description>

      <title>Investigation of shallow water waves near the coast or in lake environments via the KdV-Calogero-Bogoyavlenskii-Schiff equation</title>

Abstract: Shallow water waves phenomena in nature attract the attention of scholars and play an important role in fields such as tsunamis, tidal waves, solitary waves, and hydraulic engineering. Hereby, fortheshallowwaterwavesphenomenainvariousnaturalenvironments, westudytheKdV-Calogero-Bogoyavlenskii-Schiff (KdV-CBS) equation. Based on the binary Bell polynomial theory, a new general bilinear B\"acklund transformation, Lax pair and infinite conservation laws of the KdV-CBS equation are derived, and it is proved that it is completely integrable in Lax pair sense. Various types of mixed solutions are constructed by using a combination of Homoclinic test method and symbolic computations. These findings have important significance for the discipline, offering vital insights into the intricate dynamics of the KdV-CBS equation. We hope that our research results could help the researchers understand the nonlinear complex phenomena of the shallow water waves in oceans, rivers and coastal areas. Furthermore, the present work can be directly applied to other nonlinear equations.</description>
