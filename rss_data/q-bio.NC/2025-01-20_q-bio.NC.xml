      <title>Multiplex Nodal Modularity: A novel network metric for the regional analysis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment during a working memory binding task</title>

Abstract: Modularity is a well-established concept for assessing community structures in various single and multi-layer networks, including those in biological and social domains. Biological networks, such as the brain, are known to exhibit group structure at a variety of scales -- local, meso, and global scale. Modularity, while useful in describing mesoscale brain organization, is limited as a metric to a global scale describing the overall strength of community structure. This approach, while valuable, overlooks important localized variations in community structure at the node level. To address this limitation, we extended modularity to individual nodes. This novel measure of nodal modularity ($nQ$) captures both meso and local scale changes in modularity. We hypothesized that $nQ$ illuminates granular changes in the brain due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are known to disrupt the brain's modular structure. We explored $nQ$ in multiplex networks of a visual short-term memory binding task in fMRI and DTI data in the early stages of AD. Observed changes in $nQ$ in fMRI and DTI networks aligned with known trajectories of AD and were linked to common biomarkers of the disease, including amyloid-$\beta$ and tau. Additionally, $nQ$ clearly differentiated MCI from MCI converters showing indications that $nQ$ may be a useful diagnostic tool for characterizing disease stages. Our findings demonstrate the utility of $nQ$ as a measure of localized group structure, providing novel insights into temporal and disease related variability at the node level. Given the widespread application of modularity as a global measure, $nQ$ represents a significant advancement, providing a granular measure of network organization applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</description>
