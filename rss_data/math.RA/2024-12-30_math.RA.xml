      <title>Smoothness of commutative Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopf algebras, most generally in a semisimple abelian symmetric monoidal category, are here supposed to be commutative but not to be of finite-type, and their (equivariant) smoothness are discussed. Given a Hopf algebra $H$ in a category such as above, it is proved that the following are equivalent: (i) $H$ is smooth as an algebra; (ii) $H$ is smooth as an $H$-comodule algebra; (iii) the product morphism $S_H^2(H^+) \to H^+$ defined on the 2nd symmetric power is monic. Working over a field $k$ of characteristic zero, we prove: (1) every ordinary Hopf algebra, i.e., such in the category $\mathsf{Vec}$ of vector spaces, satisfies the equivalent conditions (i)--(iii) and some others; (2) every Hopf algebra in the category $\mathsf{sVec}$ of super-vector spaces has a certain property that is stronger than (i). In the case where $\operatorname{char}k=p&gt;0$, there are shown weaker properties of ordinary Hopf algebras and of Hopf algebras in $\mathsf{sVec}$ or in the ind-completion $\mathsf{Ver}_p^{\mathrm{ind}}$ of the Verlinde category.</description>

      <title>Functional identities involving additive maps on division rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $g$ be an additive map on division ring $D$ and $G_{1}(Y), G_{2}(Y) \neq 0$, $H(Y)$ are generalized polynomials in $D \{Y\}$. In this paper, we study the functional identity $G_{1}(y)g(y)G_{2}(y) = H(y)$. By application of the result and its implications, we prove that if $D$ is a non-commutative division ring with characteristic different from $2$, then the only possible solution of additive maps $g_{1},g_{2}: D \rightarrow D$ satisfying the identity $g_{1}(y)y^{-m} + y^{n}g_{2}(y^{-1})= 0$ with $(m,n) \neq (1,1)$ are positive integers is $ g_{1} = g_{2} = 0$.</description>

      <title>Left dual $(b,c)$-core inverses in rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $a,b,c\in R$ where $R$ is a $*$-ring. We call $a$ \textit{left dual $(b,c)$-core invertible} if there exists $x\in Rc$ such that $bxab=b$ and $(xab)^*=xab$. Such an $x$ is called a left dual $(b,c)$-core inverse of $a$. In this paper, characteriztions of left dual $(b,c)$-core invertible element are introduced. We characterize left dual $(b,c)$-core inverses in terms of properties of the left annihilators and ideals. Moreover, we prove that $a$ is left dual $(b,c)$-core invertible if and only if $a$ is left $(b,c)$ invertible and $b$ is \{1,4\} invertible. Also, properties of left dual $(b,c)$-core invertible elements are examined. We present the matrix representations of left dual $(b,c)$-core inverses by the Pierce decomposition. Furthermore, reletions between left dual $(b,c)$-core inverses and the other generalized inverses are given.</description>

      <title>The nucleus of the Johnson graph $J(N,D)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the nucleus of the Johnson graph $\Gamma = J(N,D)$
  with $N &gt; 2D$. Let $X$ denote the vertex set of $\Gamma$. Let $A \in \text{Mat}_X({\mathbb C})$ denote the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma$. Let $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^D$ denote the $Q$-polynomial ordering of the primitive idempotents of $A$. Fix $x \in X$, and consider the corresponding dual adjacency matrix $A^*$ and dual primitive idempotents $\{E^*_i\}_{i=0}^D$. The subalgebra $T$ of $\text{Mat}_X({\mathbb C})$ generated by $A$, $A^*$ is called the subconstituent algebra of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. Let $V={\mathbb C}^X$ denote the standard module of $\Gamma$. For $0 \leq i \leq D$ define \[ {\mathcal N}_i = (E^*_0 V + E^*_1 V + \cdots + E^*_i V) \cap
  (E_0 V + E_1 V + \cdots + E_{D-i} V). \] It is known that the sum ${\mathcal N} = \sum_{i=0}^D {\mathcal N}_i$ is direct, and $\mathcal N$ is a $T$-module. The $T$-module $\mathcal N$ is called the nucleus of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. For $0 \leq i \leq D$ we construct a basis for ${\mathcal N}_i$ and a basis for $E^*_i {\mathcal N}$. From this we obtain two bases of $\mathcal N$. We give a combinatorial interpretation of these two bases. We give the transition matrices between these two bases. We also give the action of $A$, $A^*$ on these bases.</description>

      <title>Conjugation, loop and closure invariants of the iterated-integrals signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a feature set for the shape of a closed loop, it is natural to ask which features in that set do not change when the starting point of the path is moved. For example, in two dimensions, the area enclosed by the path does not depend on the starting point. In the present article, we characterize such loop invariants among all those features known as interated integrals of a given path. Furthermore, we relate these to conjugation invariants, which are a canonical object of study when treating (tree reduced) paths as a group with multiplication given by the concatenation. Finally, closure invariants are a third class in this context which is of particular relevance when studying piecewise linear trajectories, e.g. given by linear interpolation of time series.
  Keywords: invariant features; concatenation of paths; combinatorial necklaces; shuffle algebra; free Lie algebra; signed area; signed volume; tree-like equivalence.</description>

      <title>Lattice properties of the sharp partial order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study lattice properties of the sharp partial order for complex matrices having index at most 1. We investigate the down-set of a fixed matrix $B$ under this partial order via isomorphisms with two different partially ordered sets of projectors. These are, respectively, the set of projectors that commute with a certain (nonsingular) block of a Hartwig-Spindelb\"ock decomposition of $B$ and the set of projectors that commute with the Jordan canonical form of that block. Using these isomorphisms, we study the lattice structure of the down-sets and we give properties of them. Necessary and sufficient conditions under which the down-set of B is a lattice were found, in which case we describe its elements completely. We also show that every down-set of $B$ has a distinguished Boolean subalgebra and we give a description of its elements. We characterize the matrices that are above a given matrix in terms of its Jordan canonical form. Mitra (1987) showed that the set of all $n \times n$ complex matrices having index at most 1 with $n\geq 4$ is not a lower semilattice. We extend this result to $n=3$ and prove that it is a lower semilattice with $n=2$. We also answer negatively a conjecture given by Mitra, Bhimasankaram and Malik (2010). As a last application, we characterize solutions of some matrix equations via the established isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau completions for roots of dualizing dg bimodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Roots of shifted Serre functors appear naturally in representation theory and algebraic geometry. We give an analogue of Keller's Calabi-Yau completion for roots of shifted inverse dualizing bimodules over dg categories. Given a positive integer $a$, we introduce the notion of the $a$-th root pair on smooth dg categories and define its Calabi-Yau completion. We prove that the Calabi-Yau completion has the Calabi-Yau property when the $a$-th root pair has certain invariance under an action of the cyclic group of order $a$, and observe that it is only twisted Calabi-Yau in general. Next, we establish a bijection between Adams graded Calabi-Yau dg categories of Gorenstein parameter $a$ and $a$-th root pairs on a dg category with the cyclic invariance. Applying this bijection, we prove that a certain operation on dg categories, called the $a$-Segre product, allows us to reproduce Calabi-Yau dg categories. Furthermore, we discuss the cluster category of these Calabi-Yau completions, and prove that it is a $\mathbb{Z}/a\mathbb{Z}$-quotient of the usual cluster category, which thereby establishes the $a$-th root versions of cluster categories. In the appendix, we give a generalization of Beilinson's theorem on tilting bundles on projective spaces to the setting of Adams graded dg categories.</description>

      <title>Higher hereditary algebras arising from some toric singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study graded and ungraded singularity categories of some commutative Gorenstein toric singularities, namely, Veronese subrings of polynomial rings, and Segre products of some copies of polynomial rings. We show that the graded singularity category has a tilting object whose endomorphism ring is higher representation infinite. Moreover, we construct the tilting object so that the endomorphism ring has a strict root pair of its higher Auslander-Reiten translation, which allows us to give equivalences between singularity categories and (folded) cluster categories in a such a way that their cluster tilting objects correspond to each other. Our distinguished form of tilting objects also allows us to construct (twisted) Calabi-Yau algebras as the Calabi-Yau completions of the root pairs. We give an explicit description of these twisted Calabi-Yau algebras as well as the higher representation infinite algebras in terms of quivers and relations. Along the way, we prove that certain idempotent quotients of higher representation infinite algebras remain higher representation infinite.</description>

      <title>Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, Maximum Deconstructibility, and set-generation of torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deconstructibility is an often-used sufficient condition on a class $\mathcal{C}$ of modules that allows one to carry out homological algebra \emph{relative to $\mathcal{C}$}. The principle \textbf{Maximum Deconstructibility (MD)} asserts that a certain necessary condition for a class to be deconstructible, is also sufficient. MD implies, for example, that the classes of Gorenstein Projective modules, Ding Projective modules, their relativized variants, and all torsion classes are deconstructible over any ring. MD was known to follow from Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and imply the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. We prove that MD is equivalent to Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, and to the assertion that all torsion classes of abelian groups are generated by a set (yielding the converse of a theorem of G\"obel and Shelah).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal C_{c}(L):= \{\alpha\in \mathcal{R}(L) \mid R_{\alpha} \, \text{ is a countable subset of } \, \mathbb R \}$, where $R_\alpha:=\{r\in\mathbb R \mid {\mathrm{coz}}(\alpha-r)\neq\top\}$ for every $\alpha\in\mathcal R (L).$ By using idempotent elements, it is going to prove that ${{\mathrm{Coz}}}_c[L]:= \{{\mathrm{coz}}(\alpha) \mid \alpha\in\mathcal{C}_c (L) \}$ is a $\sigma$-frame for every completely regular frame $L,$ and from this, we conclude that it is regular, paracompact, perfectly normal and an Alexandroff algebra frame such that each cover of it is shrinkable. Also, we show that $L$ is a zero-dimensional frame if and only if $ L$ is a $c$-completely regular frame.</description>

Abstract: We study the category $\mathop{\mathrm{ref}}\Lambda$ of reflexive modules over a two-sided Noetherian ring $\Lambda$. We show that the category $\mathop{\mathrm{ref}}\Lambda$ is quasi-abelian if and only if $\Lambda$ satisfies certain Auslander-type condition on the minimal injective resolution of the ring itself. Furthermore, we establish a Morita theorem which characterizes the category of reflexive modules among quasi-abelian categories in terms of generator-cogenerators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of classifying gradings by groups on a finite-dimensional algebra $A$ (with any number of multilinear operations) over an algebraically closed field. We introduce a class of gradings, which we call almost fine, such that every $G$-grading on $A$ is obtained from an almost fine grading on $A$ in an essentially unique way, which is not the case with fine gradings. For abelian groups, we give a method of obtaining all almost fine gradings if fine gradings are known. We apply these ideas to the case of semisimple Lie algebras in characteristic $0$: to any abelian group grading with nonzero identity component, we attach a (possibly nonreduced) root system and, in the simple case, construct an adapted grading by this root system.</description>

      <title>Prime rings having nontrivial centralizers of (skew) traces of Lie ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a prime ring with center $Z(R)$ and with involution $*$. Given an additive subgroup $A$ of $R$, let $T(A):=\{x+x^*\mid x\in A\}$ and $K_0(A):=\{x-x^*\mid x\in A\}$. Let $L$ be a non-abelian Lie ideal of $R$. It is proved that if $d$ is a nonzero derivation of $R$ satisfying $d(T(L))=0$ (resp. $d(K_0(L))=0$), then $T(R)^2\subseteq Z(R)$ (resp. $K_0(R)^2\subseteq Z(R)$). These results are applied to the study of $d(T(M))=0$ and $d(K_0(M))=0$ for noncentral $*$-subrings $M$ of a division ring $R$ such that $M$ is invariant under all inner automorphisms of $R$, and for noncentral additive subgroups $M$ of a prime ring $R$ containing a nontrivial idempotent such that $M$ is invariant under all special inner automorphisms of $R$. The obtained theorems also generalize some recent results on simple artinian rings with involution due to M. Chacron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in graded rings called generalized homogeneous derivations, which serve as a natural generalization of the homogeneous derivations introduced by Kanunnikov. We provide an example demonstrating that the class of homogeneous derivations is strictly contained within the class of generalized homogeneous derivations. Furthermore, we extend several significant results, originally established for prime rings, to the context of gr-prime rings.</description>

      <title>Hindman's finite sums theorem and its application to topologizations of algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.01947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of the paper is a brief overview of Hindman's finite sums theorem, its prehistory and a few of its further generalizations, and a modern technique used in proving these and similar results, which is based on idempotent ultrafilters in ultrafilter extensions of semigroups. The second, main part of the paper is devoted to the topologizability problem of a wide class of algebraic structures called polyrings; this class includes Abelian groups, rings, modules, algebras over a ring, differential rings, and others. We show that the Zariski topology of such an algebra is always non-discrete. Actually, a much stronger fact holds: if $K$ is an infinite polyring, $n$ a natural number, and a map $F$ of $K^n$ into $K$ is defined by a term in $n$ variables, then $F$ is a closed nowhere dense subset of the space $K^{n+1}$ with its Zariski topology. In particular, $K^n$ is a closed nowhere dense subset of $K^{n+1}$. The proof essentially uses a multidimensional version of Hindman's finite sums theorem. The third part of the paper lists several problems concerning topologization of various algebraic structures, their Zariski topologies, and related questions.</description>

      <title>Universal graph series, chromatic functions, and their index theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we introduce the concept of universal graph series. We then present four invariants of graphs and discuss some of their properties. In particular, one of these invariants is a generalization of the chromatic symmetric function and a complete invariant for graphs.</description>
