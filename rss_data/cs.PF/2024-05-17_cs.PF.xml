      <title>LFED: A Literary Fiction Evaluation Dataset for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in the need for comprehensive assessments of their performance across various dimensions. In this paper, we propose LFED, a Literary Fiction Evaluation Dataset, which aims to evaluate the capability of LLMs on the long fiction comprehension and reasoning. We collect 95 literary fictions that are either originally written in Chinese or translated into Chinese, covering a wide range of topics across several centuries. We define a question taxonomy with 8 question categories to guide the creation of 1,304 questions. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis to ascertain how specific attributes of literary fictions (e.g., novel types, character numbers, the year of publication) impact LLM performance in evaluations. Through a series of experiments with various state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate that these models face considerable challenges in effectively addressing questions related to literary fictions, with ChatGPT reaching only 57.08% under the zero-shot setting. The dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/LFED.git</description>

      <title>Stochastic Q-learning for Large Discrete Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex environments with large discrete action spaces, effective decision-making is critical in reinforcement learning (RL). Despite the widespread use of value-based RL approaches like Q-learning, they come with a computational burden, necessitating the maximization of a value function over all actions in each iteration. This burden becomes particularly challenging when addressing large-scale problems and using deep neural networks as function approximators. In this paper, we present stochastic value-based RL approaches which, in each iteration, as opposed to optimizing over the entire set of $n$ actions, only consider a variable stochastic set of a sublinear number of actions, possibly as small as $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$. The presented stochastic value-based RL methods include, among others, Stochastic Q-learning, StochDQN, and StochDDQN, all of which integrate this stochastic approach for both value-function updates and action selection. The theoretical convergence of Stochastic Q-learning is established, while an analysis of stochastic maximization is provided. Moreover, through empirical validation, we illustrate that the various proposed approaches outperform the baseline methods across diverse environments, including different control problems, achieving near-optimal average returns in significantly reduced time.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Wafer-Scale Reduce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient Reduce and AllReduce communication collectives are a critical cornerstone of high-performance computing (HPC) applications. We present the first systematic investigation of Reduce and AllReduce on the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE). This architecture has been shown to achieve unprecedented performance both for machine learning workloads and other computational problems like FFT. We introduce a performance model to estimate the execution time of algorithms on the WSE and validate our predictions experimentally for a wide range of input sizes. In addition to existing implementations, we design and implement several new algorithms specifically tailored to the architecture. Moreover, we establish a lower bound for the runtime of a Reduce operation on the WSE. Based on our model, we automatically generate code that achieves near-optimal performance across the whole range of input sizes. Experiments demonstrate that our new Reduce and AllReduce algorithms outperform the current vendor solution by up to 3.27x. Additionally, our model predicts performance with less than 4% error. The proposed communication collectives increase the range of HPC applications that can benefit from the high throughput of the WSE. Our model-driven methodology demonstrates a disciplined approach that can lead the way to further algorithmic advancements on wafer-scale architectures.</description>
