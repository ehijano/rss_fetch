      <title>A survey on the uniform $S$-version of rings, modules and their homological theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in the theory of ``uniformly $S$''-algebraic structures in commutative ring theory. Originating from the classical concepts of Noetherian, coherent, von Neumann regular, and semisimple rings, the introduction of a multiplicative subset $S$ has led to the development of $S$-Noetherian, $S$-coherent, and other $S$-analogues. However, the element $s \in S$ in the original definitions often depends on the ideal or module under consideration. To overcome this limitation and enable deeper module-theoretic characterizations, the notion of "uniformly $S$" (abbreviated as $u$-$S$) was introduced. This survey systematically presents the definitions, characterizations, and properties of $u$-$S$-torsion modules, $u$-$S$-exact sequences, and the subsequent uniform analogues of fundamental module classes: $u$-$S$-finitely presented, $u$-$S$-Noetherian, $u$-$S$-coherent, $u$-$S$-flat, $u$-$S$-projective, $u$-$S$-injective, and $u$-$S$-absolutely pure modules. We then explore the associated uniform homological dimensions, including the $u$-$S$-weak global dimension, the $u$-$S$-global dimension, and their interplay with polynomial rings and localizations. The survey also covers structural ring classes such as $u$-$S$-von Neumann regular, $u$-$S$-semisimple, $u$-$S$-Artinian, $u$-$S$-multiplication rings, and rings with $u$-$S$-Noetherian spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the closed neighborhood ideal of square of the path graph and study its invariants. We compute the height, the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity. We prove that these ideals are sequentially Cohen--Macaulay and characterize when they are Cohen--Macaulay.</description>

      <title>Partially ordered sets of distributive type and algebras with straightening laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite poset (partially ordered set) $P$ with ${\hat 0}$ is called of distributive type if every interval $[{\hat 0}, a]$, $a \in P$, of $P$ is a distributive lattice. From a viewpoint of ASL's (algebras with straightening laws), the join-meet toric ring on a finite distributive lattice is generalized to an ASL on a finite poset of distributive type. Our target is the questions when a finite poset of distributive lattice is Cohen--Macaulay and when the ASL on it is Gorenstein. We focus on a natural class of finite posets of distributive type and study various aspects of the above questions.</description>

      <title>Can a Lightweight Automated AI Pipeline Solve Research-Level Mathematical Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in generating rigorous mathematical proofs, with "AI for Math" emerging as a vibrant field of research. While these models have mastered competition-level benchmarks like the International Mathematical Olympiad and show promise in research applications through auto-formalization, their deployment via lightweight, natural-language pipelines for research problems remains underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that next-generation models (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2 Pro), when integrated into a streamlined automated pipeline optimized for citation-based verification, can solve sophisticated research-grade problems. We evaluate our pipeline on two novel datasets: (1) the ICCM problem sets (comparable to the S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest) proposed by leading mathematicians, and (2) the "First Proof" problem set, consisting of previously unpublished research questions. Our pipeline generated candidate proofs for all problems in the first two ICCM sets and the "First Proof" set. The solutions for the first two ICCM sets and Problem 4 of the "First Proof" set have been fully verified by our team. All generated proofs have been submitted to the official organization, and our generated results are publicly available. We plan to open-source the complete pipeline methodology in due course.</description>

      <title>On silting complexes associated to n-silting modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any (n+1)-term silting complex whose intermediate cohomology vanishes gives rise to an n-silting module, as recently introduced by Mao. Specializing to commutative noetherian rings, we show that this assignment induces a bijection on the respective equivalence classes. Furthermore, we prove in the same setting that the n-silting modules always correspond to a tilting complex, that is, the associated t-structure is of derived type. We use this to exhibit new examples of tilting complexes in the setting of Commutative Algebra and also to show that the finite type property for n-silting modules, as formulated by Mao, can in general fail.</description>

      <title>Computing $A$-resultants via direct images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We improve a previously known theoretic method to compute A-resultants for suitable monomial support sets due to Weyman to the extent that it becomes computationally feasible and effective. This is achieved by introducing a new algorithm for the computation of direct images of complexes of coherent sheaves on toric varieties. The procedure does not rely on Gr\"obner basis computations at any stage.</description>

      <title>The projective coinvariant algebra, Young invariants and bigraded coordinate rings of Segre embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a flat degeneration P_n of the classical coinvariant algebra R_n, a bigraded Artinian Gorenstein algebra that arises from the coordinate ring of the Segre embedding of the n-fold self-product of the projective line. The Frobenius character of P_n is computed by a natural bigraded refinement of the classical Lusztig--Stanley formula for the character of the coinvariant algebra. Young invariants in P_n get related to coordinate rings of general Segre embeddings of products of projective spaces; their bigraded Hilbert polynomials get expressed in terms of major-descent generating functions of words in multisets. Relations to the diagonal coinvariant algebra, cohomological interpretations including quantum cohomology, and Garsia-Stanton-style bases are also explored.</description>

      <title>Regularity of deficiency modules through spectral sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to obtain upper bounds for the regularity of graded deficiency modules in the spirit of the one obtained by Kumini--Murai in the monomial case building upon the spectral sequence formalism developed by \`Alvarez Montaner, Boix and Zarzuela. This spectral sequence formalism allows us not only to recover Kumini--Murai's upper bound for monomial ideals, but also to extend it for other types of rings, which include toric face rings and some binomial edge rings, producing to the best of our knowledge new upper bounds for the regularity of graded deficiency modules of this type of rings.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and investigate the open neighborhood ideal $\mathcal{N}(G)$ of a finite simple graph $G$. We describe the minimal primary decomposition of $\mathcal{N}(G)$ in terms of the minimal total dominating sets (TDSs) of $G$. Then we prove that the open neighborhood ideal of a tree is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if the tree is well-totally dominated (WTD) and calculate the Cohen-Macaulay type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study graded perfectoid rings as graded analogues of Scholze's (integral) perfectoid rings. We establish a categorical equivalence between graded perfectoid rings and graded perfect prisms, extending the Bhatt-Scholze's correspondence to the graded setting. We also construct the initial graded perfectoid cover of any graded semiperfectoid rings and prove a graded version of Andr\'e's flatness lemma. These results lay the foundations for a graded theory of perfectoid rings.</description>

      <title>On the faithful flatness of some modules arising in analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of faithful flatness of a module over a commutative ring is studied for two $R$-modules $M$ arising in functional analysis, where $R$ is a Banach algebra and $M$ is a Hilbert space. The following results are shown:
  If $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff topological space, and $\mu$ is a positive Radon measure on $X$, then $L^2(X,\mu)$ is a flat $L^\infty(X,\mu)$-module.
  Moreover:
  (1) If $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, then for every finitely generated, nonzero, proper ideal $\mathfrak{n}$ of $L^\infty(X,\mu)$, there holds $\mathfrak{n}L^2(X,\mu)\subsetneq L^2(X,\mu)$.
  (2) If $X$ is the union of an increasing family of Borel sets $U_n$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$, such that for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$, $\overline{U_n}$ is compact and $\mu(U_{n+1}\setminus U_n)&gt;0$, then $L^2(X,\mu)$ is not a faithfully flat $L^\infty(X,\mu)$-module.
  It is shown that the Hardy space $H^2$ is a flat, but not a faithfully flat $H^\infty$-module (answering a 2005 question of Alban Quadrat).</description>

      <title>Hilbert's Theorem 90, periodicity, and roots of Artin-Schreier polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E/F$ be a cyclic field extension of degree $n$, and let $\sigma$ generate the group ${\rm Gal}(E/F)$. If ${\rm Tr}^E_F(y)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sigma^i y=0$, then the additive form of Hilbert's Theorem 90 asserts that $y=\sigma x-x$ for some $x\in E$. When $E$ has characteristic $p&gt;0$ we prove that $x$ gives rise to a periodic sequence $x_0,x_1,\dots$ which has period $pn_p$, where $n_p$ is the largest $p$-power that divides $n$. We also show, if $y$ lies in the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, then the roots of a reducible Artin-Schreier polynomial $t^p-t-y$ have the form $x+u$ where $u\in\mathbb{F}_p$ and $x=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}y^{p^i}$ for some $z\in\mathbb{F}_{p^e}$ with $e=n_p$. Furthermore, the sequence $\left(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}\right)_{i\ge0}$ is periodic with period $pe$.</description>

      <title>Galois Action and Localization in Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a Galois number field $K$, the Galois group $\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ acts on the class group $Cl_K$ in a very natural way: $\sigma\cdot[I]=[\sigma(I)]$ for any $\sigma \in \text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$, $[I]\in Cl_K$. In this paper, we will explore how the unique properties of this group action work together to elucidate the relationship between these two groups. While previous work on this problem has focused on representation theory, we take a direct approach to some classical and new problems. The paper concludes with an exploration of the class groups of overrings of the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$. These turn out to be powerful tools for understanding $Cl_K$ and overrings of $\mathcal{O}_K$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a Serre subcategory $\mathscr L$ and a resolving subcategory $\mathscr A$ of an abelian category, we show that the derived equivalence $D^b(\overline{\mathscr A} \cap \mathscr L) \simeq D^b_{\mathscr L}(\mathscr A)$ holds under certain conditions. We apply this to obtain derived equivalences in the contexts of chain complexes of graded modules or coherent sheaves, with finite $\mathscr A$-dimension, supported on closed sets having eventually finite $\mathscr A$-dimension. Using this, we obtain descriptions of the homotopy fibers in (hermitian) K theory of the restriction maps to certain open sets.</description>
