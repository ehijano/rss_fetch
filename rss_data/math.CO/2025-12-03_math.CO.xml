      <title>Free boundary q-Whittaker and Hall-Littlewood processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the free boundary $q$-Whittaker and Hall--Littlewood processes, two probability measures on sequences of partitions. We prove that a certain observable of the free boundary $q$-Whittaker process exhibits a $(q,t)$ symmetry after a random shift, generalizing a previous result of Imamura, Mucciconi, and Sasamoto, and an extension of that result due to the first author. Our proof is completely different, and as part of our proof, we find contour integral formulas for the free boundary $q$-Whittaker process. We also show a matching between certain observables in the free boundary Hall--Littlewood process and a quasi-open six vertex model, and explain how work of Finn and Vanicat gives an evaluation of a bounded sum over skew Hall--Littlewood functions as a rectangular Koornwinder polynomial.</description>

      <title>A dimer view on Fox's trapezoidal conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fox's conjecture (1962) states that the sequence of absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of alternating links is trapezoidal. While the conjecture remains open in general, a number of special cases have been settled, some, quite recently: Fox's conjecture was shown to hold for special alternating links by Hafner, M\'esz\'aros, and Vidinas (2023) and for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links by Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an (2024). Any alternating link can be written as a diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links; thus, if one could remove the certain adjective in the previous result, it would settle Fox's conjecture. In this paper, we give an alternative proof of Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an's aforementioned result via a dimer model for the Alexander polynomial. In doing so, we not only obtain a significantly shorter proof of Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an's result than the original, but we also obtain several theorems of independent interest regarding the Alexander polynomial, which are readily visible from the dimer point of view. Moreover, we explain, backed with computational evidence, why our result is only for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links as opposed to all. While the latter does not settle an open question, it strikes us as important to bring to attention, given the interest in finding a solution to Fox's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Signed Mahonian Polynomials on Colored Derangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polynomial $\sum_{\pi \in W}q^{maj(\pi)}$ of major index over a classical Weyl group $W$ with a generating set $S$ is called the Mahonian polynomial over $W$, and also the polynomial $\sum_{\pi \in W}(-1)^{l(\pi)}q^{maj(\pi)}$ of major index together with sign over the group $W$ is called the signed Mahonian polynomial over the group $W$, where $l$ is the length function on $W$ defined in terms of the generating set $S$. We concern with the signed Mahonian polynomial $$\sum_{\pi \in D_{n}^{(c)}}(-1)^{L(\pi)}q^{fmaj(\pi)}$$ on the set $D_{n}^{(c)}$ of colored derangements in the group $G_{c,n}$ of colored permutations, where $L$ denotes the length function defined by means of a complex root system described by Bremke and Malle in $G_{c,n}$ and $fmaj$ defined by Adin and Roichman in $G_{c,n}$ represents the \textit{flag-major index}, which is a Mahonian statistic. As an application of the formula for signed Mahonian polynomials on the set of colored derangements, we will derive a formula to count colored derangements of even length in $G_{c,n}$ when $c$ is an even number. Finally, we conclude by providing a formula for the difference between the number of derangements of even and odd lengths in $G_{c,n}$ when $c$ is even.</description>

      <title>Lie and pre-Lie theory of Novikov algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novikov algebras provide a simple but powerful algebraic axiomatization of important features of classical diferential calculus. We study their structure properties, modeling their relationships with commutative algebras with a derivation, featuring the role of their Lie and pre-Lie structures and analyzing the structure of their enveloping algebras. We focus on the combinatorial analysis of the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem (classical and pre-Lie), the pre-Lie exponential and logarithm. The topic is important for applications of the theory and has been treated intensively for pre-Lie algebras. However, specific formulas can be obtained in the Novikov case. We analyze their structure, as well as featuring various remarkable properties. Related statistical phenomena on trees, tableaux and permutations are investigated in this context.</description>

      <title>Preservation of notion of large sets near zero over reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the size of subsets in a semigroup have shown that many of these subsets have strong combinatorial properties and contribute richly to the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification of a discrete semigroup. N. Hindman and D. Strauss have proved that if u, v $\in \mathbb{N}$, M is a u \times v matrix satisfying restrictions that vary with the notion of largeness and if $\Psi$ is a notion of large sets in $\mathbb{N}$ then $\{\vec{x} \in \mathbb{N}^v: M\vec{x} \in \Psi^u\}$ is large set in $\mathbb{N}^v$. In this article, we investigate the above result for various notions of largeness near zero in $\mathbb{R}^+$.</description>

      <title>There are no excess one digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digraph $G$ is \emph{$k$-geodetic} if for any pair $u,v \in V(G)$ there is at most one $u,v$-walk of length not exceeding $k$. The order of a $k$-geodetic digraph with minimum out-degree $d$ is bounded below by the directed Moore bound $M(d,k) = 1 + d + d^2+ \cdots +d^k$. It is known that the Moore bound cannot be achieved for $d,k \geq 2$. A $k$-geodetic digraph with minimum degree $d$ and order one greater than the Moore bound has \emph{excess one}. In this paper we prove a conjecture that no excess one digraphs exist for $d,k \geq 2$, thus complementing the result of Bannai and Ito on the non-existence of undirected graphs with excess one.</description>

      <title>Generalized Zykov's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02958v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, let $n$ denote its number of vertices, and let $N(G,K_t)$ denote the number of copies of $K_t$ in $G$. Zykov's theorem (1949) asserts that for any $K_{r+1}$-free graph and $t \ge 2$, \[ N(G,K_t) \le {r \choose t}\left(\frac{n}{r}\right)^t \] We generalize Zykov's bound within a vertex-based localization framework.
  For each vertex $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ denote the order of the largest clique containing $v$. In this paper, we show that \[ N(G,K_t) \le n^{t-1} \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{1}{c(v)^t} {c(v) \choose t} \] We further show that equality holds if and only if $G$ is a regular complete multipartite graph. \newline Note that if we impose the condition that, $G$ is $K_{r+1}$-free, then $c(v) \leq r$ for all $v \in V(G)$. Thus, plugging $c(v) = r$ for all $v \in V(G)$, we retrieve Zykov's bound.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic enumeration via graph containers and entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The container methods are powerful tools to bound the number of independent sets of graphs and hypergraphs, and they have been extremely influential in the area of extremal and probabilistic combinatorics. We will focus on more specialized graph container methods due to Sapozhenko (1987) that deal with sets in expander graphs. Entropy, first introduced by Shannon (1948) in the area of information theory, is a measure of the expected amount of information contained in a random variable. Entropy has seen lots of fascinating applications in a wide range of enumeration problems. In this survey article, we will discuss recent developments that exploit a combination of the two methods on enumerating graph homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Dominance regions for affine cluster algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine dominance regions associated to cluster algebras of affine type. In the most interesting cases, the dominance region is a line segment, which we describe explicitly. Motivations for this work include a project to determine all pointed bases for cluster algebras of affine type and a separate project to determine all theta functions in the affine case. The proofs draw on known results from the doubled Cambrian fan and almost-positive roots models, as well as a new tool that we develop: a detailed description of neighboring seeds of affine type (seeds that are, in some sense, as close as possible to the boundary of the g-vector fan).</description>

      <title>Hilbert Coefficients and Regularity of Binomial Edge Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph on $n$ vertices, and let $J_G$ denotes the corresponding binomial edge ideal in $S=\mathbb{K}[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_n]$, where $\mathbb{K}$ is a field. We show that if a vertex satisfies a certain degree condition, then some Hilbert coefficients remain unchanged upon its removal, thereby providing a reduction technique for computing Hilbert coefficients. As an application, for any $i\geq 0$ and a pair $(r,s)$ with $r\geq 2, s\in \mathbb{Z}$, we show that there always exists a graph $G$ such that $\mathrm{reg}(S/J_G)=r$ and $e_i(S/J_G)=s$, where $\mathrm{reg}(S/J_G)$ and $e_i(R/J_G)$ denote the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and the $i$-th Hilbert coefficient of $S/J_G$, respectively. In particular, this demonstrates that there is no inherent relationship between the regularity and the Hilbert coefficients for the class of binomial edge ideals.</description>

      <title>Digit-Indexed q-ary SEC-DED Codes with Near-Hamming Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple $q$-ary family of single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC--DED) linear codes whose parity checks are tied directly to the base-$p$ ($q=p$ prime) digits of the coordinate index. For blocklength $n=p^r$ the construction uses only $r+1$ parity checks -- \emph{near-Hamming} overhead -- and admits an index-based decoder that runs in a single pass with constant-time location and magnitude recovery from the syndromes. Based on the prototype, we develop two extensions: Code A1, which removes specific redundant trits to achieve higher information rate and support variable-length encoding; and Code A2, which incorporates two group-sum checks together with a 3-wise XOR linear independence condition on index subsets, yielding a ternary distance-4 (SEC--TED) variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework generalizes via $n$-wise XOR linearly independent sets to construct codes with distance $d = n + 1$, notably recovering the ternary Golay code for $n = 5$ -- showing both structural generality and a serendipitous link to optimal classical codes.
  Our contribution is not optimality but \emph{implementational simplicity} and an \emph{array-friendly} structure: the checks are digitwise and global sums, the mapping from syndromes to error location is explicit, and the SEC--TED upgrade is modular. We position the scheme against classical $q$-ary Hamming and SPC/product-code baselines and provide a small comparison of parity overhead, decoding work, and two-error behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a view towards studying the multitemporal wave equation on affine buildings recently introduced by Anker-R\'emy-Trojan [arXiv:2312.06860], we systematically develop the basic properties of the discrete wave equation on $\mathbb{Z}$ and use this to explain existing results about the wave equation on regular graphs. Furthermore, we explicitly compute the incoming and outgoing translation representations and the scattering operator, in the sense of Lax-Phillips, for regular and biregular trees. Finally, we use the wave equation on biregular graphs to extend a result of Brooks-Lindenstrauss about delocalization of eigenfunctions on regular graphs to the setting of biregular graphs.</description>

      <title>On hyperbolic links associated to Eulerian cycles on ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Eulerian cycles without transversal selfintersections in $4$-valent planar graphs. We prove that any cycle of this type in the graph of an ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope corresponds to a hyperbolic link such that its complement consists of $4$-copies of this polytope glued according to its checkerboard coloring. Moreover, this link consists of trivially embedded circles bijectively corresponding to the vertices of the polytope. For such cycles we prove that the $3$-antiprism $A(3)$ (octahedron) has exactly $2$ combinatorially different cycles, the $4$-antiprism $A(4)$ has exactly $7$ combinatorially different cycles, and these cycles correspond to $7$ cycles (perhaps combinatorially equivalent) on any polytope different from antiprisms, and any antiprism $A(k)$ has at least $2$ combinatorially different cycles. The $2$-fold branched covering space corresponding to our link is a small cover over some simple $3$-polytope. This small cover is defined by a Hamiltonian cycle on it. We show that any compact hyperbolic $3$-polytope with a Hamiltonian cycle arises in this way.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial foundations for solvable chaotic local Euclidean quantum circuits in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a graph-theoretic problem motivated by questions in quantum computing concerning the propagation of information in quantum circuits. A graph $G$ is said to be a bounded extension of its subgraph $L$ if they share the same vertex set, and the graph distance $d_L(u, v)$ is uniformly bounded for edges $uv\in G$. Given vertices $u, v$ in $G$ and an integer $k$, the geodesic slice $S(u, v, k)$ denotes the subset of vertices $w$ lying on a geodesic in $G$ between $u$ and $v$ with $d_G(u, w) = k$. We say that $G$ has bounded geodesic slices if $|S(u, v, k)|$ is uniformly bounded over all $u, v, k$. We call a graph $L$ geodesically directable if it has a bounded extension $G$ with bounded geodesic slices.
  Contrary to previous expectations, we prove that $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is geodesically directable. Physically, this provides a setting in which one could devise exactly-solvable chaotic local quantum circuits with non-trivial correlation patterns on 2D Euclidean lattices. In fact, we show that any bounded extension of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is geodesically directable. This further implies that all two-dimensional regular tilings are geodesically directable.</description>

      <title>The Gamma-disordered Aztec diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-parameter family of random edge weights on the Aztec diamond graph, given by certain Gamma variables, and prove several results about the corresponding random dimer measures.
  Firstly, we show there is no phase transition at the level of the free energy. This provides rigorous backing for the physics predictions of Zeng-Leath-Hwa and later works that dimer models with random weights are in the glassy `super-rough' phase at all temperatures with no phase transition.
  Secondly, we show that the random dimer covers themselves enjoy exact distributional equalities of certain marginals with path locations in new `hybrid' integrable polymers. These reduce to the stationary log-Gamma, strict-weak, and Beta polymer in random environment in certain cases, allowing transfer of known results from integrable polymers to dimers with random weights. As an example application, we prove that the turning points at the boundaries of the Aztec diamond exhibit fluctuations of order $n^{2/3}$, in contrast to the $n^{1/2}$ fluctuations for deterministic weights.
  Underlying all these is a key integrability property of the weights: they are the unique family for which independence is preserved under the shuffling algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadwiger's theorem is a Helly-type theorem involving common transversals to families of convex sets instead of common intersections. Subsequently, Pollack and Wenger identified a necessary and sufficient condition, called a consistent $k$-ordering, for the existence of a hyperplane transversal for sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We obtain a quantitative generalization of Hadwiger's theorem in $\mathbb{R}^2$, showing that compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with a quantitative version of consistent ordering have a transversal satisfying quantitative requirements. Our proof generalizes the methods in Wenger's proof of Hadwiger's theorem in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We also prove colorful versions of our results.</description>

      <title>Shrinking the Jung radius: Maximizing partial coverage of finite point sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jung's theorem says that planar sets of diameter $1$ can be covered by a closed circular disk of radius $\frac 1{\sqrt3}$. In this paper we consider a fractional Jung-type problem for finite planar point-sets. Let $\mathcal{P}_n$ be the family of all finite sets of $n$ points in the plane, of diameter at most $1$. Let the function value $N_n(r)$ ($0 &lt; r \leq 1$) be the largest integer $k$ so that for every point set $P \in \mathcal{P}_n$ there is a closed circular disk of radius $r$ which covers at least $k$ points of $P$. We focus on the radii $r=\frac 12$ and $r=\frac 14$ and prove exact maximum values. Concerning the radius $r= \frac 12$, we prove $N_n(\frac{1}{2})=\lceil \frac{n}{3}\rceil+1$. Concerning the radius $r= \frac 14$, we prove that $N_{n}(\frac{1}{4}) = \lceil \frac{n}{7}\rceil$ if $n$ is not a multiple of 7, and $N_{n}(\frac{1}{4})$ is $ \frac{n}{7}$ or $ \frac{n}{7}+1$ otherwise. We also initiate further study of the function $N_n(r)$ by giving lower and upper bounds for $N_n(r)$ ($0 &lt; r &lt; \frac 1{\sqrt3}$).</description>

      <title>Chain Conditions and Optimal Elements in Generalized Union-Closed Families of Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The union-closed sets conjecture (sometimes referred to as Frankl's conjecture) states that every finite, nontrivial union-closed family of sets has an element that is in at least half of its members. Although the conjecture is known to be false in the infinite setting, we show that many interesting results can still be recovered by imposing suitable chain conditions and considering carefully chosen elements called optimal elements. We use these elements to show that the union-closed conjecture holds for both finite and infinite union-closed families such that the cardinality of any chain of sets is at most three. We also show that the conjecture holds for all nontrivial topological spaces satisfying the descending chain condition on its open sets. Notably, none of those arguments depend on the cardinality of the underlying family or its universe. Finally, we provide an interesting class of families that satisfy the conclusion of the conjecture but are not necessarily union-closed.</description>

      <title>Permutation-based Strategies for Labeled Chip-Firing on $k$-ary Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chip-firing is a combinatorial game on a graph, in which chips are placed and dispersed among its vertices until a stable configuration is achieved. We specifically study a chip-firing variant on an infinite, rooted, directed $k$-ary tree where we place $k^n$ chips labeled $0,1,\dots, k^n-1$ on the root for some nonnegative integer $n$, and we say a vertex $v$ can fire if it has at least $k$ chips. When a vertex fires, we select $k$ labeled chips and send the $i$th smallest chip among them to its $i$th leftmost child. A stable configuration is reached when no vertex can fire. In this paper, we focus on stable configurations resulting from specific firing strategies based on permutations of $1, 2, \dots, n$. We then express the stable configuration as a permutation of $0,1, 2, \dots, k^n-1$ and explore its properties, such as the number of inversions and descents.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Symmetry in Finding New Permutiples from Known Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A permutiple is a natural number whose representation in some base, $b&gt;1$, is an integer multiple of a number whose base-$b$ representation has the same collection of digits. Previous efforts have made progress in finding such numbers using graph-theoretical and finite-state-machine constructions. These are the mother graph and the Hoey-Sloane machine. In this paper, we leverage the inherent symmetry of the above constructions for the purpose of finding new permutiples from old. Such results also help us to see previous work through a new lens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A permutiple is a natural number whose representation in some base is an integer multiple of a number whose representation has the same collection of digits. A previous paper utilizes a finite-state-machine construction and its state graph to recognize permutiples and to generate new examples. Permutiples are associated with walks on the state graph which necessarily satisfy certain conditions. However, the above effort does not provide sufficient conditions for the existence of permutiples. In this paper, we provide such a condition which we will state using the language of multigraphs.</description>

Abstract: We present a random construction proving that the extreme off-diagonal Ramsey numbers satisfy $R(3,k)\ge \left(\frac12+o(1)\right)\frac{k^2}{\log{k}}$. This bound has been conjectured to be asymptotically tight, and improves the previously best bound $R(3,k)\ge \left(\frac13+o(1)\right)\frac{k^2}{\log{k}}$. In contrast to all previous constructions achieving the correct order of magnitude, we do not use a nibble argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chung and Graham [J. London Math. Soc., 1983] claimed to prove that there exists an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\frac{5}{2}n \log_2 n + O(n)$ edges that contains every $n$-vertex tree as a subgraph. Frati, Hoffmann and T\'oth [Combin. Probab. Comput., 2023] discovered an error in the proof. By adding more edges to $G$ the error can be corrected, bringing the number of edges in $G$ to $\frac{7}{2}n \log_2 n + O(n). $
  We make the first improvement to Chung and Graham's bound in over four decades by showing that there exists an $n$-vertex graph with $\frac{14}{5}n \log_2 n + O(n) $ edges that contains every $n$-vertex tree as a subgraph.
  Furthermore, we generalise this bound for treewidth-$k$ graphs by showing that there exists a graph with $O(kn\log n)$ edges that contains every $n$-vertex treewidth-$k$ graph as a subgraph. This is best possible in the sense that $\Omega(kn\log{n})$ edges are required.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Obstructions and the Collapse of Elementary Structure in the Kronecker Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse.
  We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge.
  We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</description>

Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of majorization relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of doubly stochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove a new asymptotic result in the case of majorization, and new exact finite-$n$ formulae in the case of UT-majorization relation, i.e. when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Predicting the depth of the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ species: the impact of phylogenetic tree shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the following question: how close to the ancestral root of a phylogenetic tree is the most recent common ancestor of $k$ species randomly sampled from the tips of the tree? For trees having shapes predicted by the Yule-Harding model, it is known that the most recent common ancestor is likely to be close to (or equal to) the root of the full tree, even as $n$ becomes large (for $k$ fixed). However, this result does not extend to models of tree shape that more closely describe phylogenies encountered in evolutionary biology. We investigate the impact of tree shape (via the Aldous $\beta-$splitting model) to predict the number of edges that separate the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ tip species and the root of the parent tree they are sampled from. Both exact and asymptotic results are presented. We also briefly consider a variation of the process in which a random number of tip species are sampled.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of edge-colored dual graphs of balanced 3- and 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on a class of properly edge-colored graphs, which arise from topological combinatorics, and investigates their embeddings onto surfaces. Specifically, these graphs are known as the dual graphs of balanced normal pseudomanifolds. We introduce the concept of the balanced genus, which represents the smallest genus of a surface onto which the dual graph of a normal pseudomanifold can embed regularly.
  As a key result, we establish that for any 3-manifold $ M $ that is not a sphere, the balanced genus satisfies the lower bound $ \mathcal{G}_M \geq m+3 $, where $ m $ is the rank of its fundamental group of $M$. Furthermore, we prove that a 3-manifold $ M $ is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere if and only if its balanced genus $ \mathcal{G}_M $ is at most 3. Similarly, for 4-manifolds, we establish that if $ M $ is not homeomorphic to a sphere, then its balanced genus is bounded below by $ \mathcal{G}_M \geq 2\chi(M) + 5m + 11 $. Moreover, a 4-manifold $ M $ is PL homeomorphic to the 4-sphere if and only if its balanced genus satisfies $ \mathcal{G}_M \leq 2\chi(M) + 10 $.
  We believe that the balanced genus offers a new perspective in graph theory and combinatorics and will inspire further developments in the field in connection with algebraic combinatorics. To this end, we outline several directions for future research.</description>

      <title>How to Learn a Star: Binary Classification with Starshaped Polyhedral Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider binary classification restricted to a class of continuous piecewise linear functions whose decision boundaries are (possibly nonconvex) starshaped polyhedral sets, supported on a fixed polyhedral simplicial fan. We investigate the expressivity of these function classes and describe the combinatorial and geometric structure of the loss landscape, most prominently the sublevel sets, for two loss-functions: the 0/1-loss (discrete loss) and a log-likelihood loss function. In particular, we give explicit bounds on the VC dimension of this model, and concretely describe the sublevel sets of the discrete loss as chambers in a hyperplane arrangement. For the log-likelihood loss, we give sufficient conditions for the optimum to be unique, and describe the geometry of the optimum when varying the rate parameter of the underlying exponential probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial K3 surfaces and the Mori fan of the Dolgachev--Nikulin--Voisin family in degree 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a combinatorial K3 surface. Those form a certain class of type III semistable K3 surfaces and are completely determined by combinatorial data called curve structures. Emphasis is put on degree $2$ combinatorial K3 surfaces, but the approach can be used to study higher degree as well. We describe elementary modifications both in terms of the curve structures as well as on the Picard groups. Together with a description of the nef cone in terms of curve structures, this provides an approach to explicitly computing the Mori fan of the Dolgachev--Nikulin--Voisin family in degree $2$.</description>

      <title>Matrix Invariants as Homotopy Invariants in Finite $T_0$-spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a bijection between the set of finite topological $T_0$-spaces (or partially ordered sets) and equivalence classes of square matrices. The absolute value of the determinant or the rank of these matrices serve as simple homotopy invariants for the corresponding topological spaces, and consequently, for finite simplicial complexes. To conclude, we explore further relationships and problems concerning finite posets within the context of these matrices.</description>

      <title>The Richness of CSP Non-redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), a clause is called redundant if its satisfaction is implied by satisfying all other clauses. An instance of CSP$(P)$ is called non-redundant if it does not contain any redundant clause. The non-redundancy (NRD) of a predicate $P$ is the maximum number of clauses in a non-redundant instance of CSP$(P)$, as a function of the number of variables $n$. Recent progress has shown that non-redundancy is crucially linked to many other important questions in computer science and mathematics including sparsification, kernelization, query complexity, universal algebra, and extremal combinatorics. Given that non-redundancy is a nexus for many of these important problems, the central goal of this paper is to more deeply understand non-redundancy.
  Our first main result shows that for every rational number $r \ge 1$, there exists a finite CSP predicate $P$ such that the non-redundancy of $P$ is $\Theta(n^r)$. Our second main result explores the concept of conditional non-redundancy first coined by Brakensiek and Guruswami [STOC 2025]. We completely classify the conditional non-redundancy of all binary predicates (i.e., constraints on two variables) by connecting these non-redundancy problems to the structure of high-girth graphs in extremal combinatorics.
  Inspired by these concrete results, we build off the work of Carbonnel [CP 2022] to develop an algebraic theory of conditional non-redundancy. As an application of this algebraic theory, we revisit the notion of Mal'tsev embeddings, which is the most general technique known to date for establishing that a predicate has linear non-redundancy. For example, we provide the first example of predicate with a Mal'tsev embedding that cannot be attributed to the structure of an Abelian group, but rather to the structure of the quantum Pauli group.</description>

      <title>Semi-Random Graphs, Robust Asymmetry, and Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Graph Reconstruction Conjecture famously posits that any undirected graph on at least three vertices is determined up to isomorphism by its family of (unlabeled) induced subgraphs. At present, the conjecture admits partial resolutions of two types: 1) casework-based demonstrations of reconstructibility for families of graphs satisfying certain structural properties, and 2) probabilistic arguments establishing reconstructibility of random graphs by leveraging average-case phenomena. While results in the first category capture the worst-case nature of the conjecture, they play a limited role in understanding the general case. Results in the second category address much larger graph families, but it remains unclear how heavily the necessary arguments rely on optimistic distributional properties. Drawing on the perspectives of smoothed and semi-random analysis, we study the robustness of what are arguably the two most fundamental properties in this latter line of work: asymmetry and uniqueness of subgraphs. Notably, we find that various semi-random graph distributions exhibit these properties asymptotically, much like their Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi counterparts. In particular, Bollob\'as (1990) demonstrated that almost all Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G = (V, E) \sim \mathscr{G}(n, p)$ enjoy the property that their induced subgraphs on $n - \Theta(1)$ vertices are asymmetric and mutually non-isomorphic, for $1 - p, p = \Omega(\log(n) / n)$. We show that this property is robust against perturbation -- even when an adversary is permitted to add/remove each vertex pair in $V^{(2)}$ with (independent) arbitrarily large constant probability. Exploiting this result, we derive asymptotic characterizations of asymmetry in random graphs with planted structure and bounded adversarial corruptions, along with improved bounds on the probability mass of nonreconstructible graphs in $\mathscr{G}(n, p)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, for every Coxeter diagram $D$ with no rank $3$ residues of spherical type and such that $D$ has not only edges labelled by $2$, the space of countable (Tits) buildings of type $D$ is Borel complete, that is, classifying countable buildings of type $D$ up to isomorphism is as hard as classifying countable graphs up to isomorphism. In particular, for every $n\geq 3$, the space of countable generalised $n$-gons is Borel complete.</description>

      <title>Pure minimal injective resolutions and perfect modules for lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, Iyama and Marczinzik showed that a lattice is distributive if and only if the incidence algebra is Auslander regular, giving a new connection between homological algebra and lattice theory. In this article we study when a distributive lattice has a pure minimal injective coresolution, a notion first introduced and studied in a work of Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang. We will see that this problem naturally leads to studying when certain antichain modules are perfect modules. We give a classification of perfect antichain modules under the assumption that their canonical antichain resolution is minimal and use this to give a completion classification in lattice theoretic terms of incidence algebras of distributive lattices with pure minimal injective coresolution. We use our results to answer a question raised by Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang by showing that there exist Auslander-Gorenstein polynomial identity rings without a pure injective coresolution.</description>

      <title>On a kind of generalized multi-harmonic sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime, Jianqiang Zhao has established a curious congruence, which is $$
  \sum_{i+j+k=p \atop i,j,k &gt; 0} \frac{1}{ijk} \equiv -2B_{p-3}\pmod p , $$ where $B_{n}$ denotes the $n$-th Bernoulli number. In this paper, we will generalize this kind of sums and prove a family of similar congruences modulo prime powers $p^r$.</description>
