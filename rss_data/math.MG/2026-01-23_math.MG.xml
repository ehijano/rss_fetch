      <title>Metric constructions and fixed point theorems in product spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies a general scheme for constructing metrics on a product of metric spaces by means of a family of continuous convex functions. This construction includes the conventional $p$-metrics and generates metrics that are topologically equivalent to the conventional ones. As an application, we study fixed point and approximate fixed point properties for nonexpansive maps on a product space equipped with the constructed metric. We show that existing fixed point results of this type are consequences of our framework. Examples are provided to illustrate the established results. The construction machinery is also used to study products of length and geodesic spaces. The obtained results encompass existing ones and provide a background for potential studies of fixed point properties on these product spaces.</description>

      <title>Discrete log-concavity and threshold phenomena for atomic measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate threshold phenomena for random polytopes $K_N=\conv\{X_1,\dots,X_N\}$ generated by i.i.d.\ samples from an atomic law $\mu$. We identify and provide a missing justification in the discrete-hypercube threshold argument of Dyer--F\"uredi--McDiarmid, where the supporting half-space estimate is derived via a smooth (gradient/uniqueness) step that can fail at boundary contact points. We then compare threshold-driving mechanisms in the continuous log-concave setting -- through the Cram\'{e}r transform and Tukey's half-space depth -- with their discrete analogues. Within this framework, we establish a sharp threshold for lattice $p$-balls $\mathbb{Z}^n \cap rB_p^n$. Finally, we present structural counterexamples showing that sharp thresholds need not hold in general discrete log-concave settings.</description>

      <title>Length minimization of filling pairs on hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A filling pair $(\alpha, \beta)$ of a surface $S_g$ is a pair of simple closed curves in minimal position such that the complement of $\alpha\cup\beta$ in $S_g$ is a disjoint union of topological disks. A filling pair is said to be minimally intersecting if the number of intersections between them, or equivalently, the number of complementary disks, is minimal among all filling pairs of $S_g$. For surfaces of genus $g \geq 3$, minimal filling pairs are well understood, whereas in genus two, such a pair divides the surface into exactly two disks. In this paper, we classify all minimal filling pairs up to the action of the mapping class group in genus two and determine the length of the shortest minimal filling pair.</description>

      <title>Integer-valued valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a complete characterization of planar monotone $\sigma$-continuous valuations taking integer values, without assuming invariance under any group of transformations. We further investigate the consequences of dropping monotonicity or $\sigma$-continuity and give a full classification of line valuations. We also introduce a construction of the product for valuations of this type.</description>

      <title>A characterization of the local structure of two-dimensional sets with positive reach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result of the article is a complete characterization of the local structure of two-dimensional sets with positive reach in $R^d$. We also present a more elementary proof of a recent result of A. Lytchak which describes for $k\leq d$ the local structure of $k$-dimensional sets with positive reach $A$ in $R^d$ at points where the tangent cone of $A$ is $k$-dimensional. As an easy corollary of our and Lytchak's results we obtain a characterization of compact two-dimensional sets with positive reach in $R^d$. Our method also shows that, for any set $A\subset R^d$ with positive reach, the set of points at which the tangent cone of $A$ is $k$-dimensional is locally contained in a $k$-dimensional $C^{1,1}$ surface. As a consequence we obtain that if $1\leq k&lt;d$, and $A$ is $k$-dimensional, it can be covered by countably many $k$-dimensional $C^{1,1}$ surfaces.</description>

      <title>On manifolds with almost non-negative Ricci curvature and integrally-positive $k^{th}$-scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider manifolds with almost non-negative Ricci curvature and strictly positive integral lower bounds on the sum of the lowest $k$ eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor.
  If $(M^n,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying such curvature bounds for $k=2$, then we show that $M$ is contained in a neighbourhood of controlled width of an isometrically embedded $1$-dimensional sub-manifold. From this, we deduce several metric and topological consequences: $M$ has at most linear volume growth and at most two ends, it has bounded 1-Urysohn width, the first Betti number of $M$ is bounded above by $1$, and there is precise information on elements of infinite order in $\pi_1(M)$.
  If $(M^n,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying such bounds for $k\geq 2$, then we show that $M$ has at most $(k-1)$-dimensional behavior at large scales.
  If $k=n={\rm dim}(M)$, so that the integral lower bound is on the scalar curvature, assuming in addition that the $(n-2)$-Ricci curvature is non-negative, we prove that the dimension drop at large scales improves to $n-2$.
  From the above results we deduce topological restrictions, such as upper bounds on the first Betti number.</description>
