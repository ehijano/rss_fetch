      <title>Mechanical properties of crystalline-amorphous composites: generalisation of Hall-Petch and inverse Hall-Petch behaviours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strength, $\sigma_{\rm y}$, of a polycrystal decreases with mean grain diameter $D$ at $D\gtrsim50$ atoms (i.e. Hall-Petch behaviour) and increases at $D\lesssim50$ (i.e. inverse Hall-Petch behaviour). Our simulations generalise $\sigma_{\rm y}(D)$ to $\sigma_{\rm y}(D,l)$, where $l$ is the mean thickness of grain boundaries. For various particle compositions, the maximum strength is reached at $(D,l)\simeq(50, 6)$ particles for single-component face-centred-cubic solids and at $(D,l)\simeq(50, 2)$ for bidispersed or body-centred-cubic solids because of the different activation stresses of dislocation motions. The results explain recent alloy experiments and provide a way to exceed the maximum strength of polycrystals. Ductility and elastic moduli are also measured in the broad $(D,l)$ space. The regimes without a strength-ductility trade-off, the maximum ductility and ductile--brittle transitions are identified. These results obtained in $(D,l)$ space are important in solid mechanics and can guide the fabrication of crystalline-amorphous composites with outstanding mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-regulated composition evolution kinetics of bicomponent nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple model and computation of Moir\'e-regulated composition evolution kinetics of bicomponent nanoclusters is presented. Assuming continuous adsorbate coverage on top of 2D bilayer and Moir\'e potential-driven nanocluster formation at fcc sites of Moir\'e landscape, these sites experience the influx of one component of a bicomponent adsorbate and the outflux of another component. Kinetics of this process is characterized for several combinations of adsorption potentials and their relative strengths.</description>

      <title>Role of native point defects and Hg impurities in the electronic properties of Bi$_4$I$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the effects of point defects and Hg impurities in the electronic properties of bismuth iodide (Bi$_4$I$_4$). Our transport measurements after annealing at different temperatures show that the resistivity of Bi$_4$I$_4$ depends on its thermal history, suggesting that the formation of native defects and impurities can shape the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that the bismuth and iodine antisites, and bismuth vacancies are the dominant native point defects. We find that bismuth antisites introduce resonant states in the band-edges, while iodine antisites and bismuth vacancies lead to a $n$-type and $p$-type doping of Bi$_4$I$_4$, respectively. The Hg impurities are likely to be found at Bi substitutional sites, giving rise to the $p$-type doping of Bi$_4$I$_4$. Overall, our findings indicate that the presence of native point defects and impurities can significantly modify the electronic properties, and, thus, impact the resistivity profile of Bi$_4$I$_4$ due to modifications in the amount and type of carriers, and the associated defect(impurity) scattering. Our results suggest possible routes for pursuing fine-tuning of the electronic properties of quasi-one-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Semiconductive and Ferromagnetic Lanthanide MXenes Derived from Carbon Intercalated Two-dimensional Halides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors are a key focus in developing next-generation information storage technologies. MXenes, as emerging 2D early transition metal carbides and nitrides, offer versatile compositions and tunable chemical structures. Incorporating lanthanide metals, with their unique role of 4f-electrons in engineering physical properties, into MXenes holds potential for advancing technological applications. However, the scarcity of lanthanide-containing ternary MAX phase precursors and the propensity of lanthanides to oxidize pose significant challenges to obtain lanthanide MXenes (Ln2CT2) via the top-down etching method. Here, we propose a general bottom-up methodology for lanthanide MXenes, that derive from carbon intercalated van der Waals building blocks of 2D halides. Compared to conventional MXenes conductors, the synthesized Ln2CT2 exhibit tunable band gaps spanning 0.32 eV to 1.22 eV that cover typical semiconductors such as Si (1.12 eV) and Ge (0.67 eV). Additionally, the presence of unpaired f-electrons endows Ln2CT2 with intrinsic ferromagnetism, with Curie temperatures ranging between 36 K and 60 K. Theoretical calculations reveal that, in contrast to traditional MXenes, the number of d-electrons states around the Fermi level are largely diminishes in bare Ln2C MXenes, and the halogen terminals can further exhaust these electrons to open band gaps. Meanwhile, the Ln-4f electrons in Ln2CT2 are highly localized and stay away from the Fermi level, contributing to the spin splitting for the observed ferromagnetic behavior. Lanthanide MXenes hold immense promise for revolutionizing future applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Atomistic understanding of hydrogen coverage on RuO2(110) surface under electrochemical conditions from ab initio statistical thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dehydrogenation of transition metal oxide surfaces under electrochemical potential is critical to the control of important chemical processes such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using first principles computations, we model the thermodynamic dehydrogenation process on RuO$_2$(110) and compare the results to experimental cyclic voltammetry (CV) on single crystal. We use a cluster expansion model trained on *ab initio* energy data coupled with Monte Carlo (MC) sampling to derive the macroscopic electrochemical observables, i.e., experimental CV, from the energetics of different hydrogen coverage microstates on well-defined RuO$_2$(110). Our model reproduces the unique "two-peaks" cyclic voltammogram observed experimentally with current density peak positions and shapes in good qualitative agreement. We show that RuO$_2$(110) starts as a water-covered surface with hydrogen on bridge (BRG) and coordination-unsaturated sites (CUS) at low potential (less than 0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). As the potential increases, the hydrogens on BRG desorb, becoming the main contributor to the first CV peak with smaller contributions from CUS. When all BRG hydrogens are desorbed (before 1.2 V vs. RHE), the remaining CUS hydrogens desorb abruptly in a very small potential window leading to the sharp second peak observed during CV. Our work shows that above 1.23 V, the OER proceeds on a fully dehydrogenated RuO$_2$(110) surface.</description>

      <title>Beyond Electric-Dipole Treatment of Light-Matter Interactions in Materials: Nondipole Harmonic Generation in Bulk Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A beyond electric-dipole light-matter theory is needed to describe emerging X-ray and THz applications for characterization and control of quantum materials but inaccessible as nondipole lattice-aperiodic terms impede on the use of Bloch's theorem. To circumvent this, we derive a formalism that captures dominant nondipole effects in intense electromagnetic fields while conserving lattice translational symmetry. Our approach enables the first accurate nondipole first-principles microscopic simulation of nonperturbative harmonic generation in Si. We reveal nondipole-induced transverse currents generating perturbative even-ordered harmonics and display the onset of nondipole high harmonic generation near the laser damage threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ab-initio computational analysis of the topological Hall effect arising from stable magnetic skyrmions in the Pd/Fe/Ir(111) film using non-collinear spin density functional calculations within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green function method. The semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation is employed for the resistivity and the Hall angle of the system. We explore the influence of the skyrmion size and the impact of disorder on the topological Hall angle.</description>

      <title>Lead-free Hybrid Perovskite: An Efficient Room Temperature Spin Generator via Large Interfacial Rashba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (HOIP) demonstates great potential for developing flexible and wearable spintronic devices, by serving as spin sources via the bulk Rashba effect (BRE). However, the practical application of BRE in 2D HOIP faces huge challenges, particularly due to the toxicity of lead, which is crucial for achieving large spin-orbit coupling, and the restrictions in 2D HOIP candidates to meet specific symmetry-breaking requirements. To overcome these obstacles, we design a strategy to exploit the interfacial Rashba effect (IRE) of lead-free 2D HOIP (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)2CuCl4 (PEA-CuCl), manifesting as an efficient spin generator at room temperature. IRE of PEA-CuCl originates from the large orbital hybridization at the interface between PEA-CuCl and adjacent ferromagnetic layers. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements further quantify a large Rashba effective field of 14.04 Oe per 10^11 A m-2, surpassing those of lead-based HOIP and traditional all-inorganic heterojunctions with noble metals. Our lead-free 2D HOIP PEA-CuCl, which harnesses large IRE for spin generation, is efficient, nontoxic, and economic, offering huge promise for future flexible and wearable spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Scanning tables for the layer groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As two-dimensional (2D) materials continue to gain prominence, understanding their symmetries is critical for unlocking their full potential. In this work, we present comprehensive scanning tables that tabulate the rod group symmetries of all crystallographic lines in all 80 layer groups, which describe the symmetries of 2D materials. These tables are analogous to the scanning tables for space groups found in Volume E of the International Tables for Crystallography, but are specifically tailored for layer groups and their applications to 2D materials. This resource will aid in the analysis of line defects, such as domain walls and grain boundaries, which play a crucial role in determining the properties and functionality of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Fractals: Switching Mechanism of Wurtzite AlN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of wurtzite ferroelectrics is enabling a new generation of ferroelectric devices for computer memory that has the potential to bypass the von Neumann bottleneck, due to their robust polarization and silicon compatibility. However, the microscopic switching mechanism of wurtzites is still undetermined due to the limitations of density functional theory simulation size and experimental temporal and spatial resolution. Thus, physics-informed materials engineering to reduce coercive field and breakdown in these devices has been limited. Here, the atomistic mechanism of domain wall migration and domain growth in wurtzites is uncovered using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations of aluminum nitride. We reveal the anomalous switching mechanism of fast 1D single columns of atoms propagating from a slow-moving 2D fractal-like domain wall. We find that the critical nucleus in wurtzites is a single aluminum ion that breaks its bond with one nitrogen and bonds to another nitrogen; this creates a cascade that only flips atoms directly in the same column, due to the extreme locality (sharpness) of the domain walls in wurtzites. We further show how the fractal shape of the domain wall in the 2D plane breaks assumptions in the KAI model and leads to the anomalously fast switching in wurtzite structured ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Tetragonal BaCoO$_3$: A Co$^{4+}$ Ferromagnetic Mott Insulator with Inverted Spin Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between crystal electric field splitting of d states and Hund's rule exchange energy in cobalt-based perovskites offers a promising avenue for inducing spin-state transitions. This study reports a new body-centered tetragonal (BCT) phase of BaCoO$_3$ (BCT-BaCoO$_3$), synthesized under high pressure (15 GPa) and high temperature (1200 {\deg}C) conditions. BCT-BaCoO$_3$ adopts a double perovskite structure of EuTiO$_3$-type (space group I4/mcm, #140), confirmed by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a rare Co$^{4+}$ valence state. Magnetization and X-ray absorption measurements reveal a low-spin to high-spin transition that takes place between 200 and 300 K. While spin crossovers are relatively common among common oxides, the one observed in BCT-BaCoO$_3$ is remarkable in that it proceeds in the opposite direction from conventional spin transitions. BCT-BaCoO$_3$ exhibits a low-spin (S = 1/2) state at high temperatures and transitions to a high-spin (S = 5/2) state at low temperatures. Within the high-spin state, hard ferromagnetic order onsets at T$_C$ = 107 K. Electrical resistivity indicates weak magnetoresistance and insulating behavior. Overall, BCT-BaCoO$_3$ presents an exceptional model for the exploration of spin-state transitions and the study of Co spin states in cobalt-based perovskites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exists in two polymorphs: an unconventional structure with alternating layers of single- and triple-layered nickel-oxygen octahedra, and a classical double-layered Ruddlesden-Popper phase. In this study, we report the growth of single crystals of classical double-layered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the floating zone method. Structural characterization under pressures up to 15.4 GPa reveals a gradual transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry near 12 GPa. Additionally, we present pressure and field-dependent electrical resistance measurements under pressures as high as 27.4 GPa, from which we construct a phase diagram.</description>

      <title>High-throughput search for topological magnon materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnons give rise to possibilities for engineering novel spintronics devices with critical applications in quantum information and computation, due to its symmetry-protected robustness and low dissipation. However, to make reliable and systematic predictions about material realization of topological magnons has been a major challenge, due to the lack of neutron scattering data for most materials. In this work, we significantly advance the symmetry-based approach for identifying topological magnons through developing a fully automated algorithm, utilizing the theory of symmetry indicators, that enables a highly efficient and large-scale search for candidate materials hosting field-induced topological magnons. This progress not only streamlines the discovery process but also expands the scope of materials exploration beyond previous manual or traditional methods, offering a powerful tool for uncovering novel topological phases in magnetic systems. Performing a large-scale search over all 1649 magnetic materials in Bilbao Crystallographic Server with a commensurate magnetic order, we discover 387 candidate materials for topological magnons, significantly expanding the pool of topological magnon materials. We further discuss examples and experimental accessibility of the candidate materials, shedding light on future experimental realizations of topological magnons in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Electron-ion model of ball and bead lightning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the electron-ion model, parameters of ball and bead lightning are calculated. The model allows us to estimate maximum size of ball lightning, its energy content, electric charge and magnetic field, to determine equilibrium conditions between positively charged ions located inside and outer shell containing rapidly moving electrons. An explanation is given to the fact that shells are observed inside ball lightning that differ from each other in color of glow. The model describes structure of not only ball lightning, but also bead lightning. The long-term stability of bead lightning is associated with the balance of neighboring beads under action of magnetic force of their attraction and electric force of repulsion, which exceed in magnitude the force of wind pressure.</description>

      <title>Hall signal-dominated microwave transmission through graphene-loaded waveguides</title>

Abstract: Microwave transmission line spectroscopy is used to observe the integer quantum Hall effect in two samples of monolayer graphene with different geometries that are resistively-coupled to a coplanar waveguide. We find plateaus in transmitted power that do not vary significantly with microwave frequency but are significantly different for two samples due to their shape. With each drop in transmitted power corresponding to an additional quantum Hall edge mode that short the transmission line to ground, these well-known quanta of conductance allow us to calibrate the sensitivity of the devices. One sample with short contact regions matched the sensitivity expected when considering only the quantum Hall conductance of $\nu e^2/h$; another sample with long contact regions demonstrated a nearly three-fold enhancement in sensitivity. We model this result with a purely resistive circuit that introduces an additional resistance to explain the increased sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Anomalous shot noise in a bad metal beta-tantalum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic shot noise produced by nanowires of beta-Ta, an archetypal ``bad" metal with resistivity near the Ioffe-Regel localization limit. The Fano factor characterizing the shot noise exhibits a strong dependence on temperature and is suppressed compared to the expectations for quasiparticle diffusion, but hopping transport is ruled out by the analysis of scaling with the nanowire length. These anomalous behaviors closely resemble those of strange metal nanowires, suggesting that beta-Ta may host a correlated electron liquid. This material provides an accessible platform for exploring exotic electronic states of matter.</description>

      <title>Crystalline electric field excitations and their nonlinear splitting under magnetic fields in YbOCl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently reported van der Waals layered honeycomb rare-earth chalcohalides REChX (RE = rare earth, Ch = chalcogen, and X = halogen) are considered to be promising Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) candidates. The high-quality single crystals of YbOCl, a representative member of the family with an effective spin of 1/2, are available now. The crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations in a rare-earth spin system are fundamentally important for understanding both finite-temperature and ground-state magnetism, but remain unexplored in YbOCl so far. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive Raman scattering study to unambiguously identify the CEF excitations in YbOCl and determine the CEF parameters and wave functions. Our Raman experiments further reveal the anomalous nonlinear CEF splitting under magnetic fields. We have grown single crystals of YbOCl, the nonmagnetic LuOCl, and the diluted magnetic Lu_{0.86}Yb_{0.14}OCl to make a completely comparative investigation. Polarized Raman spectra on the samples at 1.8 K allow us to clearly assign all the Raman-active phonon modes and explicitly identify the CEF excitations in YbOCl. The CEF excitations are further examined using temperature-dependent Raman measurements and careful symmetry analysis based on Raman tensors related to CEF excitations. By applying the CEF Hamiltonian to the experimentally determined CEF excitations, we extract the CEF parameters and eventually determine the CEF wave functions. The study experimentally pins down the CEF excitations in the Kitaev compound YbOCl and sets a foundation for understanding its finite-temperature magnetism and exploring the possible nontrivial spin ground state.</description>

      <title>Enhanced laser-induced single-cycle terahertz generation in a spintronic emitter with a gradient interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of spintronic emitters of broadband THz pulses relies on designing heterostructures where processes of laser-driven spin current generation and subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion are the most efficient. An interface between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers in the emitter is one of the critical elements. Here, we study experimentally single-cycle THz pulse generation from a laser-pulse excited Pt/Co emitter with a composition gradient interface between Pt and Co and compare it with the emission from a conventional Pt/Co structure with an abrupt interface. We find that the gradient interface enhances the efficiency of optics-to-THz conversion by a factor of two in a wide range of optical fluences up to 3 mJ cm$^{-2}$. We reveal that this enhancement is caused by a pronounced increase in transmittance of the laser-driven spin-polarized current through the gradient interface compared to the abrupt one. Furthermore, we find that such a transmission deteriorates with laser fluence due to the spin accumulation effect.</description>

      <title>The electronic structure of EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ in the vicinity of the critical endpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hard X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals significant alterations in the valence band states of EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ at a temperature $T_V$, where the Eu ions undergo a temperature-induced valence crossover from a magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ state to a low-temperature valence-fluctuating state. The introduction of small amounts of Au on Pd lattice sites and Ge on Si sites, respectively, results in a decrease in $T_V$ and the emergence of an antiferromagnetic state at low temperatures without valence fluctuations. It has been proposed that the boundary between AFM order and valence crossover represents a first-order phase transition associated with a specific type of second-order critical end point. In this scenario, strong coupling effects between fluctuating charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom are to be expected. In the case of EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ with x=0.13, which is situated close to the critical end point, a splitting of conduction band states and the emergence of flat bands with one-dimensional character have been observed. A comparison with ab initio theory demonstrates a high degree of correlation with experimental findings, particularly in regard to the bands situated in proximity to the critical end point.</description>

      <title>Observation of Complete Orbital Two-channel Kondo Effect in van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital two-channel Kondo (2CK) effect is one of the crucial systems with non- Fermi liquid (NFL) behaviors. But the full three-regime transport evidence has never been observed in one sample. Here, all three-resistive regimes for the orbital 2CK effect induced by two-level systems (TLSs) have been observed in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. The electron behavior undergoes a continuous transition from electron scattering to the NFL behavior, and subsequently to Fermi liquid behavior. The magnetic field does not affect any regimes, indicating the non-magnetic origin of the TLSs in Fe3GaTe2. In addition, the slope of linear negative magnetoresistance, rather than the topological Hall effect, has been found to be related to spin-magnon scattering and can be used to infer the emergence of spin textures. Our findings indicate Fe3GaTe2 may be an ideal platform to study electron-correlation and topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Resistively detected electron spin resonance and g factor in few-layer exfoliated MoS2 devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MoS2 has recently emerged as a promising material for enabling quantum devices and spintronic applications. In this context, the demonstration of resistively detected electron spin resonance (RD-ESR) and the determination and improved physical understanding of the g factor are of great importance. However, its application and RD-ESR studies have been limited so far by Schotttky or high-resistance contacts to MoS2. Here, we exploit naturally n-doped few-layer MoS2 devices with ohmic tin (Sn) contacts that allow the electrical study of spin phenomena. Resonant excitation of electron spins and resistive detection is a possible path to exploit the spin effects in MoS2 devices. Using RD-ESR, we determine the g factor of few-layer MoS2 to be ~ 1.92 and observe that the g factor value is independent of the charge carrier density within the limits of our measurements.</description>

      <title>Surface magnetic stabilization and the photo-emission chiral-induced spin-selectivity effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spinterface mechanism was suggested as a possible origin for the chirality induced spin-selectivity (CISS) effect, and was used to explain and reproduce, with remarkable accuracy, experimental data from transport experiments showing the CISS effect. Here, we apply the spinterface mechanism to explain the appearance of magnetization at the interface between non-magnetic metals and chiral molecules, through the stabilization of other-wise fluctuating magnetic moments. We show that the stabilization of surface magnetic moments occurs for a wide range of realistic parameters and is robust against dephasing. Importantly, we show that the direction of the surface magnetic moments is determined by the chiral axis of the chiral molecules. Armed with the concept of stable surface magnetic moments, we then formulated a theory for the photoemission CISS effect. The theory, based on spin-dependent scattering, leads to direct predictions regarding the relation between the photoemission CISS effect, the chiral axis direction, the spinterface "size", and the tilt angle of the detector with respect to the surface. These predictions are within reach of current experimental capabilities, and may shed new light on the origin of the CISS effect.</description>

      <title>Datatractor: Metadata, automation, and registries for extractor interoperability in the chemical and materials sciences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two key issues hindering the transition towards FAIR data science are the poor discoverability and inconsistent instructions for the use of data extractor tools, i.e., how we go from raw data files created by instruments, to accessible metadata and scientific insight. If the existing format conversion tools are hard to find, install, and use, their reimplementation will lead to a duplication of effort, and an increase in the associated maintenance burden is inevitable. The Datatractor framework presented in this work addresses these issues. First, by providing a curated registry of such extractor tools their discoverability will increase. Second, by describing them using a standardised but lightweight schema, their installation and use is machine-actionable. Finally, we provide a reference implementation for such data extraction. The Datatractor framework can be used to provide a public-facing data extraction service, or be incorporated into other research data management tools providing added value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a generalized transfer matrix method that provides exact analytical and numerical solutions for lattice versions of topological models with surface termination in one direction. We construct a generalized eigenvalue equation, equivalent to the conventional transfer matrix, which neither suffers from nor requires singular (non-invertible) inter-layer hopping matrices, in contrast to previous works. We then apply this formalism to derive, with exactness, the topological surface states and Fermi arc states in two prototypical topological models: the 3D Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model and a lattice model exhibiting Weyl semimetal behavior. Our results show that the surface states and bulk bands, across the projected 2D Brillouin zone, agree perfectly with those obtained through direct numerical diagonalization of the corresponding Hamiltonians in a slab geometry. This highlights that the generalized transfer matrix method is not only a powerful tool but also a highly efficient alternative to fully numerical methods for investigating surface physics and interfaces in topological systems, particularly when it is required to go beyond low-energy effective descriptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insulating materials featuring ultralow thermal conductivity for diverse applications also require robust mechanical properties. Conventional thinking, however, which correlates strong bonding with high atomic-vibration-mediated heat conduction, led to diverse weakly bonded materials that feature ultralow thermal conductivity and low elastic moduli. One must, therefore, search for strongly-bonded single crystals in which heat transport is impeded by other means. Here, we report intrinsic, glass-like, ultralow thermal conductivity and ultrahigh elastic-modulus/thermal-conductivity ratio in single-crystalline Ruddlesden-Popper Ban+1ZrnS3n+1, n = 2,3, which are derivatives of BaZrS3. Their key features are strong anharmonicity and intra-unit-cell rock-salt blocks. The latter produce strongly bonded intrinsic superlattices, impeding heat conduction by broadband reduction of phonon velocities and mean free paths and concomitant strong phonon localization. The present study initiates a paradigm of mechanically stiff phonon glasses.</description>

      <title>Density-Based Long-Range Electrostatic Descriptors for Machine Learning Force Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a long-range descriptor for machine learning force fields (MLFFs) that maintains translational and rotational symmetry, similar to short-range descriptors while being able to incorporate long-range electrostatic interactions. The proposed descriptor is based on an atomic density representation and is structurally similar to classical short-range atom-centered descriptors, making it straightforward to integrate into machine learning schemes. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through comparative analysis with the long-distance equivariant (LODE) descriptor. In a toy model with purely electrostatic interactions, our model achieves errors below 0.1%, worse than LODE but still very good. For real materials, we perform tests for liquid NaCl, rock salt NaCl, and solid zirconia. For NaCl, the present descriptors improve on short-range density descriptors, reducing errors by a factor of two to three and coming close to message-passing networks. However, for solid zirconia, no improvements are observed with the present approach, while message-passing networks reduce the error by almost a factor of two to three. Possible shortcomings of the present model are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: Absence of net magnetization in altermagnetis is both a blessing (no stray fields) and a curse (no obvious way to manipulate altermagnetic domains by external fields). Yet, MnTe was demonstrated experimentally to have no measurable stray fields and yet controllable by external magnetic filed - a win-win situation. In this paper we unravel the microscopic mechanism of this property. It appear to emerge from concerted action of three different mechanisms. Microscopic understanding of the beneficial properties of MnTe opens a road to controllable design of similar altermagnets for spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic spin currents in bulk noncentrosymmetric ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intrinsic spin currents are encountered in noncentrosymmetric crystals without any external electric fields; these currents are caused by spin-orbit interaction. In this paper, various theoretical aspects of this phenomenon in bulk ferromagnets are studied by using group theory, perturbation expansion, and calculations for model and real systems. The group-theoretical analysis of the spin-current tensor shows that the absence of space-inversion symmetry is not a sufficient condition for appearance of the intrinsic spin currents. The perturbation expansion proves that in the regime of exchange splitting dominating over spin-orbit interaction, the spin polarization of the intrinsic currents is nearly perpendicular to the direction of magnetization. First-principles calculations are carried out for NiMnSb and CoMnFeSi ferromagnetic compounds, both featured by a tetrahedral crystallographic point group. The dependence of the spin-current tensor on the direction of magnetization is approximated by a simple quadratic formula containing two constants; the relative error of this approximation is found as small as a few percent for both compounds.</description>

Abstract: Achieving parametric excitation in an oscillating physical system involves periodically adjusting one of its parameters to modulate the oscillator's natural frequency. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous systems within physics and engineering, profoundly transforming modern science and technology. Despite rapid progress, the parametric control of collective excitations, such as phonons, remains a challenge while promising to generate novel and intriguing effects in a largely unexplored field. Here, we investigate the terahertz (THz) field-induced dynamics of Raman-active phonons in LaAlO$_3$ (LAO), an archetypal quantum material for its electronic and structural properties. Utilizing intense THz pulses, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of parametric phonon excitation marked by substantial subharmonic components. Theoretical analysis can successfully capture the hallmarks of the observed phenomena in a physical scenario with the THz field inducing a parametric coupling between the Raman mode and pairs of acoustic phonon excitations.</description>

Abstract: We propose a strategy to make phosphorus nanotubes from two well-known phosphorus allotropes: violet phosphorus and red phosphorus. First-principles calculations show that doping with sulfur dissociates the covalent bonds between tubular phosphorus structures that form bilayers in these allotropes, resulting in free-standing 1D nanotubes. Due to the substitutional nature of the sulfur dopant, the resulting 1D structure is linear, unlike the helical ring structure studied previously. The sulfur sites are situated periodically along the 1D nanotubes and can be further functionalized. Our results show that the S-doped phosphorus nanotube can sustain a tensile strain of up to 18%. The strain also substantially modifies the electronic band gap and the effective mass of carriers. Calculations using the many-body Green's functions (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approaches reveal a large exciton binding energy of 1.57 eV. The one-dimensional nature, linearity, functionalizability, mechanical flexibility, tunability of electronic properties, and large exciton binding energy make this material interesting for applications in optoelectronic devices, solar cells, chemical sensors, and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Straintronics and Mechanical Aharonov-Bohm Effect in Quasi-metallic SWCNTs</title>

Abstract: Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are effectively narrow ribbons of 2D materials with atomically precise edges. They are ideal systems to harness quantum transport straintronics (QTS), i.e. using mechanical strain to control quantum transport. Their large subband energy spacing ($\sim$ 0.8 eV) leads to transistors with a single quantum transport channel. We adapt an applied model to study QTS in uniaxially-strained quasi-metallic-SWCNT transistors. The device parameters are based on an existing experimental platform, with channel lengths of $L=$ 50 nm, diameters $d\approx$ 1.5 nm, and strains up to $\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}\approx$ 7 $\%$. We demonstrate that the charge carrier's propagation angle $\Theta$ is fully tunable with $\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}$. When $\Theta$ reaches 90$^o$, the conductance $G$ is completely suppressed. A strain-generated band gap can be tuned up to $\approx$ 400 meV. Mechanical strain adds both scalar $\phi_{\varepsilon}$ and vector $\textbf{A}$ gauge potentials to the transistor's Hamiltonian. These potentials create a rich spectrum of quantum interferences in $G$, which can be described as a mechanical Aharonov-Bohm effect. The charge carriers' quantum phase can be controlled by purely mechanical means. For instance, a full 2$\pi$ phase shift can be induced in a (12,9) tube by a 0.7 $\%$ strain change. This work opens opportunities to add quantitative quantum transport strain effects to the tools box of quantum technologies based on 2D materials and their nanotubes.</description>
