      <title>TeV Solar Gamma Rays as a probe for the Solar Internetwork Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic fields that emerge from beneath the solar surface and permeate the solar atmosphere are the key drivers of space weather and, thus, understanding them is important to human society. Direct observations, used to measure magnetic fields, can only probe the magnetic fields in the photosphere and above, far from the regions the magnetic fields are being enhanced by the solar dynamo. Solar gamma rays produced by cosmic rays interacting with the solar atmosphere have been detected from GeV to TeV energy range, and revealed that they are significantly affected by solar magnetic fields. However, much of the observations are yet to be explained by a physical model. Using a semi-analytic model, we show that magnetic fields at and below the photosphere with a large horizontal component could explain the $\sim$1 TeV solar gamma rays observed by HAWC. This could allow high-energy solar gamma rays to be a novel probe for magnetic fields below the photosphere.</description>

      <title>The Symbiotic X-ray Binary IGR J16194-2810: A Window on the Future Evolution of Wide Neutron Star Binaries From Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical follow-up of IGR J16194-2810, a hard X-ray source discovered by the INTEGRAL mission. The optical counterpart is a $\sim500\,L_\odot$ red giant at a distance of $2.1$ kpc. We measured 16 radial velocities (RVs) of the giant over a period of $\sim 300$ days. Fitting these RVs with a Keplerian model, we find an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb} = 192.73 \pm 0.01$ days and a companion mass function $f(M_2) = 0.361 \pm 0.005 \,M_{\odot}$. We detect ellipsoidal variability with the same period in optical light curves from the ASAS-SN survey. Joint fitting of the RVs, light curves, and the broadband SED allows us to robustly constrain the masses of both components. We find a giant mass of $M_\star = 1.02\pm 0.01\,M_{\odot}$ and a companion mass of $M_{2} = 1.35^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\,M_{\odot}$, implying that the companion is a neutron star (NS). We recover a $4.06$-hour period in the system's TESS light curve, which we tentatively associate with the NS spin period. The giant does not yet fill its Roche lobe, suggesting that current mass transfer is primarily via winds. MESA evolutionary models predict that the giant will overflow its Roche lobe in $5$-$10$ Myr, eventually forming a recycled pulsar + white dwarf binary with a $\sim 900$ day period. IGR J16194-2810 provides a window on the future evolution of wide NS + main sequence binaries recently discovered via Gaia astrometry. As with those systems, the binary's formation history is uncertain. Before the formation of the NS, it likely survived a common envelope episode with a donor-to-accretor mass ratio $\gtrsim 10$ and emerged in a wide orbit. The NS likely formed with a weak kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 100\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$), as stronger kicks would have disrupted the orbit.</description>

      <title>Driving asymmetric red supergiants winds with binary interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars in the red supergiant (RSG) phase are known to undergo strong mass loss through winds and observations indicate that a substantial part of this mass loss could be driven by localised and episodic outflows. Various mechanisms have been considered to explain this type of mass loss in RSGs, but these models often focus on single-star evolution. However, massive stars commonly evolve in binary systems, potentially interacting with their companions. Motivated by observations of the highly asymmetric circumstellar ejecta around the RSG VY~CMa, we investigate a scenario where a companion on an eccentric orbit grazes the surface of a red supergiant at periastron. The companion ejects part of the outer RSG envelope, which radiatively cools, reaching the proper conditions for dust condensation and eventually giving rise to dust-driven winds. Using simple treatments for radiative cooling and dust-driven winds, we perform 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of this scenario with a $20\,M_\odot$ RSG and a $2\,M_\odot$ companion. We follow the evolution of the binary throughout a total of 14 orbits and observe that the orbit tightens after each interaction, in turn enhancing the mass loss of subsequent interactions. We show that one such grazing interaction yields outflows of $3\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot$, which later results in wide asymmetric dusty ejecta, carrying a total mass of $0.185\,M_\odot$ by the end of simulations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of the binary, potential observational signatures, as well as future improvements of the model required to provide sensible predictions for the evolution of massive binaries.</description>

      <title>Rotational synchronisation of B-type binaries in 30 Doradus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin evolution of stars in close binary systems can be strongly affected by tides. We investigate the rotational synchronisation of the stellar components for 69 SB1 systems and 14 SB2 B-type systems in the 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud using observations from the VFTS and BBC surveys. Their orbital periods range from a few to a few hundred days, while estimated primary masses for these systems are in the range 5-20 Msun with mass ratio ranges of approximately q=0.03-0.5 and q=0.6-1.0 for the SB1 and SB2 systems, respectively. Projected rotational velocities of the stellar components have been compared with their synchronous velocities derived from the orbital periods. We find that effectively all systems with orbital period of more than 10 days must be asynchronous, whilst all the systems with periods of less than 3 days are likely synchronised. In terms of the stellar fractional radius (r), our results imply that all systems with r&lt;0.1 are asynchronous, with those having r&gt;0.2 probably being synchronised. For the apparently synchronised systems our results are more consistent with synchronisation at the mean orbital angular velocity rather than with that at periastron.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Polluted White Dwarfs and Other Treasures with Gaia XP Spectra and Unsupervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) polluted by exoplanetary material provide the unprecedented opportunity to directly observe the interiors of exoplanets. However, spectroscopic surveys are often limited by brightness constraints, and WDs tend to be very faint, making detections of large populations of polluted WDs difficult. In this paper, we aim to increase considerably the number of WDs with multiple metals in their atmospheres. Using 96,134 WDs with Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) spectra, we constructed a 2D map using an unsupervised machine learning technique called Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to organize the WDs into identifiable spectral regions. The polluted WDs are among the distinct spectral groups identified in our map. We have shown that this selection method could potentially increase the number of known WDs with 5 or more metal species in their atmospheres by an order of magnitude. Such systems are essential for characterizing exoplanet diversity and geology.</description>

      <title>X-ray Irradiation of the Giant Planet Orbiting the T Tauri Star TAP 26</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new Chandra X-ray observations of TAP 26, a ~17 Myr old magnetically-active weak-lined T Tauri star that has been reported to host a massive planet in a 10.8 day orbit. At a separation of a = 0.097 AU the planet will be exposed to intense X-ray and UV radiation from the star. The first observation caught the star in a state of elevated X-ray emission with variability on a timescale of a few hours and an X-ray temperature kTx ~ 2 - 4 keV. Two subsequent observations 5-10 days later showed slow variability and a lower X-ray flux and temperature (kTx ~ 1 keV). We characterize the X-ray emission and estimate the X-ray ionization and heating rates that will need to be incorporated into realistic models of the planet's atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Discriminating between Babcock-Leighton-type solar dynamo models by torsional oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The details of the dynamo process in the Sun are an important aspect of research in solar-terrestrial physics and astrophysics. The surface part of the dynamo can be constrained by direct observations, but the subsurface part lacks direct observational constraints. The torsional oscillations, a small periodic variation of the Sun's rotation with the solar cycle, are thought to result from the Lorentz force of the cyclic magnetic field generated by the dynamo. In this study, we aim to discriminate between three Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo models by comparing the zonal acceleration of the three models with the observed one. The property that the poleward and equatorward branches of the torsional oscillations originate from about $\pm 55^\circ$ latitudes with their own migration time periods serves as an effective discriminator that could constrain the configuration of the magnetic field in the convection zone. The toroidal field, comprising poleward and equatorward branches separated at about $\pm 55^\circ$ latitudes can generate the two branches of the torsional oscillations. The alternating acceleration and deceleration bands in time is the other property of the torsional oscillations that discriminate between the dynamo models. To reproduce this property, the phase difference between the radial ($B_{r}$) and toroidal ($B_{\phi}$) components of the magnetic field near the surface should be about $\pi/2$.</description>

      <title>A Contact Binary Mis-Classified as an Ellipsoidal Variable: Complications for Detached Black Hole Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying sources exhibiting ellipsoidal variability in large photometric surveys is becoming a promising method to search for candidate detached black holes in binaries. This technique aims to exploit the orbital-phase dependent modulation in optical photometry caused by the black hole distorting the shape of the luminous star to constrain the mass ratio of the binary. Without understanding if, or how much, contamination is present in the candidate black hole samples produced by this new technique it is hard to leverage them for black hole discovery. Here, we follow up one of the best candidates identified from Gaia Data Release 3, Gaia DR3 4042390512917208960, with a radial velocity campaign. Combined photometric and radial velocity modelling, along with spectral disentangling, suggests that the true mass ratio (mass of the unseen object divided by the mass of the luminous star) is an order of magnitude smaller than that inferred assuming the modulations arise from ellipsoidal variability. We therefore infer that this system is likely a contact binary, or on the boundary of both stars nearly filling their Roche lobes, however, further observations are required to confidently detect the secondary. We find that the well-known problem of discriminating between ellipsoidal and contact binary light curves results in a larger contamination from contact binaries than previously suggested. Until ellipsoidal variables can be reliably distinguished from contact binaries, samples of black hole candidates selected based on ellipsoidal variability are likely to be highly contaminated by contact binaries or similar systems.</description>

      <title>The expected evolution of the binary system PTF J2238+743015.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary systems made by a low-mass CO WD and a He-donor represent possible progenitors of explosive events via He-detonation, producing low-luminosity thermonuclear Supernovae with a peculiar nucleosynthetis. Recently, the binary system PTF J223857.11+743015.1 has been suggested as one. We investigate the evolution of the PTF J223857.11+743015.1 system, composed by a 0.75Msun CO WD and a 0.390Msun subdwarf, capped by a thin H-rich layer, considering rotation of the WD component. We compute the evolution of two stars simultaneously, accounting for the possible evolution of the orbital parameters, as determined by mass transfer between components and by mass ejection from the system during RLOF episodes. We consider that the WD gains angular momentum due to accretion and we follow the evolution of the angular velocity profile as due to angular momentum transport via convection and rotation-induced instabilities. As the donor H-rich envelope is transferred, the WD experiences recurrent very strong H-flashes triggering RLOF episodes during which the entire accreted matter is lost from the system. Due to mixing of chemicals by rotation-induced instabilities during the accretion phase, H-flashes occur inside the original WD. Hence, pulse-by pulse, the accretor mass is reduced down to 0.7453Msun. When He-rich matter is transferred, He-detonation does not occur in the rotating WD, which undergoes 6 very strong He-flashes and subsequent RLOF episodes. Also in this case, due to rotation-induced mixing of the accreted layers with the underlying core, the WD is eroded. Finally, when the mass transfer rate from the donor decreases, a massive He-buffer is piled-up onto the accretor which ends its life as a cooling WD. The binary system PTF J2238+743015.1 as all those binaries having similar components masses and orbital parameters are not good candidates as thermonuclear explosions progenitors.</description>

      <title>Multi spacecraft study with the Icarus model: Modelling the propagation of CMEs to Mercury and Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are the main drivers of the disturbances in interplanetary space. Understanding the CME interior magnetic structure is crucial for advancing space weather studies. Assessing the capabilities of a numerical heliospheric model is crucial, as understanding the nature and extent of its limitations can be used for improving the model and the space weather predictions based on it.
  The present paper aims to test the capabilities of the recently developed heliospheric model Icarus and the linear force-free spheromak model that has been implemented in it.
  To validate the Icarus space weather modeling tool, two CME events were selected that were observed by two spacecraft located near Mercury and Earth, respectively. This enables testing the heliospheric model computed with Icarus at two distant locations. The source regions for the CMEs were identified, and the CME parameters were determined and later optimized. Different adaptive mesh refinement levels were applied in the simulations to assess its performance by comparing the simulation results to in-situ measurements.
  The first CME event erupted on SOL2013-07-09T15:24. The modeled time series were in good agreement with the observations both at MESSENGER and ACE. The second CME event started on SOL2014-02-16T10:24 and was more complicated, as three CME interactions occurred in this event. It was impossible to recover the observed profiles without modeling the other two CMEs that were observed, one before the main CME and one afterward. For both CME studies, AMR level 3 was sufficient to reconstruct small-scale features near Mercury, while at Earth, AMR level 4 was necessary due to the radially stretched grid that was used.</description>

      <title>Boron depletion in Galactic early B-type stars reveals two different main sequence star populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution and fate of massive stars are thought to be affected by rotationally induced internal mixing. The surface boron abundance is a sensitive tracer of this in early B-type main sequence stars. We test current stellar evolution models of massive main sequence stars which include rotational mixing through a systematic study of their predicted surface boron depletion. We construct a dense grid of rotating single star models using MESA, for which we employ a new nuclear network which follows all the stable isotopes up to silicon, including lithium, beryllium, boron, as well as the radioactive isotope aluminium-26. We also compile the measured physical parameters of the 90 Galactic early B-type stars with boron abundance information. We then compare each observed stars with our models through a Bayesian analysis, which yields the mixing efficiency parameter with which the star is reproduced the best, and the probability that it is represented by the stellar models. We find that about two-thirds of the sample stars are well represented by the stellar models, with the best agreement achieved for a rotational mixing efficiency of ~50% compared to the widely adopted value. The remaining one third of the stars, of which many are strongly boron depleted slow rotators, are largely incompatible with our models, for any rotational mixing efficiency. We investigate the observational incidence of binary companions and surface magnetic fields, and discuss their evolutionary implications. Our results confirm the concept of rotational mixing in radiative stellar envelopes. On the other hand, we find that a different boron depletion mechanism, and likely a different formation path, is required to explain about one-third of the sample stars. The large spread in the surface boron abundances of these stars may hold a clue to understanding their origin.</description>

      <title>Going Beyond the MHD Approximation: Physics-Based Numerical Solution of the CGL Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new numerical model for solving the Chew-Goldberger-Low system of equations describing a bi-Maxwellian plasma in a magnetic field. Heliospheric and geospace environments are often observed to be in an anisotropic state with distinctly different parallel and perpendicular pressure components. The CGL system represents the simplest leading order correction to the common isotropic MHD model that still allows to incorporate the latter's most desirable features. However, the CGL system presents several numerical challenges: the system is not in conservation form, the source terms are stiff, and unlike MHD it is prone to a loss of hyperbolicity if the parallel and perpendicular pressures become too different. The usual cure is to bring the parallel and perpendicular pressures closer to one another; but that has usually been done in an ad hoc manner. We present a physics-informed method of pressure relaxation based on the idea of pitch-angle scattering that keeps the numerical system hyperbolic and naturally leads to zero anisotropy in the limit of very large plasma beta. Numerical codes based on the CGL equations can, therefore, be made to function robustly for any magnetic field strength, including the limit where the magnetic field approaches zero. The capabilities of our new algorithm are demonstrated using several stringent test problems that provide a comparison of the CGL equations in the weakly and strongly collisional limits. This includes a test problem that mimics interaction of a shock with a magnetospheric environment in 2D.</description>

      <title>Reverse Shock Revisited in Cassiopeia A with Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using data from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, we revisited the reverse shock in the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A.Based on the spectroscopic of a series of annuli in the northwest (NW) and southeast (SE), we get the radial profiles of the S/Si K-alpha line flux ratio and Fe K-alpha line centroid energy. They both show monotonic increase, confirming that the Si- and Fe-rich ejecta are heated by the reverse shock.The abrupt change of the S and Si line flux ratio is clearly observed in Cassiopeia A, leading to the determination of the reverse shock location (~1.71+-0.16 arcmin and ~1.35+-0.18 arcmin in the NW and SE, with respect to the central source). By comparing the radial profiles of S and Si line flux, we find that the reverse shock is moving outward in the frame of the observer, and the velocities are ~3950+-210 km/s and ~2900+-260 km/s in the NW and SE, respectively. In contrast, the velocities become ~1150 km/s (NW) and ~1300 km/s (SE) in the ejecta frame. Our measured reverse shock velocities are quite consistent with those obtained from the X-ray and/or optical images. It therefore supplies a crosscheck of the accuracy for the two available methods to measure the reverse shock velocity in SNRs. Both the location and the velocity of the reverse shock show apparent asymmetry, suggesting that the asymmetric explosion of the progenitor plays a key role in the interaction between the reverse shock and the ejecta, ultimately shaping complex features observed in SNRs.</description>

      <title>The JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program VII. Stress Testing the NIRCam Exposure Time Calculator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We empirically assess estimates from v3.0 of the JWST NIRCam Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) using observations of resolved stars in Local Group targets taken as part of the Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science (ERS) Program. For bright stars, we find that: (i) purely Poissonian estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are in good agreement between the ETC and observations, but non-ideal effects (e.g., flat field uncertainties) are the current limiting factor in the photometric precision that can be achieved; (ii) source position offsets, relative to the detector pixels, have a large impact on the ETC saturation predictions and introducing sub-pixel dithers in the observation design can improve the saturation limits by up to ~1 mag. For faint stars, for which the sky dominates the error budget, we find that the choice in ETC extraction strategy (e.g., aperture size relative to point spread function size) can affect the exposure time estimates by up to a factor of 5. We provide guidelines for configuring the ETC aperture photometry to produce SNR predictions in line with the ERS data. Finally, we quantify the effects of crowding on the SNRs over a large dynamic range in stellar density and provide guidelines for approximating the effects of crowding on SNRs predicted by the ETC.</description>

      <title>Diamond phase in space and possibility of its spectroscopic detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eventual presence of diamond carbon allotrope in space is discussed in numerous theoretical and experimental studies. The review summarises principal mechanisms of nanodiamond formation and experimental results of spectroscopic and structural investigations of nano- and microdiamonds extracted from meteorites. Size dependence of diamond spectroscopic properties is discussed. Infrared spectroscopy allows detection of C-H bonds on surfaces of hot nanodiamond grains. Spectroscopic observation of nitrogen-related point defects in nanodiamonds is very challenging; moreover, such defects were never observed in nanodiamonds from meteorites. At the same time, photoluminescence and, eventually, absorption, of some impurity-related defects, in particular, of silicon-vacancy (SiV) center, observed in real meteoritic nanodiamonds, opens a possibility of diamond detection in astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>White dwarf magnetospheres: Shielding volatile content of icy objects and implications for volatile pollution scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. About 25% -- 50% of white dwarfs are found to be contaminated by heavy elements, which are believed to originate from external sources such as planetary materials. Elemental abundances suggest that most of the pollutants are rocky objects and only a small fraction of white dwarfs bear traces of volatile accretion.
  Aims. In order to account for the scarcity of volatile pollution, we investigate the role of the white dwarfs' magnetospheres in shielding the volatile content of icy objects.
  Methods. We estimated the volatile sublimation of inward-drifting exocomets. We assume the orbits of the exocomets are circularized by the Alfven wing drag that is effective for long-period comets.
  Results. Volatile material can sublimate outside the corotation radius and be shielded by the magnetic field. {The two conditions for this volatile-shielded mechanism are that the magnetosphere radius must be larger than the corotation radius and that the volatiles are depleted outside the corotation radius, which requires a sufficiently slow orbital circularization process.} We applied our model to nine white dwarfs with known rotational periods, magnetic fields, and atmosphere compositions. Our volatile-shielded model may explain the excess of volatile elements such as C and S in the disk relative to the white dwarf atmosphere in WD2326+049 (G29-38). Nevertheless, given the sensitivity of our model to the circularization process and material properties of icy objects, there remains considerable uncertainty in our results.
  Conclusions. Our work suggests a possible explanation for the scarcity of volatile-accretion signatures among white dwarfs. We also identify a correlation between the magnetic field strength, the spin period, and the composition of pollutants in white dwarf atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of magnetohydrodynamic modes in the ISM through synchrotron polarization statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the biggest challenges in understanding Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is identifying the plasma mode components from observational data. Previous studies on synchrotron polarization from the interstellar medium (ISM) suggest that the dominant MHD modes can be identified via statistics of Stokes parameters, which would be crucial for studying various ISM processes such as the scattering and acceleration of cosmic rays, star formation, dynamo. In this paper, we present a numerical study of the Synchrotron Polarization Analysis (SPA) method through systematic investigation of the statistical properties of the Stokes parameters. We derive the theoretical basis for our method from the fundamental statistics of MHD turbulence, recognizing that the projection of the MHD modes allows us to identify the modes dominating the energy fraction from synchrotron observations. Based on the discovery, we revise the SPA method using synthetic synchrotron polarization observations obtained from 3D ideal MHD simulations with a wide range of plasma parameters and driving mechanisms, and present a modified recipe for mode identification. We propose a classification criterion based on a new SPA+ fitting procedure, which allows us to distinguish between Alfv\'en mode and compressible/slow mode dominated turbulence. We further propose a new method to identify fast modes by analyzing the asymmetry of the SPA+ signature and establish a new asymmetry parameter to detect the presence of fast mode turbulence. Additionally, we confirm through numerical tests that the identification of the compressible and fast modes is not affected by Faraday rotation in both the emitting plasma and the foreground.</description>

      <title>[X/Fe] Marks the Spot: Mapping Chemical Azimuthal Variations in the Galactic Disk with APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical cartography of the Galactic disk provides insights to its structure and assembly history over cosmic time. In this work, we use chemical cartography to explore chemical gradients and azimuthal substructure in the Milky Way disk with giant stars from APOGEE DR17. We confirm the existence of a radial metallicity gradient in the disk of $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$R $\sim -0.066 \pm 0.0004$ dex/kpc and a vertical metallicity gradient of $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$Z $\sim -0.164 \pm 0.001$ dex/kpc. We find azimuthal variations ($\pm0.1$ dex) on top of the radial metallicity gradient that have been previously established with other surveys. The APOGEE giants show strong correlations with stellar age and the intensity of azimuthal variations in iron; older stellar populations show the largest deviations from the radial metallicity gradient. Beyond iron, we show that other elements (e.g., Mg, O) display azimuthal variations at the $\pm0.05$ dex-level across the Galactic disk. We illustrate that moving into the orbit-space could help constrain the mechanisms producing these azimuthal metallicity variations. These results suggest that the spiral arms of the Galaxy are not solely responsible for azimuthal metallicity variations and other Galactic processes are at play.</description>

      <title>Strange quark stars: the role of excluded volume effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cold strange quark stars employing an enhanced version of the quark-mass density-dependent model which incorporates excluded volume effects to address non-perturbative QCD repulsive interactions. We provide a comparative analysis of our mass formula parametrization with previous models from the literature. We identify the regions within the parameter space where three-flavor quark matter is more stable than the most tightly bound atomic nucleus (stability window). Specifically, we show that excluded volume effects do not change the Gibbs free energy per baryon at zero pressure, rendering the stability window unaffected. The curves of pressure versus energy density exhibit various shapes -- convex upward, concave downward, or nearly linear -- depending on the mass parametrization. This behavior results in different patterns of increase, decrease, or constancy in the speed of sound as a function of baryon number density. We analyze the mass-radius relationship of strange quark stars, revealing a significant increase in maximum gravitational mass and a shift in the curves towards larger radii as the excluded volume effect intensifies. Excluded volume effects render our models compatible with all modern astrophysical constraints, including the properties of the recently observed low-mass compact object HESSJ1731.</description>

      <title>Population III star formation in the presence of turbulence, magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence, magnetic fields and radiation feedback are key components that shape the formation of stars, especially in the metal-free environments at high redshifts where Population III stars form. Yet no 3D numerical simulations exist that simultaneously take all of these into account. We present the first suite of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code FLASH. We include both turbulent magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback coupled to primordial chemistry, and resolve the collapse of primordial clouds down to few au. We find that dynamically strong magnetic fields significantly slow down accretion onto protostars, while ionizing feedback is largely unable to regulate gas accretion because the partially ionized \ion{H}{ii} region gets trapped near the star due to insufficient radiative outputs from the star. The maximum stellar mass in the HD and RHD simulations that only yield one star exceeds $100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ within the first $5000\,\rm{yr}$. However, in the corresponding MHD and RMHD runs, the maximum mass of Population III star is only $60\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$. In other realizations where we observe widespread fragmentation leading to the formation of Population III star clusters, the maximum stellar mass is further reduced by a factor of few due to fragmentation-induced starvation. We thus conclude that magnetic fields are more important than ionizing feedback in regulating the mass of the star, at least during the earliest stages of Population III star formation, in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \approx 30$.</description>

      <title>The Potential of Asteroseismology to Resolve the Blue Supergiant Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite major progress in our understanding of massive stars, concerning discrepancies still remain between observations and theory. Most notable are the numerous stars observed beyond the theoretical main sequence, an evolutionary phase expected to be short-lived and hence sparsely populated. This is the "Blue Supergiant Problem." Stellar models with abnormal internal structures can provide long-lived solutions for this problem: core hydrogen-burning stars with oversized cores may explain the hotter ones, and core helium-burning stars with undersized cores may explain the cooler ones. Such stars may result from enhanced or suppressed mixing in single stars, or, more likely, as the products of binary interaction and stellar mergers.
  Here we investigate the potential of asteroseismology to uncover the nature of blue supergiants. We construct stellar models for the above scenarios and show that they predict $g$-mode period spacings that differ by an order of magnitude: $\sim$ 200~min versus $\sim$ 20~min for long-lived core H and He burning stars, respectively. For the classical scenario of H-shell-burning stars rapidly crossing the Hertzsprung gap, we furthermore predict changes of the order of $10^{-2}\,\mu\rm{Hz\,yr}^{-1}$ in high-frequency modes; this effect would be in principle observable from $\sim 5$~yr of asteroseismic monitoring if these modes can be identified. This raises the possibility of revealing the internal structure of blue supergiants, and thus determining whether these stars are indeed binary merger products. These asteroseismic diagnostics may be measurable through long time-series observations from the ongoing TESS mission and upcoming PLATO mission, thereby laying a path toward resolving the blue supergiant problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study MeV-scale electrophilic Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs), that may be abundantly produced in Supernova (SN) explosions, escape the star and decay into electrons and positrons. This exotic injection of leptons in the Milky Way leaves an imprint in both photon and cosmic-ray fluxes. Specifically, positrons lose energy and annihilate almost at rest with background electrons, producing photons with $511$ keV energy. In addition, electrons and positrons radiate photons through bremsstrahlung emission and upscatter the low-energy galactic photon fields via the inverse Compton process generating a broad emission from X-ray to $\gamma$-ray energies. Finally, electrons and positrons are directly observable in cosmic ray experiments. In order to describe the FIP-induced lepton injection in full generality, we use a model independent parametrization which can be applied to a host of FIPs such as axion-like particles, dark photons and sterile neutrinos. Theoretical predictions are compared to experimental data to robustly constrain FIP-electron interactions with an innovative multimessenger analysis.</description>

      <title>Evolution and final fate of massive post-common-envelope binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mergers of neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) are nowadays observed routinely thanks to gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. In the isolated binary-evolution channel, a common-envelope (CE) phase of a red supergiant (RSG) and a compact object is crucial to sufficiently shrink the orbit and thereby enable a merger via GW emission. Here, we use the outcomes of two three-dimensional (3D) magneto-hydrodynamic CE simulations of an initially 10.0 solar-mass RSG with a 5.0 solar-mass BH and a 1.4 solar-mass NS, respectively, to explore the further evolution and final fate of the post-CE binaries. Notably, the 3D simulations reveal that the post-CE binaries are likely surrounded by circumbinary disks (CBDs), which contain substantial mass and angular momentum to influence the subsequent evolution. The binary systems in MESA modelling undergo another phase of mass transfer (MT) and we find that most donor stars do not explode in ultra-stripped supernovae (SNe), but rather in Type Ib/c SNe. The final orbits of our models with the BH companion are too wide, and NS kicks are actually required to sufficiently perturb the orbit and thus facilitate a merger via GW emission. Moreover, by exploring the influence of CBDs, we find that mass accretion from the disk widens the binary orbit, while CBD-binary resonant interactions can shrink the separation and increase the eccentricity depending on the disk mass and lifetime. Efficient resonant contractions may even enable a BH or NS to merge with the remnant He stars before a second SN explosion, which may be observed as gamma-ray burst-like transients, luminous fast blue optical transients and Thorne-\.Zytkow objects. For the surviving post-CE binaries, the CBD-binary interactions may significantly increase the GW-induced double compact merger fraction. We conclude that accounting for CBD may be crucial to better understand observed GW mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) have three main components: a central star (CS), ionised gas and dust in the nebula. Each of them contains critical chemical fingerprints of their evolution, serving as tracers of the evolution, nucleosynthesis and dust production that occurred during the preceding asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. We aim to build a bridge to link the PN phase to the evolution of their progenitors, trying to better understand the dust production and mass-loss mechanism during the final AGB phase. Here, we present a comprehensive study of nine Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) spherical or elliptical PNe whose observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the infrared (IR) are available in the literature. We characterize nebulae and CSs, finding information as the amount of gas that makes up the nebula and the dust that surrounds the CS, necessary to reconstruct the evolutionary history of mass-loss and dust production. We compare the observed energy distribution of the selected PNe to that obtained from photoionization modeling, taking into account the presence of dust. The physical and chemical parameters of the central stars are then compared with the predictions from the evolutionary tracks. We characterized the source, assigning to each CS a progenitor, early-AGB mass. We estimated the mass of the nebula and the dust-to-gas ratio. For 5 objects, we find evidence for the presence of a near-IR bump, which would be connected to the presence of hot dust.</description>

      <title>The Variation of the Galaxy-Wide IMF for Low-Mass Stars: Modeling and Observational Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) characterizes the mass distribution of newly formed stars in various cosmic environments, serving as a fundamental assumption in astrophysical research. Recent findings challenge the prevalent notion of a universal and static IMF, proposing instead that the IMF's shape is contingent upon the star formation environment. In this study, we analyze the galaxy-wide variation of the IMF for low-mass stars in both dwarf and massive galaxies with diverse observational methods. Despite systematic discrepancies between different approaches, an IMF model with a metallicity-dependent slope for the low-mass stars aligns with the majority of observations, indicating a high degree of uniformity in the star formation processes across the universe. We also emphasize the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the variation of the low-mass IMF, considering measurement biases and factors beyond metallicity.</description>
