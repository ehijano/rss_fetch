      <title>An elementary proof of representation of submodular function as an supremum of measures on $\sigma$-algebra with totally ordered generating class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an alternative proof of a fact that a finite continuous non-decreasing submodular set function on a measurable space can be expressed as a supremum of measures dominated by the function, if there exists a class of sets which is totally ordered with respect to inclusion and generates the sigma-algebra of the space. The proof is elementary in the sense that the measure attaining the supremum in the claim is constructed by a standard extension theorem of measures. As a consequence, a uniquness of the supremum attaining measure also follows. A Polish space is an examples of the measurable space which has a class of totally ordered sets that generates the Borel sigma-algebra.</description>

      <title>Regular Coderivative and Graphical Derivative of the Metric Projection onto closed Balls in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first establish a formula for exactly computing the regular coderivative of the metric projection operator onto closed balls $r\mathbb{B}$ centered at the origin in Hilbert spaces. Then, this result is extended to metric projection operator onto any closed balls $\mathbb{B}(c,r)$, which has center $c$ in Hilbert space $H$ and with radius $r &gt; 0$. Finally, we give the formula for calculating the graphical derivative of the metric projection operator onto closed balls with center at arbitrarily given point in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Compact embeddings of Sobolev, Besov, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing compactness of embeddings of fractional Sobolev spaces, Besov spaces, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, in the general context of quasi-metric-measure spaces. Although stated in the setting of quasi-metric spaces, the main results in this article are new, even in the metric setting. Moreover, by considering the more general category of quasi-metric spaces we are able to obtain these characterizations for optimal ranges of exponents that depend (quantitatively) on the geometric makeup of the underlying space.</description>

      <title>On various classes of supercyclic operators on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize supercyclic weighted composition operators on various function spaces. Moreover, we also characterize supercyclic adjoint of the weighted composition operator and supercyclic left multipliers acting on the space of compact operators. Finally, we illustrate our results with concrete examples.</description>

      <title>On Modulation and Translation Invariant Operators and the Heisenberg Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spaces of operators which are invariant under translations or modulations by lattices in phase space. The natural connection to the Heisenberg module is considered, giving results on the characterisation of such operators as limits of finite--rank operators. Discrete representations of these operators in terms of elementary objects and the composition calculus are given. Different quantisation schemes are discussed with respect to the results.</description>

      <title>Representations of C*-correspondences on pairs of Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study representations of Hilbert bimodules on pairs of Hilbert spaces. If $A$ is a C*-algebra and $\mathsf{X}$ is a right Hilbert $A$-module, we use such representations to faithfully represent the C*-algebras $\mathcal{K}_A(\mathsf{X})$ and $\mathcal{L}_A(\mathsf{X})$. We then extend this theory to define representations of $(A,B)$ C*-correspondences on a pair of Hilbert spaces and show how these can be obtained from any nondegenerate representation of $B$. As an application of such representations, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on an $(A,B)$ C*-correspondences to admit a Hilbert $A$-$B$-bimodule structure. Finally, we show how to represent the interior tensor product of two C*-correspondences.</description>

      <title>The mod-2 cohomology groups of low-dimensional unordered flag manifolds and Auerbach bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unordered flag manifolds are the manifolds of unordered $n$-tuple of mutually orthogonal lines in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In this paper, we develop some basic tools to compute the mod-$2$ cohomology groups of these spaces, and apply them for explicit computation for small $n$. We show that this computation improves the known estimate of the number of Auerbach bases of normed linear spaces of small dimensions.</description>

      <title>Sampling recovery on function classes with a structural condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling recovery on some function classes is studied in this paper. Typically, function classes are defined by imposing smoothness conditions. It was understood in nonlinear approximation that structural conditions in the form of control of the number of big coefficients of an expansion of a function with respect to a given system of functions plays an important role. Sampling recovery on smoothness classes is an area of active research, some problems, especially in the case of mixed smoothness classes, are still open. It was discovered recently that universal sampling discretization and nonlinear sparse approximations are useful in the sampling recovery problem. This motivated us to systematically study sampling recovery on function classes with a structural condition. Some results in this direction are already known. In particular, the classes defined by conditions on coefficients with indices from the domains, which are differences of two dyadic cubes are studied in the recent author's papers. In this paper we concentrate on studying function classes defined by conditions on coefficients with indices from the domains, which are differences of two dyadic hyperbolic crosses.</description>
