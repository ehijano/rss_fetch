      <title>Beyond Social Media Analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steady flow of social-media cases toward the Supreme Court shows a nation reworking its fundamental relationship with technology. The cases raise a host of questions ranging from difficult to impossible: how to nurture a vibrant public square when a few tech giants dominate the flow of information, how social media can be at the same time free from conformist groupthink and also protected against harmful disinformation campaigns, and how government and industry can cooperate on such problems without devolving toward censorship.
  To such profound questions, this Essay offers a comparatively modest contribution -- what not to do. Always the lawyer's instinct is toward analogy, considering what has come before and how it reveals what should come next. Almost invariably, that is the right choice. The law's cautious evolution protects society from disruptive change. But almost is not always, and, with social media, disruptive change is already upon us. Using social-media laws from Texas and Florida as a case study, this Essay shows how social-media's distinct features render it poorly suited to analysis by analogy and argues that courts should instead shift their attention toward crafting legal doctrines targeted to address social media's unique ills.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Educational Outcome with Machine Learning: Modeling Friendship Formation, Measuring Peer Effect and Optimizing Class Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we look at a school principal's class assignment problem. We break the problem into three stages (1) friendship prediction (2) peer effect estimation (3) class assignment optimization. We build a micro-founded model for friendship formation and approximate the model as a neural network. Leveraging on the predicted friendship probability adjacent matrix, we improve the traditional linear-in-means model and estimate peer effect. We propose a new instrument to address the friendship selection endogeneity. The estimated peer effect is slightly larger than the linear-in-means model estimate. Using the friendship prediction and peer effect estimation results, we simulate counterfactual peer effects for all students. We find that dividing students into gendered classrooms increases average peer effect by 0.02 point on a scale of 5. We also find that extreme mixing class assignment method improves bottom quartile students' peer effect by 0.08 point.</description>

      <title>From Time-inconsistency to Time-consistency for Optimal Stopping Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For optimal stopping problems with time-inconsistent preference, we measure the inherent level of time-inconsistency by taking the time needed to turn the naive strategies into the sophisticated ones. In particular, when in a repeated experiment the naive agent can observe her actual sequence of actions which are inconsistent with what she has planned at the initial time, she then chooses her immediate action based on the observations on her later actual behavior. The procedure is repeated until her actual sequence of actions are consistent with her plan at any time. We show that for the preference value of cumulative prospect theory, in which the time-inconsistency is due to the probability distortion, the higher the degree of probability distortion, the more severe the level of time-inconsistency, and the more time required to turn the naive strategies into the sophisticated ones.</description>

      <title>Exploring Sustainable Clothing Consumption in Middle-Income Countries: A case study of Romanian consumers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overconsumption of consumers under today's increasingly scarce natural resources has overwhelmed the textile industry in middle-income countries, such as Romania. It is becoming more and more essential to encourage sustainable clothing consumption behaviors, such as purchasing recyclable clothes. Notwithstanding there is a limited number of studies trying to understand the intrinsic factors that motivate consumers' purchase intention toward sustainable clothes in middle-income countries. Moreover, the effect of consumers' environmental knowledge on determining their purchase intention of sustainable clothes remains understudied. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to make a significant contribution to the sustainable consumption literature by providing a consolidated framework that explores the behavioral factors inclining Romanian consumers' purchase intention towards sustainable clothes. The foundation of this study combines consumers' social value orientation and the theory of planned behavior. the partial least square path modelling procedure was used to analyze the data of 1,018 Romanian respondents. The findings of this study show that altruistic value orientation, subjective norms, and sustainable attitudes have a positive effect on Romanian consumers' purchase intention of sustainable clothing. Thus, these insights provide essential practical implications of advocating for the consumption of sustainable clothes along with useful guidelines for practitioners in the textile industry among middle-income countries, especially in Romania, to reduce overconsumption.</description>

      <title>Karma: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of non-tradable credits that flow between individuals like karma, hence proposed under that name, is a mechanism for repeated resource allocation that comes with attractive efficiency and fairness properties, in theory. In this study, we test karma in an online experiment in which human subjects repeatedly compete for a resource with time-varying and stochastic individual preferences or urgency to acquire the resource. We confirm that karma has significant and sustained welfare benefits even in a population with no prior training. We identify mechanism usage in contexts with sporadic high urgency, more so than with frequent moderate urgency, and implemented as an easy (binary) karma bidding scheme as particularly effective for welfare improvements: relatively larger aggregate efficiency gains are realized that are (almost) Pareto superior. These findings provide guidance for further testing and for future implementation plans of such mechanisms in the real world.</description>

      <title>Collaboratively adding context to social media posts reduces the sharing of false news</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a novel database of around 285,000 notes from the Twitter Community Notes program to analyze the causal influence of appending contextual information to potentially misleading posts on their dissemination. Employing a difference in difference design, our findings reveal that adding context below a tweet reduces the number of retweets by almost half. A significant, albeit smaller, effect is observed when focusing on the number of replies or quotes. Community Notes also increase by 80% the probability that a tweet is deleted by its creator. The post-treatment impact is substantial, but the overall effect on tweet virality is contingent upon the timing of the contextual information's publication. Our research concludes that, although crowdsourced fact-checking is effective, its current speed may not be adequate to substantially reduce the dissemination of misleading information on social media.</description>

      <title>Candidate Incentive Distributions: How voting methods shape electoral incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the tendency for different voting methods to promote political compromise and reduce tensions in a society by using computer simulations to determine which voters candidates are incentivized to appeal to. We find that Instant Runoff Voting incentivizes candidates to appeal to a wider range of voters than Plurality Voting, but that it leaves candidates far more strongly incentivized to appeal to their base than to voters in opposing factions. In contrast, we find that Condorcet methods and STAR (Score Then Automatic Runoff) Voting provide the most balanced incentives; these differences between voting methods become more pronounced with more candidates are in the race and less pronounced in the presence of strategic voting. We find that the incentives provided by Single Transferable Vote to appeal to opposing voters are negligible, but that a tweak to the tabulation algorithm makes them substantial.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Electricity Market Signals via Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a generative artificial intelligence approach to probabilistic forecasting of electricity market signals, such as real-time locational marginal prices and area control error signals. Inspired by the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series, we propose a weak innovation autoencoder architecture and a novel deep learning algorithm that extracts the canonical independent and identically distributed innovation sequence of the time series, from which future time series samples are generated. The validity of the proposed approach is established by proving that, under ideal training conditions, the generated samples have the same conditional probability distribution as that of the ground truth. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for self-scheduled resources such as battery storage participants, (ii) interregional price spread forecasting for virtual bidders in interchange markets, and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed generative forecaster over leading classical and modern machine learning techniques under both probabilistic and point forecasting metrics.</description>
