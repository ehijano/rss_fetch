      <title>Spatiotemporal noise stabilizes unbounded diversity in strongly-competitive communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical ecological models predict that large, diverse communities should be unstable, presenting a central challenge to explaining the stable biodiversity seen in nature. We revisit this long-standing problem by extending the generalized Lotka-Volterra model to include both spatial structure and environmental fluctuations across space and time. We find that neither space nor environmental noise alone can resolve the tension between diversity and stability, but that their combined effects permit arbitrarily many species to stably coexist despite strongly disordered competitive interactions. We analytically characterize the noise-induced transition to coexistence, showing that spatiotemporal noise drives an anomalous scaling of abundance fluctuations, known empirically as Taylor's law. At the community level, this manifests as an effective sublinear self-inhibition that renders the community stable and asymptotically neutral in the high-diversity limit. Spatiotemporal noise thus provides a novel resolution to the diversity-stability paradox and a generic mechanism by which complex communities can persist.</description>

      <title>Bistability to Quad-stability: Emergence of Hybrid Phenotypes &amp; Enhanced Spatio-temporal Plasticity in Presence of Host-Circuit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of multistability driven diseases, like cancer, spatiotemporal plasticity plays a significant role to achieve a spectrum of phenotypic variations. The interplay between gene regulatory networks and environmental factors, such as resource competition and spatial diffusion, plays a crucial role in determining cellular behaviour and phenotypic heterogeneity. Though reaction diffusion frameworks have been widely applied in developmental biology, less attention has been paid to the simultaneous effects of resource competition and growth feedback on spatial organization. In this paper, we observed that a bistable genetic circuit under high resource competition due to growth feedback gives rise to multiple emergent phenotypes, as observed in cancer systems. Furthermore, we observed how spatial diffusion coupled with intrinsic nonlinearity can drive the emergence of distinct spatial dynamics over time. The observed spatiotemporal plasticity can also be driven by the comparative stability of the fixed points, diffusivity, and asymmetry of diffusion. Our findings highlight that growth-induced resource competition combined with diffusion can provide deeper insights into metastasis and cancer progression.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Mediated Contagion: A Quantum Electrodynamics-Inspired Framework for Non-Local Epidemic Dynamics and Superdiffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a gauge-mediated Epidemiological Model inspired by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). In this model, the ``direct contact'' paradigm of classical SIR models is replaced by a gauge-mediated interaction where the environment, represented by a pathogen field $\varphi$, plays a fundamental role in the epidemic dynamics. In this model, the non-local characteristics of epidemics appear naturally by integrating out the pathogen field. Utilizing the Doi-Peliti formalism, we derive the effective action of the system and the standard Feynman rules that can be used to compute perturbatively any observables. Using standard QED techniques, we show how to relate renormalized pathogen mass, Debye screening, to epidemiological concepts and we compute at first order the effective reproductive number,$R_{eff}$, and how the condition to have an epidemic is related to a phase transition in the pathogen mass. We show that the superspreading hosts can be included easily in this formalism.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Bacterial Selection and Extinction Driven by Growth-Kill Trade-Off in Cyclic Antimicrobial Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimicrobial protocols - using substances such as antibiotics or disinfectants - remain the preferred option for preventing the spread of pathogenic bacteria. However, bacteria can develop mechanisms to reduce their antimicrobial susceptibility, which can lead to treatment failure and the selection of resistance or tolerance. In this work, we propose a minimal population dynamics model to study bacterial selection during cyclic antimicrobial application, a commonly used protocol. Selection in bacterial populations with heterogeneous antimicrobial susceptibility is modelled here as a trade-off between survival advantage (reduction in antimicrobial killing) and potential fitness costs (reduction in growth rate) of the less susceptible strains. The proposed model allows us to derive useful expressions for determining the success of cyclic antimicrobial treatments based on two bacterial traits: growth and kill rates. The results obtained here are directly applicable to preventing the selection and spread of resistant and tolerant bacterial strains in real-life protocols.</description>

      <title>Quasilocalization under coupled mutation-selection dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When mutations are rampant, quasispecies theory or Eigen's model predicts that the fittest type in a population may not dominate. Beyond a critical mutation rate, the population may even be delocalized completely from the peak of the fitness landscape and the fittest is ironically lost. Extensive efforts have been made to understand this exceptional scenario. But in general, there is no simple prescription that predicts the eventual degree of localization for arbitrary fitness landscapes and mutation rates. Here, we derive a simple and general relation linking the quasispecies' Hill numbers, which are diversity metrics in ecology, and the ratio of an effective fitness variance to the mean mutation rate squared. This ratio, which we call the localization factor, emerges from mean approximations of decomposed surprisal or stochastic entropy change rates. On the side of application, the relation we obtained here defines a combination of Hill numbers that may complement other complexity or diversity measures for real viral quasispecies. Its advantage being that there is an underlying biological interpretation under Eigen's model.</description>

      <title>Infection models on dense dynamic random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models on dense dynamic random graphs, in which the joint dynamics of vertices and edges are co-evolutionary, i.e., they influence each other bidirectionally. In particular, edges appear and disappear over time depending on the states of the two connected vertices, on how long they have been infected, and on the total density of susceptible and infected vertices. Our main results establish functional laws of large numbers for the densities of susceptible, infected, and recovered vertices, jointly with the underlying evolving random graphs in the graphon space. Our results are supported by simulations, which characterize the limiting size of the epidemics, i.e., the limiting density of susceptible vertices, and how the peak of the epidemics depends on the rate of the evolution of the underlying graph.
  The proofs of our main results rely on the careful construction of a mimicking process, obtained by approximating the two-way feedback interaction between vertex and edge dynamics with a mean-field type interaction, acting only as one-way feedback, that remains sufficiently close to the original co-evolutionary process. To treat the more general setting in which edge dynamics are affected by the proportions of susceptible and infected individuals, we introduce a methodological extension of existing techniques. We thus show that our model exhibits multiple epidemic peaks -- a phenomenon observed in real-world epidemics -- which can emerge in models that incorporate mutual feedback between vertex and edge dynamics.</description>

      <title>Flexible inference of evolutionary accumulation dynamics using uncertain observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting evolutionary accumulation pathways is a key objective in many fields of research, ranging from classical evolutionary biology to diverse applications in medicine. In this context, we are often confronted with the problem that data is sparse and uncertain. To use the available data as best as possible, inference approaches that can handle this uncertainty are required. One way that allows us to use not only cross-sectional data, but also phylogenetic related and longitudinal data, is using `hypercubic inference' models. In this article we introduce HyperLAU, a new algorithm for hypercubic inference that makes it possible to use datasets including uncertainties for learning evolutionary pathways. Expanding the flexibility of accumulation modelling, HyperLAU allows us to infer dynamic pathways and interactions between features, even when large sets of particular features are unobserved across the source dataset. We show that HyperLAU is able to highlight the main pathways found by other tools, even when up to 50% of the features in the input data are uncertain. Additionally, we demonstrate how it can help to overcome possible biases that can occur then reducing the used data by excluding uncertain parts. We illustrate the approach with a case study on multidrug resistance in tuberculosis, showing that HyperLAU allows more flexible data and provides new information about evolutionary pathways compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Fisher's fundamental theorem and regression in causal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fisher's fundamental theorem describes the change caused by natural selection as the change in gene frequencies multiplied by the partial regression coefficients for the average effects of genes on fitness. Fisher's result has generated extensive controversy in biology. I show that the theorem is a simple example of a general partition for change in regression predictions across altered contexts. By that rule, the total change in a mean response is the sum of two terms. The first ascribes change to the difference in predictor variables, holding constant the regression coefficients. The second ascribes change to altered context, captured by shifts in the regression coefficients. This general result follows immediately from the product rule for finite differences applied to a regression equation. Economics widely applies this same partition, the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, as a fundamental tool that can in proper situations be used for causal analysis. The same partition also arises in demography and thermodynamics. Recognizing the underlying mathematical generality clarifies Fisher's theorem, provides a useful tool for causal analysis, and reveals connections across disciplines.</description>
