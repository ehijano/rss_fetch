      <title>Phase transitions in an expanding medium -- hot remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of a first order confinement/deconfinement phase transition in an expanding medium using an effective boundary description fitted to the holographic Witten model. We observe and analyze hot plasma remnants, which do not cool down or nucleate bubbles despite the expansion of the system. The appearance of the hot remnants, the dynamics of their shrinking and subsequent dissolution and further heating up is very robust and persists in such diverse scenarios as boost-invariant expansion with a flat Minkowski metric and cosmological expansion in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the $\phi^6$ Theory in Three Dimensions at Large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $O(N)$--symmetric $\phi^6$ theory in three spacetime dimensions using dimensional regularisation and minimal subtraction. The predictions of other methods are scrutinised in a large-$N$ expansion. We show how the tricritical line of fixed point emerges in a strict $N\to\infty$ limit but argue that it is not a physical manifestation. For the first time in this explicit manner, we compute the effective potential at next-to-leading order in the $1/N$-expansion and discuss its stability. The Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon is also analysed at next-to-leading order, and we demonstrate that it disappears without breaking the scale invariance spontaneously. Our findings indicate that the UV fixed point found by Pisarski persists at large $N$.</description>

      <title>Are Moduli Vacuum Expectation Values or Parameters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Banks has argued that the moduli of string theory are not vacuum expectation values but parameters. We offer a different perspective on this question. Given two different points P and Q in the moduli space, we shall regard them as different vacua of the same underlying theory if in a theory where the asymptotic values of the moduli correspond to the point P, we can perform an experiment that can determine the spectrum and S-matrix of a theory where the asymptotic values of the moduli correspond to the point Q. We argue that in asymptotically flat space-time, this can be achieved by taking a charged black hole in the limit of large mass and charges. In this limit the local geometry at any point outside the horizon is indistinguishable from flat space-time. However the moduli vary slowly over the entire region so that their values at faraway points can differ by order unity. Therefore, by sending out experimental teams to different regions outside the horizon, an asymptotic observer can measure the spectrum and S-matrix for different values of the moduli.</description>

      <title>Vector mesons from a holographic QCD model in $f(R)$-dilaton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the spectrum of vector mesons based on $f(R)$-dilaton gravity. We focus particularly on the well-known Starobinsky model, given by the function $f(R)= R+ \alpha R^2$ in the metric formalism, and we examine the deviations from the pure Einstein-dilaton case. We thus provide the field equations for Starobinsky-dilaton gravity in $\rm AdS_{5}$ spacetime and calculate the spectral decomposition of the vector mesons by means of a Sturm-Liouville problem. Remarkably, for the rho mesons $m_{\rho^2}$ and $m_{\rho^3}$, our results are in good agreement with the experimental data when $\alpha= 10^{-8}$. Our work also generalizes previous studies and recovers standard results when $\alpha= 0$.</description>

      <title>The M5-Brane Limit of Eleven-Dimensional Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the M5-brane limit of eleven-dimensional supergravity. The resulting action is invariant under Galilean boosts and has a local scale symmetry. We also consider the limit of the equations of motion where we recover a Poisson-like equation arising from an M5-brane source but which does not follow from the non-relativistic action. We argue that the resulting theory describes gravitational fluctuations around a stack of M5-branes, represented by a trivial Minkowskian spacetime, but where the number of M5-branes is determined by the flux of a Lagrange multiplier field.</description>

      <title>Genuine multi-entropy and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is bipartite entanglement sufficient for holography? Through the analysis of the Markov gap, it is known that the answer is no. In this paper, we give a new perspective on this issue from a different angle using a multi-entropy. We define a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy from a $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy by subtracting appropriate linear combinations of $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite multi-entropies for $\mathtt{\tilde{q}} &lt; \mathtt{q}$, in such a way that the genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy vanishes for all $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite entangled states. After studying several aspects, we apply it to black holes and holography. For the application to black holes, we see that such a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy is important only after the Page time. For the application to holography, we prove that non-bipartite multi-entropies are always positive and $\mathcal{O}\left({1/ G_N}\right)$, as long as boundary subregions are connected. This indicates that for holography, genuine multi-partite entanglement is not small and plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Beyond Algebraic Superstring Compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superstring compactifications have been vigorously studied for over four decades, and have flourished involving an active iterative feedback between physics and (complex) algebraic geometry. This led to an unprecedented wealth of constructions, virtually all of which are "purely" algebraic. Recent developments however indicate many more possibilities to be afforded by including certain generalizations that, at first glance at least, are not algebraic -- yet fit remarkably well within an overall mirror-symmetric framework and are surprisingly amenable to standard computational analysis upon certain mild but systematic modifications.</description>

      <title>The CEGM NLSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying quantum field theories through geometric principles has revealed deep connections between physics and mathematics, including the discovery by Cachazo, Early, Guevara and Mizera (CEGM) of a generalization of biadjoint scalar amplitudes. However, extending this to generalizations of other quantum field theories remains a central challenge. Recently it has been discovered that the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) emerges after a certain zero-preserving deformation from $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$. In this work, we find a much richer story of zero-preserving deformations in the CEGM context, yielding generalized NLSM amplitudes. We prove an explicit formula for the residual embedding of an $n$-point NLSM amplitude in a mixed $n+2$ point generalized NLSM amplitude, which provides a strong consistency check on our generalization. We show that the dimension of the space of pure kinematic deformations is $\gcd(k,n)-1$, we introduce a deformation-compatible modification of the Global Schwinger Parameterization, and we include a new proof, using methods from matroidal blade arrangements, of the linear independence for the set of planar kinematic invariants for CEGM amplitudes. Our framework is compatible with string theory through recent generalizations of the Koba-Nielsen string integral to any positive configuration space $X^+(k,n)$, where the usual Koba-Nielsen string integral corresponds to $X(2,n) = \mathcal{M}_{0,n}$.</description>

      <title>Large N vector models in the Hamiltonian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fluctuating $N$ formalism, based on second-quantization, to describe large $N$ vector models from field theory using Hamiltonian methods. We first present the method in the simpler setting of a quantum mechanical system with quartic interactions, and then apply these techniques to the $O(N)$ model in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. We recover various known results, such as the gap equation determining the ground state of the system, the presence of bound states at negative coupling and the leading order contribution to critical exponents, and provide an interpretation of the large $N$ path integral saddle point as a Bose-Einstein condensate of extended objects in the presence of a non-local interaction. In the large $N$ limit, this formalism leads naturally to a description of elementary $O(N)$ symmetric excitations in terms of bilocal fields, which are at the basis of $\text{AdS}_4/\text{CFT}_3$ studies of the $O(N)$ model and Vasiliev gravity.</description>

      <title>Fermionic CFTs from topological boundaries in abelian Chern-Simons theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum field theory is referred to as bosonic (non-spin) if its physical quantities are independent of the spacetime spin structure, and as fermionic (spin) if they depend on it. We explore fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) that emerge from bosonic abelian Chern-Simons theories, playing the role of a symmetry topological field theory, by imposing topological boundary conditions. Our construction includes the fermionic generalization of code CFTs. When the Chern-Simons theory is associated with the root lattice of a simply laced Lie algebra, this approach yields a fermionic CFT with a level-one affine Lie algebra symmetry. As an application, we consider the Chern-Simons theories corresponding to a class of supersymmetric vertex operator algebras studied by Johnson-Freyd and classify their fermionic topological boundary conditions that give rise to supersymmetric CFTs.</description>

We consider two types of $T^7/Z_2^3$ orbifolds which, with appropriate flux choices, yield integer dual dimensions for the operators corresponding to the closed string scalar fields in the dual CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the effects of noncommutative geometry on the properties of p-wave holographic superconductors with massive vector condensates in the probe limit. We have applied the St\"{u}rm-Liouville eigenvalue approach to analyze the model. In this model, we have calculated the critical temperature and the value of the condensation operator for two different values of $m^2$. We have also shown how the influence of noncommutative geometry modifies these quantities. Finally, by applying a linearized gauge field perturbation along the boundary direction, we calculated the holographic superconductor's DC conductivity using a self-consistent approach and then carrying out a more rigorous analysis. The noncommutative effects are also found to be present in the result of DC conductivity. We have also found that just like the commutative case, here the DC conductivity diverges due to the presence of a first order pole in the frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in a doubly holographic model of closed $\mathbf{dS_{2} }$ spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double holography has been proved to be a powerful method in comprehending the spacetime entanglement. In this paper we investigate the doubly holographic construction in ${\mathrm{dS_{2}} }$ spacetime. We find that in this model there exists a new extremal surface besides the Hartman-Maldacena surface and the island surface, which could lead to a more complex phase structure. We then propose a generalized mutual entropy to interpret the phase transition. However, this extremal surface has a subtle property that the length of a part of the geodesic is negative when this saddle is dominant. This is because the negative part of the geodesic is within the horizon of the bulk geometry. We move to the ${\mathrm{AdS_{2}} }$ spacetime and find this subtlety still exists. We purpose a simple solution to this issue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze some aspects of the cubic action for gravity recently proposed by Cheung and Remmen, which is a particular instance of a first order (Palatini) action. In this approach both the spacetime metric and the connection are treated as independent fields. We discuss its BRST invariance and compute explicitly the one-loop contribution of quantum fluctuations around flat space, checking that the corresponding Slavnov-Taylor identities are fulfilled. Finally, our results on a first order action are compared with the existing ones corresponding to a second order action.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Accretion Disks: Turbulence, Mode Excitation and Prospects for Future Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational-wave emission by turbulent flows in accretion disks around spinning black holes or neutron stars. We aim to understand how turbulence can stochastically excite black hole quasinormal ringing and contribute to a stochastic gravitational-wave background from accretion disks around compact objects. We employ general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and feed them as the source of the Teukolsky master equation to evaluate the gravitational wave energy spectrum of a single source. The stochastic gravitational wave background from accretion disks generated by the population of stellar-mass compact objects is far below the sensitivity of third-generation ground-based detectors. In contrast, the supermassive black hole population, in particular those actively accreting, could lead to $\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}\sim 10^{-15}$ in the microHertz. This signal remains well below the sensitivities of pulsar-timing-arrays and LISA, making direct observation infeasible.</description>

      <title>Gauge hierarchy and metastability from Higgs-driven crunching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new solution to the Higgs hierarchy problem based on a dynamical vacuum selection mechanism in a landscape which scans the Higgs mass. In patches where the Higgs mass parameter takes a natural value, the Higgs potential only admits a minimum with a large and negative energy density. This causes a cosmological crunch, removing such patches from the landscape. Conversely, in patches where the Higgs mass parameter is smaller than a critical value, the Higgs potential admits a metastable minimum with the standard cosmological history. This critical value is determined by the instability scale, where the quartic coupling turns negative due to its running. The ability of this mechanism to explain the observed Higgs mass hinges on new physics at the TeV scale, such as vector-like fermions. We study two simple realizations of this scenario in a heavy neutral lepton model and in the singlet-doublet model, the latter mimicking a Higgsino-bino system. We show that the relevant parts of their parameter spaces can be probed by proposed future colliders, such as the FCC-ee or a muon collider.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of shift-symmetric Horndeski and beyond Horndeski theories (theories in which only derivatives of the scalar field appear in the action). Utilizing Euclidean methods, we first analyze two specific cases that serve as foundational examples for the broader framework. We derive the general expression for entropy variation within this setting, for homogeneous spacetimes, demonstrating that both parity-preserving and parity-violating terms contribute to the entropy formula. Given the functional form of the coupling terms, the black hole entropy can be determined by integrating this relation with respect to the event horizon. Our general result is consistent with previously reported special cases in the literature. Notably, for particular constraints on the coupling functions, the entropy identically vanishes. Furthermore, we establish that homogeneous spacetimes within shift- and parity-symmetric beyond-Horndeski theories universally obey Bekenstein's Area Law for entropy, irrespective of the specific form of the coupling functions.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$: package for numerical computation of Lauricella functions depending on a parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$ package, a computational tool developed in Wolfram Mathematica for high-precision numerical evaluations of Lauricella functions with indices linearly dependent on a parameter, $\varepsilon$. The package leverages a method based on analytical continuation via Frobenius generalized power series, providing an efficient and accurate alternative to conventional approaches relying on multi-dimensional series expansions or Mellin--Barnes representations. This one-dimensional approach is particularly advantageous for high-precision calculations and facilitates further optimization through $\varepsilon$-dependent reconstruction from evaluations at specific numerical values, enabling efficient parallelization. The underlying mathematical framework for this method has been detailed in our previous work, while the current paper focuses on the design, implementation, and practical applications of the $\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$ package.</description>

      <title>Screening rho-meson mass in the presence of strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the screening mass of the neutral rho-meson in the presence of strong magnetic fields using the Kroll-Lee-Zumino (KLZ) model. The rho-meson self-energy is computed at one-loop order within the lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation, considering the magnetic field as the dominant energy scale. Due to Lorentz symmetry breaking induced by the external field, we decompose the self-energy into three independent tensor structures, which give rise to three distinct modes. Additionally, the four-momentum splits into parallel and perpendicular components, leading to two types of screening masses: the parallel screening mass ( $p_0=0$ and $p_\perp \to 0$ ) and the perpendicular screening mass ( $p_0=0$ and $p_\parallel \to 0$ ). Our results show that the zero and perpendicular modes exhibit a monotonically increasing behavior with the magnetic field strength, whereas the parallel mode remains essentially constant. These findings provide new insights into the behavior of vector mesons in strongly magnetized media, with implications for QCD under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Scale Setting and Strong Coupling Determination in the Gradient Flow Scheme for 2+1 Flavor Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a scale determination, scale setting, and determination of the strong coupling in the gradient flow scheme using the $N_f=2+1$ highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensembles generated by the HotQCD Collaboration for bare gauge couplings ranging from $\beta = 7.030$ to $8.400$. The gradient flow scales we obtain in this work are $\sqrt{t_0} = 0.14229(98)$~fm and $w_0 = 0.17190(140)$~fm. Using the decay constants of the kaon and $\eta_s$, as well as the bottomonium mass splitting from the literature, we also calculate the potential scale $r_1$, obtaining $r_1 = 0.3072(22)$~fm. We fit the flow scales to an Allton-type ansatz as a function of $\beta$, providing a polynomial expression that allows for the prediction of lattice spacings at new $beta$ values. As a secondary result, we make an attempt to determine $\Lambda_{\overline{\mathrm{MS}}}$ and use it to estimate the strong coupling in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cosmological Implications of the Modified Raychaudhuri Equation in Non-Gravitating Vacuum Energy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the modified Raychaudhuri Equation (RE) in the context of Non-Gravitating Vacuum Energy (NGVE) theory and its implications for various cosmological characteristics. The equation is formulated based on the NGVE framework, in which global scale invariance generates a unique geometry. The newly developed geometry introduces a metric that is conformally connected to the conventional metric, with the conformal factor dependent on scalar field potentials. The cosmological study is carried out under the framework of a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. Assuming matter behaves as an ideal fluid in the modified geometry, we formulate models for conditional expansion, collapse, and steady state, governed by the scalar field ($\phi$). In this context, the caustic solution and the focusing theorem are also studied. Scalar field solutions for exponential and power-law scale factors are also derived using NGVE theory's equations of motion. Finally, graphical analysis is used to investigate the behavior of the interaction terms that appear in the modified RE under these scale factors.</description>

      <title>Models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on $T^2/{\mathbb Z}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study six-dimensional $SU(n)$ gauge models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on $T^2/{\mathbb Z}_4$. In the absence of continuous Wilson line phases, product group unification models can be constructed based on $SU(7)$ and $SU(8)$ gauge models. When continuous Wilson line phases are present, we find that a minimal model, namely, an $SU(6)$ gauge model, can describe the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry. In addition, this model has excellent features that two Higgs doublets appear from the zero modes of the extra-dimensional gauge field, and the quarks in each generation can be unified into one multiplet, without exotic quarks, as the zero modes of a bulk field in the $\boldsymbol{15}$ representation of $SU(6)$. We show that there exists a vacuum where the electroweak symmetry is slightly broken, as a minimum of the effective potential for the continuous Wilson line phases, by adding suitable bulk fields, in a toy model. This electroweak symmetry breaking can be naturally understood in terms of the two Higgs doublet model, and mass eigenstates of the neutral Higgs bosons are examined, including the component corresponding to the nonflat direction, which does not appear in the continuous Wilson line phases. We also discuss the tadpole terms of the field strength localized on fixed points. We show that their direct contributions to the Higgs masses can be forbidden by a reflection symmetry, and thus, quadratic divergences are not reintroduced into the Higgs masses not only at one-loop level but also at higher orders.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrected Einstein-Yang-Mills black holes in semiclassical gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) black holes in semiclassical gravity by including in the field equations the expectation value of a renormalized energy-momentum tensor in the Polyakov approximation. We solve the field equations and the equations of motion self-consistently. This framework has previously been used to study vacuum solutions, i.e. quantum corrected Schwarzschild black holes. In our system, which contains black hole hair, we find quantum corrected solutions in which the classical horizon disappears and is replaced by a wormhole structure, similarly to what is found in vacuum. We also find quantum corrected solutions in which the classical horizon disappears, but there is no wormhole structure. Our results indicate that the inclusion of black hole hair in semiclassical gravity still leads to the disappearance of classical horizons for nonextremal black holes in static spherically symmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Normalizing Fock space states in static spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theory, sharp momentum states have to be normalized to be in Fock space. We investigate different normalization schemes, both box normalization and wave packets. These methods are equivalent in flat spacetimes, but turn out to produce different results in curved spacetimes, specifically in those that break translation invariance. This means that scattering processes have to be defined in relation to the normalization scheme used, rather than being independent of it as is the case in flat spacetime. We provide an illustrative example of this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Testing the consistency of new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst dataset cosmological constraints with those from better-established cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are promising cosmological probes for exploring the Universe at intermediate redshifts ($z$). We analyze 151 Fermi-observed long GRBs (datasets A123 and A28) to simultaneously constrain the Amati correlation and cosmological parameters within six spatially flat and nonflat dark energy models. We find that these datasets are standardizable via a single Amati correlation, suggesting their potential for cosmological analyses. However, constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter from A123 and the combined A123 + A28 data exhibit $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those derived from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most considered cosmological models. This tension indicates that these GRB data are unsuitable for jointly constraining cosmological parameters with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO and similar data. Although the A28 data constraints are consistent with the $H(z)$ + BAO data constraints, its limited sample size (28 GRBs) and high intrinsic scatter ($\sim0.7$) diminishes its statistical power compared to existing datasets.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Truncation Crafted for UV-divergent QFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) to systematically study RG flows that require the renormalization of coupling constants. This is a necessary step towards making HT a fully general method for QFT calculations. We apply this theory to a number of QFTs defined as relevant deformations of $d=1+1$ CFTs. We investigated three examples of increasing complexity: the deformed Ising, Tricritical-Ising, and non-unitary minimal model $M(3,7)$. The first two examples provide a crosscheck of our methodologies against well established characteristics of these theories. The $M(3,7)$ CFT deformed by its $Z_2$-even operators shows an intricate phase diagram that we clarify. At a boundary of this phase diagram we show that this theory flows, in the IR, to the $M(3,5)$ CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By working with the covariant phase space formalism, we have shown that not only can the Hamiltonian conjugate to a Killing vector field $\xi$ be expressed as the sum of the associated Noether charge and $\xi$ contracted with the Hilbert action boundary term for $F(R_{abcd})$ gravity, but also be written as its contraction with another $\xi$ independent tensor field. With this, we have proven the equivalence of Noether charge and Hilbert action boundary term formulae for the stationary black hole entropy in $F(R_{abcd})$ gravity, which is further substantiated by our explicit computation using both formulae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a generalisation of Brand-Dicke (BD) theory can provide a theoretical basis for dark energy at early times. This generalisation is based on introducing a potential for the BD scalar and allowing of the latter to interact with radiation in the radiation-dominated rea. We argue that the model we take up provides a strong theoretical basis for early dark energy (EDE) so that the scalar field can mimic a cosmological constant and quintessence behaviors under slow-roll and non-slow-roll conditions, respectively.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau description of a class of non-unitary minimal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the Ginzburg-Landau description of the non-unitary conformal minimal model $M(3,8)$ is provided by the Euclidean theory of two real scalar fields with third-order interactions that have imaginary coefficients. The same lagrangian describes the non-unitary model $M(3,10)$, which is a product of two Yang-Lee theories $M(2,5)$, and the Renormalization Group flow from it to $M(3,8)$. This proposal has recently passed an important consistency check, due to Y. Nakayama and T. Tanaka, based on the anomaly matching for non-invertible topological lines. In this paper, we elaborate the earlier proposal and argue that the two-field theory describes the $D$ series modular invariants of both $M(3,8)$ and $M(3,10)$. We further propose the Ginzburg-Landau descriptions of the entire class of $D$ series minimal models $M(q, 3q-1)$ and $M(q, 3q+1)$, with odd integer $q$. They involve $PT$ symmetric theories of two scalar fields with interactions of order $q$ multiplied by imaginary coupling constants.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study ${\mathcal N} = 1$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory on $\mathbb{R}^2\times (S^1)_3\times (S^1)_4$ with the 't Hooft twist. The theory becomes weakly coupled if the length $L_4$ of $(S^1)_4$ is sufficiently small, $NL_4\Lambda\ll 1$. We explore the nonperturbative dynamics at the weak-coupling regime by changing the size of $L_3$ and uncover how $3$d monopole/bion-based effective theory for $L_3\gg L_4$ is related to the $2$d vortex-based theory for $L_3\approx L_4$. The highlights of our results are (1) the smooth "weak-weak" continuity of the vacuum structure and gluino condensate during the $3$d-$2$d dimensional reduction, (2) the switching of Wilson loop behavior from the area law in $3$d to the perimeter law in $2$d via a "double-string" picture, (3) the role of mass deformation in breaking discrete chiral symmetry and restoring the area law in $2$d, and (4) the microscopic investigation of bions during the reduction from $3$d to $2$d and the cancellation of the vacuum energy due to the hidden topological angle. We also discuss the generalization of our results for (1)--(3) from $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM to QCD with adjoint quarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the recently introduced linear equation, reformulating the first Friedmann equation, is the first-order WKB expansion of a quantum cosmological equation. This result shows a deeper underlying connection between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, pointing towards a unified framework. Solutions of this equation are built in terms of a scale factor encapsulating quantum effects on a free-falling particle. The quantum scale factor reshapes cosmic dynamics, resolving singularities at its vanishing points. As an explicit example, we consider the radiation-dominated era and show that the quantum equation is dual to the one in Seiberg-Witten formulation, recently applied to black holes, and incorporates resurgence phenomena and complex metrics, as developed by Kontsevich, Segal, and Witten. This links to the invariance of time parametrization under $\Gamma(2)$ transformations of the dual wave function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a wider theoretical framework that has quantum field theory built-in, taking the fact that quantum mechanics is reconstructed from quantum field theory as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as an inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation.</description>

      <title>Boundary terms in string field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We supplement the string field theory action with boundary terms to make its variational principle well-posed. Central to our considerations is the violation of the stress-energy tensor conservation in non-compact CFTs due to the boundary terms. This manifests as the failure of the cyclicity of the BRST operator, which encodes the target space integration by parts identities at the level of the worldsheet. Using this failure, we argue that the free closed string field theory action admits a well-posed variational principle upon including an additional boundary contribution. We explicitly work out the resulting action up to the massless level and show that it is related to the expansion of the low-energy effective string action endowed with the Gibbons-Hawking-York term on a flat background. We also discuss the structure of the boundary terms in the interacting theory.</description>

      <title>Conformal Cores of Quantum Black Holes in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that quadratic gravity, as a renormalizable theory, describes the interior of quantum black holes. We find new exact power-law solutions to pure quadratic gravity under spherical symmetry, which are complex valued. The resulting solutions, dubbed powerballs, are horizonless compact objects that become Schwarzschild-like a small distance (of the order of the Planck length) outside the would-be Schwarzschild horizon. We present a description of the global eternal geometry, whose right and left exteriors are Lorentzian and Euclidean Schwarzschild-like regions, respectively, while the complex interior is a form of spiraling spacetime. We compute the total on-shell action integral as a saddle point to a gravitational path integral and discuss the Lorentzian and Euclidean interpretations thereof.</description>

      <title>Sphere free energy of scalar field theories with cubic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dimensional continuation approach to calculating the free energy of $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the round sphere $S^d$ has been used to develop its $4-\epsilon$ expansion for a number of well-known non-supersymmetric theories, such as the $O(N)$ model. The resulting estimate of the sphere free energy $F$ in the 3D Ising model has turned out to be in good agreement with the numerical value obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization. In this paper, we develop the $6-\epsilon$ expansions for CFTs on $S^d$ described by scalar field theory with cubic interactions and use their resummations to estimate the values of $F$. In particular, we study the theories with purely imaginary coupling constants, which describe non-unitary universality classes arising when certain conformal minimal models are continued above two dimensions. The Yang-Lee model $M(2,5)$ is described by a field theory with one scalar field, while the $D$-series $M(3,8)$ model is described by two scalar fields. We also study the $OSp(1|2)$ symmetric cubic theory of one commuting and two anti-commuting scalar fields, which appears to describe the critical behavior of random spanning forests. In the course of our work, we revisit the calculations of beta functions of marginal operators containing the curvature. We also use another method for approximating $F$, which relies on perturbation theory around the bilocal action near the long-range/short-range crossover. The numerical values it gives for $F$ tend to be in good agreement with other available methods.</description>

      <title>The entropy of radiation for local quenches in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the real time dynamics of the radiation produced by a local quench in a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with $d&gt;2$. Using the interpretation of the higher-dimensional twist operator as a conformal defect, we study the time evolution of the entanglement entropy of the radiation across a spherical entangling surface. We provide an analytic estimate for the early- and late-time behavior of the entanglement entropy and derive an upper bound valid at all times. We extend our analysis to the case of a boundary CFT (BCFT) and derive similar results through a detailed discussion of the setup with two conformal defects (the boundary and the twist operator). We conclude with a holographic analysis of the process, computing the time evolution of the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) as the area of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in a backreacted geometry. This gives a Page-like curve in agreement with the early- and late-time results obtained with CFT methods. The extension to a holographic BCFT setup is generically hard and we consider the case of a tensionless end-of-the-world brane.</description>

      <title>The Superconformal Index and Black Hole Instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N)$ has provided powerful insights into the entropy of supersymmetric black holes in AdS$_5\times S^5$, including some sub-leading logarithmic and non-perturbative corrections. Recently, the phase space of supersymmetric solutions has been argued to contain configurations other than the asymptotically AdS$_5$ black hole. Such configurations include the so-called grey galaxies where the black hole at the center is surrounded by a gas of gravitons. By numerically evaluating the superconformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills at small values of $N$, we detect systematic deviations from the entropy of black holes with two distinct angular momenta. We find that the giant graviton expansion of the index is a numerically efficient way of evaluating the index that complements the direct character evaluation and allows for explicit access to $N\le 15$ with up to two giant gravitons in the expansion. We find it remarkable that a supersymmetric quantity in field theory, usually thought of as a rigid counting observable, indeed contains information about different phases in the space of supersymmetric solutions on the gravity side.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Carrollian Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the first example of interacting quantized Carrollian Dirac fermions and investigate their discrete symmetries, including charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T) transformations. As a toy model, we couple these fermions to a Carrollian scalar field using Carrollian Yukawa theory and compute the tree-level diagram, revealing an ultralocal interaction between the Carrollian fermions and the scalar field. This interaction, widely known as a Dirac delta interaction with time-dependent factor, frequently appears in quantum physics. We then address the renormalization of the theory by employing the Wilsonian procedure at one-loop order. Furthermore, we analyze the fixed points and stability properties of Carrollian Yukawa theory, comparing them with their relativistic counterparts. Beyond the specific Yukawa model studied here, we expect that our framework will have broader applications in Carrollian physics, particularly in understanding ultralocal interactions and their role in condensed matter systems, where similar phenomena arise in strongly correlated and non-relativistic regimes.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flows and the Curvature of Theory Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The metric and potential associated with the gradient property of renormalisation group flow in multiscalar models in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions are studied. The metric is identified with the Zamolodchikov metric of nearly marginal operators on the sphere. An explicit form for the associated Ricci scalar in $d=4-\varepsilon$ is derived, which shows that the space of multiscalar field theories is curved. The potential is identified with a quantity $\widetilde{F}$ that was previously proposed as a weakly monotonic function interpolating between the $a$-theorem in four dimensions and the $F$-theorem in three dimensions. This implies that the $\widetilde{F}$-theorem can be extended perturbatively to a theorem about gradient flow in $d=4-\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Constraining the history of reheating with the NANOGrav 15-year data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last few years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as a strong candidate for cold dark matter. A significant number of PBHs are produced when the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced on small scales (compared to the COBE normalized values on large scales). Such primordial spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the scalar-induced, secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The recent detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened up the possibility of directly probing the very early universe. Different studies have shown that, when PBHs are assumed to have been formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the mechanism for the amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to explain the PTA data can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In this work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power spectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary GWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of radiation domination. Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the conditions for the formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs produced remains within the observational bounds. We find that the scalar-induced SGWB generated during a phase of reheating with a steeper equation of state (than that of radiation) fit the NANOGrav 15-year data with a stronger Bayesian evidence than the astrophysical scenario involving GWs produced by merging supermassive binary black holes.</description>

      <title>General Discussions on the SU(2) Vector Boson Dark Matter Model with a Single Higgs Multiplet -- Lagrangian, Discrete Subgroups, and Scalar Classifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vector boson dark matter particles which stem from some broken gauge symmetries usually requires some unbroken symmetries to keep themselves stable. In the previous literature, some simplest cases have been discussed, in which the unbroken symmetry is provided by a remnant subgroup of the gauge group. It would be interesting to ask whether all the possible remnant subgroups as well as all the possible coupling forms can be enumerated. Classifying all the Higgs components into different mass degenerate representations to simplify the diagonalization processes is also necessary. Rather than the ambitious target of providing a general solution to all kinds of gauge groups configured with all forms of the Higgs multiplets, in this paper, we concentrate on the case of $\text{SU(2)}_{\text{D}}$ gauge group together with a single Higgs multiplet. We enumerate all possible discrete subgroups that can survive up to $n=21$, where $n$ is the dimension of the Higgs multiplet. We also provide the general algorithms to enumerate all possible renormalizable operators, to write down the general forms of the vacuum expectation value (VEV) configurations, and to give the detailed results of all the mass degenerate irreducible representations embedded in the Higgs multiplet.</description>

      <title>Standard Model anomalies and vacuum stability for lepton portals with extra $U(1)$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the experimental values of the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ and of the $W$ boson mass $m_{_W}$ have both indicated significant deviations from the SM predictions, motivating the exploration of extensions with extra particles and symmetries. We revisit a lepton portal model with $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry where an extra Higgs doublet, a scalar singlet and one $SU(2)_L$ singlet vector-like fermion are introduced. In this model, $(g-2)_\mu$ can be explained by extra one-loop contributions from the vector-like lepton and the $Z'$ boson, whereas $m_{_W}$ can be increased by a tree-level mixing between the $Z$ and $Z'$. Setting the $Z'$ and lepton couplings at low energies to account for the SM anomalies, we perform a Renormalization Group analysis to investigate on the high-energy behaviour of the model, in particular on the issue of vacuum stability. We find that in the alignment limit for the two Higgs doublets, the Landau pole and the scale where perturbativity is lost are of order $10-100\,{\rm TeV}$, not far from the scales experimentally reached so far, and sensibly lower than the stability scale. We show how the Landau pole can be increased up to $\sim10^9\,{\rm GeV}$ in a misaligned scenario where the experimental anomalies are still accommodated and a positive shift of the Higgs quartic coupling to improve stability can be achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the interior spacetime of stars is built in a Lorentz symmetry breaking model called bumblebee gravity. Firstly, we calculated the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this context of modified gravity. Then we show that the bumblebee field, responsible for the symmetry breaking, increases the star mass-radius relation when it assumes its vacuum expectation value. When compared to the general relativity mass-radius relation, a Lorentz symmetry breaking context, like the bumblebee gravity, could provide more massive stars, surpassing the $2.5 M_{\odot}$ limit as the interior of the star is described by quark matter with the MIT bag model. Also, we investigate the stability of the solution with the MIT bag equation of state in this context of modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal Dark Matter in $U(1)_{B-L}$ Extension of Inert Doublet Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM) that explains both neutrino masses and dark matter (DM) in the intermediate-mass range by incorporating a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry. This additional symmetry enables the inclusion of right-handed neutrinos, providing a natural mechanism for neutrino mass generation. While the CP-even component of the inert doublet can serve as a DM candidate, its thermal relic abundance is insufficient to match the observed DM density. To address this, we introduce a non-thermal production mechanism, where a heavy scalar associated with the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry decays into the inert doublet scalar, yielding a viable relic abundance at low reheating temperatures. We also examine both direct and indirect detection prospects for this DM candidate and assess the model against current experimental constraints.</description>

Abstract: Lattice $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories with complex actions share many key features with finite-density QCD including a sign problem and $CK$ symmetry. Complex $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models exhibit a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality mapping them onto chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models, which are simulatable with standard lattice methods in large regions of parameter space. The Migdal-Kadanoff real-space renormalization group (RG) preserves this duality, and we use it to compute the approximate phase diagram of both spin and gauge $\mathbb{Z}_3$ models in dimensions one through four. Chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin models are known to exhibit a Devil's Flower phase structure, with inhomogeneous phases which can be thought of as $\mathbb{Z}_3$ analogues of chiral spirals. Out of the large class of models we study, we find that only chiral spin models and their duals have a Devil's Flower structure with an infinite set of inhomogeneous phases, a result we attribute to Elitzur's theorem. We also find that different forms of the Migdal-Kadanoff RG produce different numbers of phases, a violation of the expectation for universal behavior from a real-space RG. We discuss extensions of our work to $\mathbb{Z}_N$ models, SU($N$) models and nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in massive gravity: Waveforms generated by a particle plunging into a black hole and the excitation of quasinormal modes and quasibound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the aim of testing massive gravity in the context of black hole physics, we investigate the gravitational radiation emitted by a massive particle plunging into a Schwarzschild black hole from slightly below the innermost stable circular orbit. To do so, we first construct the quasinormal and quasibound resonance spectra of the spin-2 massive field for odd and even parity. Then, we compute the waveforms produced by the plunging particle and study their spectral content. This allows us to highlight and interpret important phenomena in the plunge regime, including (i) the excitation of quasibound states, with particular emphasis on the amplification and slow decay of the post-ringdown phase of the even-parity dipolar mode due to harmonic resonance; (ii) during the adiabatic phase, the waveform emitted by the plunging particle is very well described by the waveform emitted by the particle living on the innermost stable circular orbit, and (iii) the regularized waveforms and their unregularized counterparts constructed from the quasinormal mode spectrum are in excellent agreement. Finally, we construct, for arbitrary directions of observation and, in particular, outside the orbital plane of the plunging particle, the regularized multipolar waveforms, i.e., the waveforms constructed by summing over partial waveforms.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Picture for Entanglement Hamiltonians in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the quasiparticle picture of entanglement evolution to obtain an effective description for the out-of-equilibrium Entanglement Hamiltonian at the hydrodynamical scale following quantum quenches in free fermionic systems in two or more spatial dimensions. Specifically, we begin by applying dimensional reduction techniques in cases where the geometry permits, building directly on established results from one-dimensional systems. Subsequently, we generalize the analysis to encompass a wider range of geometries. We obtain analytical expressions for the entanglement Hamiltonian valid at the ballistic scale, which reproduce the known quasiparticle picture predictions for the Renyi entropies and full counting statistics. We also numerically validate the results with excellent precision by considering quantum quenches from several initial configurations.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms Behind the Aschenbach Effect in Non-Rotating Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that a rotating black hole drags the spacetime due to its spin. This effect can influence the motion of nearby objects, causing them to either fall into the black hole or orbit around it. In classical Newtonian mechanics, as the radius of the orbit increases, the angular velocity of an object in a stable circular orbit decreases. However, Aschenbach discovered that for a hypothetical non-rotating observer, contrary to usual behavior, the angular velocity increases with radius in certain regions. Although the possibility of observing rare and less probable rotational behaviors in a rotating structure is not unlikely or impossible. However, observing such behaviors in a static structure is not only intriguing but also thought-provoking, as it raises questions about the factors that might play a role in such phenomena. In seeking answers to this question, various static models, particularly in the context of nonlinear fields, were examined, with some results presented as examples in the article. Among the models studied, the model of Magnetic Black Holes in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet Massive Gravity Coupled to Nonlinear Electrodynamics (M-EGB-Massive) appears to be a candidate for this phenomenon. In the analysis section, we will discuss the commonalities of this model with previous models that have exhibited this phenomenon and examine the cause of this phenomenon. Finally, we will state whether this phenomenon is observable in other black holes and, if not, why</description>

      <title>Natural solution of SUSY $\mu$ problem from modulus stabilization in modular flavor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a solution to the SUSY $\mu$-problem within the framework of modular flavor symmetry. The explicit $\mu$-term is prohibited by modular symmetry, and an effective $\mu$-term is regenerated following the stabilization of the modulus field. We examine the stabilization mechanism of a single modulus field with the presence of SUSY breaking contributions described by the non-linear SUSY realization scheme involving a nilpotent Goldstino $\textbf{X}_{nl}$ superfield. The inclusion of $\textbf{X}_{nl}$ contributions can slightly alter the original stabilized modulus VEV to a value near some fixed point. A natural small $\mu_{eff}$, significantly smaller than the SUSY scale, can result from either the expansion of typical modular forms using a small deviation parameter near the fixed point $\omega$, or from the combined effects of suppression by powers of $q^{1/24}$ [or $(2\Im\tau)^{-1}$] along with the asymptotic suppression behavior of typical modular forms away from the fixed point $i\infty$, taking the form of appropriate power of the tiny deviation parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Cardoso and Nat\'ario [6] constructed an exact solution of Einstein-scalar field equations that describes a scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe. In fact, this solution belongs to a more general class of solutions described by Herdeiro in [7]. In this work we show how to further generalize these solutions in presence of rotation and various charges. More specifically, we describe the general charged rotating black holes with NUT charge and present some of their properties.</description>

      <title>Competition and survival in modern academia: A bibliometric case study of theoretical high-energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the career lengths of researchers in theoretical high-energy physics from 1950 to 2020. Using a cohort-based analysis and bibliometric data from 30,149 authors in three physics disciplines we observe a dramatic increase in the ratio of academic dropouts over time. Where nearly all authors prior to the 1980s remained active more than a decade after their initial publication, this was the case for 50% or less by the 2010s. Consequently, the fraction of theoretical physicists who achieve full academic careers have diminished significantly in the last four decades. Additionally, we study correlations between author survivability and potential success factors, inferring that early author productivity and collaborative efforts have become increasingly strong determinants over time. A logistic regression is utilized to interpret the empirical findings through a survival model. Performance measures further indicate that early career collaboration and productivity rates have emerged as reliable predictors of author survivability during the period in which competition has intensified. Finally, we discuss the potential impacts that these developments may have on science itself.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 1. Primordial Theory &amp; Optimal Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primordial four-point function encodes a wealth of information about the inflationary Universe. Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 2. Code &amp; Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 3. Constraints from Planck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} &lt;1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.</description>
