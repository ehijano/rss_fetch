      <title>Positive Hermitian curvature flow on 2-step nilpotent Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the positive Hermitian curvature flow for left-invariant metrics on $2$-step nilpotent Lie groups with a left-invariant complex structure $J$. We describe the long-time behavior of the flow under the assumption that $J[\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]$ is contained in the center of $\mathfrak{g}$. We show that under our assumption the flow $g_{t}$ exists for all positive $t$ and $(G,(1+t)^{-1}g_{t})$ converges, in the Cheeger-Gromov topology, to a $2$-step nilpotent Lie group with a non flat semi-algebraic soliton. Moreover, we prove that, in our class of Lie groups, there exists at most one semi-algebraic soliton solution, up to homothety. Similar results were proved by M. Pujia and J. Stanfield for nilpotent complex Lie groups \cite{P2021, S2021}. In the last part of the paper we study the Hermitian curvature flow for the same class of Lie groups.</description>

      <title>All toric Hermitian ALE gravitational instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the only smooth, Ricci flat, ALE instanton with a toric Hermitian non-K\"ahler structure is the Eguchi-Hanson instanton. The proof is analogous to the classification of toric Hermitian ALF instantons by Biquard and Gauduchon, although we avoid the use of toric K\"ahler geometry and instead perform a direct global analysis of the Tod form of the metric in Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates. This supports a conjecture by Gibbons and Bando-Kasue-Nakajima which states that any Ricci flat ALE instanton is self-dual.</description>

      <title>Generalized Bishop frames of regular time-like curves in 4-dimensional Lorentz space $\mathbb{L}^{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduced generalized Bishop frames on curves in 4-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^{4}$, which are orthonormal frames such that the derivatives of the vectors of the frames along the curve can be expressed, via a certain matrix, as a linear combination of the vectors of the frame.
  In relation to that, we study generalized Bishop frames of regular time-like curves. In a previous work, we showed that there is a hierarchy among different types of generalized Bishop frames for regular curves in the Euclidean space. Building upon this study, we further investigate it in the 4-dimensional Lorentz space $\mathbb{L}^4$. There are four types of generalized Bishop frames of regular time-like curves in $\mathbb{L}^{4}$ up to the change of the order of vectors fixing the first one which is the tangent vector. Unlike other types of curves, such as light-like and space-like ones, the time-like curve can be investigated in a manner analogous to the Euclidean case. We find that a hierarchy of frames exists, similar to that in the Euclidean setting. Based on this hierarchy, we propose a new classification of curves.</description>

      <title>A family of non-simple surfaces whose transport twistor spaces admit global blow-down maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature on X-ray transform and Transport Twistor (TT) spaces, blow-down maps (or maps with holomorphic blow-down structure as defined in [BMP24]) are maps that desingularize the degenerate complex structure of the TT space of an oriented Riemannian surface, while collapsing (yet separating) geodesics of the unit tangent bundle of that surface. Such maps were originally constructed in [BMP24] for near-constant curvature simple surfaces, showing that the interior of their TT space is biholomorphic to an open set in standard $\mathbb{C}^2$. The construction there relied on a microlocal argument leveraging the absence of conjugate points. In this note, we construct an explicit example of a family of convex, non-trapping Riemannian surfaces, some of which have conjugate points, yet all of whose TT spaces admit a global blow-down map. We also discuss a consequence on the existence of special geodesically invariant functions and its application to geometric inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Stability Estimates for Commutativity Properties of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laplacian $\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$ on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ has the property that it can explicitly be expressed in terms of $\Lambda$, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the unit ball, as $\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}=\Lambda^2+(n-2)\Lambda$. In this paper, we seek to characterize those manifolds for which such an exact relationship holds, and more generally measure the discrepancy of such a relationship holding in terms of geometric data. To this end, we obtain a stability estimate which shows that, for a smoothly bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$, if the commutator $[\Lambda,\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}]$ is small then that domain is itself close to a ball. We then study the case of manifolds conformal to the ball, show that a relationship as above implies a radial metric structure, and discuss stability in this setting. Finally, we provide a modern exposition of Gohberg's lemma, a foundational result in microlocal analysis which we employ as a starting step for our reasoning.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Carleman-type estimates for holomorphic sections over bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes quantitative Carleman-type inequalities for holomorphic sections of Hermitian vector bundles over bounded domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ with $n \geq 2$. We first prove a Sobolev-type inequality with explicit constants for the Laplace operator, which leads to quantitative Carleman-type estimates for holomorphic functions. These results are then extended to holomorphic sections of Hermitian vector bundles satisfying certain curvature restrictions, yielding quantitative versions where previously only non-quantitative forms were available. The proofs refine existing methods through careful constant tracking and by estimating the radius of the uniform sphere condition of the boundary through the Lipschitz constant of its outward unit normal vector.</description>

      <title>Bigraded Lie algebras and nilpotent fundamental groups of smooth complex algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex algebraic variety. Assume that the fundamental group $\pi_1(X,x)$ is torsion-free nilpotent. We show that if the betti number $b_1(X)$ is less than or equal to $3$, then $\pi_1(X,x)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}^2$, $\mathbb{Z}^3$, a lattice in the Heisenberg group $H_3(\mathbb{R})$ or $\mathbb{R}\times H_3(\mathbb{R})$. Moreover we show that $\pi_1(X,x)$ is abelian or $2$-step nilpotent if the rank of $\pi_1(X,x)$ is less than or equal to seven. We prove the main theorems by using the bigraded structures of mixed Hodge structures on nilpotent Lie algebras. In particular, if the rank of $\pi_1(X,x)$ is less than or equal to six, then we show that $\pi_1(X,x)$ is a lattice in an abelian Lie group $\mathbb{R}^n$ or a $(2k+1)$-dimensional Heisenberg group $H_{2k+1}(\mathbb{R})$ or a product group $\mathbb{R}^m\times H_{2l+1}(\mathbb{R})$ or $H_3(\mathbb{R})\times H_3(\mathbb{R})$ for some $n=1,2,3,4,5,6$, $k=1,2$ or $(m,l)=(1,3),(2,3),(3,3),(1,5)$. Our main result supports a conjecture of nilpotent (quasi-) K\"ahler group provided by Aguilar and Campana.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that given a Fuchsian representation $\rho_\circ: \pi_1S \rightarrow {\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb R)$, where $S$ is a closed oriented surface of genus $\geq 2$, any hyperbolic cone-metric on $S$ with cone-angles $&gt;2\pi$ isometrically embeds as a future-convex bent Cauchy surface in a globally hyperbolic maximal Cauchy compact anti-de Sitter (2+1)-spacetime whose left representation is $\rho_\circ$. Furthermore, we show that such a spacetime and an embedding are unique provided that $d$ is sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on the symplectic geometry of graded manifolds and higher Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study symplectic structures on graded manifolds and their global counterparts, higher Lie groupoids. We begin by introducing the concept of graded manifold, starting with the degree 1 case, and translating key geometric structures into classical differential geometry terms. We then extend our discussion to the degree 2 case, presenting several illustrative examples with a particular emphasis on equivariant cohomology and Lie bialgebroids. Next, we define symplectic Q-manifolds and their Lagrangian Q-submanifolds, introducing a graded analogue of Weinstein's tubular neighborhood theorem and applying it to the study of deformations of these submanifolds.
  Shifting focus, we turn to higher Lie groupoids and the shifted symplectic structures introduced by Getzler. We examine their Morita invariance and provide several examples drawn from the literature. Finally, we introduce shifted Lagrangian structures and explore their connections to moment maps and symplectic reduction procedures.
  Throughout these notes, we illustrate the key constructions and results with concrete examples, highlighting their applications in mathematics and physics. These lecture notes are based on two mini-courses delivered by the first author at Geometry in Algebra and Algebra in Geometry VII (2023) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and at the INdAM Intensive Period: Poisson Geometry and Mathematical Physics (2024) in Napoli, Italy.</description>

      <title>Filtered complexes and cohomologically equivalent subcomplexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Rumin's work on a subcomplex in sub-Riemannian manifolds which is cohomologically equivalent to the de Rham complex, we present a more general construction that produces subcomplexes from any filtered cochain complex of finite depth and still computes the cohomology of the original filtered complex. A priori these subcomplexes depend not only on the filtration itself, but also on the choice of additional structures. However, we show that the construction only depends on the given filtration up to isomorphism. Finally, we show how such subcomplexes relate to spectral sequences, a cohomological machinery that arises naturally when considering a filtered complex.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the Laplacian and the Jacobi operator on Generalized rotational minimal hypersurfaces of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M\subset S^{n+1}$ be the hypersurface generated by rotating a hypersurface $M_0$ contained in the interior of the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^{n-k+1}$. More precisely, $M=\{(\sqrt{1-|m|^2}\, y, m):y\in S^k, m\in M_0\}$. We derive the equation for the mean curvature of $M$ in terms of the principal curvatures of $M_0$. For the particular case when $M_0$ is a surface of revolution in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we provide a method for finding the eigenvalues of the Laplace and stability operators. To illustrate this method, we consider an example of a minimal embedded hypersurface in $S^6$ and numerically compute all the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator less than 12, as well as all non-positive eigenvalues of the stability operators. For this example, we show that the stability index (the number of negative eigenvalues of the stability operator, counted with multiplicity) is 77, and the nullity (the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\lambda=0$ of the stability operator) is 14. Similar results are found in the case where $M_0$ is a hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{l+2}$ of the form $(f_2(u)z, f_1(u))$, with $z$ in the $l$-dimensional unit sphere $S^l$. Carlotto and Schulz have found examples of embedded minimal hypersurfaces in the case where $M_0=S^k\times S^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the short-time existence theory of Ricci-DeTurck flow starting from rough metrics which satisfy a Morrey-type integrability condition. Using the rough existence theory, we show the preservation and improvement of distributional scalar curvature lower bounds provided the singular set for such metrics is not too large. As an application, we use the Ricci flow smoothing to study the removable singularity for scalar curvature rigidity in the compact case under Morrey regularity conditions. Our result supplements those of Jiang-Sheng-Zhang.</description>

      <title>Spray-Invariant Sets in Infinite-Dimensional Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of spray-invariant sets on infinite-dimensional manifolds, where any geodesic of a spray starting in the set stays within it for its entire domain. These sets, possibly including singular spaces such as stratified spaces, exhibit different geometric properties depending on their regularity: sets that are not differentiable submanifolds may show sensitive dependence, for example, on parametrization, whereas for differentiable submanifolds invariance is preserved under reparametrization.
  This framework offers a broader perspective on geodesic preservation than the rigid notion of totally geodesic submanifolds, with examples arising naturally even in simple settings, such as linear spaces equipped with flat sprays.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider general $k$th-mixed curvature $\mathcal{C}^{(k)}_{\alpha,\beta}$ ($\beta\neq0$) for Hermitian manifolds, which is a convex combination of the $k$th Chern Ricci curvature and holomorphic sectional curvature. We prove that any compact Hermitian surface with constant $k$th-mixed curvature is self-dual. Furthermore, we show that if a compact Hermitian surface has constant 2th-mixed curvature $c$, then the Hermitian metric must be K\"{a}hler. For the higher-dimensional case, when the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ satisfy certain conditions, we can also obtain partial results.</description>

      <title>Duistermaat-Heckman measures for Hamiltonian groupoid actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a source proper, source connected regular symplectic groupoid acting locally freely and effectively in a Hamiltonian way, and assume that the moment map is proper and has connected fibres. In this case there is an associated Duistermaat-Heckman measure on the quotient orbifold. We show that this measure is polynomial with respect to the natural affine measure.</description>

      <title>The Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the wake of major breakthroughs in General Relativity during the 1960s, Roger Penrose introduced Strong Cosmic Censorship, a profound conjecture regarding the deterministic nature of the theory. Penrose's proposal has since opened far-reaching new mathematical avenues, revealing connections to fundamental questions about black holes and the nature of gravitational singularities. We review recent advances arising from modern techniques in the theory of partial differential equations as applied to Strong Cosmic Censorship, maintaining a focus on the context of gravitational collapse that gave birth to the conjecture.</description>
