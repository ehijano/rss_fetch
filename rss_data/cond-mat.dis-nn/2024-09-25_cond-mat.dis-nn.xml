      <title>DisQu: Investigating the Impact of Disorder in Quantum Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered Quantum many-body Systems (DQS) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) have many structural features in common. However, a DQS is essentially an initialized QNN with random weights, often leading to non-random outcomes. In this work, we emphasize the possibilities of random processes being a deceptive quantum-generating model effectively hidden in a QNN. In contrast to classical noisy maps, quantum maps have the possibility of ergodicity breaking leading to memory effects and thus multiple consequences on the learnability and trainability of QNN. This phenomenon may lead to a fundamental misunderstanding of the capabilities of common quantum generative models, where the generation of new samples is essentially averaging over random outputs. While we suggest that DQS can be effectively used for tasks like image augmentation, we draw the attention that overly simple datasets are often used to show the generative capabilities of quantum models, potentially leading to overestimation of their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Hessian Spectrum at the Ground State in Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the bulk Hessian spectrum at approximate ground states in any spherical spin glass. Marginal stability, the presence of many near-zero Hessian eigenvalues, is shown to be equivalent to full replica symmetry breaking near overlap $1$ at zero temperature. This connection has long been implicit in the physics literature, which also links marginal stability to the performance of efficient algorithms. For even models, we prove the Hessian has no outlier eigenvalues, which has geometric consequences for low temperature Gibbs measures in the case that marginal stability is absent. Our proofs rely on interpolation bounds for certain vector spin glass models. For generic spin glasses, we give another more conceptual argument that full RSB near overlap $1$ implies marginal stability at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Avalanche criticality emerges by thermal fluctuation in a quiescent glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report avalanche criticality of thermal relaxation in glassy systems after a rapid quench by molecular simulation. Our analysis of the energy landscape and the scaling reveals that particle rearrangement is critical. The critical phenomenon has the same origin as avalanches in sheared amorphous solids, but the critical exponent differs from previously observed. Our results suggest that by viewing a glass as a thermally driven elastoplastic material, we can understand dynamics below the glass transition point, such as aging.</description>

      <title>Self-attention as an attractor network: transient memories without backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers are one of the most successful architectures of modern neural networks. At their core there is the so-called attention mechanism, which recently interested the physics community as it can be written as the derivative of an energy function in certain cases: while it is possible to write the cross-attention layer as a modern Hopfield network, the same is not possible for the self-attention, which is used in the GPT architectures and other autoregressive models. In this work we show that it is possible to obtain the self-attention layer as the derivative of local energy terms, which resemble a pseudo-likelihood. We leverage the analogy with pseudo-likelihood to design a recurrent model that can be trained without backpropagation: the dynamics shows transient states that are strongly correlated with both train and test examples. Overall we present a novel framework to interpret self-attention as an attractor network, potentially paving the way for new theoretical approaches inspired from physics to understand transformers.</description>

      <title>Toward mean-field bound for critical temperature on Nishimori line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12728v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation establishes a lower bound of the true critical inverse temperature in a broad class of ferromagnetic spin models. This is referred to as the mean-field bound for the critical temperature. In this study, we explored the possibility of a corresponding mean-field bound for the critical temperature in Ising spin glass models with Gaussian randomness on the Nishimori line. On this line, the critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation is given by $\beta_{MF}^{NL}=\sqrt{1/z}$, where $z$ is the coordination number. Using the Griffiths inequalities on the Nishimori line, we proved that there is zero spontaneous magnetization in the high-temperature region $\beta &lt; \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. In other words, the true critical inverse temperature $\beta_c^{NL}$ on the Nishimori line is always bounded by $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in obtaining the corresponding mean-field bound $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}$ on the Nishimori line.</description>

      <title>Trade-off relations between quantum coherence and measure of many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum coherence, a fundamental resource in quantum computing and quantum information, often competes with localization effects that affects quantum states in disordered systems. In this work, we prove exact trade-off relations between quantum coherence and a measure of localization and many-body localization, namely, the inverse participation ratio (IPR).We prove that for a pure quantum state, l1-norm of quantum coherence and the relative entropy of coherence satisfy complementarity relations with IPR. For a mixed state, IPR and the l2-norm of quantum coherence as well as relative entropy of coherence satisfy trade-off inequalities. These relations suggest that quantum coherence, in disordered quantum systems is also an ideal characterization of the delocalisation to many-body localisation transition, much like IPR, which is a well-known diagnostic of MBL. These relations also provide insight into the unusual properties of bipartite entanglement entropy across the MBL transition. We believe that these trade-off relations can help in better understanding of how coherence can be preserved or lost in realistic many-body quantum systems, which is vital for developing robust quantum technologies and uncovering new phases of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to QAOA: finding a needle in the haystack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Comparison of intermediate-range order in GeO$_2$ glass: molecular dynamics using machine-learning interatomic potential vs.\ reverse Monte Carlo fitting to experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The short and intermediate-range order in GeO$_2$ glass are investigated by molecular dynamics using machine-learning interatomic potential trained on ab initio calculation data and compared with reverse Monte Carlo fitting of neutron diffraction data. To characterize the structural differences in each model, the total/partial structure factors, coordination number, ring size and shape distributions, and persistent homology analysis were performed. These results show that although the two approaches yield similar two-body correlations, they can lead to three-dimensional models with very different short and intermediate-range ordering. A clear difference was observed especially in the ring distributions; RMC models exhibit a broad distribution in the ring size distribution, while neural network potential molecular dynamics yield much narrower ring distributions. This confirms that the density functional approximation in the ab initio calculations determines the preferred network assembly more strictly than RMC with simple coordination constraints and neutron diffraction data with isotope substitution.</description>
