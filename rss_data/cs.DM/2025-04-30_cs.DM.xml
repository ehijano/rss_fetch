      <title>Note about the complexity of the acyclic orientation with parity constraint problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a connected graph, and let $T$ in $V$ be a subset of vertices. An orientation of $G$ is called $T$-odd if any vertex $v \in V$ has odd in-degree if and only if it is in $T$. Finding a T -odd orientation of G can be solved in polynomial time as shown by Chevalier, Jaeger, Payan and Xuong (1983). Since then, $T$-odd orientations have continued to attract interest, particularly in the context of global constraints on the orientation. For instance, Frank and Kir\'aly (2002) investigated $k$-connected $T$-odd orientations and raised questions about acyclic $T$-odd orientations. This problem is now recognized as an Egres problem and is known as the "Acyclic orientation with parity constraints" problem. Szegedy ( 005) proposed a randomized polynomial algorithm to address this problem. An easy consequence of his work provides a polynomial time algorithm for planar graphs whenever $|T | = |V | - 1$. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether it exists in general. In this paper we contribute to the understanding of the complexity of this problem by studying a more general one. We prove that finding a $T$-odd acyclic orientation on graphs having some directed edges is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Approximately Dominating Sets in Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condorcet's paradox is a fundamental result in social choice theory which states that there exist elections in which, no matter which candidate wins, a majority of voters prefer a different candidate. In fact, even if we can select any $k$ winners, there still may exist another candidate that would beat each of the winners in a majority vote. That is, elections may require arbitrarily large dominating sets.
  We show that approximately dominating sets of constant size always exist. In particular, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, every election (irrespective of the number of voters or candidates) can select $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2})$ winners such that no other candidate beats each of the winners by a margin of more than $\varepsilon$ fraction of voters.
  Our proof uses a simple probabilistic construction using samples from a maximal lottery, a well-studied distribution over candidates derived from the Nash equilibrium of a two-player game. In stark contrast to general approximate equilibria, which may require support logarithmic in the number of pure strategies, we show that maximal lotteries can be approximated with constant support size. These approximate maximal lotteries may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the structure of (dart, odd hole)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hole is a chordless cycle with at least four vertices. A hole is odd if it has an odd number of vertices. A dart is a graph which vertices $a, b, c, d, e$ and edges $ab, bc, bd, be, cd, de$. Dart-free graphs have been actively studied in the literature. We prove that a (dart, odd hole)-free graph is perfect, or does not contain a stable set on three vertices, or is the join or co-join of two smaller graphs. Using this structure result, we design a polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal colouring of (dart, odd hole)-free graphs. A graph $G$ is perfectly divisible if every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ contains a set $X$ of vertices such that $X$ meets all largest cliques of $H$, and $X$ induces a perfect graph. The chromatic number of a perfectly divisible graph $G$ is bounded by $\omega^2$ where $\omega$ denotes the number of vertices in a largest clique of $G$. We prove that (dart, odd hole)-free graphs are perfectly divisible.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and local complexity of Delone sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study complexity and periodicity of Delone sets by applying an algebraic approach to multidimensional symbolic dynamics. In this algebraic approach, $\mathbb{Z}^d$-configurations $c: \mathbb{Z}^d \to \mathcal{A}$ for a finite set $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ and finite $\mathbb{Z}^d$-patterns are regarded as formal power series and Laurent polynomials, respectively. In this paper we study also functions $c: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathcal{A}$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is as above. These functions are called $\mathbb{R}^d$-configurations. Any Delone set may be regarded as an $\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration by simply presenting it as its indicator function. Conversely, any $\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration whose support (that is, the set of cells for which the configuration gets non-zero values) is a Delone set can be seen as a colored Delone set. We generalize the concept of annihilators and periodizers of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-configurations for $\mathbb{R}^d$-configurations. We show that if an $\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration has a non-trivial annihilator, that is, if a linear combination of some finitely many of its translations is the zero function, then it has an annihilator of a particular form. Moreover, we show that $\mathbb{R}^d$-configurations with integer coefficients that have non-trivial annihilators are sums of finitely many periodic functions $c_1,\ldots,c_m: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{Z}$. Also, $\mathbb{R}^d$-pattern complexity is studied alongside with the classical patch-complexity of Delone sets. We point out the fact that sufficiently low $\mathbb{R}^d$-pattern complexity of an $\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration implies the existence of non-trivial annihilators. Moreover, it is shown that if a Meyer set has sufficiently slow patch-complexity growth, then it has a non-trivial annihilator. Finally, a condition for forced periodicity of colored Delone sets of finite local complexity is provided.</description>

      <title>Average Case Analysis of Leaf-Centric Binary Tree Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.10396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the average number of distinct fringe subtrees in random trees generated by leaf-centric binary tree sources as introduced by Zhang, Yang and Kieffer. A leaf-centric binary tree source induces for every $n \geq 2$ a probability distribution on the set of binary trees with $n$ leaves. We generalize a result by Flajolet, Gourdon, Martinez and Devroye, according to which the average number of distinct fringe subtrees in a random binary search tree of size $n$ is in $\Theta(n/\log n)$, as well as a result by Flajolet, Sipala and Steayert, according to which the number of distinct fringe subtrees in a uniformly random binary tree of size $n$ is in $\Theta(n/\sqrt{\log n})$.</description>

      <title>A Dense Neighborhood Lemma: Applications of Partial Concept Classes to Domination and Chromatic Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In its Euclidean form, the Dense Neighborhood Lemma (DNL) asserts that if $V$ is a finite set of points of $\mathbb{R}^N$ such that for each $v \in V$ the ball $B(v,1)$ intersects $V$ on at least $\delta |V|$ points, then for every $\varepsilon &gt;0$, the points of $V$ can be covered with $f(\delta,\varepsilon)$ balls $B(v,1+\varepsilon)$ with $v \in V$. DNL also applies to other metric spaces and to abstract set systems, where elements are compared pairwise with respect to (near) disjointness. In its strongest form, DNL provides an $\varepsilon$-clustering with size exponential in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, which amounts to a Regularity Lemma with 0/1 densities of some trigraph.
  Trigraphs are graphs with additional red edges. They are natural instances of partial concept classes, introduced by Alon, Hanneke, Holzman and Moran [FOCS 2021]. This paper is mainly a combinatorial study of the generalization of Vapnik-Cervonenkis dimension to partial concept classes. The main point is to show how trigraphs can sometimes explain the success of random sampling even though the VC-dimension of the underlying graph is unbounded. All the results presented here are effective in the sense of computation: they primarily rely on uniform sampling with the same success rate as in classical VC-dimension theory.
  Among some applications of DNL, we show that $\left(\frac{3t-8}{3t-5}+\varepsilon\right)\cdot n$-regular $K_t$-free graphs have bounded chromatic number. Similarly, triangle-free graphs with minimum degree $n/3-n^{1-\varepsilon}$ have bounded chromatic number (this does not hold with $n/3-n^{1-o(1)}$). For tournaments, DNL implies that the domination number is bounded in terms of the fractional chromatic number. Also, $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-majority digraphs have bounded domination, independently of the number of voters.</description>

      <title>Free Sets in Planar Graphs: History and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a planar graph $G$ is a free set if, for every set $P$ of $|S|$ points in the plane, there exists a straight-line crossing-free drawing of $G$ in which vertices of $S$ are mapped to distinct points in $P$. In this survey, we review - several equivalent definitions of free sets, - results on the existence of large free sets in planar graphs and subclasses of planar graphs, - and applications of free sets in graph drawing. The survey concludes with a list of open problems in this still very active research area.</description>

      <title>NPA Hierarchy for Quantum Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Man\v{c}inska and Roberson [FOCS'20] showed that two graphs are quantum isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class of planar graphs. Atserias et al. [JCTB'19] proved that quantum isomorphism is undecidable in general. The NPA hierarchy gives a sequence of semidefinite programming relaxations of quantum isomorphism. Recently, Roberson and Seppelt [ICALP'23] obtained a homomorphism indistinguishability characterization of the feasibility of each level of the Lasserre hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations of graph isomorphism. We prove a quantum analogue of this result by showing that each level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism of graphs is equivalent to homomorphism indistinguishability over an appropriate class of planar graphs. By combining the convergence of the NPA hierarchy with the fact that the union of these graph classes is the set of all planar graphs, we are able to give a new proof of the result of Man\v{c}inska and Roberson [FOCS'20] that avoids the use of the theory of quantum groups. This homomorphism indistinguishability characterization also allows us to give a randomized polynomial-time algorithm deciding exact feasibility of each fixed level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Double Spending Analysis of Nakamoto Consensus for Time-Varying Mining Rates with Ruin Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical guarantees for double spending probabilities for the Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule have been extensively studied for zero/bounded network delays and fixed mining rates. In this paper, we introduce a ruin-theoretical model of double spending for Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule when the honest mining rate is allowed to be an arbitrary function of time including the block delivery periods, i.e., time periods during which mined blocks are being delivered to all other participants of the network. Time-varying mining rates are considered to capture the intrinsic characteristics of the peer to peer network delays as well as dynamic participation of miners such as the gap game and switching between different cryptocurrencies. Ruin theory is leveraged to obtain the double spend probabilities and numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical method.</description>

      <title>Deciding Local Unitary Equivalence of Graph States in Quasi-Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm with quasi-polynomial runtime $n^{\log_2(n)+O(1)}$ for deciding local unitary (LU) equivalence of graph states. The algorithm builds on a recent graphical characterisation of LU-equivalence via generalised local complementation. By first transforming the corresponding graphs into a standard form using usual local complementations, LU-equivalence reduces to the existence of a single generalised local complementation that maps one graph to the other. We crucially demonstrate that this reduces to solving a system of quasi-polynomially many linear equations, avoiding an exponential blow-up. As a byproduct, we generalise Bouchet's algorithm for deciding local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states by allowing the addition of arbitrary linear constraints. We also improve existing bounds on the size of graph states that are LU- but not LC-equivalent. While the smallest known examples involve 27 qubits, and it is established that no such examples exist for up to 8 qubits, we refine this bound by proving that LU- and LC-equivalence coincide for graph states involving up to 19 qubits.</description>
