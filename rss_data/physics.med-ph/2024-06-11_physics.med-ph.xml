      <title>Cross-sectional shape analysis for risk assessment and prognosis of patients with true lumen narrowing after type-A aortic dissection surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: For acute type-A aortic dissection (ATAAD) surgery, early post-surgery assessment is crucially important for effective treatment plans, underscoring the need for a framework to identify the risk level of aortic dissection cases. We examined true-lumen narrowing during follow-up examinations, collected morphological data 14 days (early stages) after surgery, and assessed patient risk levels over 2.8 years.
  Purpose: To establish an implementable framework supported by mathematical techniques to predict the risk of aortic dissection patients experiencing true-lumen narrowing after ATAAD surgery.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed CT data from 21 ATAAD patients. Forty uniformly distributed cross-sectional shapes (CSSs) are derived from each lumen to account for gradual changes in shape. We introduced the form factor (FF) to assess CSS morphology. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used for the risk classification of aortic dissection patients. Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation (LOPO-CV) is used for risk prediction.
  Results: For this investigation, we examined data of 21 ATAAD patients categorized into high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk cases based on clinical observations of the range of true-lumen narrowing. Our risk classification machine-learning (ML) model preserving the model's generalizability. The model's predictions reliably identified low-risk patients, thereby potentially reducing hospital visits. It also demonstrated proficiency in accurately predicting the risk for all high-risk patients.
  Conclusion: The suggested method anticipates the risk linked to aortic enlargement in patients with a narrowing true lumen in the early stage following ATAAD surgery, thereby aiding follow-up doctors in enhancing patient care.</description>

      <title>Collimator-less SPECT System Design for Dynamic Whole-body Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a collimator less SPECT system for dynamic whole-body imaging, which enables multi-energy gamma photon detection with higher efficiency compared to mechanically collimated SPECT. The system consists of two detectors, one movable and one fixed, providing a field of view (FOV) adequate for whole-body imaging, while achieving high sensitivity and clinically usable imaging resolution within a reasonable scanning time. This work focuses on the system design using the Monte Carlo simulation toolkit Gate 9.2. The imaging performance is evaluated at two energy peaks (440 keV, 218 keV), representing the major detectable gamma energies generated from Actinium-225, one of the radionuclides under investigation for targeted alpha therapy (TAT). We intend to use the collimator-less system for treatment response monitoring in TAT. Results demonstrate a system resolution of 1.0 cm with a sensitivity of 0.50% for whole-body imaging as measured using a Derenzo-type phantom in the simulation. This demonstrates that the proposed system may serve as an alternative imaging tool for rapid scanning in clinical settings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This data curation work introduces the first large-scale dataset of radial k-space and DICOM data for breast DCE-MRI acquired in diagnostic breast MRI exams. Our dataset includes case-level labels indicating patient age, menopause status, lesion status (negative, benign, and malignant), and lesion type for each case. The public availability of this dataset and accompanying reconstruction code will support research and development of fast and quantitative breast image reconstruction and machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Validation of the estimated Effect of Ankle Foot Orthoses on Spinal Cord Injury Gait Using Subject-Adjusted Musculoskeletal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of assistive devices on pathological gait through musculoskeletal models offers the potential and advantages of estimating the effect of the device in several biomechanical variables and the device characteristics ahead of manufacturing. In this study, we introduce a novel musculoskeletal modelling approach to simulate the biomechanical impact of ankle foot orthoses (AFO) on gait in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Leveraging data from the Swiss Paraplegic Center, we constructed anatomically and muscularly scaled models for SCI-AFO users, aiming to predict changes in gait kinematics and kinetics. The importance of this work lies in its potential to enhance rehabilitation strategies and improve quality of life by enabling the pre-manufacturing assessment of assistive devices. Despite the application of musculoskeletal models in simulating walking aids effects in other conditions, no predictive model currently exists for SCI gait. Evaluation through RMSE showed similar results compared with other pathologies, simulation errors ranged between 0.23 to 2.3 degrees in kinematics. Moreover, the model was able to capture ankle joint muscular asymmetries and predict symmetry improvements with AFO use. However, the simulation did not reveal all the AFO effects, indicating a need for more personalized model parameters and optimized muscle activation to fully replicate orthosis effects on SCI gait.</description>

      <title>Beat Pilot Tone (BPT): Simultaneous MR Imaging and RF Motion Sensing at Arbitrary Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To introduce a simple system exploitation with the potential to turn MRI scanners into general-purpose RF motion monitoring systems.
  Methods: Inspired by Pilot Tone (PT), this work proposes Beat Pilot Tone (BPT), in which two or more RF tones at arbitrary frequencies are transmitted continuously during the scan. These tones create motion-modulated standing wave patterns that are sensed by the receiver coil array, incidentally mixed by intermodulation in the receiver chain, and digitized simultaneously with the MRI data. BPT can operate at almost any frequency as long as the intermodulation products lie within the bandwidth of the receivers. BPT's mechanism is explained in electromagnetic simulations and validated experimentally.
  Results: Phantom and volunteer experiments over a range of transmit frequencies suggest that BPT may offer frequency-dependent sensitivity to motion. Using a semi-flexible body receiver array, BPT appears to sense cardiac-induced body vibrations at microwave frequencies (1.2 GHz and greater). At lower frequencies, it exhibits a similar cardiac signal shape to PT, likely due to blood volume changes.
  Other volunteer experiments with respiratory, bulk, and head motion show that BPT can achieve greater sensitivity to motion than PT and greater separability between motion types. Basic multiple-input multiple-output (4x22 MIMO) operation with simultaneous PT and BPT in head motion is demonstrated using two transmit antennas and a 22-channel head-neck coil.
  Conclusion: BPT may offer a rich source of motion information that is frequency-dependent, simultaneous, and complementary to PT and the MRI exam.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces for infrared multi-modal microscopy: phase contrast and bright field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different imaging modalities are used to extract the diverse information carried in an optical field. Two prominent modalities include bright field and phase contrast microscopy that can visualize the amplitude and phase features of a sample, respectively. However, capturing both of these images on the same camera typically requires interchanging optical components. Metasurfaces are ultra-thin nanostructures that can merge both of these operations into a single miniaturized device. Here, a silicon-based metasurface that supports a Mie resonance is demonstrated to perform near-infrared phase contrast and bright field multi-modal microscopy that can be tuned by changing the polarization of the illumination. We performed experiments using optical fields with phase variations synthesized by a spatial light modulator and introduced by propagation through semi-transparent samples, including C. elegans, unstained human prostate cancer cells and breast tissue. The results demonstrate the potential of metasurfaces for label-free point-of-care testing.</description>
