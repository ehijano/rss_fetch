      <title>Quadratic functional estimation from observations with multiplicative measurement error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonparametric estimation of the value of a quadratic functional evaluated at the density of a strictly positive random variable $X$ based on an iid. sample from an observation $Y$ of $X$ corrupted by an independent multiplicative error $U$. Quadratic functionals of the density covered are the $\mathbb{L}^2$-norm of the density and its derivatives or the survival function. We construct a fully data-driven estimator when the error density is known. The plug-in estimator is based on a density estimation combining the estimation of the Mellin transform of the $Y$ density and a spectral cut-off regularized inversion of the Mellin transform of the error density. The main issue is the data-driven choice of the cut-off parameter using a Goldenshluger-Lepski-method. We discuss conditions under which the fully data-driven estimator attains oracle-rates up to logarithmic deteriorations. We compute convergence rates under classical smoothness assumptions and illustrate them by a simulation study.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Approach for Queue Length Estimation Using License Plate Recognition Data: Considering Overtaking in Multi-lane Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-section license plate recognition (LPR) data provides input-output information and sampled travel times of the investigated link, serving as an ideal data source for lane-based queue length estimation in recent studies. However, most of these studies assumed the strict FIFO rule or a specific arrival process, thus ignoring the potential impact of overtaking and the variation of traffic flows, especially in multi-lane scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a probabilistic approach to derive the stochastic queue length by constructing a conditional probability model of no-delay arrival time (NAT), i.e., the arrival time of vehicles without experiencing any delay, based on multi-section LPR data. First, the NAT conditions for all vehicles are established based on upstream and downstream vehicle departure times and sequences. To reduce the computational dimensionality and complexity, a DP-based algorithm is developed for vehicle group partitioning based on potential interactions between vehicles. Then, the conditional probability of NATs of each vehicle group is derived and an MCMC sampling method is employed for calculation. Subsequently, the stochastic queue profile and maximum queue length for each cycle can be derived based on the NATs of vehicles. Eventually, to leverage the LPR data sufficiently, we extend our approach to multi-lane scenarios, where the problem can be converted to a weighted general exact coverage problem and solved by a backtracking algorithm with heuristics. Empirical and simulation experiments have shown that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and robustness across various traffic conditions, including different V/C ratios, matching rates, and FIFO violation rates. In addition, the performance of the proposed approach can be further improved by utilizing multi-lane LPR data.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional optimization for multi-spiked tensor PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of two local optimization algorithms, online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and gradient flow, within the framework of the multi-spiked tensor model in the high-dimensional regime. This multi-index model arises from the tensor principal component analysis (PCA) problem, which aims to infer $r$ unknown, orthogonal signal vectors within the $N$-dimensional unit sphere through maximum likelihood estimation from noisy observations of an order-$p$ tensor. We determine the number of samples and the conditions on the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) required to efficiently recover the unknown spikes from natural initializations. Specifically, we distinguish between three types of recovery: exact recovery of each spike, recovery of a permutation of all spikes, and recovery of the correct subspace spanned by the signal vectors. We show that with online SGD, it is possible to recover all spikes provided a number of sample scaling as $N^{p-2}$, aligning with the computational threshold identified in the rank-one tensor PCA problem [Ben Arous, Gheissari, Jagannath 2020, 2021]. For gradient flow, we show that the algorithmic threshold to efficiently recover the first spike is also of order $N^{p-2}$. However, recovering the subsequent directions requires the number of samples to scale as $N^{p-1}$. Our results are obtained through a detailed analysis of a low-dimensional system that describes the evolution of the correlations between the estimators and the spikes. In particular, the hidden vectors are recovered one by one according to a sequential elimination phenomenon: as one correlation exceeds a critical threshold, all correlations sharing a row or column index decrease and become negligible, allowing the subsequent correlation to grow and become macroscopic. The sequence in which correlations become macroscopic depends on their initial values and on the associated SNRs.</description>

      <title>Cross Modality of the Extended Binomial Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a family of probability functions (or a probability kernel), cross modality occurs when every likelihood maximum matches a mode of the distribution. This implies existence of simultaneous maxima on the modal ridge of the family. The paper explores the property for extended Bernoulli sums, which are random variables representable as a sum of independent Poisson and any number (finite or infinite) of Bernoulli random variables with variable success probabilities. We show that the cross modality holds for many subfamilies of the class, including power series distributions derived from entire functions with totally positive series expansion. A central role in the study is played by the extended Darroch's rule \cite{Darroch, Pitman}, which originally localised the mode of Poisson-binomial distribution in terms of the mean. We give different proofs and geometric interpretation to the extended rule and point at other modal properties of extended Bernoulli sums, in particular discuss stability of the mode in the context of a transport problem.</description>

      <title>Post-selection inference for high-dimensional mediation analysis with survival outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is of substantial scientific interest to detect mediators that lie in the causal pathway from an exposure to a survival outcome. However, with high-dimensional mediators, as often encountered in modern genomic data settings, there is a lack of powerful methods that can provide valid post-selection inference for the identified marginal mediation effect. To resolve this challenge, we develop a post-selection inference procedure for the maximally selected natural indirect effect using a semiparametric efficient influence function approach. To this end, we establish the asymptotic normality of a stabilized one-step estimator that takes the selection of the mediator into account. Simulation studies show that our proposed method has good empirical performance. We further apply our proposed approach to a lung cancer dataset and find multiple DNA methylation CpG sites that might mediate the effect of cigarette smoking on lung cancer survival.</description>

      <title>An unbounded intensity model for point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a model for point processes on the real line, where the intensity can be locally unbounded without inducing an explosion. In contrast to an orderly point process, for which the probability of observing more than one event over a short time interval is negligible, the bursting intensity causes an extreme clustering of events around the singularity. We propose a nonparametric approach to detect such bursts in the intensity. It relies on a heavy traffic condition, which admits inference for point processes over a finite time interval. With Monte Carlo evidence, we show that our testing procedure exhibits size control under the null, whereas it has high rejection rates under the alternative. We implement our approach on high-frequency data for the EUR/USD spot exchange rate, where the test statistic captures abnormal surges in trading activity. We detect a nontrivial amount of intensity bursts in these data and describe their basic properties. Trading activity during an intensity burst is positively related to volatility, illiquidity, and the probability of observing a drift burst. The latter effect is reinforced if the order flow is imbalanced or the price elasticity of the limit order book is large.</description>

      <title>Blessing of Dimensionality for Approximating Sobolev Classes on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manifold hypothesis says that natural high-dimensional data is actually supported on or around a low-dimensional manifold. Recent success of statistical and learning-based methods empirically supports this hypothesis, due to outperforming classical statistical intuition in very high dimensions. A natural step for analysis is thus to assume the manifold hypothesis and derive bounds that are independent of any embedding space. Theoretical implications in this direction have recently been explored in terms of generalization of ReLU networks and convergence of Langevin methods. We complement existing results by providing theoretical statistical complexity results, which directly relates to generalization properties. In particular, we demonstrate that the statistical complexity required to approximate a class of bounded Sobolev functions on a compact manifold is bounded from below, and moreover that this bound is dependent only on the intrinsic properties of the manifold. These provide complementary bounds for existing approximation results for ReLU networks on manifolds, which give upper bounds on generalization capacity.</description>

      <title>Nuisance Function Tuning and Sample Splitting for Optimal Doubly Robust Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimators of doubly robust functionals typically rely on estimating two complex nuisance functions, such as the propensity score and conditional outcome mean for the average treatment effect functional. We consider the problem of how to estimate nuisance functions to obtain optimal rates of convergence for a doubly robust nonparametric functional that has witnessed applications across the causal inference and conditional independence testing literature. For several plug-in estimators and a first-order bias-corrected estimator, we illustrate the interplay between different tuning parameter choices for the nuisance function estimators and sample splitting strategies on the optimal rate of estimating the functional of interest. For each of these estimators and each sample splitting strategy, we show the necessity to either undersmooth or oversmooth the nuisance function estimators under low regularity conditions to obtain optimal rates of convergence for the functional of interest. Unlike the existing literature, we show that plug-in and first-order biased-corrected estimators can achieve minimax rates of convergence across all H\"older smoothness classes of the nuisance functions by careful combinations of sample splitting and nuisance function tuning strategies.</description>

      <title>Computational Lower Bounds for Graphon Estimation via Low-degree Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15728v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphon estimation has been one of the most fundamental problems in network analysis and has received considerable attention in the past decade. From the statistical perspective, the minimax error rate of graphon estimation has been established by Gao et al (2015) for both stochastic block model and nonparametric graphon estimation. The statistical optimal estimators are based on constrained least squares and have computational complexity exponential in the dimension. From the computational perspective, the best-known polynomial-time estimator is based universal singular value thresholding, but it can only achieve a much slower estimation error rate than the minimax one. The computational optimality of the USVT or the existence of a computational barrier in graphon estimation has been a long-standing open problem. In this work, we provide rigorous evidence for the computational barrier in graphon estimation via low-degree polynomials. Specifically, in SBM graphon estimation, we show that for low-degree polynomial estimators, their estimation error rates cannot be significantly better than that of the USVT under a wide range of parameter regimes and in nonparametric graphon estimation, we show low-degree polynomial estimators achieve estimation error rates strictly slower than the minimax rate. Our results are proved based on the recent development of low-degree polynomials by Schramm and Wein (2022), while we overcome a few key challenges in applying it to the general graphon estimation problem. By leveraging our main results, we also provide a computational lower bound on the clustering error for community detection in SBM with a growing number of communities and this yields a new piece of evidence for the conjectured Kesten-Stigum threshold for efficient community recovery. Finally, we extend our computational lower bounds to sparse graphon estimation and biclustering.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous extremes in the presence of random covariates and censoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of analyzing extreme events with censoring effects is considered under a framework allowing for random covariate information. A wide class of estimators that can be cast as product-limit integrals is considered, for when the conditional distributions belong to the Frechet max-domain of attraction. The main mathematical contribution is establishing uniform conditions on the families of the regularly varying tails for which the asymptotic behaviour of the resulting estimators is tractable. In particular, a decomposition of the integral estimators in terms of exchangeable sums is provided, which leads to a law of large numbers and several central limit theorems. Subsequently, the finite-sample behaviour of the estimators is explored through a simulation study, and through the analysis of two real-life datasets. In particular, the inclusion of covariates makes the model significantly versatile and, as a consequence, practically relevant.</description>

      <title>DPO: Differential reinforcement learning with application to optimal configuration search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with continuous state and action spaces remains one of the most challenging problems within the field. Most current learning methods focus on integral identities such as value functions to derive an optimal strategy for the learning agent. In this paper, we instead study the dual form of the original RL formulation to propose the first differential RL framework that can handle settings with limited training samples and short-length episodes. Our approach introduces Differential Policy Optimization (DPO), a pointwise and stage-wise iteration method that optimizes policies encoded by local-movement operators. We prove a pointwise convergence estimate for DPO and provide a regret bound comparable with the best current theoretical derivation. Such pointwise estimate ensures that the learned policy matches the optimal path uniformly across different steps. We then apply DPO to a class of practical RL problems with continuous state and action spaces, and which search for optimal configurations with Lagrangian rewards. DPO is easy to implement, scalable, and shows competitive results on benchmarking experiments against several popular RL methods.</description>
