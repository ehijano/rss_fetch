      <title>EBIF: Exact Bilinearization Iterative Form for Control-Affine Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel framework, Exact Bilinearization Iterative Form (EBIF), for transforming a nonlinear control-affine system into an exact finite-dimensional bilinear representation. In contrast to most existing approaches which generally lead to an infinite-dimensional representation, the proposed EBIF approach yields an iterative procedure for constructing a finite set of smooth coordinate functions that define an embedding, enabling an exact bilinear representation of the original nonlinear dynamics. Leveraging tools from algebra and differential geometry, we establish both necessary and sufficient conditions for a nonlinear system to be exactly bilinearizable. We further illustrate how the EBIF-induced bilinear systems facilitate reachability analysis and control design. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the EBIF framework and highlight its potential in simplifying control synthesis for nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Fej\'er and Fej\'er* Monotonicity: New Results and Limiting Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many algorithms in convex optimization and variational analysis can be analyzed using Fej\'er monotone sequences. In 2024, Behling, Bello-Cruz, Iusem, Alves Ribeiro, and Santos introduced a new, more general, notion: Fej\'er* monotonicity. They obtained basic results and discussed applications in optimization.
  In this work, we complement Behling et al.'s work by presenting a thorough study of Fej\'er* monotonicity. We reveal striking similarities and differences between these notions, including descriptions of the maximal Fej\'er* set. Moreover, we also touch upon Opial sequences and quasi-Fej\'er monotonicity. Throughout this paper, we provide numerous limiting examples and counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Distributed Rotary Coverage Control of Multi-Agent Systems in Uncertain Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is always a challenging task for multi-agent systems to achieve efficient and robust coverage in uncertain environments. The absence of global positioning information on the uncertain environment introduces significant complexity to the spatially distributed design of coverage control algorithms. To address this issue, this paper proposes a coverage control formulation based on beacon-free rotary pointer partition mechanism. A partition dynamics is designed to enable the asymptotical consensus of multi-agent reference points, as well as the workload-balanced subdivision of coverage region. On this basis, a distributed coverage control algorithm is developed to drive each agent toward the optimal deployment of their respective subregions, thereby minimizing the coverage cost. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed coverage control method can significantly improve overall coverage efficiency with workload balance among agents, and exhibit strong adaptability and robustness in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Unknown input observer design for a class of coupled wave PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of designing unknown input observers for a class of coupled semilinear wave partial differential equations (PDE) systems. A state observer is designed to estimate the uncertain coupled wave PDE systems. Then, the analysis of the asymptotic stability and $H_{\infty}$ performance for the observer design of coupled wave PDE systems is investigated. Some sufficient conditions of asymptotic stability for the observer error system with disturbance attenuation level are derived via matrix inequalities based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a numerical simulation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained result.</description>

      <title>Graph Isomorphism: Mixed-Integer Convex Optimization from First-Order Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph isomorphism (GI) problem, which asks whether two graphs are structurally identical, occupies a unique position in computational complexity -- it is neither known to be solvable in polynomial time, nor proven to be NP-complete. We propose a convex mixed-integer formulation of the problem and leverage first-order convex optimization to tackle it, following a stream of recent work on optimization-driven graph isomorphism detection. We strengthen our formulation with variable fixing techniques that prove highly effective while preserving the polyhedral structure. We perform extensive computations evaluating the performance of different families of methods including a mixed-integer convex formulation, mixed-integer linear optimization, local search and spectral heuristics over a collection of challenging GI instances. We find that a high level of symmetry is beneficial for optimization-based methods. On the other hand, presolving techniques that detect local substructures to fix variables are crucial for asymmetric instances. The proposed method outperforms the second best approach, the integer feasibility approach, on 6 of the 12 graphs families and is on par with it on symmetric families.</description>

      <title>Absorbing Markov Decision Processes: Geometric Properties and Sufficiency of Finite Mixtures of Deterministic Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate several geometric properties of the set of occupancy measures. In particular, we analyse the structure of the faces generated by a given occupancy measure, together with their relative algebraic interior. We also determine the affine hulls of these faces and describe the associated parallel linear subspaces. It is shown that these structures can be fully characterised in terms of the parameters that define the underlying Markov decision process (MDP). Moreover, we establish that the class of finite mixtures of deterministic stationary policies constitutes a sufficient class of policies for uniformly absorbing MDPs with a measurable state space and multiple criteria. We also provide a characterisation of the minimal order required for a finite mixture of deterministic stationary policies to represent the performance vector of an arbitrary policy.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Maximum Principle for Optimal Control of Anticipated Backward Stochastic Systems with Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal control problems for delayed systems governed by Infinitely Anticipated Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (IABSDEs). Unlike existing frameworks limited to bounded delays, we introduce a generalized formulation utilizing $\sigma$-finite measures that accommodates both long-term memory effects and forward-looking anticipation.
  Employing a new type of infinitely delayed stochastic differential equations as adjoint equations, we derive the necessary conditions of the maximum principle for optimal control. Under appropriate assumptions, the sufficiency of the maximum principle is also established. As illustrative examples, a climate policy model, a consumption optimization problem and a linear quadratic control problem are discussed, and all optimal controls are derived explicitly.</description>

      <title>Clique Probing for Mixed-Integer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing is an important presolving technique in mixed-integer programming solvers. It selects binary variables, tentatively fixes them to 0 and 1, and performs propagation to deduce additional variable fixings, bound tightenings, substitutions, and implications. In this work, we propose clique probing instead of probing on individual variables, we select cliques, a set of binary variables of which at most one can be set to one, and systematically probe on all variables of a clique. Experiments with our implementation in the open-source presolve library PaPILO demonstrate that exploiting clique information in this form significantly increases the number of reductions. When integrated into the MIP solver SCIP, we observe a 3% performance improvement on MIPLIB instances containing cliques.</description>

      <title>A Separation Principle for Conditional Mean-Field Type Linear Quadratic Optimal Control Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a conditional mean-field type linear quadratic (LQ) optimal control problem with partial observation and regime switching, where the conditional expectations of the state and control given the history of Markov chain enter into the dynamics and cost. The exact regime of Markov chain is accessible, whereas the system state can only be partially observed. A separation principle is established, showing that the estimate and control procedures can be separated and implemented independently. It extends the classical separation principle to conditional mean-field system. Utilizing two sets of Riccati equations and a set of first-order ordinary differential equations, we derive the feedback representation of the optimal control. To illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results, two applications with numerical simulations are provided, including a one-dimensional LQ example and a coupled electrical machines control problem.</description>

      <title>A Conjugate Gradient Method for Nonlinear Programming Problems using Caputo Fractional Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article proposes a Caputo fractional conjugate gradient (CFCG) method for unconstrained optimization problems which is applicable to smooth as well as non-smooth problmes. The proposed method uses a non-adaptive version of the Caputo fractional derivative that provides integer-order derivatives information. A descent direction is obtained using the Caputo fractional gradients of two consecutive iterative points with a parameter ($\beta$). An inexact line search technique based on Armijo-Wolfe line conditions is used to find a suitable step length. Finally, a descent sequence is generated. The convergence results are derived under mild assumptions that ensuring of convergence is at least linear. Moreover, the convergence of the proposed method for quadratic functions is established through a Tikhonov-regularized formulation that can be interpreted as an extension of the least-squares approach. Finally, some numerical experiments, including neural network applications, are performed to justify that the proposed method achieves faster and more stable performance.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of output reference tracking for unknown nonlinear multi-input, multi-output systems with relative degree two and bounded-input bounded-state (BIBS) stable internal dynamics. We propose a novel model-free adaptive controller that ensures the evolution of the tracking error within prescribed performance funnel boundaries. By applying an output filter, the control objective is achieved without utilizing derivative information of system's output. The controller is illustrated by a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Time Optimal Control Problem for the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the time-optimal control problem for the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation, a macroscopic model that characterizes magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials across a wide temperature range, including near and above the Curie temperature. We analyze the LLB system on bounded domains in one, two, and three dimensions, establishing the existence of optimal controls that drive the magnetization to a desired target state within a minimal time frame. Utilizing a Lagrange multiplier approach and an adjoint-based framework, we derive first-order necessary optimality conditions. Furthermore, we establish second-order sufficient conditions for local optimality, addressing the mathematical challenges posed by the system's inherent nonlinearities and the nonlinear appearance of the control in the effective magnetic field. These results provide a rigorous theoretical basis for the rapid manipulation of magnetic states, offering insights into the fundamental limits of control for nonlinear diffusion-relaxation processes in magnetism. Such findings are essential for advancing high-speed magnetic memory technologies and optimizing thermal magnetic switching in next-generation storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control Problems with Nonlocal Conservation Laws: Existence of Optimizers and Singular Limits in Approximations of Local Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution considers optimal control problems subject to nonlocal conservation laws -- those in which the velocity depends nonlocally (i.e., via a convolution) on the solution -- and the so-called singular limit. First, the existence of minimizers is demonstrated for a broad class of optimal control problems, involving optimization over the initial datum, velocity, and nonlocal kernel for classical tracking-type $L^2$ cost functionals. Then, it is proven that the obtained minimizers converge to minimizers of the corresponding local optimal control problem when the kernel function of the convolution is of exponential type and approaches a Dirac distribution. Finally, some numerical results are presented.</description>

      <title>Ethic Duality: A Homological Framework for Primal-Dual Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a homological duality framework based on a contravariant functor $D=\operatorname{Hom}_E(-,R)$ with dualizing object $R$. A morphism is called ethic when it satisfies the canonical double-dual compatibility $D^2(f)\eta=\eta f$. In the derived setting, the functor $\mathrm{RHom}_E(-,R)$ produces a graded family of Ext-groups that measure all failures of this compatibility. The first layer $\operatorname{Ext}^1$ identifies primal-dual gaps, while higher $\operatorname{Ext}^k$ provide a systematic hierarchy of derived obstructions to exactness.
  This formulation specializes uniformly across several classical domains. In linear and conic optimization, Farkas- and Slater-type exactness criteria correspond to the vanishing of $\operatorname{Ext}^1$, and integer duality gaps coincide with torsion Ext-classes. In graph theory, Kirchhoff- and Baker-Norine-type dualities arise as instances of ethic exactness. In dynamical systems, the higher derived layers encode nonvanishing persistence phenomena. Additional examples include social-choice configurations, categorical factorization in scattering formalisms, coding-theoretic duality, and Bellman-type recurrences, all appearing as concrete instances of Ext-controlled exactness.
  All resulting invariants are stable under derived Morita equivalence and depend only on the dualizing pair $(E,R)$. The framework therefore provides a substrate-independent criterion for primal-dual exactness and a uniform homological description of its obstructions.</description>

      <title>Generative modeling of conditional probability distributions on the level-sets of collective variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a probability distribution $\mu$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ represented by data, we study in this paper the generative modeling of its conditional probability distributions on the level-sets of a collective variable $\xi: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$, where $1 \le k&lt;d$. We propose a general and effcient learning approach that is able to learn generative models on different level-sets of $\xi$ simultaneously. To improve the learning quality on level-sets in low-probability regions, we also propose a strategy for data enrichment by utilizing data from enhanced sampling techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed learning approach through concrete numerical examples. The proposed approach is potentially useful for the generative modeling of molecular systems in biophysics, for instance.</description>

      <title>Splitting infinity: a de Finetti game with state-dependent profit rates and singular control for diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a game of resource extraction of a common good under one-dimensional diffusive dynamics with player actions corresponding to singular stochastic control up to absorption at $0$, implying a trade-off between profitable resource extraction and sustainability. Unsurprisingly, immediate extraction of all available resources is an equilibrium. A main result is that we characterize and prove the existence of non-trivial equilibria that do not result in immediate absorption, but instead are attained with both players extracting resources according to a state-dependent rate of threshold type, corresponding to the presence of control only when the state process is in an interval $(b,\infty)$. The underlying assumption is, roughly, that the drift coefficient of the uncontrolled state process grows sufficiently fast in relation to the discount rate, implying that the value for the corresponding one-player problem is infinite. We also study a generalization of the game that allows a state-dependent profit rate integrated against the control processes. In this game we again characterize and prove the existence of non-trivial equilibria of threshold type. In particular, a main novelty is that we find equilibria where the state process is controlled with its own local time such that we have reflection points with associated initial jumps, as well as other points in the state space where the control processes increase in a singular manner (skew points).</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving nonlinear matrix decompositions (NMD). Given an input matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and a factorization rank $r \ll \min(m, n)$, NMD seeks matrices $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $H \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$ such that $X \approx f(WH)$, where $f$ is an element-wise nonlinear function. We evaluate our method on several representative nonlinear models: the rectified linear unit activation $f(x) = \max(0, x)$, suitable for nonnegative sparse data approximation, the component-wise square $f(x) = x^2$, applicable to probabilistic circuit representation, and the MinMax transform $f(x) = \min(b, \max(a, x))$, relevant for recommender systems. The proposed framework flexibly supports diverse loss functions, including least squares, $\ell_1$ norm, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and can be readily extended to other nonlinearities and metrics. We illustrate the applicability, efficiency, and adaptability of the approach on real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimisation: Which Constraints Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimisation has proven to be a powerful tool for expensive global black-box optimisation problems. In this paper, we propose new Bayesian optimisation variants of the popular Knowledge Gradient acquisition functions for problems with \emph{decoupled} black-box constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. In particular, our methods aim to take into account that often only a handful of the constraints may be binding at the optimum, and hence we should evaluate only relevant constraints when trying to optimise a function. We empirically benchmark these methods against existing methods and demonstrate their superiority over the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>A Unified Representation of Neural Networks Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the limiting case of neural networks (NNs) architectures when the number of neurons in each hidden layer and the number of hidden layers tend to infinity thus forming a continuum, and we derive approximation errors as a function of the number of neurons and/or hidden layers. Firstly, we consider the case of neural networks with a single hidden layer and we derive an integral infinite width neural representation that generalizes existing continuous neural networks (CNNs) representations. Then we extend this to deep residual CNNs that have a finite number of integral hidden layers and residual connections. Secondly, we revisit the relation between neural ODEs and deep residual NNs and we formalize approximation errors via discretization techniques. Then, we merge these two approaches into a unified homogeneous representation of NNs as a Distributed Parameter neural Network (DiPaNet) and we show that most of the existing finite and infinite-dimensional NNs architectures are related via homogeneization/discretization with the DiPaNet representation. Our approach is purely deterministic and applies to general, uniformly continuous matrix weight functions. Differences and similarities with neural fields are discussed along with further possible generalizations and applications of the DiPaNet framework.</description>

      <title>A Systems-Theoretic View on the Convergence of Algorithms under Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms increasingly operate within complex physical, social, and engineering systems where they are exposed to disturbances, noise, and interconnections with other dynamical systems. This article extends known convergence guarantees of an algorithm operating in isolation (i.e., without disturbances) and systematically derives stability bounds and convergence rates in the presence of such disturbances. By leveraging converse Lyapunov theorems, we derive key inequalities that quantify the impact of disturbances. We further demonstrate how our result can be utilized to assess the effects of disturbances on algorithmic performance in a wide variety of applications, including communication constraints in distributed learning, sensitivity in machine learning generalization, and intentional noise injection for privacy. This underpins the role of our result as a unifying tool for algorithm analysis in the presence of noise, disturbances, and interconnections with other dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Relative arbitrage problem under eigenvalue lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new formulation of the relative arbitrage problem from stochastic portfolio theory that asks for a time horizon beyond which arbitrage relative to the market exists in all ``sufficiently volatile'' markets. In our formulation, ``sufficiently volatile'' is interpreted as a lower bound on an ordered eigenvalue of the instantaneous covariation matrix, a quantity that has been studied extensively in the empirical finance literature. Upon framing the problem in the language of stochastic optimal control, we characterize the time horizon in question through the unique upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE). In a special case, this PDE amounts to the arrival time formulation of the Ambrosio-Soner co-dimension mean curvature flow. Beyond the setting of stochastic portfolio theory, the stochastic optimal control problem is analyzed for arbitrary compact, possibly non-convex, domains, thanks to a boundedness assumption on the instantaneous covariation matrix.</description>

      <title>Inclusion constants for free spectrahedra with applications to quantum incompatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the matrix cube problem, inclusions of free spectrahedra have been used successfully to obtain relaxations of hard spectrahedral inclusion problems. The quality of such a relaxation is quantified by the inclusion constant associated with each free spectrahedron. While optimal values of inclusion constants were known in certain highly symmetric cases, no general method for computing them was available. In this work, we show that inclusion constants for Cartesian products of free simplices can be computed using methods from non-commutative polynomial optimization, together with a detailed analysis of the extreme points of the associated free spectrahedra. This analysis also yields new closed-form analytic expressions for these constants. As an application to quantum information theory, we prove new bounds on the amount of white noise that incompatible measurements can tolerate before they become compatible. In particular, we study the case of one dichotomic and one $k$-outcome measurement, as well as the case of four dichotomic qubit measurements.</description>

      <title>Certified bounds on optimization problems in quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semidefinite relaxations of polynomial optimization have become a central tool for addressing the non-convex optimization problems over non-commutative operators that are ubiquitous in quantum information theory and, more in general, quantum physics. Yet, as these global relaxation methods rely on floating-point methods, the bounds issued by the semidefinite solver can - and often do - exceed the global optimum, undermining their certifiability. To counter this issue, we introduce a rigorous framework for extracting exact rational bounds on non-commutative optimization problems from numerical data, and apply it to several paradigmatic problems in quantum information theory. An extension to sparsity and symmetry-adapted semidefinite relaxations is also provided and compared to the general dense scheme. Our results establish rational post-processing as a practical route to reliable certification, pushing semidefinite optimization toward a certifiable standard for quantum information science.</description>

      <title>On the ROF Model in Rectilinear Anisotropy: Piecewise Constant Approximation and Universal Minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.05186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the $L^2$ distance between the minimizer of the $\ell^1$-anisotropic Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) functional and its minimizer over the space of piecewise constant functions on a rectilinear grid is $\mathcal{O}(h^{\frac12 - \frac{q'}{2q}})$, where $h$ is the grid's mesh size and the datum belongs to $L^q$, $q \ge 2$. These convergence rates are valid in any dimension $d\ge 1$. However, in dimension $d = 1$ they can be further improved to $\mathcal{O}(h^{\frac12 - \frac{1}{2q}})$. To establish the error bounds, $L^q$ estimates of the ROF minimizer in terms of the datum are critical. Such estimates are particular cases of a universal minimality property of the ROF minimizer derived in the second part of the paper. There it is shown, in both the finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional settings, that the minimizer simultaneously minimizes a broad class of convex functionals over a neighbourhood of the datum arising in the convex dual of the ROF problem. This extends previous results of similar type about taut strings and the ROF problem.</description>

      <title>Unifying Distributionally Robust Optimization via Optimal Transport Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, two prominent paradigms have shaped distributionally robust optimization (DRO), modeling distributional ambiguity through $\phi$-divergences and Wasserstein distances, respectively. While the former focuses on ambiguity in likelihood ratios, the latter emphasizes ambiguity in outcomes and uses a transportation cost function to capture geometric structure in the outcome space. This paper proposes a unified framework that bridges these approaches by leveraging optimal transport (OT) with conditional moment constraints. Our formulation enables adversarial distributions to jointly perturb likelihood ratios and outcomes, yielding a generalized OT coupling between the nominal and perturbed distributions. We further establish key duality results and develop tractable reformulations that highlight the practical power of our unified approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal Ratcheting of Dividends with Irreversible Reinsurance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers an insurance company that faces two key constraints: a ratcheting dividend constraint and an irreversible reinsurance constraint. The company allocates part of its reserve to pay dividends to its shareholders while strategically purchasing reinsurance for its claims. The ratcheting dividend constraint ensures that dividend cuts are prohibited at any time. The irreversible reinsurance constraint ensures that reinsurance contracts cannot be prematurely terminated or sold to external entities. The dividend rate and reinsurance level are modeled as nondecreasing processes, thereby satisfying the constraints. Claims are modeled using a Brownian risk model. The main objective is to maximize the cumulative expected discounted dividend payouts until the time of ruin. The reinsurance and dividend levels are restricted to a finite set. The optimal value function is shown to be the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. A threshold strategy is constructed and shown to be optimal. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the optimality conditions and optimal strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Bayesian adaptive optimal stochastic control problem where a hidden static signal has a non-separable influence on the drift of a noisy observation. Being allowed to control the specific form of this dependence, we aim at optimising a cost functional depending on the posterior distribution of the hidden signal. Our setup is in sharp contrast to existing work: we include costs that depend on the full posterior distribution in a form that admits a large class of non-linear relationships. Expressing the dynamics of this posterior distribution in the observation filtration, we embed our problem into a genuinely infinite-dimensional stochastic control problem using measure-valued martingales. We address this problem by use of viscosity theory and approximation arguments. Specifically, we show equivalence to a corresponding weak formulation, characterise the optimal value of the problem in terms of the unique continuous viscosity solution of an associated HJB equation, and construct a piecewise constant and arbitrarily-close-to-optimal control to our main problem of study. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also provide a novel stability result for a class of measure-valued SDEs which we believe is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ebola virus disease is a severe hemorrhagic fever with rapid transmission through infected fluids and surfaces. We develop a fractional-order model using Caputo derivatives to capture memory effects in disease dynamics. An eight-compartment structure distinguishes symptomatic, asymptomatic, and post-mortem transmission pathways. We prove global well-posedness, derive the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$, and establish stability theorems. Sensitivity analysis shows $\mathcal{R}_0$ is most sensitive to transmission rate, incubation period, and deceased infectivity. Treatment-safe burial synergy achieves 86.5\% morbidity-mortality control, with safe burial being most effective. Our disease-informed neural network achieves near-perfect predictive accuracy ($R^2$: 0.991-0.999, 99.1-99.9\% accuracy), closely matching real epidemic behavior.</description>

      <title>A Dual-Mode Framework for Mean-Field Systems: Model-Based $H_2/H_\infty$ Control with Jump Diffusions and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01000v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two approaches for solving the robust control of mean-field systems are investigated in this paper. For the stochastic $H_2/H_\infty$ control problem of continuous-time mean-field stochastic differential equations with Poisson jumps over a finite horizon, the continuous and jump diffusion terms in the system depend not only on the state but also on the control input, external disturbance, and mean-field components. The feasibility of the stochastic $H_2/H_\infty$ control problem is demonstrated to be equivalent to the solvability of four sets of cross-coupled generalized differential Riccati equations. Based on this conclusion, a model-based numerical method is presented. Furthermore, a data-driven, model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning approach is proposed, which can be employed to solve the $H_\infty$ control problem of the linear mean-field (x, u, v)-dependent systems. Two distinct methodologies for designing robust controllers for interacting particle systems are demonstrated in this paper.</description>

      <title>Safeguarded Stochastic Polyak Step Sizes for Non-smooth Optimization: Robust Performance Without Small (Sub)Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic Polyak step size (SPS) has proven to be a promising choice for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), delivering competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods on smooth convex and non-convex optimization problems, including deep neural network training. However, extensions of this approach to non-smooth settings remain in their early stages, often relying on interpolation assumptions or requiring knowledge of the optimal solution. In this work, we propose a novel SPS variant, Safeguarded SPS (SPS$_{safe}$), for the stochastic subgradient method, and provide rigorous convergence guarantees for non-smooth convex optimization with no need for strong assumptions. We further incorporate momentum into the update rule, yielding equally tight theoretical results. On non-smooth convex benchmarks, our experiments are consistent with the theoretical predictions on how the safeguard affects the convergence neighborhood. On deep neural networks the proposed step size achieves competitive performance to existing adaptive baselines and exhibits stable behavior across a wide range of problem settings. Moreover, in these experiments, the gradient norms under our step size do not collapse to (near) zero, indicating robustness to vanishing gradients.</description>

      <title>SCAFFLSA: Taming Heterogeneity in Federated Linear Stochastic Approximation and TD Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the sample and communication complexity of the federated linear stochastic approximation (FedLSA) algorithm. We explicitly quantify the effects of local training with agent heterogeneity. We show that the communication complexity of FedLSA scales polynomially with the inverse of the desired accuracy $\epsilon$. To overcome this, we propose SCAFFLSA a new variant of FedLSA that uses control variates to correct for client drift, and establish its sample and communication complexities. We show that for statistically heterogeneous agents, its communication complexity scales logarithmically with the desired accuracy, similar to Scaffnew. An important finding is that, compared to the existing results for Scaffnew, the sample complexity scales with the inverse of the number of agents, a property referred to as linear speed-up. Achieving this linear speed-up requires completely new theoretical arguments. We apply the proposed method to federated temporal difference learning with linear function approximation and analyze the corresponding complexity improvements.</description>

      <title>Operational Dosage: Implications of Capacity Constraints for the Design and Interpretation of Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study RCTs that evaluate the impact of service interventions, for example, teachers or advisors conducting proactive outreach to at-risk students, medical providers giving medication adherence support by calling or texting, or social workers that conduct home visits. A defining feature of service interventions is that they are delivered by a capacity-constrained resource -- teachers, healthcare providers, or social workers -- whose limited availability creates causal inference complications. Because participants share a finite service capacity, adding more participants can reduce the timeliness or intensity of the service that others receive, introducing interference across participants. This generates hidden variation in the treatment itself, which we term operational dosage. We provide a mathematical model of service interventions using techniques from queueing theory and study the impact of capacity constraints on experimental outcomes. Our main insight is that treatment effects are both capacity- and sample-size-dependent, as well as decreasing in sample size once a critical threshold is exceeded. Interestingly, an implication is that statistical power of service intervention RCTs peaks at intermediate sample sizes -- directly contradicting conventional power calculations that assume monotonically increasing power with sample size. We instantiate our insights using simulations calibrated to a real-world trial evaluating a behavioral health intervention for tuberculosis patients in Kenya. Our simulation results suggest that a trial with high service capacity but limited sample size can obtain the same statistical power as a trial with lower service capacity but large sample size. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of capacity selection in experiment design and provide a mechanism for why experiments may fail to replicate or perform at scale.</description>

      <title>Refined Analysis of Federated Averaging and Federated Richardson-Romberg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel analysis of \FedAvg with constant step size, relying on the Markov property of the underlying process. We demonstrate that the global iterates of the algorithm converge to a stationary distribution and analyze its resulting bias and variance relative to the problem's solution. We provide a first-order bias expansion in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Interestingly, this bias decomposes into two distinct components: one that depends solely on stochastic gradient noise and another on client heterogeneity. Finally, we introduce a new algorithm based on the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation technique to mitigate this bias.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Control Barrier Functions: Nested Boolean and p-choose-r Compositions of Safety Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of composing multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) -- and matrix control barrier functions (MCBFs) -- through logical and combinatorial operations. Standard CBF formulations naturally enable conjunctive (AND) combinations, but disjunctive (OR) and more general logical structures introduce nonsmoothness and possibly a combinatorial blow-up in the number of logical combinations. We introduce the framework of combinatorial CBFs that addresses p-choose-r safety specifications and their nested composition. The proposed framework ensures safety for the exact safe set in a scalable way, using the original number of primitive constraints. We establish theoretical guarantees on safety under these compositions, and we demonstrate their use on a patrolling problem in a multi-agent system.</description>

      <title>A Neural Surrogate-Enhanced Multi-Method Framework for Robust Wing Design Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a modular and scalable design optimization framework for the wing design process that enables faster early-phase design while ensuring aerodynamic stability. The pipeline starts with the generation of initial wing geometries and then proceeds to optimize the wing using several algorithms. Aerodynamic performance is assessed using a Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) applied to a carefully selected dataset of wing configurations. These results are employed to develop surrogate neural network models, which can predict lift and drag rapidly and accurately. The stability evaluation is implemented by setting the control surfaces and components to fixed positions in order to have realistic flight dynamics. The approach unifies and compares several optimization techniques, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA), gradient-based MultiStart methods, Bayesian optimization, and Lipschitz optimization. Each method ensures constraint management via adaptive strategies and penalty functions, where the targets for lift and design feasibility are enforced. The progression of aerodynamic characteristics and geometries over the optimization iterations will be investigated in order to clarify each algorithm's convergence characteristics and performance efficiency. Our results show improvement in aerodynamic qualities and robust stability properties, offering a mechanism for wing design at speed and precision. In the interest of reproducibility and community development, the complete implementation is publicly available at Github.</description>

      <title>Generalized infinite dimensional Alpha-Procrustes based geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work extends the recently introduced Alpha-Procrustes family of Riemannian metrics for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices by incorporating generalized versions of the Bures-Wasserstein (GBW), Log-Euclidean, and Wasserstein distances. While the Alpha-Procrustes framework has unified many classical metrics in both finite- and infinite- dimensional settings, it previously lacked the structural components necessary to realize these generalized forms. We introduce a formalism based on unitized Hilbert-Schmidt operators and an extended Mahalanobis norm that allows the construction of robust, infinite-dimensional generalizations of GBW and Log-Hilbert-Schmidt distances. Our approach also incorporates a learnable regularization parameter that enhances geometric stability in high-dimensional comparisons. Preliminary experiments reproducing benchmarks from the literature demonstrate the improved performance of our generalized metrics, particularly in scenarios involving comparisons between datasets of varying dimension and scale. This work lays a theoretical and computational foundation for advancing robust geometric methods in machine learning, statistical inference, and functional data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In pseudo-boolean solving the currently most successful unit propagation strategy is a hybrid mode combining the watched literal scheme with the counting method. This short paper introduces new heuristics for this hybrid decision, which are able to drastically outperform the current method in the RoundingSAT solver.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Laser-Wakefield Acceleration via Spectral Pulse Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of spectral pulse shaping of the laser driver on the performance of channel-guided, laser-plasma accelerators. The study was carried out with the assistance of Bayesian optimization using particle-in-cell simulations. We used a realistic plasma profile based on a novel optical-field-ionized channel technique with ionization injection and low on-axis plasma densities to maximize the energy gain of the electron bunch trailing the laser. Spectral shaping allows us to modify the temporal profile of the laser driver while keeping the laser energy constant, affecting the acceleration and injection processes. Given the complexity and breadth of the parameter space in question, we used numerical optimization to identify high performers. In particular, we found laser profiles with additional spectral content that, when used with optimal plasma channel parameters, result in charge content an order of magnitude higher than the baseline Gaussian case while also increasing the mean energy of the electron bunch.</description>
