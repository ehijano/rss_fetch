      <title>A new method to find exact solution of nonlinear ordinary differential equations: Application to derive thermophoretic waves in graphene sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel approach for determining exact solutions to nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The recommended iterative method provides the solution via a rapidly converging series that readily approaches a closed form solution. The proposed approach is very efficient and essentially perfect for determining exact solutions of nonlinear equations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we examined the extended (2 + 1) dimensional equation for thermophoretic motion, which is based on wrinkle wave movements in graphene sheets supported by a substrate. The implementation of the suggested approach effectively yielded closed-form solutions in terms of exponential functions, hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, algebraic functions, and Jacobi elliptic functions, respectively. Three generated solutions illustrated to examine the characteristics of thermophoretic waves in graphene sheets. The proposed method's benefits and drawbacks are also examined. Consequently, unlike previous solutions obtained via the variation of parameters method for nonlinear issues, the solutions presented here are exact and unique.</description>

      <title>The Divergence-Free Radiant Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the rigorous mathematical construction and foundational properties of the Divergence-Free Radiant Transform (DFRT), a spectral transform specifically designed for divergence-free vector fields, with applications in incompressible fluid dynamics and other solenoidal systems. The DFRT basis functions are constructed using a curl-based formulation that ensures the divergence-free condition is satisfied identically. We define the forward and inverse transforms, prove the Parseval identity, and establish the completeness of the basis. The DFRT coefficient space is equipped with an algebraic structure via a spectral coboundary operator, defined using Wigner 3j and 6j symbols to encode angular momentum coupling. This cohomological structure, and its connection to the Geometric Refinement Transform (GRT), is developed in a companion paper using a bigraded cohomology framework. We derive a modal evolution equation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in DFRT coordinates and introduce a persistent regularity class based on cohomological constraints. Finally, we present a variational argument showing that an entropy-maximizing energy distribution leads to exponential decay, offering a new perspective on regularity and singularity prevention in incompressible flows.</description>

      <title>A Mixed Problem for the Wave Equation in a Curvilinear Half-Strip with Discontinuous Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a one-dimensional wave equation, we consider a mixed problem in a curvilinear half-strip. The initial conditions have a first-kind discontinuity at one point. The mixed problem models the problem of a longitudinal impact on a finite elastic rod with a movable boundary. We construct the solution using the method of characteristics in an explicit analytical form. For the problem in question, we prove the uniqueness of the solution and establish the conditions under which its classical solution exists.</description>

      <title>A quantitative stability result for regularity of optimal transport on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a Korevaar-style maximum principle approach to show the following: Fixing a $C^{2}$ bound on the log densities of a set of smooth measures, there is a quantifiably-sized Wasserstein neighborhood over which all pairs of such measures will enjoy smooth optimal transport. \ We do this in spite of unhelpful MTW\ curvature, by showing that when the gradient of the Kantorovich potential is small enough, the Hessian ``bound" places the Hessian in one of two disconnected regions, one bounded and the other unbounded. \ Tracking the estimate along a continuity path which starts in the bounded region, we conclude the Hessian must stay bounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the semilinear elliptic equation and inequality on pseudo-Hermitian manifolds. In particular, we first obtain a Liouville theorem for the equation $\Delta_b u+F(u)=0$ based on a generalized Jerison-Lee's formula. Next, we prove the nonexistence of a positive solution to the inequality $\Delta_b u+F(u)\leq 0$ under the volume estimate.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal dynamics of an age-structured reaction-diffusion system of epidemic type subjected by Neumann boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the spatio-temporal dynamics of an age-structured reaction-diffusion system of KPP-epidemic type (SIS), subject to Neumann boundary conditions and incorporating $L^1$ blow-up type death rate. We first establish the existence of time dependent solutions using age-structured semigroup theory. Afterward, the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ is derived by linearizing the system around the disease-free equilibrium state. In the case $\mathcal{R}_0&lt;1$, the existence, uniqueness and stability of disease-free equilibrium are shown by using $\omega$-limit set approach of Langlais \cite{langlais_large_1988}, combined with the technique developed in recent works of Zhao et al. \cite{zhao_spatiotemporal_2023} and Ducrot et al. \cite{ducrot_age-structured_2024}. We highlight that the absence of a general comparison principle for the age-structured SIS-model and non-separable variable mortality rate prevent the direct application of the semi-flow technique developed in \cite{ducrot_age-structured_2024} to study the long time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Existence of ground state solutions to Kirchhoff--Choquard system in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with constant potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following linearly coupled Kirchhoff--Choquard system in $\mathbb{R}^3$: \begin{align*} \begin{cases} -\left(a_1 + b_1\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla u|^2\,dx\right)\Delta u + V_1 u = \mu (I_{\alpha} * |u|^p) |u|^{p - 2} u + \lambda v, \ \ x\in\mathbb{R}^3\\ -\left(a_2 + b_2\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla v|^2\,dx\right)\Delta v + V_2 v = \nu (I_{\alpha} * |v|^q) |v|^{q - 2} v + \lambda u,\ \ x\in\mathbb{R}^3 \\ u, v \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3),
  \end{cases} \end{align*} where $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2, V_1, V_2$, $\lambda$, $\mu$ and $\nu$ are positive constants. The function $I_{\alpha} : \mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$ denotes the Riesz potential with $\alpha \in (0, 3)$.
  We study the existence of positive ground state solutions under the conditions $\frac{3 + \alpha}{3} &lt; p \le q &lt; 3 + \alpha$, or $\frac{3 + \alpha}{3} &lt; p &lt; q = 3 + \alpha$, or $\frac{3 + \alpha}{3} = p &lt; q &lt; 3 + \alpha$. Assuming suitable conditions on $V_1$, $V_2$, and $\lambda$, we obtain a ground state solution by employing a variational approach based on the Nehari--Pohozaev manifold, inspired by the works of Ueno (Commun. Pure Appl. Anal. 24 (2025)) and Chen--Liu (J. Math. Anal. 473 (2019)).
  In particular, we emphasize that in the upper half critical case $\frac{3 + \alpha}{3} &lt; p &lt; q = 3 + \alpha$ and the lower half critical case $\frac{3 + \alpha}{3} = p &lt; q &lt; 3 + \alpha$, a ground state solution can still be obtained by taking $\mu$ or $\nu$ sufficiently large to control the energy level of the minimization problem.
  To employ the Nehari--Pohozaev manifold we extend a regularity result to the linearly coupled system, which is essential for the validity of the Pohozaev identity.</description>

      <title>Stability results for nonlocal Serrin-type problems, antisymmetric Harnack inequalities, and geometric estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we explore several related topics broadly regarding the symmetry and geometric properties of nonlocal partial differential equations (PDE). This thesis is split into three parts. In the first part, we study two overdetermined problems, namely Serrin's problem and the parallel surface problem, driven by the fractional Laplacian. In the second part, we study the Harnack inequality for solutions to nonlocal PDE which are antisymmetric, that is, they have an odd symmetry with respect to reflections across some hyperplane. This topic has a strong motivation coming from proving quantitative stability estimates for nonlocal overdetermined problems. In the third part, we prove several geometric identities and inequalities involving the fractional mean curvature.</description>

      <title>Weak-strong uniqueness of the full coupled Navier-Stokes and Q-tensor system in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the weak-strong uniqueness for the Leray-Hopf type weak solutions to the Beris-Edwards model of nematic liquid crystals in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with an arbitrary parameter $\xi\in\mathbb{R}$, which measures the ratio of tumbling and alignment effects caused by the flow. This result is obtained by proposing a new uniqueness criterion in terms of $(\Delta Q,\nabla u)$ with regularity $L_t^qL_x^p$ for $\frac{2}{q}+\frac{3}{p}=\frac{3}{2}$ and $2\leq p\leq 6$, which enable us to deal with the additional nonlinear difficulties arising from the parameter $\xi$. Comparing with the related literature, our finding also reveals a new regime of weak-strong uniqueness for the simplified case of $\xi=0$. Moreover, we establish the global well-posedness of this model for small initial data in $H^s$-framework.</description>

      <title>On linear evolutionary equations with skew symmetric spatial operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generalized solutions of an evolutionary equation related to a densely defined skew-symmetric operator in a real Hilbert space. We establish existence of a contractive semigroup, which provides generalized solutions, and find criteria of uniqueness of generalized solutions. Some applications are given including the transport equations and the linearised Euler equations with solenoidal (and generally discontinuous) coefficients. Under some additional regularity assumption on the coefficients we prove that the corresponding spatial operators are skew-adjoint, which implies existence and uniqueness of generalized solutions for both the forward and the backward Cauchy problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the evolution of two incompressible, immiscible fluids in two dimensions governed by the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations. We prove global-in-time well-posedness, establishing the preservation of the natural $C^{1+\gamma}$ H\"older regularity of the free boundary, for $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$. This is the first result that allows for nonnegative density driven by a low-regularity initial velocity, while also remaining valid in the presence of a small viscosity jump.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic decay of solitary wave solutions of the fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of solitary wave solutions of the one-dimensional version of the fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (fNLS) equation was analyzed by the authors in a previous work. In this paper, the asymptotic decay of the solitary waves is analyzed. From the formulation of the differential system for the wave profiles as a convolution, these are shown to decay algebraically to zero at infinity, with an order which depends on the parameter determining the fractional order of the equation. Some numerical experiments illustrate the result.</description>

      <title>Global nonlinear stability of vortex sheets for the Navier-Stokes equations with large data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the global nonlinear stability of vortex sheets for the Navier-Stokes equations. When the Mach number is small, we allow both the amplitude and vorticity of the vortex sheets to be large. We introduce an auxiliary flow and reformulate the problem as a vortex sheet with small vorticity but subjected to a large perturbation. Based on the decomposition of frequency, the largeness of the perturbation is encoded in the zero modes of the tangential velocity. We discover an essential cancellation property that there are no nonlinear interactions among these large zero modes in the zero-mode perturbed system. This cancellation is owing to the shear structure inherent in the vortex sheets. Furthermore, with the aid of the anti-derivative technique, we establish a faster decay rate for the large zero modes.These observations enable us to derive the global estimates for strong solutions that are uniform with respect to the Mach number. As a byproduct, we can justify the incompressible limit.</description>

      <title>Steady vortex-patch flows with circulation past an obstacle in an infinity long strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the steady Euler flows past an obstacle in an infinity long strip with horizontal constant velocity at infinity, prescribed circulation around the obstacle and sharply concentrated patch-type vorticity. The construction of these flows are based on the structure of a new Green's function, the existence of stable minimum points of the Kirchhoff-Routh functions and the existence of maximizers of the kinetic energy for the vorticity. We mainly focus on the effect from the obstacle, the velocity at infinity and the circulation around the obstacle on the existence of minimum points of the Kirchhoff-Routh function, and hence on the existence of vortex patch flows.</description>

      <title>Global $L^\infty$ and decay estimate for fractional $p$-Laplacian equations in $D^{s,p}(\R^N)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new global $L^\infty$-estimate for solutions $u\in D^{s,p}(\R^N)$ of the fractional $p$-Laplacian equation %
$$ u\in D^{s,p}(\R^N): (-\Delta_p)^s u=f(x,u) \quad\mbox{in }\R^N, $$ %
of the form %
$$ \|u\|_{\infty}\le C \Phi(\|u\|_{\beta}) $$ %
for some $\beta&gt; p$, where $\Phi: \R^+\to \R^+$ is a data independent function with $\lim_{s\to 0^+}\Phi(s)=0$. The obtained $L^\infty$-estimate is used to prove a decay estimate based on pointwise estimates in terms of nonlinear Wolff potentials. Taking advantage of both the $L^\infty$ and decay estimate we prove a Brezis-Nirenberg type result regarding $D^{s,2}(\R^N)$ versus $C_b\left(\R^N, 1+|x|^{N-2s}\right)$ local minimizers.</description>

      <title>Two Strings with a Dynamic Interior Mass: A Feedback Control Design with Guaranteed Exponential Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the exponential stabilization of a coupled two-string system joined by a dynamic interior mass. The combined effect of three feedback mechanisms, boundary damping from tip velocity, higher-order nodal damping from angular velocity, and lower-order nodal damping from mass velocity, is analyzed using a Lyapunov framework. Exponential stability is established unconditionally, without constraints on wave speeds or mass location, improving upon earlier results that lower-order nodal damping, as in {Hansen-Zuazua'95}, or boundary damping alone, as in {Lee-You'89}, does not ensure exponential decay without additional structural conditions. Moreover, the lower-order feedback can be removed without loss of exponential decay when combined with the other two mechanisms, via a compact perturbation argument. These results apply to hybrid systems with interior or tip mass interfaces, including overhead cranes, deep-sea cables, and fluid structure interaction. Theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive dynamics of nonlocal competition models with heterogeneous resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time behavior of phenotype-structured models describing evolutionary dynamics of asexual populations, and analyze the joint effects of nonlocal interactions and spatial resource distributions on the global dynamics of the two species. In the first part, we consider an integro-differential system without diffusion terms, where phenotypic changes are absent and the spatial distribution of resources for one species is heterogeneous while that of the other is homogeneous. Using an entropy method to address nonlocal interactions and resource heterogeneity, we prove that the species subject to heterogeneous resources converges to a Dirac mass concentrated at the peak of the phenotypic fitness landscape, which establishes the selection of the best adapted trait. Numerical experiments further provide a sufficient criterion to identify the positions of fitness peaks. In the second part, we extend our study to a nonlocal reaction-diffusion system involving a linear diffusion operator, where heritable phenotypic changes occur and both resources are spatially heterogeneous. Through an appropriate transformation, we overcome the challenges induced by resource heterogeneity and prove that the long-time limits of the two species under different interspecific competitive coefficients are given by distinct steady states of the parabolic system, with concentrations at the maxima of their respective resource functions. Numerical results confirm the predictions and further reveal phenomena beyond the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09587v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study singular solutions to the fractional Laplace equation and, more generally, to nonlocal linear equations with measurable kernels. We establish B\^ocher type results that characterize the behavior of singular solutions near the singular point. In addition, we prove Liouville theorems for singular solutions. To this end, we construct fundamental solutions for nonlocal linear operators and establish a localized comparison principle.</description>

      <title>Higher-order coupling conditions for arbitrary flows in Stokes-Darcy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of interface conditions for coupling free-flow and porous-medium flow systems is crucial in order to obtain accurate coupled flow models and precise numerical simulation results. Typically, the Stokes equations are considered in the free-flow region, Darcy's law is applied in the porous medium, and traditional coupling conditions (conservation of mass, balance of normal forces, the Beavers-Joseph condition on tangential velocity) are set on the interface. However, these traditional conditions are applicable to flows parallel to the fluid-porous interface only. Recently, we derived generalized interface conditions accounting for arbitrary flow directions to the porous layer using homogenization and boundary layer theory. We validated these conditions numerically and demonstrated that they are more accurate than the traditional coupling conditions. However, error estimates have not been derived yet. In this paper, we extend the generalized coupling conditions and prove rigorous error estimates for the homogenization result. All effective parameters appearing in the developed higher-order interface conditions are computed numerically based on the pore geometry. We validate the derived conditions by comparing numerical simulation results for the coupled Stokes-Darcy model and the pore-scale resolved model. Moreover, we compare the new coupling conditions to the traditional as well as generalized interface conditions and highlight the importance of the additional higher-order terms appearing in the derived coupling concept.</description>

      <title>Multiple normalized solutions for a class of dipolar Gross-Pitaveskii equation with a mass subcritical perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of multiple normalized solutions to the following dipolar Gross-Pitaveskii equation with a mass subcritical perturbation \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} -\frac{1}{2}\Delta u+\mu u+V(\varepsilon x)u + \lambda_1 |u|^{2}u + \lambda_2(K\ast|u|^{2})u + \lambda_3|u|^{p-2}u = 0, \;&amp;\text{in}\; \mathbb{R}^{3},\\ \int_{{\mathbb{R}}^3} |u|^{2}dx = a^{2}, \end{array}\right. \end{align*} where $a,\varepsilon&gt;0$, $2&lt;p&lt;\frac{10}{3}$, $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ denotes the Lagrange multiplier, $\lambda_3&lt;0$, $(\lambda_1,\lambda_2) \in \left\lbrace (\lambda_1,\lambda_2) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}:\lambda_1&lt;\frac{4\pi}{3}\lambda_2\le 0\; \text{or}\; \lambda_1&lt;-\frac{8\pi}{3}\lambda_2\le 0 \right\rbrace$, $V(x)$ is an external potential, $\ast$ stands for the convolution, $K(x)=\frac{1-3cos^{2}\theta (x)}{|x|^{3}}$ and $\theta (x)$ is the angle between the dipole axis determined by $(0,0,1)$ and the vector $x$. Under some assumptions of $V$, we use variational methods to prove that the number of normalized solutions is not less than the number of global minimum points of $V$ if $\varepsilon&gt; 0$ is sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Improved H\"older regularity of fractional $(p,q)$-Poisson equation with regular data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative H\"{o}lder continuity result for viscosity solutions to the equation $$ (-\Delta_p)^{s}u(x) + {\rm PV} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |u(x)-u(x+z)|^{q-2}(u(x)-u(x+z))\frac{\xi(x,z)}{|z|^{n+ tq}} dz=f \quad \text{in}\; B_2, $$ where $t, s\in (0, 1), 1&lt;p\leq q, tq\leq sp$ and $\xi\geq 0$. Specifically, we show that if $\xi$ is $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous and $f$ is $\beta$-H\"{o}lder continuous then any viscosity solution is locally $\gamma$-H\"{o}lder continuous for any $\gamma&lt;\gamma_\circ $, where \[ \gamma_\circ=\left\{\begin{array}{lll} \min\{1, \frac{sp+\alpha\wedge\beta}{p-1}, \frac{sp}{p-2}\} &amp; \text{for}\; p&gt;2, \\ \min\{1, \frac{sp+\alpha\wedge\beta}{p-1}\} &amp; \text{for}\; p\in (1, 2]. \end{array} \right. \] Moreover, if $\min\{\frac{sp+\alpha\wedge\beta}{p-1}, \frac{sp}{p-2}\}&gt;1$ when $p&gt;2$, or $\frac{sp+\alpha\wedge\beta}{p-1}&gt;1$ when $p\in (1, 2]$, the solution is locally Lipschitz. This extends the result of [20] to the case of H\"{o}lder continuous modulating coefficients. Additionally, due to the equivalence between viscosity and weak solutions, our result provides a local Lipschitz estimate for weak solutions of $(-\Delta_p)^{s}u(x)=0$ provided either $p\in (1, 2]$ or $sp&gt;p-2$ when $p&gt;2$, thereby improving recent works [9, 10, 24].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study existence and regularity for solutions to parabolic equations having a superlinear lower order term depending on both the solution and its gradient. Two different situations are analyzed. On the one hand, we assume that the initial datum belongs to an Orlicz space of exponentially summable functions. On the other, data in an appropriate Lebesgue space satisfying a smallness condition are considered. Our results are coherent with those of previous papers in similar frameworks.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and stability in determining the wave equation from a single passive boundary measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the inverse problem of simultaneously recovering both the wave speed coefficient and an unknown initial condition for the multidimensional wave equation from a single passive boundary measurement. Specifically, we establish uniqueness and H\"{o}lder stability estimates for determining these parameters in the wave equation on $\mathbb{R}^3$, where only a single boundary measurement of the solution--generated by the unknown initial data--is available. Our work connects to thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography (TAT/PAT) for the physically relevant case of piecewise constant sound speeds. We significantly relax the stringent conditions previously required for resolving this problem, extending results to general classes of piecewise constant sound speeds over inclusions with unknown locations. The approach combines frequency-domain solution representations with distinctive properties of elliptic and hyperbolic equations.</description>

      <title>Classification of finite-time blow-up of strong solutions to the incompressible free boundary Euler equations with surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the first complete classification of finite-time blow-up scenarios for strong solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations with surface tension in a bounded domain possessing a closed, moving free boundary. Uniquely, we make \textit{no} assumptions on symmetry, periodicity, graph representation, or domain topology (simple connectivity). At the maximal existence time $T&lt;\infty$, up to which the velocity field and the free boundary can be continued in $H^3\times H^4$, blow-up must occur in at least one of five mutually exclusive ways: (i) self-intersection of the free boundary for the first time; (ii) loss of mean curvature regularity in $H^{\frac{3}{2}}$, or the free boundary regularity in $H^{2+\varepsilon}$ (for any sufficiently small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$); (iii) loss of $H^{\frac{5}{2}}$ regularity for the normal boundary velocity; (iv) the $L^1_tL^\infty$-blow-up of the tangential velocity gradient on the boundary; or (v) the $L^1_tL^\infty$-blow-up of the full velocity gradient in the interior. Furthermore, for simply connected domains, blow-up scenario (v) simplifies to a vorticity-based Beale-Kato-Majda criterion, and in particular, irrotational flows admit blow-up only at the free boundary.</description>

      <title>Existence of Solutions and Selection Problem for Quasi-stationary Contact Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First, we study the existence of solutions for a class of first order mean field games systems
\begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;H(x,u,Du)=F(x,m(t)),\quad &amp;&amp;x\in M,\ \forall\ t\in[0,T],\\ &amp;\partial_t m-\text{div}\left(m\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial p}(x,u,Du)\right)=0,\quad &amp;&amp;(x,t)\in M\times(0,T],\\ &amp;m(0)=m_0, \end{aligned}\right. \end{equation*} where the system comprises a stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the contact case and an evolutionary continuity equation.
  Then, for any fixed $\lambda&gt;0$, let $(u^\lambda,m^\lambda)$ be a solution of the system \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;H(x,\lambda u^\lambda,Du^\lambda)=F(x,m^\lambda(t))+c(m^\lambda(t)),\quad &amp;&amp;x\in M,\ \forall t\in[0,T],\\ &amp;\partial_t m^\lambda-\text{div}\left(m^\lambda\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial p}(x,\lambda u^\lambda,Du^\lambda)\right)=0,\quad &amp;&amp;(x,t)\in M\times(0,T],\\ &amp;m(0)=m_0, \end{aligned}\right. \end{equation*} where $c(m^\lambda(t))$ is the Ma\~n\'e critical value of the Hamiltonian $H(x,0,p)-F(x,m^\lambda(t))$. We investigate the selection problem for the limit of $(u^\lambda,m^\lambda)$ as $\lambda$ tends to 0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the Reshetnyak-class homeomorphisms $\varphi:\Omega\to Y$, where~$\Omega$ is a~domain in some Carnot group and~$Y$ is a~metric space, we obtain an~equivalent description as the mappings which induce the bounded composition operator $$ \varphi^*:{\rm Lip}(Y)\to L_q^1(\Omega), $$ where $1\leq q\leq \infty$, as $\varphi^*u=u\circ\varphi$ for $u\in{\rm Lip}(Y)$. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by characterizing the homeomorphisms $\varphi:\Omega\to\Omega'$ of domains in some Carnot group~$\mathbb G$ which induce the bounded composition operator $$ \varphi^*: L^1_p(\Omega')\cap {\rm Lip}_{{\rm loc}}(\Omega')\to L^1_q (\Omega),\quad 1\leq q \leq p\leq \infty, $$ of homogeneous Sobolev spaces. The new proof is much shorter than the one already available, requires a~minimum of tools, and enables us to obtain new properties of the homeomorphisms in question.</description>

      <title>Identification problems for anisotropic time-fractional subdiffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse problem consisting in the identification of constant coefficients for a fractional-in-time partial differential equation governed by a finite sum of positive self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space under energy-type overdeterminating conditions. We prove the uniqueness of the solution to the inverse problem when the fractional order $\alpha$ of the derivative is in $(0,1)$. A conditioned existence result is also provided, complemented with a suitable selection of numerical calculations. In addition, we prove that, as $\alpha\to 1^{-}$, the solution corresponding to $\alpha$ tends to the classical one ($\alpha=1$). Applications to examples of heat diffusion and elasticity are presented.</description>

      <title>Smoothness and stability in the Alt-Phillips problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-phase Alt-Phillips free boundary problem, focusing on the case of negative exponents $\gamma \in (-2,0)$. The goal of this paper is twofold.
  On the one hand, we prove smoothness of $C^{1,\alpha}$-regular free boundaries by reducing the problem to a class of degenerate quasilinear PDEs, for which we establish Schauder estimates. Such method provide a unified proof of the smoothness for general exponents.
  On the other hand, by exploiting the higher regularity of solutions, we derive a new stability condition for the Alt-Phillips problem in the negative exponent regime, ruling out the existence of nontrivial axially symmetric stable cones in low dimensions. Finally, we provide a variational criterion for the stability of cones in the Alt-Phillips problem, which recovers the one for minimal surfaces in the singular limit as $\gamma \to -2$.</description>

      <title>Fractional sublinear Sobolev inequality for $\mathcal{L}-$superharmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a Sobolev-type inequality in Lorentz spaces for $\mathcal{L}$-superharmonic functions \[ \|u\|_{L^{\frac{nq}{n-\alpha q},t}(\mathbb{R}^n)} \leq c \left\| \frac{u(x) - u(y)}{|x-y|^{\frac{n}{q}+\alpha}} \right\|_{L^{q,t}(\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n)} \] in the sublinear case $p-1 &lt; q &lt; 1$ and $p-1\leq t\leq \infty$. The nonlocal nonlinear elliptic operator $\mathcal{L}$ is modeled from the fractional $p$-Laplacian $(- \Delta_{p})^{\alpha} $ with $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ and $1&lt;p&lt;2$. Related Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation for $\mathcal{L}$-superharmonic functions is also derived.</description>

      <title>Instabilities of internal gravity waves in the two-dimensional Boussinesq system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional, incompressible, inviscid fluid with variable density, subject to the action of gravity. Assuming a stable equilibrium density profile, we adopt the so-called Boussinesq approximation, which neglects density variations in all terms except those involving gravity. This model is widely used in the physical literature to describe internal gravity waves.
  In this work, we prove a modulational instability result for such a system: specifically, we show that the linearization around a small-amplitude travelling wave admits at least one eigenvalue with positive real part, bifurcating from double eigenvalues of the linear, unperturbed equations. This can be regarded as the first rigorous justification of the Parametric Subharmonic Instability (PSI) of inviscid internal waves, wherein energy is transferred from an initially excited primary wave to two secondary waves with different frequencies. Our approach uses Floquet-Bloch decomposition and Kato's similarity transformations to compute rigorously the perturbed eigenvalues without requiring boundedness of the perturbed operator - differing fundamentally from prior analyses involving viscosity.
  Notably, the inviscid setting is especially relevant in oceanographic applications, where viscous effects are often negligible.</description>

      <title>On a class of forward-backward reaction-diffusion systems with local and nonlocal coupling for image restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of novel nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems that couple forward-backward with fractional diffusion for image restoration, offering the advantage of preserving both contour features and textures. The existence of Young measure solutions to the proposed model is established using the regularization technique, Rothe's method, relaxation theorem, and Moser's iteration. Uniqueness follows from the independence property satisfied by the solution. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our model in image denoising and deblurring, in comparison with existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider systems of the differential inequalities $$\left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp; \sum_{|\alpha| = m_1} \partial^\alpha a_\alpha (x, u_1) \ge f_1 (u_2) &amp; \mbox{in } {\mathbb R}^n, &amp; \sum_{|\alpha| = m_2} \partial^\alpha b_\alpha (x, u_2) \ge f_2 (u_1) &amp; \mbox{in } {\mathbb R}^n, \end{aligned} \right. $$ where $n, m_1, m_2 \ge 1$ are integers and $a_\alpha$ and $b_\alpha$ are Caratheodory functions such that $$ |a_\alpha (x, \zeta)| + |b_\alpha (x, \zeta)| \le A |\zeta| $$ with some constant $A &gt; 0$ for almost all $x \in {\mathbb R}^n$ and for all $\zeta \in {\mathbb R}$. For solutions of these systems exact blow-up conditions are obtained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that solutions to linear kinetic equations in a half-space with absorbing boundary conditions decay for large times like $t^{-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{d}{4}}$ in a weighted $\sfL^{2}$ space and like $t^{-1-\frac{d}{2}}$ in a weighted $\sfL^{\infty}$ space, i.e. faster than in the whole space and in agreement with the decay of solutions to the heat equation in the half-space with Dirichlet conditions. The class of linear kinetic equations considered includes the linear relaxation equation, the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation and the Kolmogorov equation associated with the time-integrated spherical Brownian motion.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fluid-structure interaction problem between a viscous incompressible fluid and an elastic beam with fixed endpoints in a static setting. The 3D fluid domain is bounded, nonsmooth and non simply connected, the fluid is modeled by the stationary Navier-Stokes equations subject to inflow/outflow conditions. The structure is modeled by a stationary 1D beam equation with a load density involving the force exerted by the fluid and, thereby, may vary its position. In a smallness regime, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the PDE-ODE coupled system.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Fractional Navier-Stokes Equations: Finite-Time Blow-up for Vortex Stretch Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the first finite-time blow-up results for generalized 3D stochastic fractional Navier-Stokes equations \[ \Caputo \mathbf{u} = -(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u} - \nabla p + \nu \fLaplacian \mathbf{u} + I^{1-\beta}[\sigma(\mathbf{u}) \dot{W}], \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0, \] with dissipation $(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}$ for $\alpha \in (1, 3/2)$, Caputo time-memory $\partial_t^\beta$, and superlinear noise $|\mathbf{u}|^{1+\gamma}$, proving that for a critical window of memory, $\beta \in (\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+3}, \beta_c(\alpha,\gamma))$, the second moment of the vorticity supremum explodes due to a vortex-stretching-driven renewal inequality. This work reveals that when a fluid's temporal memory, governed by $\partial_t^\beta$, is short enough to permit instability but long enough for that instability to mature, the relentless self-amplification from vortex stretching, when coupled with explosive stochastic kicks from the $|\mathbf{u}|^{1+\gamma}$ noise, guarantees the vorticity will spin up to infinity in finite time.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a direct continuation of the paper arXiv:2401.00053. By this reason neither introductory part of the paper nor the list of references are not duplicated. However for the reader convenience, the formulas from the first paper that are cited here are collected in a special addendum at the end of the paper with their original numbers.
  At this paper two new local foliations are investigated: minor pockets and rectangles. The appearance of such local foliations is illustrated by the further investigation of the examples with the boundary functions being the polynomials of the third degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp local smoothing estimates for curve averages in all dimensions. As a corollary, we prove the sharp $L^p$ boundedness of the helical maximal operator in $\mathbb{R}^4$, which was previously known only for $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. We also improve previously known results in higher dimensions. There are new ingredients of the proof: Fourier decay estimates and wave envelope estimates for nondegenerate curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$. As a byproduct, we prove Bochner-Riesz estimates for nondegenerate curves in all dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of a positive, bounded solution for a class of parabolic partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, where the boundary conditions depend on the solution on the boundary at a time $\tau \geq 0$ in the past. These equations model the production dynamics of a protein species by a single cell, where a feedback mechanism downregulates the protein's production. Furthermore, we analyze the stability of a non-trivial steady-state solution and provide sufficient conditions on the nonlinearity parameter, boundary flux, and time delay that ensure the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation.</description>

First some asymptotic property of positive energy solutions is obtained, as time goes to infinity. Afterwards, we prove the existence of hyperbolic solutions with given initial configuration and asymptotic behavior, when time goes to positive or negative infinity, and in the planar case, the existence of bi-hyperbolic solutions with given asymptotic behaviors, when time goes to both positive and negative infinities, under various conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish fractional Leibniz rules for the Dunkl Laplacian $\Delta_k$ of the form $$\|(-\Delta_k)^s(fg)\|_{L^p(d\mu_k)} \lesssim \|(-\Delta_k)^s f\|_{L^{p_1}(d\mu_k)} \|g\|_{L^{p_2}(d\mu_k)} + \|f\|_{L^{p_1}(d\mu_k)} \|(-\Delta_k)^s g\|_{L^{p_2}(d\mu_k)}.$$ Our approach relies on adapting the classical paraproduct decomposition to the Dunkl setting. In the process, we develop several new auxiliary results. Specifically, we show that for a Schwartz function $f$, the function $(-\Delta_k)^s f$ satisfies a pointwise decay estimate; we establish a version of almost orthogonality estimates adapted to the Dunkl framework; and we investigate the boundedness of Dunkl paraproduct operators on the Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <title>A classification of global attractors for $\mathbb{S}^1$-equivariant parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey the global dynamics of semiflows generated by scalar semilinear parabolic equations which are $\mathbb{SO}(2)$ equivariant under spatial shifts of $x\in \mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. $$ u_t = u_{xx} + f(u,u_x),\qquad x\in \mathbb{S}^1.$$ For dissipative $C^2$ nonlinearities $f$, the semiflow possesses a compact global attractor $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ which we call Sturm attractor. The Sturm attractor $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ decomposes as $$ \mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{E}\cup\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P}\cup\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}\cup\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P},$$ where $\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P}$ denotes heteroclinic orbits between distinct elements of spatially homogeneous equilibria $\mathcal{E}$, rigidly rotating waves $\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}$ and, as their non-rotating counterparts, frozen waves $\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P}$. We therefore represent $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ by its connection graph $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$, with vertices in $\mathcal{E},\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P},\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}$ and edges $\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P}$. Under mild hyperbolicity assumptions, the directed graphs $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$ are finite and transitive. For illustration, we enumerate all 21 connection graphs $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$ with up to seven vertices. The result uses a lap signature of period maps associated to integrable versions of the steady state ODE of our PDE.
  As an example, we freeze and reconstruct the connection graph of the Vas tulip attractor, known from delay differential equations, in our PDE setting.</description>

      <title>On the structure of optimal solutions of conservation laws at a junction with one incoming and one outgoing arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a min-max problem for strictly concave conservation laws on a 1-1 network, with inflow controls acting at the junction. We investigate the minimization problem for a functional measuring the total variation of the flow of the solutions at the node, among those solutions that maximize the time integral of the flux. To formulate this problem we establish a regularity result showing that the total variation of the boundary-flux of the solution of an initial-boundary value problem is controlled by the total variation of the initial datum and of the flux of the boundary datum. In the case the initial datum is monotone, we show that the flux of the entropy weak solution at the node provides an optimal inflow control for this min-max problem. We also exhibit two prototype examples showing that, in the case where the initial datum is not monotone, the flux of the entropy weak solution is no more optimal.</description>

      <title>Short-time existence of Lagrangian mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his paper `Conjectures on Bridgeland Stability', Joyce asked if one can desingularise the transverse intersection point of an immersed Lagrangian using JLT expanders such that one gets a Lagrangian mean curvature flow via the desingularisations. Begley and Moore answered this in the affirmative by constructing a family of desingularisations and showing that a certain limit along their flows satisfies LMCF along with convergence to the immersed Lagrangian in the sense of varifolds. We prove that there exists a solution with convergence in a stronger sense, using the notion of manifolds with corners and a-corners as introduced by Joyce. Our methods are a direct P.D.E. based approach, along the lines of the proof of short-time existence for network flow by Lira, Mazzeo, Pluda and Saez.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau SPDEs in infinite-volume. We show that under a weakly asymmetric scaling, their solutions converge to that of the KPZ equation. The key technical innovation is the analysis of a stochastic heat kernel for the SPDE of interest, which allows for a multi-scale "localization" to the compact setting.</description>

      <title>Weighted non-autonomous $L^q(L^p)$ maximal regularity for complex systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02527v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show weighted non-autonomous $L^q(L^p)$ maximal regularity for families of complex second-order systems in divergence form under a mixed regularity condition in space and time. To be more precise, we let $p,q \in (1,\infty)$ and we consider coefficient functions in $C^{\beta + \varepsilon}$ with values in $C^{\alpha + \varepsilon}$ subject to the parabolic relation $2\beta + \alpha = 1$. If $p &lt; \frac{d}{\alpha}$, we can likewise deal with spatial $H^{\alpha + \varepsilon, \frac{d}{\alpha}}$ regularity. The starting point for this result is a weak $(p,q)$-solution theory with uniform constants. Further key ingredients are a commutator argument that allows us to establish higher a priori spatial regularity, operator-valued pseudo differential operators in weighted spaces, and a representation formula due to Acquistapace and Terreni. Furthermore, we show $p$-bounds for semigroups and square roots generated by complex elliptic systems under a minimal regularity assumption for the coefficients.</description>

      <title>The Monge-Ampere system: convex integration in arbitrary dimension and codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study flexibility of weak solutions to the Monge-Amp\`ere system (MA) via convex integration. This new system of Pdes is an extension of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation in $d=2$ dimensions, naturally arising from the prescribed curvature problem and closely related to the classical problem of isometric immersions (II).
  Our main result achieves density in the set of subsolutions, of the H\"older $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ solutions to the Von K\'arm\'an system (VK) which is the weak formulation of (MA). The regularity exponent $\alpha$ is any exponent satisfying $\alpha&lt;\frac{1}{1+
  d(d+1)/k}$ where $d$ is an arbitrary dimension and $k$ an arbitrary codimension of the problem. At $k=1$, this agrees with the regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ for (II) with any $\alpha &lt;\frac{1}{1+d(d+1)}$, proved by Conti, Delellis and Szekelyhidi. At $d=2, k=1$, this extends the initial findings by the author and Pakzad for (MA).
  Our result seems to be optimal, from the technical viewpoint, for the corrugation-based convex integration scheme. In particular, it covers the codimension interval $k\in \big(1, d(d+1)\big)$ so far uncharted even for the system (II), since the regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ with any $\alpha &lt;1$ achieved by K\"allen in \cite{Kallen}, strictly requires a large codimension. Our second main result reproduces K\"allen's result in the context of (MA), obtaining density in the set of subsolutions, of $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ regular solutions for any $\alpha&lt;1$ whenever $k\geq d(d+1)$.
  As an application of our results for (VK), we derive an energy scaling bound in the quantitative immersability of Riemannian metrics, for nonlinear energy functionals modelled on the energies of deformations of thin prestrained films in the nonlinear elasticity.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and intermittency in the limit evolution of polygonal vortex filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the aim of quantifying turbulent behaviors of vortex filaments, we study the multifractality and intermittency of the family of generalized Riemann's non-differentiable functions \begin{equation} R_{x_0}(t) = \sum_{n \neq 0} \frac{e^{2\pi i ( n^2 t + n x_0 ) } }{n^2}, \qquad x_0 \in [0,1]. \end{equation} These functions represent, in a certain limit, the trajectory of regular polygonal vortex filaments that evolve according to the binormal flow. When $x_0$ is rational, we show that $R_{x_0}$ is multifractal and intermittent by completely determining the spectrum of singularities of $R_{x_0}$ and computing the $L^p$ norms of its Fourier high-pass filters, which are analogues of structure functions. We prove that $R_{x_0}$ has a multifractal behavior also when $x_0$ is irrational. The proofs rely on a careful design of Diophantine sets that depend on $x_0$, which we study by crucially using the Duffin-Schaeffer theorem and the Mass Transference Principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09706v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on an elastic dislocation problem that is motivated by applications in the geophysical and seismological communities. In our model, the displacement satisfies the Lam\'e system in a bounded domain with a mixed homogeneous boundary condition. We also allow the occurrence of discontinuities in both the displacement and traction fields on the fault curve/surface. By the variational approach, we first prove the well-posedness of the direct dislocation problem in a rather general setting with the Lam\'e parameters being real-valued $L^\infty$ functions and satisfy the strong convexity condition. Next, by considering that the Lam\'e parameters are constant and the fault curve/surface possesses certain corner singularities, we establish a local characterization of the jump vectors at the corner points over the dislocation curve/surface. In our study, the dislocation is geometrically rather general and may be open or closed. We establish the unique results for the inverse problem of determining the dislocation curve/surface and the jump vectors for both cases.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and numerical analysis of an elapsed time model with strongly coupled neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02068v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elapsed time equation is an age-structured model that describes the dynamics of interconnected spiking neurons through the elapsed time since the last discharge, leading to many interesting questions on the evolution of the system from a mathematical and biological point of view. In this work, we deal with the case when the transmission after a spike is instantaneous and the case with a distributed delay that depends on the previous history of the system, which is a more realistic assumption. Since the instantaneous transmission case is known to be ill-posed due to non-uniqueness or jump discontinuities, we establish a criterion for well-posedness to determine when the solution remains continuous in time, through an invertibility condition that improves the existence theory under more relaxed hypothesis on the nonlinearity, including the strongly excitatory case. Inspired in the existence theory, we adapt the classical explicit upwind scheme through a robust fixed-point approach and we prove that the approximation given by this scheme converges to the solution of the nonlinear problem through BV-estimates and we extend the idea to the case with distributed delay. We also show some numerical simulations to compare the behavior of the system in the case of instantaneous transmission with the case of distributed delay under different parameters, leading to solutions with different asymptotic profiles.</description>

      <title>Minnaert Frequency and Simultaneous Reconstruction of the Density, Bulk and Source in the Time-Domain Wave Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with the inverse problem of reconstructing acoustic material properties or/and external sources for the time-domain acoustic wave model. The traditional measurements consist of repeated active (or passive) interrogations, as the Dirichlet-Neumann map, or point sources with source points varying outside of the domain of interest. It is reported in the existing literature, that based on such measurements, one can recover some (but not all) of the three parameters: mass density, bulk modulus or the external source term. In this work, we first inject isolated small-scales bubbles into the region of interest and then measure the generated pressure field at a {\it{single point}} outside, or at the boundary, of this region. Then we repeat such measurements by moving the bubble to scan the region of interest. Using such measurements, we show that
  1. If either the mass density or the bulk modulus is known then we can simultaneously reconstruct the other one and the source term.
  2. If the source term is known at the initial time, precisely we assume to know its first non vanishing time-derivative, at the initial time, then we reconstruct simultaneously the three parameters, namely the mass density, the bulk modulus and the source function.
  Here, the source term is space-time dependent. It is worth mentioning that in terms of dimentionality, the induced inverse problem is not overdetermined since we use $4=3+1$ dimensions ($3$ in space and $1$ in time) to recover $2$ coefficients of $3$ spatial dimensions, i.e. the mass density and the bulk modulus, and the $4=3+1$ dimensional source function. In addition, the result is local, meaning that we do reconstruction in any subpart, of the domain of interest, we want.</description>

      <title>Stochastic-Periodic Homogenization of a Class of Minimization Problems in Orlicz-Sobolev Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current investigation is devoted to the stochastic-periodic homogenization theory in Orlicz-Sobolev's spaces. It focuses on the concept of stochastic two-scale convergence in this type of spaces, which is a combination of both well-known periodic two-scale convergence [\textit{Acta Appl. Math. (2012)} \textbf{121}, 175-196] and stochastic two-scale convergence in the mean schemes [\textit{Asympt. Anal. (2025)} \textbf{142}, 291-320]. One fundamental in this topic is to extend the classical compactness results of the stochastic two-scale convergence method to the Orlicz-Sobolev's spaces. Moreover, it is shown that the sequence of minimizers of a class of highly oscillatory minimizations problems involving integral functionals with convex and nonstandard growth integrands, converges to the minimizer of a homogenized problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the free boundary problem of the compressible primitive equations in atmospheric dynamics with physical vacuum. Up to second order of the perturbations of an equilibrium, we have introduced a model of the compressible primitive equations with a specific viscosity and shown that the physical vacuum free boundary problem for this model system has a global-in-time solution converging to an equilibrium exponentially, provided that the initial data is a small perturbation of the equilibrium. More precisely, we introduce a new coordinate system by choosing the enthalpy (the square of sound speed) as the vertical coordinate, and thanks to the hydrostatic balance, the degenerate density at the free boundary admits a representation with separation of variables in the new coordinates. Such a property allows us to establish horizontal derivative estimates without involving the singular vertical derivative of the density profile, which plays a key role in our analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian with homogeneous Robin boundary conditions, when the (positive) Robin parameter is diverging. In this framework, since the convergence of the Robin eigenvalues to the Dirichlet ones is known, we address the question of quantifying the rate of such convergence. More precisely, in this work we identify the proper geometric quantity representing (asymptotically) the first term in the expansion of the eigenvalue variation: it is a novel notion of torsional rigidity. Then, by performing a suitable asymptotic analysis of both such quantity and its minimizer, we prove the first-order expansion of any Robin eigenvalue, in the Dirichlet limit. Moreover, the convergence rate of the corresponding eigenfunctions is obtained as well. We remark that all our spectral estimates are explicit and sharp, and cover both the cases of convergence to simple and multiple Dirichlet eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>The Weighted $L^p$ Minkowski Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem in convex geometry concerns showing a given Borel measure on the unit sphere is, up to perhaps a constant, some type of surface area measure of a convex body. Two types of Minkowski problems in particular are an active area of research: $L^p$ Minkowski problems, introduced by Lutwak and (Lutwak,Yang, and Zhang), and weighted Minkowski problems, introduced by Livshyts. For the latter, the Gaussian Minkowski problem, whose primary investigators were (Huang, Xi and Zhao), is the most prevalent. In this work, we consider weighted surface area in the $L^p$ setting. We propose a framework going beyond the Gaussian setting by focusing on rotational invariant measures, mirroring the recent development of the Gardner-Zvavitch inequality for rotational invariant, log-concave measures. Our results include existence for all $p \in \mathbb R$ (with symmetry assumptions in certain instances). We also have uniqueness for $p \geq 1$ under a concavity assumption. Finally, we obtain results in the so-called $small$ $mass$ $regime$ using degree theory, as instigated in the Gaussian case by (Huang, Xi and Zhao). Most known results for the Gaussian Minkowski problem are then special cases of our main theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a unique global solution to the Cauchy problem of the 3D Boltzmann equation for initial data around the Maxwellian in the spatially critical homogeneous Besov space $\widetilde{L}^2_{\xi}(\dot{B}_{2,1}^{1/2}\cap\dot{B}_{2,1}^{3/2})$. In addition, under the condition that the low-frequency part of initial perturbation is bounded in $\widetilde{L}^2_{\xi}(\dot{B}_{2,\infty}^{\sigma_{0}})$ with $-3/2\leq\sigma_{0}&lt;1/2$, it is shown that the solution converges to its equilibrium in large times with the optimal rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-(\sigma-\sigma_{0})/2})$ in $\widetilde{L}^2_{\xi}(\dot{B}_{2,1}^{\sigma})$ with some $\sigma&gt;\sigma_0$, and the microscopic part decays at an enhanced rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-(\sigma-\sigma_{0})/2-1/2})$. In contrast to [19], the usual $L^2$ estimates are not necessary in our approach, which provides a new understanding of hypocoercivity theory for the Boltzmann equation allowing to construct the Lyapunov functional with different dissipation rates at low and high frequencies. Furthermore, a time-weighted Lyapunov energy argument can be developed to deduce the optimal time-decay estimates.</description>

      <title>Strong ill-posedness and non-existence in Sobolev spaces for generalized-SQG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The general surface quasi-geostrophic equation is the scalar transport equation defined by \begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t}+v^\gamma_1 \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x_1}+v^\gamma_2 \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x_2} =0 ,
  \end{equation*} where the velocity comes defined by
  \begin{equation*}
  v^\gamma=\nabla^{\perp} \psi_\gamma=\left(\partial_{2} \psi_\gamma,-\partial_{1} \psi_\gamma \right), \quad \psi_\gamma=-\Lambda^{-1+\gamma} \theta,
  \end{equation*} and $\theta(\cdot,0)=\theta_0(\cdot)$ is the initial condition. We consider the parameter $\gamma \in (-1,1)$ and the non-local operator $\Lambda^{\alpha}=(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is defined on the Fourier side by $\widehat{\Lambda^{\alpha} f}(\xi)=|\xi|^{\alpha} \widehat{f}(\xi)$.
  The PDE is well-posed in the Sobolev spaces $H^s$ with $s&gt;2+\gamma$.
  In this paper we prove strong ill-posedness in the super-critical regime $H^\beta$ with $\beta\in [1,2+\gamma)\cap(\frac{3}{2}+\gamma,2+\gamma)$. To do this, we will derive an approximated PDE solvable by some family of functions that we will call pseudosolutions and that will allow us to control the norms of the real solutions.
  Using this result and a gluing argument we also prove non-existence of solutions in the same Sobolev spaces. Since the pseudosolution will control the real one, we can build a solution that will be initially in $H^{\beta}$ and will leave it instantaneously. Nevertheless, this solution exists for a long time and remains the only classical solution in a high regularity class.</description>

      <title>Convergence of non-reversible Markov processes via lifting and flow Poincar\'e inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general approach for quantitative convergence analysis of non-reversible Markov processes, based on the concept of second-order lifts and a variational approach to hypocoercivity. To this end, we introduce the flow Poincar\'e inequality, a space-time Poincar\'e inequality along trajectories of the semigroup, and a general divergence lemma based only on the Dirichlet form of an underlying reversible diffusion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to a pair of run-and-tumble particles with jamming, a model from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and several piecewise deterministic Markov processes used in sampling applications, in particular including general stochastic jump kernels.</description>

      <title>Global small data weak solutions of 2-D semilinear wave equations with scale-invariant damping, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an interesting open question: for the $n$-D ($n\ge 1$) semilinear wave equation with scale-invariant damping $\partial_t^2u-\Delta u+\frac{\mu}{t}\partial_tu=|u|^p$, where $t\ge 1$, $p&gt;1$ and $\mu&gt;0$, the global small data weak solution $u$ will exist when $p&gt;p_{crit}(n,\mu)=\max\{p_s(n+\mu), p_f(n)\}$ with $p_{s}(n+\mu)=\frac{n+\mu+1+\sqrt{(n+\mu)^2+10(n+\mu)-7}}{2(n+\mu-1)}$ and $p_f(n)=1+\frac{2}{n}$. It is noticed that the weak solution $u$ can blow up in finite time when $1&lt;p\le p_{crit}(n,\mu)$. In addition, for $n=1$, this open question has been solved recently. We now systematically solve this open problem for $n=2$. As the first part, in the present paper, the global small solution $u$ is established for $p_{s}(2+\mu)&lt;p&lt;p_{conf}(2,\mu)=\frac{\mu+5}{\mu+1}$ and $\mu\in(0,1)\cup(1,2)$. Our main ingredients are to find the suitable conformal power $p_{conf}(2,\mu)$ and derive some new kinds of spacetime-weighted $L^{q}_tL^{q}_x([1, \infty)\times \mathbb{R}^2)$ or $L^q_tL^\nu_rL^2_{\theta}([1, \infty)\times [0, \infty)\times [0, 2\pi])$ Strichartz estimates for the solutions of linear generalized Tricomi equation $\partial_t^2v-t^m\Delta v=F(t,x)$ ($m&gt;0$). In forthcoming papers, we shall show the global existence of small solution $u$ for the remaining cases of $p&gt;1$ and $\mu&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the Zakharov-Shabat systems with meromorphic potentials by quadrature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the solvability of the general two-dimensional Zakharov-Shabat (ZS) systems with meromorphic potentials by quadrature. These systems appear in application of the inverse scattering transform (IST) to an important class of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) called integrable systems. Their solvability by quadrature is a key to obtain analytical expressions for solutions to the initial value problems of the integrable PDEs by using the IST. We prove that the ZS systems are always integrable in the sense of differential Galois theory, i.e., solvable by quadrature, if and only if the meromporphic potentials are reflectionless, under the condition that the potentials are absolutely integrable on $\mathbb{R}\setminus(-R_0,R_0)$ for some $R_0&gt;0$. Similar statements were previously proved to be true by the author for a limited class of potentials and the linear Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the solvability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation under meromorphic initial conditions by quadrature when the inverse scattering transform (IST) is applied. It is a key to solve the Schr\"odinger equation appearing in the Lax pair in application of the IST. We show that the Schr\"odinger equation is always integrable in the sense of differential Galois theory, i.e., solvable by quadrature, if and only if the meromporphic potential is reflectionless, under the condition that the potential is absolutely integrable on $\mathbb{R}\setminus(-R_0,R_0)$ for some $R_0&gt;0$.This statement was previously proved to be true by the author for a limited class of potentials. We also show that the Schr\"odinger equation is not integrable in this sense for rational potentials that decay at infinity but do not satisfy the weak condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a sharp remainder formula for the Poincar\'e inequality for Baouendi-Grushin vector fields in the setting of $L^{p}$ for complex-valued functions. In special cases, we recover previously known results. Consequently, we also derive the $L^{p}$-Poincar\'e inequality with an explicit optimal constant under a certain assumption. Additionally, we provide estimates of the remainder term for $p\geq2$ and $1&lt;p&lt;2\leq n&lt;\infty$. As an application, we obtain a blow-up in finite time and global existence of the positive solutions to the initial-boundary value problem of the doubly nonlinear porous medium equation involving a degenerate nonlinear operator $\Delta_{\gamma,p}$.</description>

      <title>Decay of small energy solutions in the ABCD Boussinesq model under the influence of an uneven bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boussinesq $abcd$ system is a 4-parameter set of equations posed in $\mathbb{R}_t\times\mathbb{R}_x$, originally derived by Bona, Chen and Saut as first order 2-wave approximations of the incompressible and irrotational, two dimensional water wave equations in the shallow water wave regime, in the spirit of the original Boussinesq derivation. Among many particular regimes, depending each of them in terms of the value of the parameters $(a,b,c,d)$ present in the equations, the generic regime is characterized by the setting $b,d&gt;0$ and $a,c&lt;0$. If additionally $b=d$, the $abcd$ system is hamiltonian. Previously, sharp local in space $H^1\times H^1$ decay properties were proved in the case of a large class of $abcd$ model under the small data assumption. In this paper, we generalize [C. Kwak, et. al., The scattering problem for Hamiltonian ABCD Boussinesq systems in the energy space. J. Math. Pures Appl. (9) 127 (2019), 121--159] by considering the small data $abcd$ decay problem in the physically relevant variable bottom regime described by M. Chen. The nontrivial bathymetry is represented by a smooth space-time dependent function $h=h(t,x)$, which obeys integrability in time and smallness in space. We prove first the existence of small global solutions in $H^1\times H^1$. Then, for a sharp set of dispersive $abcd$ systems (characterized only in terms of parameters $a, b$ and $c$), all $H^1\times H^1$ small solutions must decay to zero in proper subset of the light cone $|x|\leq |t|$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated inequality by Payne relates the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian to the first eigenvalue of the buckling problem. Motivated by the goal of establishing a quantitative version of this inequality, we show that Payne's original estimate - which is not sharp - can in fact be improved. Our result provides a refined spectral bound and opens the way to further investigations into quantitative enhancements of classical inequalities in spectral theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce nonlocal minimal surfaces on closed manifolds and establish a far-reaching Yau-type result: in every closed, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold we construct infinitely many nonlocal $s$-minimal surfaces. We prove that, when $s\in (0,1)$ is sufficiently close to $1$, the constructed surfaces are smooth for $n=3$ and $n=4$, while for $n\ge 5$ they are smooth outside of a closed set of dimension $n-5$. Moreover, we prove surprisingly strong regularity and rigidity properties of finite Morse index $s$-minimal surfaces such as a "finite Morse index Bernstein-type result". These properties make nonlocal minimal surfaces ideal objects on which to apply min-max variational methods.</description>

      <title>Information geometric regularization of the barotropic Euler equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shock waves in gas dynamics feature jump discontinuities that hinder numerical simulations. Viscous regularizations are prone to excessive dissipation of fine-scale structures. In this work, we propose the first inviscid regularization of the multidimensional Euler equation based on ideas from semidefinite programming, information geometry, geometric hydrodynamics, and nonlinear elasticity. The Lagrangian flow maps of Euler solutions are a dynamical system on the manifold of diffeomorphisms. We observe that shock formation arises from the manifold's geodesic incompleteness. Our regularization embeds it into an ambient space equipped with the information geometry of the logarithmic barrier function. Thus, the diffeomorphism manifold inherits a geodesically complete geometry. The resulting regularized conservation law replaces shocks with smooth profiles without affecting oscillatory structures. One and two-dimensional numerical experiments show its practical potential to enable higher-order methods without explicit shock capturing. While we focus on the barotropic Euler equations for concreteness and simplicity of exposition, our regularization easily extends to more general Euler and Navier-Stokes-type equations. Our approach regularizes the Wasserstein geometry of the mass density with its information geometry. The former captures the natural trajectories of physical particles and the latter that of statistical estimators. Information geometric regularization accounts for the mass density's dual nature as a statistical/computational tool summarizing the motion of physical particles. Thus, our work is a starting point for information geometric mechanics that views solutions of continuum mechanical PDEs as parameters of statistical models for unresolved scales and uses their information geometry to evolve them in time.</description>

Abstract: We consider in this paper a numerical approximation of Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier- Stokes (PNP-NS) system. We construct a decoupled semi-discrete and fully discrete scheme that enjoys the properties of positivity preserving, mass conserving, and unconditionally energy stability. Then, we establish the well-posedness and regularity of the initial and (periodic) boundary value problem of the PNP-NS system under suitable assumptions on the initial data, and carry out a rigorous convergence analysis for the fully discretized scheme. We also present some numerical results to validate the positivity-preserving property and the accuracy of our scheme.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for the one-dimensional Stochastic Stefan Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional outer stochastic Stefan problem with reflection. The problem admits maximal solutions as long as the velocity of the moving boundary remains bounded, [3,9,10]. We apply Malliavin calculus to the transformed equation and first prove that its maximal solution u has continuous paths a.s. In the case of the unreflected problem, the previous enables the localization of a proper approximating sequence of the maximal solution. Then, we derive there locally the differentiability of maximal u in the Malliavin sense. The novelty of this work, apart from the derivation of continuity of the paths for the maximal solution with reflection, is that for the unreflected case we introduce a localization argument on maximal solutions and define efficiently the relevant sample space. More precisely, we prove the local (in the sample space) existence of the Malliavin derivative and, under a non-degeneracy condition on the noise coefficient, the absolute continuity of the law of the solution with respect to the Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new numerical algorithm for solving the Dirichlet problem for the real Monge--Ampere equation. The idea is to represent the non-linear Monge--Ampere operator as an infimum of a class of linear elliptic operators and use Bellman's principle to construct a numeric scheme for approximating the operator attaining this infimum.
  Moreover, we prove convergence of the proposed algorithm (under suitable technical assumptions) and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. We also demonstrate the performance of the method on several examples with various degrees of regularity and degeneracy and compare the results to two existing methods. Our method runs considerably faster than the ones used for comparison, improving the running time by a factor of 3--10 for smooth, strictly convex examples, and by a factor of 20--100 or more for mildly degenerate examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing the $k$-th eigenvalue functional over the class of absolutely continuous measures on a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $m\geq 3$.
  For dimensions $3 \leq m \leq 6$, we generalize the work of Karpukhin and Stern on the first eigenvalue, showing that the maximizing measures are realized by smooth harmonic maps into finite-dimensional spheres.
  For $m \geq 7$, the maximizing measures are again induced by harmonic maps, which may now exhibit singularities. We prove that $m-7$ is the optimal upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set. More precisely, for any $m \geq 7$, there exist maximizing harmonic maps on the $m$-dimensional sphere whose singular sets have any prescribed integer dimension up to $m - 7$.</description>

      <title>Cauchy problem for the localized wave propagation in continuous model of the one-dimensional diatomic crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the continuous model of the localized wave propagation corresponding to the one-dimensional diatomic crystal lattice. From the mathematical point of view the problem can be described in terms of the Cauchy problem with localized initial data for a system of two pseudo-differential equations. We assume two small parameters in this formulation -- the lattice step and the size if the initial perturbation. We construct the asymptotic solution of the continuous Cauchy problem with respect to the size of perturbation.
  The ratio of the small parameters drastically affects the form of the solution. We consider two situations -- when the size of the perturbation is sufficiently large and when it is comparable with the lattice step. In each situations we provide analytical formulae for the asymptotic solution via Airy function.</description>
