      <title>Searching for Ultralight Scalar Dark Matter with Clocks in Low Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density of ultralight dark matter can be modified in the vicinity of macroscopic bodies when the dark matter possesses quadratic couplings to the Standard Model. If these couplings are sufficiently strong, Earth's atmosphere acts to shield the dark matter, thereby limiting the effectiveness of laboratory-based experiments. Experiments performed at altitudes exceeding the dark matter de Broglie wavelength experience the same orbit-averaged field amplitude as in the absence of scattering. Quantum clocks are capable of detecting variations in fundamental parameters due to the dark matter background. If based on the International Space Station, they are therefore well-suited to probe dark matter masses $m_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{-9} \text{\, eV}$. Moreover, when the dark matter de Broglie wavelength is smaller than Earth's radius ($m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{-10}$ eV), the dark matter profile around Earth exhibits a dipole feature. In Low Earth Orbits this dipole temporally modulates potential dark matter signals. This provides a powerful cross-check of the orbit-averaged effect and can enhance the sensitivity of these experiments. We find optical clocks could give rise to world-leading constraints in some cases. Orbiting nuclear clocks could probe even more of the parameter space inaccessible to ground-based experiments.</description>

      <title>UV cut-off of the Standard Model and proton decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-observation of proton decays as well as the smallness of the neutrino masses can naturally be explained by the accidental baryon and lepton number symmetry in the Standard Model, where the approximate symmetries are a consequence of the absence of the baryon or lepton number violating operators at the renormalizable level. The neutrino masses at sub-eV scales can be explained by the presence of the dimension-five, $\ell\ell HH/\Lambda$, term in the Lagrangian, suggesting that a more fundamental theory takes over beyond the energy scale $\Lambda$. We consider the possibility that the theory above the scale $\Lambda$ generates general higher dimensional operators with the flavor structure implied by the Yukawa interactions in the Standard Model. Such a set-up can be realized, for example, in the composite Higgs scenario with partial compositeness of fermions. The fermion masses and the neutrino masses are explained for $\Lambda \sim 10^{11}$GeV. The lifetime of proton in this scenario is, interestingly, consistent with the observed event of the $p \to \pi^0 \mu^+$ decay at the Super-Kamiokande experiment. The Hyper-Kamiokande experiments should see a large number of events soon after the data taking.</description>

      <title>Axial Anomaly, entanglement and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (pion) decays controlled by axial anomaly imply the specific entanglement between photons having also the counterparts for classical electromagnetic waves. This is also a specific case of Eisnstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm-Aharonov effect. The absence of causality and non-locality in (angular) momentum conservation is manifested, being especially clear for the generalization to the case of time rather than space separation corresponds to the polarization of dileptons described by time-like pion transition formfactors which may be studied experimentally. The similar decays in external magnetic field manifest the interplay with vacuum conductivity in external magnetic field and longitudinal polarization of vector mesons observed in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Universality of Gluon Saturation from Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universality of the color dipole amplitude is a cornerstone of high-energy Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). However, standard phenomenological approaches typically rely on rigid parametric ansatzes and often require ad-hoc geometric adjustments to reconcile inclusive and diffractive measurements. To resolve this tension, we introduce Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) employing a ``Teacher--Student'' strategy. The rigorous momentum-space Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution dynamics act as the ``Teacher,'' constraining the solution manifold, while the network ``Student'' is refined against inclusive HERA $F_2$ data. This approach extracts a model-independent dipole amplitude without assuming initial states. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this amplitude -- without parameter retuning or geometric rescaling -- successfully predicts exclusive $J/\psi$ photoproduction cross-sections. This zero-parameter prediction rigorously confirms the universality of the gluon saturation scale and establishes PINNs as a transformative paradigm for uncovering non-perturbative QCD structures.</description>

      <title>PanopTag: Simultaneously Tagging All Jets in a Particle Collision Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet tagging, identifying the origin of jets produced in particle collisions, is a critical classification task in high-energy physics. Despite the revolutionary impact of deep learning on jet tagging over the past decade, the paradigm has remained unchanged. In particular, jets are classified independently, one at a time. This single-jet approach ignores correlations, overlaps, and wider event context between jets. We introduce PanopTag, a new paradigm for jet tagging that departs from traditional single-jet tagging approaches. Rather than classifying jets independently, PanopTag simultaneously tags all jets by employing an encoder-decoder architecture that uses jet kinematics as queries to cross-attend to particle flow object embeddings. We evaluate PanopTag on heavy-flavor $(b/c)$-tagging and demonstrate remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art single-jet baselines that are only accessible by exploiting event-level features and correlations between jets.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Study of Lepton Number Violation in Rare $B$ and $K$ Meson Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study lepton-number-violating interactions at dimension seven in the Standard Model effective field theory that contribute to the meson decays $B \to K \nu \nu$ and $K \to \pi \nu \nu$. Such interactions could washout the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and also contribute to the neutrinoless double beta decay, even though the interactions involve a change in down-type quark flavors. We clarify conditions under which excesses in meson decay rates over the Standard Model predictions can be successfully observed. We also show that, although these interactions contribute to neutrino masses at the two-loop level, the Weinberg operator can be introduced consistently without spoiling the scenario.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Description of Light Dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dilatons, the CP-even pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons arising from spontaneous scale symmetry breaking, offer a compelling alternative to axion-like particles (ALPs) yet lack a comprehensive low-energy framework. We address this by constructing a systematic effective field theory (EFT) for the dilaton based on a manifestly scale-invariant regularization scheme. This approach derives universal linear couplings to the trace anomaly while preserving consistent renormalization group evolution. We establish a hierarchical EFT tower connecting the ultraviolet conformal sector to the infrared, encompassing the dilaton-extended SMEFT, low-energy EFT up to dimension-7, and a chiral Lagrangian describing meson and baryon interactions. We perform a comprehensive phenomenological analysis across two distinct mass regimes, where dilaton manifests as either conventional particle or wave-like particle. For MeV-scale dilatons behaving as conventional particles, we obtain constraints from LHC production, semi-invisible $B$- and $K$-meson decays, and supernova cooling. For ultralight dilatons acting as dark matter, we project sensitivities for atomic clocks and atom interferometers. This unified EFT framework would pave the way for extended phenomenological studies across the full mass spectrum of the light dilaton.</description>

      <title>Description of Charged\text{-}Particle Multiplicity Distributions in High\text{-}Energy Proton\text{-}Proton Collisions Based on a Two-Component Model and Examination of Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy proton-proton collisions at the LHC offer a stringent test of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the small-$x$, gluon-dominated regime. This study focus on a minimal, gluon-driven framework to describe the charged-particle multiplicities and their pseudorapidity densities in high energy collisions. The two-component model taken here includes the hard gluon-gluon fusion process and the soft quark recombination process, which directly relates to both integrated and unintegrated parton distributions. We begin by evolving Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) using the Modified Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (MD-DGLAP) equations. These PDFs are then converted into unintegrated PDFs (UPDFs) via the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin (KMR) scheme. The resulting PDFs and UPDFs are incorporated into the two-component model to predict the charged-particle pseudorapidity density $\left(1 / N_{\mathrm{ev}}\right) d N_{\mathrm{ch}} / d \eta$ in $pp$ collisions at LHC energies. Our predictions are compared to the data from the ATLAS experiment, revealing that the model effectively captures the features of the observed pseudorapidity distributions, despite its simplicity. Within this framework, the gluon-gluon fusion processes are found to dominate particle production for $\sqrt { s } \ge 9 0 0 \ \mathrm { GeV }$.These findings provide phenomenological support for MD-DGLAP-based PDFs and the associated small-$x$ gluon dynamics. Furthermore,a comparative analysis of results from alternative PDF sets--including CTEQ, MSHT, NNPDF, HERAPDF, and GRV--is performed, with particular focus on examining their consistency with the relative shapes of experiment data in the small-$x$ region.</description>

      <title>Flavour-Changing Neutral Current Top Decays in the Three Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study flavour-changing neutral current decays of the top quark in the democratic Three Higgs Doublet Model featuring a $Z_3$-symmetric scalar potential and Natural Flavour Conservation. In this framework, while such processes are absent at tree-level, the extended scalar sector induces new one-loop contributions to rare top decays. We compute the branching ratios for processes of the form $t \to q X$ (with $q = u, c$ and $X$ denoting a boson of the model), and explore the viable regions of the parameter space under theoretical consistency conditions and current experimental constraints. Several alignment-limit scenarios corresponding to different hierarchies among the CP-even Higgs states are analysed, and we find that the predicted branching ratios can significantly exceed their Standard Model expectations while remaining consistent with existing limits. In particular, we identify scenarios with light non-standard scalars that can lead to rates within the projected sensitivity of the High-Luminosity LHC. Our results therefore highlight rare top decays as a promising probe of the extended scalar sector of the Three Higgs Doublet Model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic geometry in hadron resonance gas model at real and imaginary baryon chemical potential and a simple sufficient condition for quark deconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic geometry of the hadron resonance gas model with (without) excluded volume effects (EVE) of baryons is investigated. The case with imaginary mu, where mu is the baryon chemical potential, is investigated as well as the one with real mu. We calculate the scalar curvature R and use the R=0 criterion to investigate the phase structure in the mu^2-T plane where T is the temperature. The curve on which R=0 continues analytically from the imaginary mu region, where the lattice QCD is feasible, to the real mu one. In the presence of EVE, there are rich phase structures in the large real mu region as well as the Roberge-Weiss like region where mu is imaginary and a singularity appears, while there is no phase structure in the large real $\mu$ region in the absence of EVE. The limitation temperature of the baryon gas is also obtained by using the baryon number fluctuation. The LQCD predicted critical point locates almost on the curve of the limitation temperature we determined. A simple sufficient condition, n_B&gt;1/(2v_B)$, is obtained for the quark deconfinement in the large real mu region, where n_B and v_B are the net baryon number density and the volume of a baryon, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Scattering Algebra of Physical Space: Squared Massive Constructive Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Algebra of Physical Space (APS) is used to explore the Constructive Standard Model (CSM) of particle physics. Namely, this paper connects the spinor formalism of the APS to massive amplitudes in the CSM. A novel equivalency between traditional CSM and APS-CSM formalisms is introduced, called the Scattering Algebra (SA), with example calculations confirming the consistency of results between both frameworks. Through this all, two significant insights are revealed: The identification of traditional CSM spin spinors with Lorentz rotors in the APS, and the connection of the CSM to various formalisms through ray spinor structure. The CSM's results are replicated in massive cases, showcasing the power of the index-free, matrix-free, coordinate-free, geometric approach and paving the way for future research into massless cases, amplitude-construction, and Wigner little group methods within the APS.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray electron boosted light dark matter: Implications of LZ 2025 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current multi-ton detectors put stringent constraints on the GeV-scale galactic dark matter, pushing the allowed cross-section almost towards the neutrino fog, yet remain mostly insensitive to the light dark matter. Cosmic rays can upscatter the non-relativistic halo dark matter particles, making a sub-population of them gain sufficient kinetic energy to be discernible in current direct search experiments. In this work, we explore this alternate strategy to probe sub-MeV electrophilic dark matter boosted by cosmic rays with the latest data of LZ 2025 (WS2024 run) and improve the constraint on the MeV scale dark matter by almost $\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ compared to the previous XENONnT limit for energy-independent cross-section. Using realistic energy-dependent cross-sections, we also analyse such a scenario, where the associated mediator mass plays a crucial role in governing the event rate and hence the expected limits too. With energy-dependent cross-sections, our obtained limits also remain stronger than the existing constraints from current direct detection experiments. Even compared to the limits from the neutrino detectors with a larger target size, LZ 2025 can put stringent constraints in certain parameter space of the mediator, excluding the previously unexplored regions.</description>

      <title>NLO QCD corrections to the electroweak production of a Higgs boson pair in the quark-antiquark channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higgs boson pair production in the massless quark-antiquark channel proceeds at leading order (LO) via electroweak boson loops. We calculate the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to this process. For the corresponding two-loop amplitudes, an analytic representation has been achieved. Even though the size of this contribution at the level of total cross sections is below 1% compared to the LO gluon channel, the effect on differential observables can be in the 10% range and therefore this contribution should be taken into account when comparing to LHC data.</description>

      <title>Dark energy driven by an oscillating generalised axion-like quintessence field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalised axion-like scalar fields provide a well-motivated framework for describing the late-time acceleration of the Universe. As the field evolves, it rolls down its potential and, depending on its mass and initial conditions, it may either still be approaching the minimum or already oscillating around it. These two dynamical regimes require distinct treatments of cosmological perturbations. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of linear cosmological perturbations in the regime where the dark-energy scalar field undergoes coherent oscillations about the minimum of its potential. We show that the standard effective fluid description breaks down in this phase and develop a consistent field-based perturbation framework, which we use to assess the impact of oscillatory dark energy on the growth of cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and Second Self-Force Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the conservative scattering angle and impulse for classical black hole scattering at fifth post-Minkowskian (5PM) order by providing the second self-force (2SF) contributions. This four-loop calculation involves non-planar Feynman integrals and requires advanced integration-by-parts reduction, novel differential-equation strategies, and efficient boundary-integral algorithms to solve a system of hundreds of master integrals in four integral families on high-performance computing systems. The resulting function space includes multiple polylogarithms as well as iterated integrals with a K3 period, which generate a spurious velocity divergence at $v/c=\sqrt{8}/3$. This divergence is present in the potential region and must be cancelled by conservative memory contributions from radiative regions. We find that the standard use of Feynman propagators to access the conservative sector fails to ensure this cancellation. We propose a conservative propagator prescription which realises both cancellations leading to a physically sensible answer. All available low-velocity checks of our result against the post-Newtonian literature are satisfied.</description>

      <title>When Primordial Black Holes Absorb During the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe in the presence of a surrounding thermal bath. By incorporating the effects of thermal absorption, we show that PBHs can undergo significant mass growth, leading to extended lifetimes and substantial deviations from the standard Hawking evaporation scenario. We find a critical collapse efficiency, $\gamma_{\rm c} \simeq 0.395$, above which the PBH mass grows without bound. This correction has profound implications for both PBH-induced reheating and dark matter (DM) production. Specifically, we find that the reheating temperature can be suppressed, and the DM parameter space for the PBH reheating scenario can undergo $\mathcal{O}(10)$-$\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ corrections, depending on the PBH formation mass and collapse efficiency. Moreover, our results significantly shift the parameter space in which PBHs can account for the entirety of the DM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive phenomenological study to incorporate thermal absorption into PBH evolution and quantify its impact on cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel approach to isotensor $\pi\pi\pi$ scattering from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to understand three-body dynamics from first-principle QCD includes the study of non-resonant and resonant systems. The isospin $I=2$ system is of particular interest having no three-body resonance but featuring a resonance in a sub-channel, while also being a coupled-channel problem. In this study, we calculate the finite-volume spectrum from lattice QC at two different pion masses, map the amplitude to the infinite volume through a generalized FVU three-body quantization condition, investigate the limit of a narrow $\rho$, and compare with an effective Lagrangian prediction at leading order. Chiral extrapolations between different pion masses are performed.</description>

      <title>Slow and fast collective neutrino oscillations: Invariants and reciprocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flavor evolution of a neutrino gas can show ''slow'' or ''fast'' collective motion. In terms of the usual Bloch vectors to describe the mean-field density matrices of a homogeneous neutrino gas, the slow two-flavor equations of motion (EOMs) are $\dot{\mathbf{P}}_\omega=(\omega\mathbf{B}+\mu\mathbf{P})\times\mathbf{P}_\omega$, where $\omega=\Delta m^2/2E$, $\mu=\sqrt{2} G_{\mathrm{F}} (n_\nu+n_{\bar\nu})$, $\mathbf{B}$ is a unit vector in the mass direction in flavor space, and $\mathbf{P}=\int d\omega\,\mathbf{P}_\omega$. For an axisymmetric angle distribution, the fast EOMs are $\dot{\mathbf{D}}_v=\mu(\mathbf{D}_0-v\mathbf{D}_1)\times\mathbf{D}_v$, where $\mathbf{D}_v$ is the Bloch vector for lepton number, $v=\cos\theta$ is the velocity along the symmetry axis, $\mathbf{D}_0=\int dv\,\mathbf{D}_v$, and $\mathbf{D}_1=\int dv\,v\mathbf{D}_v$. We discuss similarities and differences between these generic cases. Both systems can have pendulum-like instabilities (soliton solutions), both have similar Gaudin invariants, and both are integrable in the classical and quantum case. Describing fast oscillations in a frame comoving with $\mathbf{D}_1$ (which itself may execute pendulum-like motions) leads to transformed EOMs that are equivalent to an abstract slow system. These conclusions carry over to three flavors.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel experimental method for probing light dark matter candidates. We show that an electro-optical material's refractive index is modified in the presence of a coherently oscillating dark matter background. A high-precision resonant Michelson interferometer can be used to read out this signal. The proposed detection scheme allows for the exploration of an uncharted parameter space of dark matter candidates over a wide range of masses -- including masses exceeding a few tens of microelectronvolts, which is a challenging parameter space for microwave cavity haloscopes.</description>

Within the Standard Model, and using flavor-$SU(3)$ relations including first-order breaking corrections, these measurements lead to new predictions with regard to CP violation in $B^+\to J/\psi K^+$ and $B_s\to J/\psi\overline{K}{}^0$ decays, the difference between $S_{\psi K_S}$ and $\sin2\beta$, and the rate and CP asymmetries in $B_s\to J/\psi\pi^0$ decay.</description>

Abstract: We study lepton-flavor violation (LFV) effects occurring in the $e-\mu$ conversion in nuclei and in the rare radiative decays $\eta(\eta') \to \gamma \mu e$ of the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons with a special impact of the sub-GeV mass vector mediator (dark photon). In the case of the lepton conversion, we make estimates for running and future experiments operating with electron beams at fixed target. Obtained results are implemented in analysis of the LFV decays $\eta(\eta') \to \gamma \mu e$.</description>

      <title>Classification of Higgs sectors from group theoretical properties of UV gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended Higgs sectors are often introduced to explain phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM). The existence of multiple scalar fields may cause the Landau pole below the Planck scale. In this case, the low-energy theory may be replaced by an asymptotic-free gauge theory. In this paper, we consider an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge theory with confinement as such an ultraviolet theory of the extended Higgs sectors. We investigate the relation between scalar particle contents at the low energy and group theoretical properties of fundamental fermions of the gauge theory. We find that particle contents of various extended Higgs sectors previously proposed to explain the BSM problems are deduced by each charge assignment of flavor symmetry of the fundamental fermions of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge symmetry. Our findings may provide a new picture for the ultraviolet completion of the extended Higgs sectors.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetry analysis of the two-Higgs-doublet model field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply Lie symmetry analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs) to the Euler-Lagrange equations of the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), to determine its scalar Lie point symmetries. A Lie point symmetry is a structure-preserving transformation of the spacetime variables and the fields of the model, which is also continuous and connected to the identity. Symmetries of PDEs may, in general, be divided into strict variational, divergence and non-variational symmetries, where the first two are collectively referred to as variational symmetries. Variational symmetries are usually preserved under quantization, and variational Lie symmetries yield conservation laws. We demonstrate that there are no scalar Lie point divergence symmetries or non-variational Lie point symmetries in the 2HDM, and re-derive its well-known strict variational Lie point symmetries, thus confirming the consistency of our implementation of Lie's method. Moreover, we prove three general results that may simplify Lie symmetry calculations for a wide class of particle physics models. Lie symmetry analysis of PDEs is broadly applicable for determining Lie symmetries. As demonstrated in this work, the method can be applied to models with many variables, parameters, and reparametrization freedom, while any missing discrete symmetries can be identified through the automorphism groups of the resulting Lie symmetry algebras.</description>

Abstract: We present an analysis of six differential cross-section measurements of top-quark pair production in the dilepton channel from the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The data are compared to state-of-the-art QCD predictions with and without the inclusion of toponium formation effects. This contribution is modelled via a re-weighting of fixed-order matrix elements using the Green's function of the non-relativistic QCD Hamiltonian, and we employ a statistical model to quantify the preference of the data for the toponium hypothesis. All observables yield Bayes factors larger than unity, with two exceeding 20, yielding strong evidence for the toponium hypothesis in top-quark pair production at the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hadronic scalar molecules $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ with asymmetric quark contents $bb \overline{b}\overline{c}$ and $cc \overline{c} \overline{b}$ are explored by means of the QCD sum rule method. Their masses and current couplings are calculated using the two-point sum rule approach. The obtained results show that they are strong-interaction unstable particles and transform to ordinary mesons' pairs. The molecule $\mathcal{M} _{b}$ dissociates through the process $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{b}}\to \eta _{b}B_{c}^{-}$. The decays $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{c}}\rightarrow \eta _{c}B_{c}^{+}$ and $J/\psi B_{c}^{\ast +}$ are dominant modes for the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{c}$. The full decay widths of the molecules $\mathcal{ \ M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ are estimated using these decay channels, as well as ones generated by the annihilation of $b\overline{b}$ and $c \overline{c}$ quarks in $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$, respectively. The QCD three-point sum rule method is employed to find partial widths all of these channels. This approach is required to evaluate the strong couplings at the molecule-meson-meson vertices under consideration. The mass $m=(15728 \pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[ \mathcal{M}_b] =(93 \pm 17)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ , and $\widetilde{m}=(9712 \pm 72)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_c] =(70 \pm 10)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ in the case of $\mathcal{M}_{c} $ offer valuable guidance for experimental searches at existing facilities.</description>

We study the impact of such mixed QCD$\otimes$QED resummed contributions on top of pure QCD corrections, finding percent-level effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the world's largest $\psi(3686)$ data sample, the BESIII Collaboration recently reported a substructure near the $\pi^+\pi^-$ mass threshold in the decay $\psi(3686) \to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$, challenging the established understanding of the di-pion invariant mass spectrum. We propose that this substructure arises directly from di-pion correlations. Using a chiral unitary approach, we successfully reproduce the observed anomaly, thereby providing strong evidence of di-pion correlation in heavy quarkonium decays. This approach also allows us to predict the corresponding di-pion correlation function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive general formulas for three flavor fractions $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ of the high-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}_e , f^{}_\mu , f^{}_\tau)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and diagnose a potential divergence associated with $\eta^{}_\mu$ and $\eta^{}_\tau$ as an unavoidable consequence of the $\mu$-$\tau$ interchange symmetry exhibiting in the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$. We present a complete set of analytical expressions for $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ as functions of two typical $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry breaking parameters in the standard parametrization of $U$, and apply it to the recent IceCube all-sky neutrino flux data ranging from 5 TeV to 10 PeV in the assumption that the relevant sources have a common flavor composition. We also explain why only $\eta^{}_e$ and $\eta^{}_\mu + \eta^{}_\tau$ can be extracted from a precision measurement of $f^{}_e$ and $f^{}_\mu = f^{}_\tau$ in the exact $\mu$-$\tau$ flavor symmetry limit.</description>

      <title>Charged Higgs Pairs at the LHC: A NLO Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged Higgs-boson pair production at hadron colliders yields information about the trilinear couplings involving charged Higgs fields in extensions of the Standard Model (SM). We consider the type-I two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) extension and obtain next-to-leading order QCD predictions for the charged-Higgs pair production ($H^+H^-$ production). All production modes, i.e. Drell--Yan-like production, gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion are included in the analysis. We determine uncertainties originating from the scale dependence, the parton-density functions and strong coupling $\alpha_s$ at the LHC. We observe that the QCD corrections lead to a significant reduction of the relative scale dependences. These improved predictions will allow for a quantitative interpretation of experimental measurements, in case that charged Higgs states will be observed.</description>

      <title>GeV-scale QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to solve the strong CP problem, we study the possibility that the Peccei--Quinn symmetry is broken {\it below}\/ the QCD scale. We find that a QCD axion can be above GeV, and may be among the observed $\eta$ resonances. It is immune to quantum gravity corrections. The only fermion that has a $U(1)$ Peccei--Quinn charge is the right-handed up quark. Flavor-changing neutral currents are surprisingly small. All accelerator and astrophysical limits can be evaded. The most significant constraint is the mass splitting between $\pi^\pm$ and $\pi^0$. In a UV completed model, LHC can look for a heavy quark pair ${\cal D} \overline{\cal D}$ followed by the decay ${\cal D} \rightarrow W+u$ or a single production $q u \rightarrow q\, {\cal U}$ followed by ${\cal U} \rightarrow u Z, uh$. There can be an $O(1)$ contribution $h \rightarrow u\bar{u}\varphi$ in the measurement of $h \rightarrow gg$ or permille effects on the hadronic $Z$ width at a Higgs factory.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of a double dilaton soft-wall model: Alpha strong from Ricci flow and pion Form Factors at intermediate-energy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through a holographic model of QCD, we present a phenomenological approach to study the running of the strong coupling constant \alpha_s in both non-perturbative and perturbative regimes. The renormalization of the metric tensor, driven by the Ricci Flow, and the breaking of conformal and chiral symmetries -- thanks to introducing a double dilaton model and large-$N_c$ corrections -- allow us to relate the existence of an infrared fixed point in the coupling constant with a smooth matching to pQCD well above 2 GeV. This is done through a model with two fit parameters and one matching point. The proposed dilaton model yields linear Regge trajectories and decay constants for scalar, vector, and tensor meson families similar to their experimental counterparts. We finally study neutral and charged pion form factors to show an application of the running coupling constant obtained.</description>

      <title>LISA double white dwarf binaries as Galactic accelerometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are among the guaranteed sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector. Most DWDs in the LISA band are far from merging and emit quasimonochromatic GWs. As these sources are distributed throughout the Milky Way, they experience different accelerations in the Galactic gravitational potential, and therefore each DWD exhibits an apparent GW frequency chirp due to differential acceleration between the source and LISA. We examine how Galactic acceleration influences parameter estimation for these sources; and investigate how LISA observations could provide insight into the distribution of matter in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger model from Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first-principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Inflationary attractors and radiative corrections in light of ACT data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of the recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which have provided a notable shift in the constraints on $(n_s, r)$ and placed several otherwise viable models of inflation in tension with the latest data, we investigate the possible effects that radiative corrections can have on $\xi$-attractor and $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation. These models, which share much in common with Starobinsky inflation, have likewise been put under pressure by these results. We find that percent (and even sub-percent) level radiative corrections can easily shift both of these classes of inflation models comfortably into the regions of parameter space favoured by the most recent constraints. However, the flexibility under such corrections calls into question to what extent it is possible to precisely pin down model-specific predictions for important cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on Neutrino Masses in a Second-Order CPL Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI results indicate a strong preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) when baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We analyze the exponential (EXP) parameterization, which introduces a second-order correction to CPL. We determine and compare the 95% upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses for three dark energy (DE) models -- $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and EXP -- across four neutrino mass hierarchies (1 massive/2 massless, degenerate, normal, inverted) and multiple dataset combinations (CMB$+$BAO, CMB$+$BAO$+$PantheonPlus, CMB$+$BAO$+$DESY5), employing both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks with physical lower limits from oscillation experiments (0.059 eV and 0.11 eV). Our results show that CPL yields tighter ($\lesssim10$%) bounds compared to EXP. We further confirm earlier findings that neutrino mass constraints are only mildly sensitive to the assumed hierarchy and that the frequentist bounds are tighter than Bayesian ones. Furthermore, the imposed oscillation lower limits, the datasets used and the DE parameterizations play a crucial role in the inferred cosmological neutrino mass bounds. For the datasets, hierarchies, and DE parameterizations considered, we find no statistically significant evidence for nonzero neutrino mass consistent with oscillation lower limits.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratio method in three-dimensional Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By performing Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model, we apply the recently proposed Lee-Yang-zero ratio (LYZR) method to determine the location of the critical point in this model. We demonstrate that the LYZR method is as powerful as the conventional Binder-cumulant method in studying the critical point, while the LYZR method has the advantage of suppressing the violation of the finite-size scaling and non-linearity near the critical point. We also achieve a precise determination of the values of the LYZRs at the critical point, which are universal numbers. In addition, we propose an alternative method that uses only a single Lee-Yang zero and show that it is also useful for the search for the critical point.</description>

      <title>21 cm forest one-dimensional power spectrum as an indirect probe of dark matter particles and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark matter (DM) particles remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Current cosmological research on these phenomena primarily utilizes cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and other late-time probes, which predominantly focus on large scales. We introduce a novel probe, the 21 cm forest signal, which can be used to investigate DM properties on small scales during the epoch of reionization, thereby addressing the gap left by other cosmological probes. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from PBHs, can heat the intergalactic medium (IGM). This heating suppresses the amplitude of the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. Therefore, the 1D power spectrum provides an effective method for constraining DM properties. However, astrophysical heating processes in the early universe can also affect the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. In this work, we assess the potential of using the SKA to observe the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum for constraining DM properties, under the assumption that astrophysical heating can be constrained reliably by other independent probes. Under low astrophysical heating conditions, the 1D power spectrum could constrain the DM annihilation cross section and decay lifetime to $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim {10^{-31}}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim {10^{30}}\,{\rm s}$ for ${10}\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles, and probe PBHs with masses $\sim {10^{15}}\,{\rm\,g}$ at abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-13}$. These constraints represent improvements of 5-6 orders of magnitude over current limits. Furthermore, the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum has the potential to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe PBHs with masses above $10^{18}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes.</description>

Abstract: We unveil the dynamical equivalence of field theories with non-canonical kinetic terms and canonical theories with a volume element invariant under transverse diffeomorphisms. The proof of the equivalence also reveals a subtle connection between the standard Legendre transformation and the so-called Clairaut equation. Explicit examples of canonizable theories include classes of $k$-essence, non-linear electrodynamics, or $f(R)$ theories. The equivalence can also be extended to the class of mimetic theories.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking neutrino-nucleus quasielastic scattering model predictions against a missing energy profile obtained using a monoenergetic neutrino beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine three exclusive nuclear ground state shell models implemented in the NEUT neutrino event generator and benchmark them against the recent JSNS$^2$ measurement of missing energy using a monoenergetic neutrino source. The nature of the measurement allows a detailed investigation of nuclear ground-state modeling using a neutrino source, and gives access to a direct measurement of the neutron spectral function in a $^{12}$C nucleus. The NEUT intranuclear cascade and nuclear deexcitation \textsc{NucDeEx} are used to simulate inelastic final-state interactions and nuclear deexcitations respectively. We find that the spectral function (SF) models perform better than relativistic mean field models in modeling both the ground state and the tail of the missing energy distribution when the NEUT cascade and nuclear excitation channels are turned on. We also find that taking into account the missing energy threshold for single nucleon knockout interactions results in all nuclear models being accepted based on the obtained $p$-values.</description>
