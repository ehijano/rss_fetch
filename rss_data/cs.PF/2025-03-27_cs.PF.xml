      <title>Cloud Resource Allocation with Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a convex optimization framework for overcoming the limitations of Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler by intelligently allocating diverse cloud resources while minimizing costs and fragmentation. Current Kubernetes scaling mechanisms are restricted to homogeneous scaling of existing node types, limiting cost-performance optimization possibilities. Our matrix-based model captures resource demands, costs, and capacity constraints in a unified mathematical framework. A key contribution is our logarithmic approximation to the indicator function, which enables dynamic node type selection while maintaining problem convexity. Our approach balances cost optimization with operational complexity through interior-point methods. Experiments with real-world Kubernetes workloads demonstrate reduced costs and improved resource utilization compared to conventional Cluster Autoscaler strategies that can only scale up or down existing node pools.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Chain-of-Thought Metadata for Task Routing and Adversarial Prompt Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a metric called Number of Thoughts (NofT) to determine the difficulty of tasks pre-prompting and support Large Language Models (LLMs) in production contexts. By setting thresholds based on the number of thoughts, this metric can discern the difficulty of prompts and support more effective prompt routing. A 2% decrease in latency is achieved when routing prompts from the MathInstruct dataset through quantized, distilled versions of Deepseek with 1.7 billion, 7 billion, and 14 billion parameters. Moreover, this metric can be used to detect adversarial prompts used in prompt injection attacks with high efficacy. The Number of Thoughts can inform a classifier that achieves 95% accuracy in adversarial prompt detection. Our experiments ad datasets used are available on our GitHub page: https://github.com/rymarinelli/Number_Of_Thoughts/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Arm DynamIQ Shared Unit and Real-Time: An Empirical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of embedded hardware platforms poses significant challenges for real-time workloads. Architectural features such as Intel RDT, Arm QoS, and Arm MPAM are either unavailable on commercial embedded platforms or designed primarily for server environments optimized for average-case performance and might fail to deliver the expected real-time guarantees. Arm DynamIQ Shared Unit (DSU) includes isolation features-among others, hardware per-way cache partitioning-that can improve the real-time guarantees of complex embedded multicore systems and facilitate real-time analysis. However, the DSU also targets average cases, and its real-time capabilities have not yet been evaluated. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of three real-world deployments of the Arm DSU on Rockchip RK3568, Rockchip RK3588, and NVIDIA Orin platforms. We integrate support for the DSU at the operating system and hypervisor level and conduct a large-scale evaluation using both synthetic and real-world benchmarks with varying types and intensities of interference. Our results make extensive use of performance counters and indicate that, although effective, the quality of partitioning and isolation provided by the DSU depends on the type and the intensity of the interfering workloads. In addition, we uncover and analyze in detail the correlation between benchmarks and different types and intensities of interference.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Orchestration for Large-Scale Inference on Heterogeneous Accelerator Systems Balancing Cost, Performance, and Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surge in generative AI workloads has created a need for scalable inference systems that can flexibly harness both GPUs and specialized accelerators while containing operational costs. This paper proposes a hardware-agnostic control loop that adaptively allocates requests across heterogeneous accelerators based on real-time cost and capacity signals. The approach sustains low latency and high throughput by dynamically shifting between cost-optimized and capacity-optimized modes, ensuring the most efficient use of expensive compute resources under fluctuating availability. Evaluated using the Stable Diffusion model, the framework consistently meets latency targets, automatically redirects traffic during capacity shortfalls, and capitalizes on lower-cost accelerators when possible. These results highlight how a feedback-driven deployment strategy, spanning the entire software and hardware stack, can help organizations efficiently scale generative AI workloads while maintaining resilience in the face of limited accelerator capacity.</description>
