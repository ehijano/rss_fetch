      <title>Iterative Annealing Mechanism for Protein and RNA Chaperones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular chaperones are machines that consume copious amount of ATP to drive misfolded proteins or RNA to fold into functionally competent native states. Because the folding landscapes of biomolecules with complex native state topology are rugged consisting of multiple minima that are separated by large free energy barriers, folding occurs by the kinetic partitioning mechanism according to which only a small fraction of the molecules reach the folded state in biologically viable times. The rescue of such proteins and RNA require chaperones. Although the protein and RNA chaperones are profoundly different in their structure and action, the principles underlying their activity to produce the folded structures can be understood using a unified theoretical framework based on iterative annealing mechanism (IAM). Our theory shows that both these machines have evolved to the maximize the production of the steady state yield on biological times. Strikingly, theory predicts that only at a moderate level of RNA chaperone activity is the yield of the self-splicing pre-RNA is maximized in \textit{in vivo}.</description>

      <title>Decision-making in light-trapped slime molds involves active mechanical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making is the process of selecting an action among alternatives, allowing biological and artificial systems to navigate complex environments and optimize behavior. While neural systems rely on neuron-based sensory processing and evaluation, decision-making also occurs in organisms without a centralized organizing unit, such as the unicellular slime mold \textit{Physarum polycephalum}. Unlike neural systems, P. polycephalum relies on rhythmic peristaltic contractions to drive internal flows and redistribute mass, allowing it to adapt to its environment. However, while previous studies have focused on the outcomes of these decisions, the underlying mechanical principles that govern this mass relocation remain unknown. Here, we investigate the exploration process of P. polycephalum confined by blue light into polygonal shapes up to its escape. While the escape occurs along the longest axis of the polygones, independent of confinement shape, the exploration process prior to escape extends protrusions almost everywhere around a shape boundary. We find protrusions to align with the direction of peristaltic contraction waves driving mass relocation. Mapping out contraction modes during exploration in detail we observe an ongoing switching between different dominant principle contraction modes. Only over the course of time does the organism ultimately settle on the contraction mode most efficient for transport, which coincides with the escape. Thus, we find that only harsh environmental confinement triggers optimal behaviour which is reached by long time re-organization of the flow patterns. Our findings provide insights into the mechanics of decision-making in non-neuronal organisms, shedding light on how decentralized systems process environmental constraints to drive adaptive behavior.</description>

      <title>Hopfield Networks as Models of Emergent Function in Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopfield models, originally developed to study memory retrieval in neural networks, have become versatile tools for modeling diverse biological systems in which function emerges from collective dynamics. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to both classical and modern Hopfield networks from a biophysical perspective. After presenting the underlying mathematics, we build physical intuition through three complementary interpretations of Hopfield dynamics: as noise discrimination, as a geometric construction defining a natural coordinate system in pattern space, and as gradient-like descent on an energy landscape. We then survey recent applications of Hopfield networks a variety of biological setting including cellular differentiation and epigenetic memory, molecular self-assembly, and spatial neural representations.</description>

      <title>Chirality across scales in tissue dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral processes that lack mirror symmetry pervade nature from enantioselective molecular interactions to the asymmetric development of organisms. An outstanding challenge at the interface between physics and biology consists in bridging the multiple scales between microscopic and macroscopic chirality. Here, we combine theory, experiments and modern inference algorithms to study a paradigmatic example of dynamic chirality transfer across scales: the generation of tissue-scale flows from subcellular forces. The distinctive properties of our microscopic graph model and the corresponding coarse-grained viscoelasticity are that (i) net cell proliferation is spatially inhomogeneous and (ii) cellular dynamics cannot be expressed as an energy gradient. To overcome the general challenge of inferring microscopic model parameters from noisy high-dimensional data, we develop a nudged automatic differentiation algorithm (NADA) that can handle large fluctuations in cell positions observed in single tissue snapshots. This data-calibrated microscopic model quantitatively captures proliferation-driven tissue flows observed at large scales in our experiments on fibroblastoma cell cultures. Beyond chirality, our inference algorithm can be used to extract interpretable graph models from limited amounts of noisy data of living and inanimate cellular systems such as networks of convection cells and flowing foams.</description>

      <title>Upper bound for the stability of Boolean networks</title>

Abstract: Boolean networks, inspired by gene regulatory networks, were developed to understand the complex behaviors observed in biological systems, with network attractors corresponding to biological phenotypes or cell types. In this article, we present a proof for a conjecture by Williadsen, Triesch and Wiles about upper bounds for the stability of basins of attraction in Boolean networks. We further extend this result from a single basin of attraction to the entire network. Specifically, we demonstrate that the asymptotic upper bound for the robustness and the basin entropy of a Boolean network are negatively linearly related.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal interactions reshape cells in a model for symbiosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shape of a cell influences and it is influenced by interactions with its neighbouring partners. Here, we introduce a coarse-grained model of non-reciprocal interactions between single-cell organisms to study emergent morphologies during symbiotic association. We show that the cell membrane can be remodelled into branched protrusions, invaginations, transient blebs and other dynamical phases that depend on the number of interacting partners, the asymmetry, and the magnitude of partnership activity. Our model finds a dynamical feedback between the local deformation of the membrane and its driving force, leading to morphologies not accessible to reciprocal systems.</description>

      <title>A Macroscopically Consistent Reactive Langevin Dynamics Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion (PBSRD) models are a popular approach for capturing stochasticity in reaction and transport processes across biological systems. In some contexts, the overdamped approximation inherent in such models may be inappropriate, necessitating the use of more microscopic Langevin Dynamics models for spatial transport. In this work we develop a novel particle-based Reactive Langevin Dynamics (RLD) model, with a focus on deriving reactive interaction kernels that are consistent with the physical constraint of detailed balance of reactive fluxes at equilibrium. We demonstrate that, to leading order, the overdamped limit of the resulting RLD model corresponds to the volume reactivity PBSRD model, of which the well-known Doi model is a particular instance. Our work provides a step towards systematically deriving PBSRD models from more microscopic reaction models, and suggests possible constraints on the latter to ensure consistency between the two physical scales.</description>

      <title>Cell size heterogeneity controls crystallization of the developing fruit fly wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental question in Biology is to understand how patterns and shapes emerge from the collective interplay of large numbers of cells. Cells forming two-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo remodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model system, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions from a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate biophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous studies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell packing in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the fruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We propose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which is quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of epithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size polydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which they form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that cell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed dynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering kinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does not control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale ordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.</description>

      <title>Active nematic response to a deformable body or boundary: elastic deformations and anchoring-induced flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A body immersed in a nematic liquid crystal disturbs the fluid's preferred molecular configuration and increases its stored elastic energy. In an active nematic, the fluid components also generate a stress in the bulk fluid. By introducing either an immersed body or boundary, a large scale flow can be triggered due to anchoring boundary conditions alone -- a global pressure built by active stresses at equilibrium is instantly released everywhere. The fluid then imposes viscous, elastic, and active stresses on such surfaces which, if compliant, may result in a surface deformation. We study the deformations and stresses of a linearly elastic body placed in an active nematic in two dimensions. Using complex variables techniques, exact expressions for the fluid flow, director field, surface tractions, and body deformation are derived. Qualitative differences between elastic and active stress-driven deformations are identified, depending on an active Ericksen number, anchoring conditions, and body material properties, thereby suggesting a new method for measuring mechanical stresses in active anisotropic environments. Flow profiles, external confinement, and anchoring-induced stirring are also addressed.</description>
