      <title>Can GNNs Learn Link Heuristics? A Concise Review and Evaluation of Link Prediction Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the ability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in learning various forms of information for link prediction, alongside a brief review of existing link prediction methods. Our analysis reveals that GNNs cannot effectively learn structural information related to the number of common neighbors between two nodes, primarily due to the nature of set-based pooling of the neighborhood aggregation scheme. Also, our extensive experiments indicate that trainable node embeddings can improve the performance of GNN-based link prediction models. Importantly, we observe that the denser the graph, the greater such the improvement. We attribute this to the characteristics of node embeddings, where the link state of each link sample could be encoded into the embeddings of nodes that are involved in the neighborhood aggregation of the two nodes in that link sample. In denser graphs, every node could have more opportunities to attend the neighborhood aggregation of other nodes and encode states of more link samples to its embedding, thus learning better node embeddings for link prediction. Lastly, we demonstrate that the insights gained from our research carry important implications in identifying the limitations of existing link prediction methods, which could guide the future development of more robust algorithms.</description>

      <title>Generative AI may backfire for counterspeech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14986v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online hate speech poses a serious threat to individual well-being and societal cohesion. A promising solution to curb online hate speech is counterspeech. Counterspeech is aimed at encouraging users to reconsider hateful posts by direct replies. However, current methods lack scalability due to the need for human intervention or fail to adapt to the specific context of the post. A potential remedy is the use of generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to write tailored counterspeech messages. In this paper, we analyze whether contextualized counterspeech generated by state-of-the-art LLMs is effective in curbing online hate speech. To do so, we conducted a large-scale, pre-registered field experiment (N=2,664) on the social media platform Twitter/X. Our experiment followed a 2x2 between-subjects design and, additionally, a control condition with no counterspeech. On the one hand, users posting hateful content on Twitter/X were randomly assigned to receive either (a) contextualized counterspeech or (b) non-contextualized counterspeech. Here, the former is generated through LLMs, while the latter relies on predefined, generic messages. On the other hand, we tested two counterspeech strategies: (a) promoting empathy and (b) warning about the consequences of online misbehavior. We then measured whether users deleted their initial hateful posts and whether their behavior changed after the counterspeech intervention (e.g., whether users adopted a less toxic language). We find that non-contextualized counterspeech employing a warning-of-consequence strategy significantly reduces online hate speech. However, contextualized counterspeech generated by LLMs proves ineffective and may even backfire.</description>

      <title>Social Media Algorithms Can Shape Affective Polarization via Exposure to Antidemocratic Attitudes and Partisan Animosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is widespread concern about the negative impacts of social media feed ranking algorithms on political polarization. Leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we develop an approach to re-rank feeds in real-time to test the effects of content that is likely to polarize: expressions of antidemocratic attitudes and partisan animosity (AAPA). In a preregistered 10-day field experiment on X/Twitter with 1,256 consented participants, we increase or decrease participants' exposure to AAPA in their algorithmically curated feeds. We observe more positive outparty feelings when AAPA exposure is decreased and more negative outparty feelings when AAPA exposure is increased. Exposure to AAPA content also results in an immediate increase in negative emotions, such as sadness and anger. The interventions do not significantly impact traditional engagement metrics such as re-post and favorite rates. These findings highlight a potential pathway for developing feed algorithms that mitigate affective polarization by addressing content that undermines the shared values required for a healthy democracy.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Innovation in Open Source Software Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software libraries are the elementary building blocks of open source software ecosystems, extending the capabilities of programming languages beyond their standard libraries. Although ecosystem health is often quantified using data on libraries and their interdependencies, we know little about the rate at which new libraries are developed and used. Here we study imports of libraries in 12 different programming language ecosystems within millions of Stack Overflow posts over a 15 year period. New libraries emerge at a remarkably predictable sub-linear rate within ecosystems per post. As a consequence, the distribution of the frequency of use of libraries in all ecosystems is highly concentrated: the most widely used libraries are used many times more often than the average. Although new libraries come out more slowly over time, novel combinations of libraries appear at an approximately linear rate, suggesting that recombination is a key innovation process in software. Newer users are more likely to use new libraries and new combinations, and we find significant variation in the rates of innovation between countries. Our work links the evolution of OSS ecosystems to the literature on the dynamics of innovation, revealing how ecosystems grow and highlighting implications for sustainability.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLM Prompts for Data Augmentation in Multi-label Classification of Ecological Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, improving the understanding, generation, and manipulation of human language across domains such as translating, summarizing, and classifying text. Previous studies have demonstrated that instruction-based LLMs can be effectively utilized for data augmentation to generate diverse and realistic text samples. This study applied prompt-based data augmentation to detect mentions of green practices in Russian social media. Detecting green practices in social media aids in understanding their prevalence and helps formulate recommendations for scaling eco-friendly actions to mitigate environmental issues. We evaluated several prompts for augmenting texts in a multi-label classification task, either by rewriting existing datasets using LLMs, generating new data, or combining both approaches. Our results revealed that all strategies improved classification performance compared to the models fine-tuned only on the original dataset, outperforming baselines in most cases. The best results were obtained with the prompt that paraphrased the original text while clearly indicating the relevant categories.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Expected Influence Capacities of Nodes in Complex Networks under the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.02324v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, epidemic modeling in complex networks has found many applications, including modeling of information or gossip spread in online social networks, modeling of malware spread in communication networks, and the most recent model of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the information disseminated is accurate, for example, maximizing its distribution is desirable, whereas if it is a rumor or a virus, its spread should be minimized. In this context, it is very important to identify super-spreaders that maximize or minimize propagation. Lately, studies for detecting super-spreaders have gained momentum. Most of the studies carried out aim to distinguish the influences of nodes under a specific propagation model (such as SIR) using network centrality measures and subsequently, to rank the nodes accordingly. However, in this study, we developed an algorithm that approximates the expected influence of nodes under the popular SIR model. By considering the behavior of the SIR model and only the shortest paths between nodes, the algorithm ranks the nodes according to this approximated value. Our developed algorithm is named the Expected Value Estimation (EVE). We compared the performance of EVE, using different SIR settings on real datasets, with that of many current well-known centrality measures. The experimental studies demonstrated that the solution quality (ranking capability) of EVE is superior to that of its competitors.</description>

      <title>Structural Group Unfairness: Measurement and Mitigation by means of the Effective Resistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social networks contribute to the distribution of social capital, defined as the relationships, norms of trust and reciprocity within a community or society that facilitate cooperation and collective action. Therefore, better positioned members in a social network benefit from faster access to diverse information and higher influence on information dissemination. A variety of methods have been proposed in the literature to measure social capital at an individual level. However, there is a lack of methods to quantify social capital at a group level, which is particularly important when the groups are defined on the grounds of protected attributes. To fill this gap, we propose to measure the social capital of a group of nodes by means of the effective resistance and emphasize the importance of considering the entire network topology. Grounded in spectral graph theory, we introduce three effective resistance-based measures of group social capital, namely group isolation, group diameter and group control, where the groups are defined according to the value of a protected attribute. We denote the social capital disparity among different groups in a network as structural group unfairness, and propose to mitigate it by means of a budgeted edge augmentation heuristic that systematically increases the social capital of the most disadvantaged group. In experiments on real-world networks, we uncover significant levels of structural group unfairness when using gender as the protected attribute, with females being the most disadvantaged group in comparison to males. We also illustrate how our proposed edge augmentation approach is able to not only effectively mitigate the structural group unfairness but also increase the social capital of all groups in the network.</description>

      <title>Important node identification for complex networks based on improved Electre Multi-Attribute fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influence maximization problem involves selecting a subset of seed nodes within a social network to maximize information spread under a given diffusion model, so how to identify the important nodes is the problem to be considered in this paper. Due to the great differences in the reality of the network, a class of multi-attribute decision fusion methods is often used to solve this problem. Electre is mostly used to solve the problems of investment order, benefit, and risk assessment of projects in economics, which supports the decision maker to make choices by comparing the differences between a set of alternatives. In this paper, we propose a multi-attribute decision fusion method named SK-E, which construct local and global metrics for different networks, use the improved Electre to make decision fusion between local and global metrics of nodes, to get the optimal weight between local and global metrics, and then identify the important nodes. The proposed method demonstrates superior accuracy compared to other methods, as evaluated through three experiments: the SIR epidemic model, the independent cascade model, and constraint efficiency. These experiments were conducted across six different real networks selected as the experimental dataset.</description>

      <title>Characterizing User Archetypes and Discussions on Scored.co</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the proliferation of social platforms has drastically transformed the way individuals interact, organize, and share information. In this scenario, we experience an unprecedented increase in the scale and complexity of interactions and, at the same time, little to no research about some fringe social platforms. In this paper, we present a multi-dimensional framework for characterizing nodes and hyperedges in social hypernetworks, with a focus on the understudied alt-right platform Scored.co. Our approach integrates the possibility of studying higher-order interactions, thanks to the hypernetwork representation, and various node features such as user activity, sentiment, and toxicity, with the aim to define distinct user archetypes and understand their roles within the network. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Scored.co, we analyze the dynamics of these archetypes over time and explore their interactions and influence within the community. The framework's versatility allows for detailed analysis of both individual user behaviors and broader social structures. Our findings highlight the importance of higher-order interactions in understanding social dynamics, offering new insights into the roles and behaviors that emerge in complex online environments.</description>

      <title>Market Reaction to News Flows in Supply Chain Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how positive and negative news about firms affects their stock prices and, moreover, how it affects stock prices of the firms' suppliers and clients, using a large sample of publicly listed firms around the world and another of Japanese listed firms. The level of positiveness and negativeness of each news article is determined by FinBERT, a natural language processing model fine-tuned specifically for financial information. Supply chains of firms across the world are identified mostly by financial statements, while those of Japanese firms are taken from large-scale firm-level surveys. We find that positive news increases the change rate of stock prices of firms mentioned in the news before its disclosure, most likely because of diffusion of information through private channels. Positive news also raises stock prices of the firms' suppliers and clients before its disclosure, confirming propagation of market values through supply chains. In addition, we generally find a larger post-news effect on stock prices of the mentioned firms and their suppliers and clients than the pre-news effect. The positive difference between the post- and pre-news effects can be considered as the net effect of the disclosure of positive news, controlling for information diffusion through private channels. However, the post-news effect on suppliers and clients in Japan is smaller than the pre-news effect, which is the opposite result to non-domestic firms from around the world.</description>

      <title>Assessing Response Disparities in California Wildland-Urban-Interface (WUI) Cities Using the Compartmental Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires pose significant risks to communities, infrastructure, and the environment, especially in Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) areas. Effective disaster management requires understanding how the public perceives and responds to wildfire threats in real-time. This study uses social media data to assess public responses and explores how these responses are linked to city-level community characteristics. Specifically, we leveraged a transformer-based topic modeling technique called BERTopic to identify wildfire response-related topics and then utilized the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to compute two key metrics associated with wildfire responses - awareness and resilience indicators. Additionally, we used GIS-based spatial analysis to map wildfire locations along with four groups of city-level factors (racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, demographic, and wildfire-specific). Our findings reveal significant geographic and socio-spatial differences in public responses. Southern California cities with larger Hispanic populations demonstrate higher wildfire awareness and resilience. In contrast, urbanized regions in Central and Northern California exhibit lower awareness levels. Furthermore, resilience is negatively correlated with unemployment rates, particularly in southern regions where higher unemployment aligns with reduced resilience. These findings highlight the need for targeted and equitable wildfire management strategies to improve the adaptive capacity of WUI communities.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Top-k Hyperedge Triplets: Models and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems frequently exhibit multi-way, rather than pairwise, interactions. These group interactions cannot be faithfully modeled as collections of pairwise interactions using graphs and instead require hypergraphs. However, methods that analyze hypergraphs directly, rather than via lossy graph reductions, remain limited. Hypergraph motifs hold promise in this regard, as motif patterns serve as building blocks for larger group interactions which are inexpressible by graphs. Recent work has focused on categorizing and counting hypergraph motifs based on the existence of nodes in hyperedge intersection regions. Here, we argue that the relative sizes of hyperedge intersections within motifs contain varied and valuable information. We propose a suite of efficient algorithms for finding top-k triplets of hyperedges based on optimizing the sizes of these intersection patterns. This formulation uncovers interesting local patterns of interaction, finding hyperedge triplets that either (1) are the least similar with each other, (2) have the highest pairwise but not groupwise correlation, or (3) are the most similar with each other. We formalize this as a combinatorial optimization problem and design efficient algorithms based on filtering hyperedges. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation shows that the resulting hyperedge triplets yield insightful information on real-world hypergraphs. Our approach is also orders of magnitude faster than a naive baseline implementation.</description>

      <title>Point process analysis of geographical diffusion of news in Argentina</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion of information plays a crucial role in a society, affecting its economy and the well-being of the population. Characterizing the diffusion process is challenging because it is highly non-stationary and varies with the media type. To understand the spreading of newspaper news in Argentina, we collected data from more than 27000 articles published in six main provinces during four months. We classified the articles into 20 thematic axes and obtained a set of time series that capture daily newspaper attention on different topics in different provinces. To analyze the data we use a point process approach. For each topic, $n$, and for all pairs of provinces, $i$ and $j$, we use two measures to quantify the synchronicity of the events, $Q_s(i,j)$, which quantifies the number of events that occur almost simultaneously in $i$ and $j$, and $Q_a(i,j)$, which quantifies the direction of news spreading. Our analysis unveils how fast the information diffusion process is, showing pairs of provinces with very similar and almost simultaneous temporal variations of media attention. On the other hand, we also calculate other measures computed from the raw time series, such as Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, which do not perform well in this context because they often return opposite directions of information transfer. We interpret this as due to different factors such as the characteristics of the data, which is highly non-stationary and the features of the information diffusion process, which is very fast and probably acts at a sub-resolution time scale.</description>
