      <title>Towards a geometric characterization of unbounded integer cubic optimization problems via thin rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study geometric characterizations of unbounded integer polynomial optimization problems. While unboundedness along a ray fully characterizes unbounded integer linear and quadratic optimization problems, we show that this is not the case for cubic polynomials. To overcome this, we introduce thin rays, which are rays with an arbitrarily small neighborhood, and prove that they characterize unboundedness for integer cubic optimization problems in dimension up to three, and we conjecture that the same holds in all dimensions. Our techniques also provide a complete characterization of unbounded integer quadratic optimization problems in arbitrary dimension, without assuming rational coefficients. These results underscore the significance of thin rays and offer new tools for analyzing integer polynomial optimization problems beyond the quadratic case.</description>

      <title>Projection-width: a unifying structural parameter for separable discrete optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of projection-width for systems of separable constraints, defined via branch decompositions of variables and constraints. We show that several fundamental discrete optimization and counting problems can be solved in polynomial time when the projection-width is polynomially bounded. These include optimization, counting, top-k, and weighted constraint violation. Our results identify a broad class of tractable nonlinear discrete optimization and counting problems. Even when restricted to the linear setting, they subsume and substantially extend some of the strongest known tractability results across multiple research areas: integer linear optimization, binary polynomial optimization, and Boolean satisfiability. Although these results originated independently within different communities and for seemingly distinct problem classes, our framework unifies and significantly generalizes them under a single structural perspective.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture to signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The balanced chromatic number of a signed graph G is the minimum number of balanced sets that cover all vertices of G. Studying structural conditions which imply bounds on the balanced chromatic number of signed graphs is among the most fundamental problems in graph theory. In this work, we initiate the study of coloring hereditary classes of signed graphs. More precisely, we say that a set F = {F_1, F_2, ..., F_l} is a GS (for Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner) set if there exists a constant c such that signed graphs with no induced subgraph switching equivalent to a member of F admit a balanced c-coloring. The focus of this work is to study GS sets of order 2. We show that if F is a GS set of order 2, then F_1 is either (K_3, -) or (K_4, -), and F_2 is a linear forest. In the case of F_1 = (K_3, -), we show that any choice of a linear forest for F_2 works. In the case of F_1 = (K_4, -), we show that if each connected component of F_2 is a path of length at most 4, then {F_1, F_2} is a GS set.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of undirected 2-quasi best match graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite best match graphs (BMG) and their generalizations arise in mathematical phylogenetics as combinatorial models describing evolutionary relationships among related genes in a pair of species. In this work, we characterize the class of \emph{undirected 2-quasi-BMGs} (un2qBMGs), which form a proper subclass of the $P_6$-free chordal bipartite graphs. We show that un2qBMGs are exactly the class of bipartite graphs free of $P_6$, $C_6$, and the eight-vertex Sunlet$_4$ graph. Equivalently, a bipartite graph $G$ is un2qBMG if and only if every connected induced subgraph contains a ``heart-vertex'' which is adjacent to all the vertices of the opposite color. We further provide a $O(|V(G)|^3)$ algorithm for the recognition of un2qBMGs that, in the affirmative case, constructs a labeled rooted tree that ``explains'' $G$. Finally, since un2qBMGs coincide with the $(P_6,C_6)$-free bi-cographs, they can also be recognized in linear time.</description>

      <title>A Courcelle-Type Metatheorem for Rank-Bounded Unconstrained Binary Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first uniform XP exact algorithm for unconstrained binary optimization of quadratic, polynomial, fractional, and other objectives under a single parameter, the differentially affine (DA) rank $r$. An objective $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ has DA rank $r$ if there is a feature map $\psi: \{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}^r$ such that each coordinate flip has finite gain $\Delta_{\pm e_i}f(x)=\langle v_{\pm e_i},\psi(x)\rangle+\beta_{\pm e_i}$. Our algorithm enumerates the $O((2n)^r)$ chambers of the induced hyperplane arrangement and applies a two-sided local-optimality test: a solution exists on a chamber and is unique iff $\operatorname{sign}\Delta_{+e_i}=-\operatorname{sign}\Delta_{-e_i}$ for all $i$, in which case $x_i^\star=1$ iff $\Delta_{+e_i}&gt;0$. This yields $n^{O(r)}$ time with $O(n)$ decoding per chamber. The framework uniformly covers a wide range of nonlinear functions, including all rank-$r$ quadratics, low-Waring-rank pseudo-Boolean polynomials, finite products/ratios on positive domains, finite-basis separable sums via explicit lifts, Taylor-series approximations of analytic functions, and compositions of all the foregoing. Applications include Ising spin models, optimal experimental design, portfolio optimization, and robust statistics. Prior to our work, only specialized subcases involving sparsity, convexity, submodularity, etc. were known to be tractable. Analogous in spirit to Courcelle's theorem (MSO on bounded treewidth graphs) and Grohe's meta-theorems for constraint satisfaction, our result replaces logical width with analytic rank for nonlinear pseudo-Boolean optimization.</description>

      <title>(Approximate) Matrix Multiplication via Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the capability of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to accelerate exact and approximate matrix multiplication without using Strassen-like divide-and-conquer. We present a simple exact algorithm running in $O(n^{2.89})$ time, which only sums a few convolutions (FFTs) in $\mathbb{Z}_{m}^{k}$, building on the work of Cohn, Kleinberg, Szegedy and Umans (2005). As a corollary, combining this algorithm with linear sketching breaks the longstanding linear speed-accuracy tradeoff for "combinatorial" approximate matrix multiplication (AMM, Pagh'13, Sarlos'06, Clarkson-Woodruff'13), achieving error $\frac{1}{r^{1.1}}\left\lVert \mathbf{A} \right\rVert_{F}^{2}\left\lVert \mathbf{B}\right\rVert_{F}^{2}$ in $O(rn^{2})$ time, using nothing but FFTs.
  Motivated by the rich literature for approximating polynomials, our main contribution in this paper is extending the group-theoretic framework of Cohn and Umans (2003) to approximate matrix multiplication (AMM). Specifically, we introduce and study an approximate notion of the Triple Product Property, which in the abelian case is equivalent to finding a Sumset which minimizes (multi-)intersections with an arithmetic progression. We prove tight bounds on this quantity for abelian groups (yielding a simple and practical AMM algorithm via polynomial multiplication), and establish a weaker lower bound for non-abelian groups, extending a lemma of Gowers. Finally, we propose a concrete approach that uses low-degree approximation of multi-variate polynomials for AMM, which we believe will lead to practical, non-asymptotic AMM algorithms in real-world applications, most notably LLM inference.</description>
