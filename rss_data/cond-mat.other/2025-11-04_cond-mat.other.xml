      <title>Optimized mouldboard design for efficient soil inversion using the discrete element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of a mouldboard (MB) plough is critical for achieving efficient soil inversion, which directly impacts soil aeration, weed control, and overall agricultural productivity. In this work, a design modification of the cylindroid-shaped MB plough is proposed, focusing on optimizing its surface profile to enhance performance. The discrete element method is used to simulate the ploughing process and evaluate the performance of the modified plough profile. The modified plough profile is compared against a previously proposed design to assess its impact on soil inversion efficiency, wear reduction, and stress distribution. A novel methodology is introduced to evaluate the plough's performance in soil inversion. The modified design demonstrates superior soil inversion efficiency, with improvements of up to $32.95\%$ in the inversion index for different velocities. The modified design achieves a notable reduction in wear up to $23.7\%$, compared to the original design. Although a slight increase in stress is observed in the modified design due to higher forces, the induced stresses remain well within the permissible limits for the plough material. Overall, the findings highlight the advantages of the modified plough design, including enhanced soil inversion efficiency and reduced wear, underscoring its potential for improved performance in tillage applications. However, the current study is limited to simulation-based analysis without experimental or field validation. Future work will focus on full-scale physical experiments to validate the simulation outcomes and incorporate additional factors such as depth-dependent moisture, soil cohesion, and multi-factor wear models for improved predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Ambient-Induced Selenium Segregation and Nanoparticle Formation in 2H-HfSe2: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the air-induced degradation of few-layer hafnium diselenide (HfSe$_2$) through combined experimental and theoretical approaches. AFM and SEM reveal the formation of selenium-rich spherical features upon ambient exposure, while EDS confirms Se segregation. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations show that Se atoms migrate to flake edges and that O/O$_2$ exposure leads to selective Hf oxidation, breaking Se--Hf bonds and expelling Se atoms. No stable Se--O bonds are observed, indicating structural reorganization rather than oxidation. These findings emphasize the material's instability in air and the importance of encapsulation for preserving HfSe$_2$ in practical applications. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy confirms the semiconducting character of the nanoparticles, with an electronic bandgap compatible with that of elemental Se. These results highlight the critical role of lattice defects and oxidation dynamics in the degradation process and underscore the need for encapsulation strategies to preserve the integrity of HfSe$_2$-based devices.</description>

      <title>Exchange-driven self-diffusion of nanoscale crystalline parahydrogen clusters on graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer simulations yield evidence of superfluid behavior of nanoscale size clusters of parahydrogen adsorbed on a graphite substrate at low temperature ($T\lesssim 0.25 \text{ K}$). Clusters with a number of molecules between 7 and 12 display concurrent superfluidity and crystalline order, reflecting the corrugation of the substrate. Remarkably, it is found that specific clusters with a number of molecules ranging between 7 and 12 self-diffuse on the surface like free particles, despite the strong pinning effect of the substrate. This effect is underlain by coordinated quantum-mechanical exchanges of groups of identical molecules, i.e., it has no classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Characterization of heat transfer in 3D CMOS structures using Sideband Scanning Thermal Wave Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient thermal management is critical for cryogenic CMOS circuits, where local heating can compromise device performance and qubit coherence. Understanding heat flow at the nanoscale in these multilayer architectures requires localized, high-resolution thermal probing techniques capable of accessing buried structures.
  Here, we introduce a sideband thermal wave detection scheme for Scanning Thermal Microscopy, S-STWM, to probe deeply buried heater structures within CMOS dies. By extracting the phase of propagating thermal waves, this method provides spatially resolved insight into heat dissipation pathways through complex multilayer structures. Our approach enables quantitative evaluation of thermal management strategies, informs the design of cryo-CMOS circuits, and establishes a foundation for in situ thermal characterization under cryogenic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices leave a macroscopic signature in the normal fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the remarkable properties of quantum turbulence in superfluid helium II, consisting of a disordered tangle of quantised vortex lines which interact with each other and reconnect when they collide. According to Landau's two-fluid theory, these vortex lines move in a surrounding of thermal excitations called the normal fluid. Until now, the normal fluid has often been considered a passive background which simply provides the vortex lines with a mechanism for dissipating their kinetic energy into heat. Using a model which fully takes into account the two-way interaction between the vortex lines and the normal fluid, here we show numerically that each vortex line creates a macroscopic wake in the normal fluid that can be larger than the average distance between vortex lines; this is surprising, given the microscopic size of the superfluid vortex cores which induce these wakes. We show that in heat transfer experiments, the flow of the normal fluid can therefore be described as the superposition of an imposed uniform flow and wakes generated by the vortex lines, leading to non-classical statistics of the normal fluid velocity. We also argue that this first evidence of independent fluid structures in the thermal excitations postulated by Landau may be at the root of recent, unaccounted for, experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Topological States without Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators exhibit boundary states protected by bulk band topology, a principle first established in quantum systems and later extended to classical waves, including phononics. Conventionally, an $n$-dimensional bulk with nontrivial topology hosts $(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states, which may be further gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them, potentially leading to the emergence of $(n-2)$-dimensional, or even lower-dimensional topological states, as in higher-order topological insulators. In this work, we introduce an alternative mechanism for gapping out topological states and forming new topological modes within the resulting gap without further unit-cell symmetry breaking or dimension reduction. Using one- and two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models, we show that controlled repositioning of topological domain walls enables the construction of hierarchical unit cells that gap out the original domain-wall states while preserving the underlying symmetry. This process produces higher-hierarchical-level topological states, characterized by a generalized winding number, and can be iterated to realize multiple - potentially infinite - hierarchical levels of topological states. Our approach expands the conventional topological classification and offers a versatile route for engineering complex networks of protected modes in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Spin-Orbit Torques by Tensorial Spin Hall Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. We propose a hitherto unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. We demonstrate these harmonic signals with semimetal WTe$_2$ in mind but the results are not restricted to specific materials.</description>

      <title>Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.</description>
