      <title>Separating complexity classes of LCL problems on grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory, computability theory, and factors of i.i.d. Our results separate various complexity classes that were not previously known to be distinct and serve as counterexamples to a number of natural conjectures in the field.</description>

      <title>Toward Better Depth Lower Bounds: Strong Composition of XOR and a Random Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proving formula depth lower bounds is a fundamental challenge in complexity theory, with the strongest known bound of $(3 - o(1))\log n$ established by Hastad over 25 years ago. The Karchmer-Raz-Wigderson (KRW) conjecture offers a promising approach to advance these bounds and separate P from NC$^{1}$. It suggests that the depth complexity of a function composition $f \diamond g$ approximates the sum of the depth complexities of $f$ and $g$.
  The Karchmer-Wigderson (KW) relation framework translates formula depth into communication complexity, restating the KRW conjecture as $\mathsf{CC}(\mathsf{KW}_f \diamond \mathsf{KW}_g) \approx \mathsf{CC}(\mathsf{KW}_f) + \mathsf{CC}(\mathsf{KW}_g)$. Prior work has confirmed the conjecture under various relaxations, often replacing one or both KW relations with the universal relation or constraining the communication game through strong composition.
  In this paper, we examine the strong composition $\mathsf{KW}_{\mathsf{XOR}} \circledast \mathsf{KW}_f$ of the parity function and a random Boolean function $f$. We prove that with probability $1-o(1)$, any protocol solving this composition requires at least $n^{3 - o(1)}$ leaves. This result establishes a depth lower bound of $(3 - o(1))\log n$, matching Hastad's bound, but is applicable to a broader class of inner functions, even when the outer function is simple. Though bounds for the strong composition do not translate directly to formula depth bounds, they usually help to analyze the standard composition (of the corresponding two functions) which is directly related to formula depth.</description>

      <title>Finding a Minimum Spanning Tree with a Small Non-Terminal Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of finding a minimum weight spanning tree that contains each vertex in a given subset $V_{\rm NT}$ of vertices as an internal vertex. This problem, called Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree, includes $s$-$t$ Hamiltonian Path as a special case, and hence it is NP-hard. In this paper, we first observe that Non-Terminal Spanning Tree, the unweighted counterpart of Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree, is already NP-hard on some special graph classes. Moreover, it is W[1]-hard when parameterized by clique-width. In contrast, we give a $3k$-vertex kernel and $O^*(2^k)$-time algorithm, where $k$ is the size of non-terminal set $V_{\rm NT}$. The latter algorithm can be extended to Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree with the restriction that each edge has a polynomially bounded integral weight. We also show that Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the number of edges in the subgraph induced by the non-terminal set $V_{\rm NT}$, extending the fixed-parameter tractability of Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree to the general case. Finally, we give several results for structural parameterization.</description>

      <title>Ask, and it shall be given: On the Turing completeness of prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the success of GPT, large language models (LLMs) have been revolutionizing machine learning and have initiated the so-called LLM prompting paradigm. In the era of LLMs, people train a single general-purpose LLM and provide the LLM with different prompts to perform different tasks. However, such empirical success largely lacks theoretical understanding. Here, we present the first theoretical study on the LLM prompting paradigm to the best of our knowledge. In this work, we show that prompting is in fact Turing-complete: there exists a finite-size Transformer such that for any computable function, there exists a corresponding prompt following which the Transformer computes the function. Furthermore, we show that even though we use only a single finite-size Transformer, it can still achieve nearly the same complexity bounds as that of the class of all unbounded-size Transformers. Overall, our result reveals that prompting can enable a single finite-size Transformer to be efficiently universal, which establishes a theoretical underpinning for prompt engineering in practice.</description>
