      <title>Evolutionary chemical learning in dimerization networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for chemical learning based on Competitive Dimerization Networks (CDNs) - systems in which multiple molecular species, e.g. proteins or DNA/RNA oligomers, reversibly bind to form dimers. We show that these networks can be trained in vitro through directed evolution, enabling the implementation of complex learning tasks such as multiclass classification without digital hardware or explicit parameter tuning. Each molecular species functions analogously to a neuron, with binding affinities acting as tunable synaptic weights. A training protocol involving mutation, selection, and amplification of DNA-based components allows CDNs to robustly discriminate among noisy input patterns. The resulting classifiers exhibit strong output contrast and high mutual information between input and output, especially when guided by a contrast-enhancing loss function. Comparative analysis with in silico gradient descent training reveals closely correlated performance. These results establish CDNs as a promising platform for analog physical computation, bridging synthetic biology and machine learning, and advancing the development of adaptive, energy-efficient molecular computing systems.</description>

      <title>The phenomenological renormalization group in neuronal models near criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenological renormalization group (PRG) has been applied to the study of scaleinvariant phenomena in neuronal data, providing evidence for critical phenomena in the brain. However, it remains unclear how reliably these observed signatures indicate genuine critical behavior, as it is not well established how close to criticality a system must be for them to emerge. Here, we rely on neuronal models with known critical points to investigate under which conditions the PRG procedure yields consistent results. We discuss how the time-binning step of data preprocessing can crucially affect the final results, and propose a data-driven method to adapt the time bin in order to circumvent this issue. Under these conditions, the PRG method only detects scaling behavior in neuronal models within a very narrow range of the critical point, lending credence to the conclusions drawn from PRG results in experimental data.</description>

      <title>Predicting the response of structurally altered and asymmetrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the response of coupled dynamical systems is modified due to a structural alteration of the interaction. The majority of the literature focuses on additive perturbations and symmetrical interaction networks. Here, we consider the challenging problem of multiplicative perturbations and asymmetrical interaction coupling. We introduce a framework to approximate the averaged response at each network node for general structural perturbations, including non-normal and asymmetrical ones. Our findings indicate that both the asymmetry and non-normality of the structural perturbation impact the global and local responses at different orders in time. We propose a set of matrices to identify the nodes whose response is affected the most by the structural alteration.</description>
