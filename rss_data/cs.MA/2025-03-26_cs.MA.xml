      <title>Cooperative Control of Multi-Quadrotors for Transporting Cable-Suspended Payloads: Obstacle-Aware Planning and Event-Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for the cooperative control of multiple quadrotors transporting cablesuspended payloads, emphasizing obstacle-aware planning and event-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Our approach integrates trajectory planning with real-time control through a combination of the A* algorithm for global path planning and NMPC for local control, enhancing trajectory adaptability and obstacle avoidance. We propose an advanced event-triggered control system that updates based on events identified through dynamically generated environmental maps. These maps are constructed using a dual-camera setup, which includes multi-camera systems for static obstacle detection and event cameras for high-resolution, low-latency detection of dynamic obstacles. This design is crucial for addressing fast-moving and transient obstacles that conventional cameras may overlook, particularly in environments with rapid motion and variable lighting conditions. When new obstacles are detected, the A* algorithm recalculates waypoints based on the updated map, ensuring safe and efficient navigation. This real-time obstacle detection and map updating integration allows the system to adaptively respond to environmental changes, markedly improving safety and navigation efficiency. The system employs SLAM and object detection techniques utilizing data from multi-cameras, event cameras, and IMUs for accurate localization and comprehensive environmental mapping. The NMPC framework adeptly manages the complex dynamics of multiple quadrotors and suspended payloads, incorporating safety constraints to maintain dynamic feasibility and stability. Extensive simulations validate the proposed approach, demonstrating significant enhancements in energy efficiency, computational resource management, and responsiveness.</description>

      <title>Browsing Lost Unformed Recollections: A Benchmark for Tip-of-the-Tongue Search and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Browsing Lost Unformed Recollections, a tip-of-the-tongue known-item search and reasoning benchmark for general AI assistants. BLUR introduces a set of 573 real-world validated questions that demand searching and reasoning across multi-modal and multilingual inputs, as well as proficient tool use, in order to excel on. Humans easily ace these questions (scoring on average 98%), while the best-performing system scores around 56%. To facilitate progress toward addressing this challenging and aspirational use case for general AI assistants, we release 350 questions through a public leaderboard, retain the answers to 250 of them, and have the rest as a private test set.</description>

      <title>Optimal Modified Feedback Strategies in LQ Games under Control Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game-theoretic approaches and Nash equilibrium have been widely applied across various engineering domains. However, practical challenges such as disturbances, delays, and actuator limitations can hinder the precise execution of Nash equilibrium strategies. This work explores the impact of such implementation imperfections on game trajectories and players' costs within the context of a two-player linear quadratic (LQ) nonzero-sum game. Specifically, we analyze how small deviations by one player affect the state and cost function of the other player. To address these deviations, we propose an adjusted control policy that not only mitigates adverse effects optimally but can also exploit the deviations to enhance performance. Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs are presented, demonstrating through a representative example that the proposed policy modification achieves up to $61\%$ improvement compared to the unadjusted feedback policy and up to $0.59\%$ compared to the feedback Nash strategy.</description>

      <title>TraF-Align: Trajectory-aware Feature Alignment for Asynchronous Multi-agent Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative perception presents significant potential for enhancing the sensing capabilities of individual vehicles, however, inter-agent latency remains a critical challenge. Latencies cause misalignments in both spatial and semantic features, complicating the fusion of real-time observations from the ego vehicle with delayed data from others. To address these issues, we propose TraF-Align, a novel framework that learns the flow path of features by predicting the feature-level trajectory of objects from past observations up to the ego vehicle's current time. By generating temporally ordered sampling points along these paths, TraF-Align directs attention from the current-time query to relevant historical features along each trajectory, supporting the reconstruction of current-time features and promoting semantic interaction across multiple frames. This approach corrects spatial misalignment and ensures semantic consistency across agents, effectively compensating for motion and achieving coherent feature fusion. Experiments on two real-world datasets, V2V4Real and DAIR-V2X-Seq, show that TraF-Align sets a new benchmark for asynchronous cooperative perception.</description>

      <title>Optimal Path Planning and Cost Minimization for a Drone Delivery System Via Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we formulate the drone delivery problem as a control problem and solve it using Model Predictive Control. Two experiments are performed: The first is on a less challenging grid world environment with lower dimensionality, and the second is with a higher dimensionality and added complexity. The MPC method was benchmarked against three popular Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL): Independent $Q$-Learning (IQL), Joint Action Learners (JAL), and Value-Decomposition Networks (VDN). It was shown that the MPC method solved the problem quicker and required fewer optimal numbers of drones to achieve a minimized cost and navigate the optimal path.</description>

      <title>Inducing Personality in LLM-Based Honeypot Agents: Measuring the Effect on Human-Like Agenda Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SANDMAN, an architecture for cyber deception that leverages Language Agents to emulate convincing human simulacra. Our 'Deceptive Agents' serve as advanced cyber decoys, designed for high-fidelity engagement with attackers by extending the observation period of attack behaviours. Through experimentation, measurement, and analysis, we demonstrate how a prompt schema based on the five-factor model of personality systematically induces distinct 'personalities' in Large Language Models. Our results highlight the feasibility of persona-driven Language Agents for generating diverse, realistic behaviours, ultimately improving cyber deception strategies.</description>

      <title>On Qualitative Preference in Alternating-time Temporal Logic with Strategy Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to add and eliminate binary preference on plays in Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) with strategy contexts on Concurrent Game Models (CGMs) by means of a translation which preserves satisfaction in models where preference-indiscernibility between plays is an equivalence relation of finite index. The elimination technique also works for a companion second-order path quantifier, which makes quantified path variables range over sets of plays that are closed under preference-indiscernibility. We argue that the preference operator and the specialized quantifier facilitate formulating interesting solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and secure equilibrium in a straightforward way. We also present a novel translation from ATL with strategy contexts to Quantified Computation Tree Logic (QCTL). Together with the translation which eliminates preference and the specialized form of quantification, this translation allows reasoning about infinite multiplayer synchronous games on CGMs to be translated from the proposed extension of ATL with strategy contexts into QCTL. The setting is related to that of ordered objectives in the works of Bouyer, Brenguier, Markey and Ummels, except that our focus is on the use of the temporal logic languages mentioned above, and we rely on translations into QCTL for the algorithmic solutions.</description>

      <title>Large language model-powered AI systems achieve self-replication with no human intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-replication with no human intervention is broadly recognized as one of the principal red lines associated with frontier AI systems. While leading corporations such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind have assessed GPT-o3-mini and Gemini on replication-related tasks and concluded that these systems pose a minimal risk regarding self-replication, our research presents novel findings. Following the same evaluation protocol, we demonstrate that 11 out of 32 existing AI systems under evaluation already possess the capability of self-replication. In hundreds of experimental trials, we observe a non-trivial number of successful self-replication trials across mainstream model families worldwide, even including those with as small as 14 billion parameters which can run on personal computers. Furthermore, we note the increase in self-replication capability when the model becomes more intelligent in general. Also, by analyzing the behavioral traces of diverse AI systems, we observe that existing AI systems already exhibit sufficient planning, problem-solving, and creative capabilities to accomplish complex agentic tasks including self-replication. More alarmingly, we observe successful cases where an AI system do self-exfiltration without explicit instructions, adapt to harsher computational environments without sufficient software or hardware supports, and plot effective strategies to survive against the shutdown command from the human beings. These novel findings offer a crucial time buffer for the international community to collaborate on establishing effective governance over the self-replication capabilities and behaviors of frontier AI systems, which could otherwise pose existential risks to the human society if not well-controlled.</description>

      <title>Distributed Stochastic Zeroth-Order Optimization with Compressed Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dual challenges of prohibitive communication overhead and the impracticality of gradient computation due to data privacy or black-box constraints in distributed systems motivate this work on communication-constrained gradient-free optimization. We propose a stochastic distributed zeroth-order algorithm (Com-DSZO) requiring only two function evaluations per iteration, integrated with general compression operators. Rigorous analysis establishes its sublinear convergence rate for both smooth and nonsmooth objectives, while explicitly elucidating the compression-convergence trade-off. Furthermore, we develop a variance-reduced variant (VR-Com-DSZO) under stochastic mini-batch feedback. The empirical algorithm performance are illustrated with numerical examples.</description>
