      <title>Milton Friedman's spending matrix revisited: 'Spending efficiency' and 'preference compatibility' across different economic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article expands Milton Friedman's spending matrix to analyse 'spending efficiency' and 'preference compatibility' across different economic systems against five key outcome criteria. By generalising Friedman's typology, it compares efficiency and freedom as systems shift from laissez-faire capitalism to communism, illustrating a gradual deterioration in their key outcomes. While government intervention is sometimes necessary to address market failures, its role should always be carefully limited to avoid inefficiency and misalignment with individual preferences. The insights may provide guidance for policymakers in designing economic systems and policies that promote both economic prosperity and personal liberty.</description>

      <title>The Quantitative Comparative Economics: indices of similarity to economic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel quantitative approach for comparative economic studies, addressing limitations in current classification methods. Conventional approaches in comparative economics often rely on ad hoc and categorical classifications, leading to subjective judgments and disregarding the continuous nature of the spectrum of economic systems. These can result in subjectivity and significant information loss, particularly for countries with systems near categorical borders. To overcome these shortcomings, the present paper proposes distance-based indices for objective categorization, considering economic foundations and using hard data. Accordingly, the paper introduces institutional similarity indices--Capitalism Similarity Index (CapSI), Communism Similarity Index (ComSI), and Socialism Similarity Index (SocSI)-which reflect countries' positions along the economic system continuum. These indices adhere to mathematical rigor and are grounded in the mathematical fields of real analysis, metric spaces, and distance functions. By classifying 135 countries and creating GIS maps, the practical applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated. Results show a high explanatory power of the introduced indices, suggesting their beneficial usage in comparative economic studies. The paper advocates for their adoption due to their objectivity and ability to capture structural and institutional nuances without subjective judgments while also considering the continuous nature of the spectrum of economic systems.</description>

      <title>Allocating Students to Schools: Theory, Methods, and Empirical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter surveys the application of matching theory to school choice, motivated by the shift from neighborhood assignment systems to choice-based models. Since educational choice is not mediated by price, the design of allocation mechanisms is critical. The chapter first reviews theoretical contributions, exploring the fundamental trade-offs between efficiency, stability, and strategy-proofness, and covers design challenges such as tie-breaking, cardinal welfare, and affirmative action. It then transitions to the empirical landscape, focusing on the central challenge of inferring student preferences from application data, especially under strategic mechanisms. We review various estimation approaches and discuss key insights on parental preferences, market design trade-offs, and the effectiveness of school choice policies?</description>

      <title>Adaptive Agents in Spatial Double-Auction Markets: Modeling the Emergence of Industrial Symbiosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial symbiosis fosters circularity by enabling firms to repurpose residual resources, yet its emergence is constrained by socio-spatial frictions that shape costs, matching opportunities, and market efficiency. Existing models often overlook the interaction between spatial structure, market design, and adaptive firm behavior, limiting our understanding of where and how symbiosis arises. We develop an agent-based model where heterogeneous firms trade byproducts through a spatially embedded double-auction market, with prices and quantities emerging endogenously from local interactions. Leveraging reinforcement learning, firms adapt their bidding strategies to maximize profit while accounting for transport costs, disposal penalties, and resource scarcity. Simulation experiments reveal the economic and spatial conditions under which decentralized exchanges converge toward stable and efficient outcomes. Counterfactual regret analysis shows that sellers' strategies approach a near Nash equilibrium, while sensitivity analysis highlights how spatial structures and market parameters jointly govern circularity. Our model provides a basis for exploring policy interventions that seek to align firm incentives with sustainability goals, and more broadly demonstrates how decentralized coordination can emerge from adaptive agents in spatially constrained markets.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Analysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how generative artificial intelligence (AI) transforms the work of financial analysts. Using the 2023 launch of FactSet's AI platform as a natural experiment, we find that adoption produces markedly richer and more comprehensive reports -- featuring 40% more distinct information sources, 34% broader topical coverage, and 25% greater use of advanced analytical methods -- while also improving timeliness. However, forecast errors rise by 59% as AI-assisted reports convey a more balanced mix of positive and negative information that is harder to synthesize, particularly for analysts facing heavier cognitive demands. Placebo tests using other data vendors confirm that these effects are unique to FactSet's AI integration. Overall, our findings reveal both the productivity gains and cognitive limits of generative AI in financial information production.</description>

      <title>Replacing Gas with Low-cost, Abundant Long-duration Pumped Hydro in Electricity Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fossil gas is sometimes presented as an enabler of variable solar and wind generation beyond 2050, despite being a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions from methane leakage and combustion. We find that balancing solar and wind generation with pumped hydro energy storage eliminates the need for fossil gas without incurring a cost penalty. However, many existing long-term electricity system plans are biased to rely on fossil gas due to using temporal aggregation methods that either heavily constrain storage cycling behaviour or lose track of the state-of-charge, failing to consider the potential of low-cost long-duration off-river pumped hydro, and ignoring the broad suite of near-optimal energy transition pathways. We show that a temporal aggregation method based on 'segmentation' (fitted chronology) closely resembles the full-series optimisation, captures long-duration storage behaviour (48- and 160-hour durations), and finds a near-optimal 100% renewable electricity solution. We develop a new electricity system model to rapidly evaluate millions of other near-optimal solutions, stressing the importance of modelling pumped hydro sites with a low energy volume cost (&lt;US$50 per kilowatt-hour), long economic lifetime (~75 years), and low real discount rate akin to other natural monopolies (&lt;=3%). Almost every region of the world has access to sufficient 50 - 5000 gigawatt-hour off-river pumped hydro options that enable them to entirely decarbonise their future electricity systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling Economic Systems as Multiport Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how multiport network theory can be used as a powerful modeling tool in economics. The critical insight is using the port concept to pair the flow of goods (the electrical current) with the agent's incentive (the voltage) in an economic interaction. By building networks of agents interacting through ports, we create models with multiple levels of abstraction, from the macro level down to the micro level. We are thereby able to model complex macroeconomic systems whose dynamical behavior is emergent from the micro level. Using the LTSpice circuit simulator, we then design and analyze a series of example systems that range in complexity from the textbook Robinson Crusoe economy to a model of an entire economy.</description>

      <title>Becoming Immutable: How Ethereum is Made</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain's economic value lies in enabling financial and economic transactions that do not require trusted, centralized intermediaries. In practice, however, transactions must pass through several intermediaries before being included on-chain. We study empirically whether this process undermines blockchain's stated benefits by assembling a novel dataset of 15,097 non-winning Ethereum blocks--blocks proposed by builders but not ultimately selected for inclusion. We show that 21% of user transactions are delayed: although proposed in some candidate blocks, they are not included in the winning block. Approximately 30% of these delayed transactions are exclusive to a single losing builder, indicating that transaction routing materially affect inclusion outcomes. We further document substantial heterogeneity in execution quality: both the probability of successful execution and the execution price of users' swaps vary across candidate blocks. Finally, we study two arbitrage bots trading between decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX). We document intense competition for the same arbitrage opportunities and estimate that these bots trade USDC/WETH and USDT/WETH on centralized exchanges at prices approximately 2.8 basis points more favorable than contemporaneous Binance prices.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Machine Learning? Regularization and Forecast Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16158v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard forecast efficiency tests interpret violations as evidence of behavioral bias. We show theoretically and empirically that rational forecasters using optimal regularization systematically violate these tests. Machine learning forecasts show near zero bias at one year horizon, but strong overreaction at two years, consistent with predictions from a model of regularization and measurement noise. We provide three complementary tests: experimental variation in regularization parameters, cross-sectional heterogeneity in firm signal quality, and quasi-experimental evidence from ML adoption around 2013. Technically trained analysts shift sharply toward overreaction post-2013. Our findings suggest reported violations may reflect statistical sophistication rather than cognitive failure.</description>

      <title>Computational Basis of LLM's Decision Making in Social Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game, a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract ``vectors of variable variations'' (e.g., ``male'' to ``female'') from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.</description>
