      <title>Reducing the climate impact of data portals: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The carbon footprint share of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector has steadily increased in the past decade and is predicted to make up as much as 23 \% of global emissions in 2030. This shows a pressing need for developers, including the information retrieval community, to make their code more energy-efficient. In this project proposal, we discuss techniques to reduce the energy footprint of the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) Portal, a MediaWiki-based knowledge base. In future work, we plan to implement these changes and provide concrete measurements on the gain in energy efficiency. Researchers developing similar knowledge bases can adapt our measures to reduce their environmental footprint. In this way, we are working on mitigating the climate impact of Information Retrieval research.</description>

      <title>BrainKnow -- Extracting, Linking, and Synthesizing Neuroscience Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04346v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exponential growth of neuroscience literature presents a significant challenge for researchers seeking to efficiently access and utilize relevant information. To address this issue, we introduce the Brain Knowledge Engine (BrainKnow), an automated system designed to extract, link, and synthesize neuroscience knowledge from scientific publications. BrainKnow constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph encompassing 3,626,931 relationships across 37,011 neuroscience concepts, derived from 1,817,744 articles. This vast repository of knowledge is accessible through a user-friendly web interface, facilitating efficient navigation and data retrieval. BrainKnow employs advanced graph network algorithms, specifically Node2Vec, to enhance knowledge recommendation and visualization. This enables users to explore semantic relationships between concepts, predict potential new relationships, and gain a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness within neuroscience. Additionally, BrainKnow ensures real-time updates by synchronizing with PubMed, providing researchers with access to the most current information. BrainKnow serves as a valuable resource for neuroscience researchers, offering a powerful tool for exploring, synthesizing, and leveraging the vast and complex knowledge base of the field.</description>

      <title>Past, Present, and Future of Citation Practices in HCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science is a complex system comprised of many scientists who individually make collective decisions that, due to the size and nature of the academic system, largely do not affect the system as a whole. However, certain decisions at the meso-level of research communities, such as the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community, may result in deep and long-lasting behavioral changes in scientists. In this article, we provide evidence on how a change in editorial policies introduced at the ACM CHI Conference in 2016 launched the CHI community on an expansive path, denoted by a year-by-year increase in the mean number of references included in CHI articles. If this near-linear trend continues undisrupted, an article in CHI 2030 will include on average almost 130 references. Our meta-research provides insights into how the nature and meaning of citation practices in HCI have changed, influenced by factors such as digital accessibility of resources and academic pressures. The observed trend towards more citations reflects a citation culture where quantity is prioritized over quality, contributing to both author and peer reviewer fatigue. This article underscores the value of meta-research for research communities and the profound impact that meso-level policy adjustments have on the evolution of scientific fields and disciplines, urging stakeholders to carefully consider the broader implications of such changes.</description>
