      <title>From scale-free to Anderson localization: a size-dependent transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale-free localization in non-Hermitian systems is a distinctive type of localization where the localization length of certain eigenstates, known as scale-free localized (SFL) states, scales proportionally with the system size. Unlike skin states, where the localization length is independent of the system size, SFL states maintain a spatial profile that remains invariant as the system size changes. We consider a model involving a single non-Hermitian impurity in an otherwise Hermitian one-dimensional lattice. Introducing disorder into this system transforms SFL states into Anderson-localized states. In contrast to the Hatano-Nelson model, where disorder typically leads to the localization of skin states and a size-independent Anderson transition, the scale-free localization in our model causes a size-dependent Anderson transition.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian neural networks for nonholonomic mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) are a powerful tool for addressing physical systems, particularly those governed by conservation laws. LNNs can parametrize the Lagrangian of a system to predict trajectories with nearly conserved energy. These techniques have proven effective in unconstrained systems as well as those with holonomic constraints. In this work, we adapt LNN techniques to mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints. We test our approach on some well-known examples with nonholonomic constraints, showing that incorporating these restrictions into the neural network's learning improves not only trajectory estimation accuracy but also ensures adherence to constraints and exhibits better energy behavior compared to the unconstrained counterpart.</description>

      <title>Quantum linear algebra for disordered electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe how to use quantum linear algebra to simulate a physically realistic model of disordered non-interacting electrons on exponentially many lattice sites. The physics of disordered electrons outside of one dimension challenges classical computation due to the critical nature of the Anderson localization transition or exponential localization lengths, while the atypical distribution of the local density of states limits the power of disorder averaged approaches. We overcome this by simulating an exponentially large disorder instance using a block-encoded hopping matrix of physical form where disorder is introduced by pseudorandom functions. Key physical quantities, including the reduced density matrix, Green's function, and local density of states, as well as bulk-averaged observables such as the linear conductivity, can then be computed using quantum singular value transformation, quantum amplitude estimation, and trace estimation.</description>

      <title>Segmentation algorithms and modeling of recurrent bursting events in neuronal and glial time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-time series of neuronal recordings are resulting from the activity of connected neuronal networks. Yet how neuronal properties can be extracted remains empirical. We review here the data analysis based on network models to recover physiological parameters from electrophysiological and calcium recordings in neurons and astrocytes. After, we present the recording techniques and activation events, such as burst and interburst and Up and Down states. We then describe time-serie segmentation methods developed to detect and to segment these events. To interpret the statistics extracted from time series, we present computational models of neuronal populations based on synaptic short-term plasticity and After hyperpolarization. We discuss how these models are calibrated so that they can reproduce the statistics observed in the experimental time series. They serve to extract specific parameters by comparing numerical and experimental statistical moment or entire distributions. Finally, we discus cases where calibrated models are used to predict the selective impact of some parameters on the circuit behavior, properties that would otherwise be difficult to dissect experimentally.</description>

      <title>Latent heat estimation with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set out to explore the possibility of investigating the critical behavior of systems with first-order phase transition using deep machine learning. We propose a machine learning protocol with ternary classification of instantaneous spin configurations using known values of disordered phase energy and ordered phase energy. The trained neural network is used to predict whether a given sample belong to one or the other phase of matter. This allows us to estimate the probability that configurations with a certain energy belong to the ordered phase, mixed phase and, disordered phase. From these probabilities, we obtained estimates of the values of the critical energies and the latent heat for the Potts model with 10 and 20 components, which undergoes a strong discontinuous transition. We also find that the probabilities can reflect geometric transitions in the mixed phase.</description>

      <title>Reentrant Localization Transitions in a Topological Anderson Insulator: A Study of a Generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topology and localization properties of a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with a quasi-periodic modulated hopping. It is found that the interplay of off-diagonal quasi-periodic modulations can induce topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phases and reentrant topological Anderson insulator (RTAI), and the topological phase boundaries can be uncovered by the divergence of the localization length of the zero-energy mode. In contrast to the conventional case that the TAI regime emerges in a finite range with the increase of disorder, the TAI and RTAI are robust against arbitrary modulation amplitude for our system. Furthermore, we find that the TAI and RTAI can induce the emergence of reentrant localization transitions. Such an interesting connection between the reentrant localization transition and the TAI/RTAI can be detected from the wave-packet dynamics in cold atom systems by adopting the technique of momentum-lattice engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a study of a disorder-dependent real-space representation of the quantum geometry in topological systems. Thanks to the development of an efficient linear-scaling numerical methodology based on the kernel polynomial method, we can explore nontrivial behavior of the integrated quantum metric and Chern number in disordered systems with sizes reaching the experimental scale. We illustrate this approach in the disordered Haldane model, examining the impact of Anderson disorder and vacancies on the trivial and topological phases captured by this model.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Bootstrap and Subsampling in High-dimensional Regularized Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate popular resampling methods for estimating the uncertainty of statistical models, such as subsampling, bootstrap and the jackknife, and their performance in high-dimensional supervised regression tasks. We provide a tight asymptotic description of the biases and variances estimated by these methods in the context of generalized linear models, such as ridge and logistic regression, taking the limit where the number of samples $n$ and dimension $d$ of the covariates grow at a comparable fixed rate $\alpha\!=\! n/d$. Our findings are three-fold: i) resampling methods are fraught with problems in high dimensions and exhibit the double-descent-like behavior typical of these situations; ii) only when $\alpha$ is large enough do they provide consistent and reliable error estimations (we give convergence rates); iii) in the over-parametrized regime $\alpha\!&lt;\!1$ relevant to modern machine learning practice, their predictions are not consistent, even with optimal regularization.</description>

      <title>Jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in amorphous materials sheared by cyclic quasistatic deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01834v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jamming is an athermal transition between flowing and rigid states in amorphous systems such as granular matter, colloidal suspensions, complex fluids and cells. The jamming transition seems to display mixed aspects of a first-order transition, evidenced by a discontinuity in the coordination number, and a second-order transition, indicated by power-law scalings and diverging lengths. Here we demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in cyclically sheared systems with quasistatic deformations, in two and three dimensions. Based on scaling analyses, we show that fluctuations of the jamming density in finite-sized systems have important consequences on the finite-size effects of various quantities, resulting in a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities, a key signature of the first-order transition with quenched disorder. This study puts the jamming transition into the category of a broad class of transitions in disordered systems where sample-to-sample fluctuations dominate over thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the nature and behavior of the jamming transition might be better understood within the developed theoretical framework of the athermally driven random-field Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians provides access to an important set of chemical properties. Wavefunctions based on ML architectures have shown promise in approximating these ground states in a variety of physical systems. In this work, we show how to achieve state-of-the-art energies for molecular Hamiltonians using the the neural network backflow wave-function. To accomplish this, we optimize this ansatz with a variant of the deterministic optimization scheme based on SCI introduced by [Li, et. al JCTC (2023)] which we find works better than standard MCMC sampling. For the molecules we studied, NNBF gives lower energy states than both CCSD and other neural network quantum states. We systematically explore the role of network size as well as optimization parameters in improving the energy. We find that while the number of hidden layers and determinants play a minor role in improving the energy, there is significant improvements in the energy from increasing the number of hidden units as well as the batch size used in optimization with the batch size playing a more important role.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free deterministic equivalents for random feature regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the generalization performance of random feature ridge regression (RFRR). Our main contribution is a general deterministic equivalent for the test error of RFRR. Specifically, under a certain concentration property, we show that the test error is well approximated by a closed-form expression that only depends on the feature map eigenvalues. Notably, our approximation guarantee is non-asymptotic, multiplicative, and independent of the feature map dimension -- allowing for infinite-dimensional features. We expect this deterministic equivalent to hold broadly beyond our theoretical analysis, and we empirically validate its predictions on various real and synthetic datasets. As an application, we derive sharp excess error rates under standard power-law assumptions of the spectrum and target decay. In particular, we provide a tight result for the smallest number of features achieving optimal minimax error rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I demonstrate a pairing mechanism of dopants in a magnetic lattice, emerging from the underlying high-temperature disorder of the spins. The effect is demonstrated in a mixed-dimensional model, where dopants travel along a two-leg ladder, while the spins feature Ising interactions along the rungs and the legs of the ladder. The dynamics following the sudden immersion of two nearest neighbor dopants in an infinite temperature spin lattice shows that thermal spin disorder frustrates the relative motion of the dopants and enforces them to co-propagate. The predictions are shown to be realistically testable in quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the Anderson localization of quasiparticles in binary Bose mixtures in the presence of the Lee-Huang-Yang quantum and thermal corrections subjected to correlated disordered potentials. We calculate the density profiles, the Bogoliubov quasiparticles modes, and the localization length in both the mixture and droplet phases. We show that for one-dimensional speckle potentials, the peculiar interplay of disorder and the Lee-Huang-Yang fluctuations may enhance localization in one component while inducing delocalization in the other. Our results reveal also that thermal fluctuations lead to the emergence of two and multiple localization maxima. In the droplet state, our findings uncover that the Anderson localization of quasiparticles is weak in the flat-top region since its excitation modes are restricted to those below the particle-emission threshold.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.</description>
