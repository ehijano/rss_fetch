      <title>Nondeterministic tree-walking automata are not closed under complementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that the family of tree languages recognized by nondeterministic tree-walking automata is not closed under complementation, solving a problem raised by Boja\'nczyk and Colcombet ("Tree-walking automata do not recognize all regular languages", SIAM J. Comp. 38 (2008) 658--701). In addition, it is shown that nondeterministic tree-walking automata are stronger than unambiguous tree-walking automata.</description>

      <title>Unconditional proofs of quantumness between small-space machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proof of quantumness is a protocol through which a classical machine can test whether a purportedly quantum device, with comparable time and memory resources, is performing a computation that is impossible for classical computers. Existing approaches to provide proofs of quantumness depend on unproven assumptions about some task being impossible for machines of a particular model under certain resource restrictions. We study a setup where both devices have space bounds $\mathit{o}(\log \log n)$. Under such memory budgets, it has been unconditionally proven that probabilistic Turing machines are unable to solve certain computational problems. We formulate a new class of problems, and show that these problems are polynomial-time solvable for quantum machines, impossible for classical machines, and have the property that their solutions can be "proved" by a small-space quantum machine to a classical machine with the same space bound. These problems form the basis of our newly defined protocol, where the polynomial-time verifier's verdict about the tested machine's quantumness is not conditional on an unproven weakness assumption.</description>

      <title>Planning with Probabilistic Opacity and Transparency: A Computational Model of Opaque/Transparent Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qualitative opacity of a secret is a security property, which means that a system trajectory satisfying the secret is observation-equivalent to a trajectory violating the secret. In this paper, we study how to synthesize a control policy that maximizes the probability of a secret being made opaque against an eavesdropping attacker/observer, while subject to other task performance constraints. In contrast to existing belief-based approach for opacity-enforcement, we develop an approach that uses the observation function, the secret, and the model of the dynamical systems to construct a so-called opaque-observations automaton which accepts the exact set of observations that enforce opacity. Leveraging this opaque-observations automaton, we can reduce the optimal planning in Markov decision processes(MDPs) for maximizing probabilistic opacity or its dual notion, transparency, subject to task constraints into a constrained planning problem over an augmented-state MDP. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the developed methods in robot motion planning problems with opacity or transparency requirements.</description>
