      <title>A Theory for Wind Work on Oceanic Mesoscales and Submesoscales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies focused primarily on wind stress being proportional to wind velocity relative to the ocean velocity, which induces a curl in wind stress with polarity opposite to the ocean mesoscale vorticity, resulting in net negative wind work. However, there remains a fundamental gap in understanding how wind work on the ocean is related to the ocean's vortical and straining motions. While it is possible to derive budgets for ocean vorticity and strain, these do not provide the energy channeled into vortical and straining motions by wind stress. An occasional misconception is that a Helmholtz decomposition can separate vorticity from strain, with the latter mistakenly regarded as being solely due to the potential flow accounting for divergent motions. In fact, strain is also an essential constituent of divergence-free (or solenoidal) flows, including the oceanic mesoscales in geostrophic balance where strain-dominated regions account for approximately half the KE. There is no existing fluid dynamics framework that relates the injection of kinetic energy by a force to how this energy is deposited into vortical and straining motions. Here, we show that winds, on average, are just as effective at damping straining motions as they are at damping vortical motions. This happens because oceanic strain induces a straining wind stress gradient (WSG), which is analogous to ocean vorticity inducing a curl in wind stress. Ocean-induced WSGs alone, whether straining or vortical, always damp ocean currents. However, our theory also reveals that a significant contribution to wind work comes from inherent wind gradients, a main component of which is due to prevailing winds of the general atmospheric circulation. We find that inherent WSGs lead to asymmetric energization of ocean weather based on the polarity of vortical and straining ocean flows.</description>
