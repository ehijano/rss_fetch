      <title>Transfer Learning in Vocal Education: Technical Evaluation of Limited Samples Describing Mezzo-soprano</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vocal education in the music field is difficult to quantify due to the individual differences in singers' voices and the different quantitative criteria of singing techniques. Deep learning has great potential to be applied in music education due to its efficiency to handle complex data and perform quantitative analysis. However, accurate evaluations with limited samples over rare vocal types, such as Mezzo-soprano, requires extensive well-annotated data support using deep learning models. In order to attain the objective, we perform transfer learning by employing deep learning models pre-trained on the ImageNet and Urbansound8k datasets for the improvement on the precision of vocal technique evaluation. Furthermore, we tackle the problem of the lack of samples by constructing a dedicated dataset, the Mezzo-soprano Vocal Set (MVS), for vocal technique assessment. Our experimental results indicate that transfer learning increases the overall accuracy (OAcc) of all models by an average of 8.3%, with the highest accuracy at 94.2%. We not only provide a novel approach to evaluating Mezzo-soprano vocal techniques but also introduce a new quantitative assessment method for music education.</description>

      <title>The Trail Making Test in Virtual Reality (TMT-VR): The Effects of Interaction Modes and Gaming Skills on Cognitive Performance of Young Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly used in neuropsychological assessments due to its ability to simulate real-world environments. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the Trail Making Test in VR (TMT-VR) and investigate the effects of different interaction modes and gaming skills on cognitive performance. A total of 71 young female and male adults (aged 18-35) with high and low gaming skills participated in this study. Participants completed the TMT-VR using three interaction modes as follows: eye tracking, head movement, and controller. Performance metrics included task completion time and accuracy. User experience, usability, and acceptability of TMT-VR were also examined. Results showed that both eye tracking and head movement modes significantly outperformed the controller in terms of task completion time and accuracy. No significant differences were found between eye tracking and head movement modes. Gaming skills did not significantly influence task performance using any interaction mode. The TMT-VR demonstrates high usability, acceptability, and user experience among participants. The findings suggest that VR-based assessments can effectively measure cognitive performance without being influenced by prior gaming skills, indicating potential applicability for diverse populations.</description>

      <title>DIP: Diffusion Learning of Inconsistency Pattern for General DeepFake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of deepfake generation techniques, the importance of deepfake detection in protecting multimedia content integrity has become increasingly obvious. Recently, temporal inconsistency clues have been explored to improve the generalizability of deepfake video detection. According to our observation, the temporal artifacts of forged videos in terms of motion information usually exhibits quite distinct inconsistency patterns along horizontal and vertical directions, which could be leveraged to improve the generalizability of detectors. In this paper, a transformer-based framework for Diffusion Learning of Inconsistency Pattern (DIP) is proposed, which exploits directional inconsistencies for deepfake video detection. Specifically, DIP begins with a spatiotemporal encoder to represent spatiotemporal information. A directional inconsistency decoder is adopted accordingly, where direction-aware attention and inconsistency diffusion are incorporated to explore potential inconsistency patterns and jointly learn the inherent relationships. In addition, the SpatioTemporal Invariant Loss (STI Loss) is introduced to contrast spatiotemporally augmented sample pairs and prevent the model from overfitting nonessential forgery artifacts. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method could effectively identify directional forgery clues and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Audio Is the Achilles' Heel: Red Teaming Audio Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated the ability to interact with humans under real-world conditions by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and modality encoders to align multimodal information (visual and auditory) with text. However, such models raise new safety challenges of whether models that are safety-aligned on text also exhibit consistent safeguards for multimodal inputs. Despite recent safety-alignment research on vision LMMs, the safety of audio LMMs remains under-explored. In this work, we comprehensively red team the safety of five advanced audio LMMs under three settings: (i) harmful questions in both audio and text formats, (ii) harmful questions in text format accompanied by distracting non-speech audio, and (iii) speech-specific jailbreaks. Our results under these settings demonstrate that open-source audio LMMs suffer an average attack success rate of 69.14% on harmful audio questions, and exhibit safety vulnerabilities when distracted with non-speech audio noise. Our speech-specific jailbreaks on Gemini-1.5-Pro achieve an attack success rate of 70.67% on the harmful query benchmark. We provide insights on what could cause these reported safety-misalignments.

      <title>'No' Matters: Out-of-Distribution Detection in Multimodality Long Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in multimodal contexts is essential for identifying deviations in combined inputs from different modalities, particularly in applications like open-domain dialogue systems or real-life dialogue interactions. This paper aims to improve the user experience that involves multi-round long dialogues by efficiently detecting OOD dialogues and images. We introduce a novel scoring framework named Dialogue Image Aligning and Enhancing Framework (DIAEF) that integrates the visual language models with the novel proposed scores that detect OOD in two key scenarios (1) mismatches between the dialogue and image input pair and (2) input pairs with previously unseen labels. Our experimental results, derived from various benchmarks, demonstrate that integrating image and multi-round dialogue OOD detection is more effective with previously unseen labels than using either modality independently. In the presence of mismatched pairs, our proposed score effectively identifies these mismatches and demonstrates strong robustness in long dialogues. This approach enhances domain-aware, adaptive conversational agents and establishes baselines for future studies.</description>

      <title>Aligning Audio-Visual Joint Representations with an Agentic Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications. While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation. We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference. Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations. The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks.</description>
