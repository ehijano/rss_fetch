      <title>The evolution of insurance purchasing behavior: an empirical study on the adoption of online channels in Poland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how Polish consumers are adapting to online insurance purchasing channels and what factors influence their preferences. Drawing on a structured survey of 100 respondents with varied demographic profiles, the study explores purchasing frequency, channel usage, price sensitivity, trust, and decision-making behaviors. Results indicate a clear shift toward digital tools, with many consumers valuing the speed, convenience, and transparency of online platforms, particularly for simple insurance products. However, barriers remain, including concerns about data security, lack of personal guidance, and difficulty understanding policy terms. A hybrid model is emerging, where online tools are used for research and comparison, while traditional agents are consulted for complex decisions. Respondents emphasized the importance of trust and personal contact, showing that emotional and psychological factors still play a role in digital adoption. Price was the dominant decision factor, but many consumers also prioritized service quality and reliability. The study concludes that insurers should invest in user-friendly digital experiences while maintaining human support options. Strategic omnichannel integration is recommended to meet diverse customer needs and reduce digital exclusion. Limitations of the study include a modest sample size and focus on the Polish market. Future research should investigate the role of AI in digital distribution, segment preferences by insurance type, and analyze trends across different regions or age groups. This paper adds empirical value to the understanding of insurance distribution and consumer behavior in digitally transforming financial markets.</description>

      <title>AI as a Centripetal Technology: Price Compression, Homogenization, and Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI does more than cut costs. It pulls products toward a shared template, making offerings look and feel more alike while making true originality disproportionately expensive. We capture this centripetal force in a standard two-stage differentiated-competition framework and show how a single capability shift simultaneously compresses perceived differences, lowers marginal cost and raises fixed access costs. The intuition is straightforward. When buyers see smaller differences across products, the payoff to standing apart shrinks just as the effort to do so rises, so firms cluster around the template. Prices fall and customers become more willing to switch. But the same homogenization also squeezes operating margins, and rising fixed outlays deepen the squeeze. The combination yields a structural prediction. There is a capability threshold at which even two firms cannot both cover fixed costs, and in a many-firm extension the sustainable number of firms falls as capability grows. Concentration increases, and prices still fall. Our results hold under broader preference shapes, non-uniform consumer densities, outside options, capability-dependent curvatures, and modest asymmetries. We translate the theory into two sufficient statistics for enforcement. On the one hand, a conduct statistic and a viability statistic. Transactions or platform rules that strengthen template pull or raise fixed access and originality costs can lower prices today yet push the market toward monoculture. Remedies that broaden access and promote template plurality and interoperability preserve the price benefits of AI while protecting entry and variety. The paper thus reconciles a live policy paradox. AI can make prices lower and entry harder at the same time. It prescribes what to measure to tell which force is dominant in practice.</description>

      <title>A data fusion approach for mobility hub impact assessment and location selection: integrating hub usage data into a large-scale mode choice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cities grapple with traffic congestion and service inequities, mobility hubs offer a scalable solution to align increasing travel demand with sustainability goals. However, evaluating their impacts remains challenging due to the lack of behavioral models that integrate large-scale travel patterns with real-world hub usage. This study presents a novel data fusion approach that incorporates observed mobility hub usage into a mode choice model estimated with synthetic trip data. We identify trips potentially affected by mobility hubs and construct a multimodal sub-choice set, then calibrate hub-specific parameters using on-site survey data and ground truth trip counts. The enhanced model is used to evaluate mobility hub impacts on potential demand, mode shift, reduced vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and increased consumer surplus (CS). We apply this method to a case study in the Capital District, NY, using data from a survey conducted by the Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) and a mode choice model estimated using Replica Inc. synthetic data. The two implemented hubs located near UAlbany Downtown Campus and in Downtown Cohoes are projected to generate 8.83 and 6.17 multimodal trips per day, reduce annual VMT by 20.37 and 13.16 thousand miles, and increase daily CS by $4,000 and $1,742, respectively. An evaluation of potential hub candidates in the Albany-Schenectady-Troy metropolitan area with the estimated models demonstrates that hubs located along intercity corridors and at urban peripheries, supporting park-and-ride P+R patterns, yield the most significant behavioral impacts.</description>

      <title>How human is the machine? Evidence from 66,000 Conversations with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to replace consumers (e.g., synthetic data), it is often assumed that AI emulates established consumers, and more generally human behaviors. Ten experiments with Large Language Models (LLMs) investigate if this is true in the domain of well-documented biases and heuristics. Across studies we observe four distinct types of deviations from human-like behavior. First, in some cases, LLMs reduce or correct biases observed in humans. Second, in other cases, LLMs amplify these same biases. Third, and perhaps most intriguingly, LLMs sometimes exhibit biases opposite to those found in humans. Fourth, LLMs' responses to the same (or similar) prompts tend to be inconsistent (a) within the same model after a time delay, (b) across models, and (c) among independent research studies. Such inconsistencies can be uncharacteristic of humans and suggest that, at least at one point, LLMs' responses differed from humans. Overall, unhuman-like responses are problematic when LLMs are used to mimic or predict consumer behavior. These findings complement research on synthetic consumer data by showing that sources of bias are not necessarily human-centric. They also contribute to the debate about the tasks for which consumers, and more generally humans, can be replaced by AI.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Volatility of Bank Betas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research has shown banks match interest income and expense betas, and thereby obtain net interest income margins which are insensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The present analysis extends this research in a number of ways. First, we use state-space methods to estimate time-varying betas and test whether they are matched at each time interval. We find substantial variation in interest income and expense betas, which drives variation in net interest margin beta coefficients. Second, we estimate the time-varying conditional volatility of beta forecasts the uncertainty of future beta values. We find uncertainty in interest expense beta coefficients drives uncertainty in interest income betas. Further, large banks have greater expense beta uncertainty, whereas small banks have greater income beta uncertainty. Lastly, we find evidence that uncertainty in interest expense betas is priced by the market, and is negatively related to bank stock prices. This is a new and previously unmeasured source of unhedgeable risk in bank stocks, and highlights an additional benefit of the Federal Reserve's Zero Interest Rate Policy.</description>

      <title>Pursuing decarbonization and competitiveness: a narrow corridor for European green industrial transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes how Europe can decarbonize its industrial sector while remaining competitive. Using the open-source model PyPSA-Eur, it examines key energy- and emission-intensive industries, including steel, cement, methanol, ammonia, and high-value chemicals. Two development paths are explored: a continued decline in industrial activity and a reindustrialization driven by competitiveness policies. The analysis assesses cost gaps between European green products and lower-cost imports, and evaluates strategies such as intra-European relocation, selective imports of green intermediates, and targeted subsidies. Results show that deep industrial decarbonization is technically feasible, led by electrification, but competitiveness depends strongly on policy choices. Imports of green intermediates can lower costs while preserving jobs and production, whereas broad subsidies are economically unsustainable. Effective policy should focus support on sectors like ammonia and steel finishing while maintaining current production levels.</description>

      <title>Modelling and evaluating travel information during disruptions: An illustrative example from Swedish railways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and timely travel information is an asset for enhancing passenger travel experience during normal traffic, and for mitigating the discomforts during disruptions. With longer and more frequent disruptions as well as increasing ridership, traffic delays can incur substantial costs for passengers and other transport stakeholders, e.g., operators and infrastructure managers. Such costs can, however, be reduced thanks to effective travel information strategies during traffic disruptions. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation model to assess the value of travel information under different scenarios. Focusing on real-time travel information to train passengers, accessibility benefits are quantified in monetary terms based on historical delay distributions, timing of travel information (pre/on-trip) and ridership. Using a case study from the Swedish railways, the model is showcased and applied to a commuter line in Stockholm. The experimental results indicate individual valuations that are higher than references and savings at the system level of at least 23% of the delay costs. Further testing of the model, e.g., on larger-scale scenarios, and including transfer trips, is a possible direction for future works.</description>

      <title>Bloated Disclosures: Can ChatGPT Help Investors Process Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10224v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT can fundamentally change the way investors process information. We probe the economic usefulness of these tools in summarizing complex corporate disclosures using the stock market as a laboratory. The unconstrained summaries are remarkably shorter compared to the originals, whereas their information content is amplified. When a document has a positive (negative) sentiment, its summary becomes more positive (negative). Importantly, the summaries are more effective at explaining stock market reactions to the disclosed information. Motivated by these findings, we propose a measure of information ``bloat." We show that bloated disclosure is associated with adverse capital market consequences, such as lower price efficiency and higher information asymmetry. Finally, we show that the model is effective at constructing targeted summaries that identify firms' (non-)financial performance. Collectively, our results indicate that generative AI adds considerable value for investors with information processing constraints.</description>

      <title>A Branch-Price-Cut-And-Switch Approach for Optimizing Team Formation and Routing for Airport Baggage Handling Tasks with Stochastic Travel Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In airport operations, optimally using dedicated personnel for baggage handling tasks plays a crucial role in the design of resource-efficient processes. Teams of workers with different qualifications must be formed, and loading or unloading tasks must be assigned to them. Each task has a time window within which it can be started and should be finished. Violating these temporal restrictions incurs severe financial penalties for the operator. In practice, various components of this process are subject to uncertainties. We consider the aforementioned problem under the assumption of stochastic travel times across the apron. We present two binary program formulations to model the problem at hand and propose a novel solution approach that we call Branch-Price-Cut-and-Switch, in which we dynamically switch between two master problem formulations. Furthermore, we use an exact separation method to identify violated rank-1 Chv\'atal-Gomory cuts and utilize an efficient branching rule relying on task finish times. We test the algorithm on instances generated based on real-world data from a major European hub airport with a planning horizon of up to two hours, 30 flights per hour, and three available task execution modes to choose from. Our results indicate that our algorithm is able to significantly outperform existing solution approaches. Moreover, an explicit consideration of stochastic travel times allows for solutions that utilize the available workforce more efficiently, while simultaneously guaranteeing a stable service level for the baggage handling operator.</description>
