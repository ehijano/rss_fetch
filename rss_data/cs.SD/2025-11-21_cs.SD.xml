      <title>SceneGuard: Training-Time Voice Protection with Scene-Consistent Audible Background Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice cloning technology poses significant privacy threats by enabling unauthorized speech synthesis from limited audio samples. Existing defenses based on imperceptible adversarial perturbations are vulnerable to common audio preprocessing such as denoising and compression. We propose SceneGuard, a training-time voice protection method that applies scene-consistent audible background noise to speech recordings. Unlike imperceptible perturbations, SceneGuard leverages naturally occurring acoustic scenes (e.g., airport, street, park) to create protective noise that is contextually appropriate and robust to countermeasures. We evaluate SceneGuard on text-to-speech training attacks, demonstrating 5.5% speaker similarity degradation with extremely high statistical significance (p &lt; 10^{-15}, Cohen's d = 2.18) while preserving 98.6% speech intelligibility (STOI = 0.986). Robustness evaluation shows that SceneGuard maintains or enhances protection under five common countermeasures including MP3 compression, spectral subtraction, lowpass filtering, and downsampling. Our results suggest that audible, scene-consistent noise provides a more robust alternative to imperceptible perturbations for training-time voice protection.

      <title>Difficulty-Controlled Simplification of Piano Scores with Synthetic Data for Inclusive Music Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its potential, AI advances in music education are hindered by proprietary systems that limit the democratization of technology in this domain. In particular, AI-driven music difficulty adjustment is especially promising, as simplifying complex pieces can make music education more inclusive and accessible to learners of all ages and contexts. Nevertheless, recent efforts have relied on proprietary datasets, which prevents the research community from reproducing, comparing, or extending the current state of the art. In addition, while these generative methods offer great potential, most of them use the MIDI format, which, unlike others, such as MusicXML, lacks readability and layout information, thereby limiting their practical use for human performers. This work introduces a transformer-based method for adjusting the difficulty of MusicXML piano scores. Unlike previous methods, which rely on annotated datasets, we propose a synthetic dataset composed of pairs of piano scores ordered by estimated difficulty, with each pair comprising a more challenging and easier arrangement of the same piece. We generate these pairs by creating variations conditioned on the same melody and harmony and leverage pretrained models to assess difficulty and style, ensuring appropriate pairing. The experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed approach, showing accurate control of playability and target difficulty, as highlighted through qualitative and quantitative evaluations. In contrast to previous work, we openly release all resources (code, dataset, and models), ensuring reproducibility while fostering open-source innovation to help bridge the digital divide.</description>

      <title>Step-Audio-R1 Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.</description>

      <title>MMVA: Multimodal Matching Based on Valence and Arousal across Images, Music, and Musical Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Multimodal Matching based on Valence and Arousal (MMVA), a tri-modal encoder framework designed to capture emotional content across images, music, and musical captions. To support this framework, we expand the Image-Music-Emotion-Matching-Net (IMEMNet) dataset, creating IMEMNet-C which includes 24,756 images and 25,944 music clips with corresponding musical captions. We employ multimodal matching scores based on the continuous valence (emotional positivity) and arousal (emotional intensity) values. This continuous matching score allows for random sampling of image-music pairs during training by computing similarity scores from the valence-arousal values across different modalities. Consequently, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in valence-arousal prediction tasks. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates its efficacy in various zeroshot tasks, highlighting the potential of valence and arousal predictions in downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Decoding Deception: Understanding Automatic Speech Recognition Vulnerabilities in Evasion and Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of Automatic Speech Recognition systems to adversarial examples, which can deceive these systems into misinterpreting input speech commands. While previous research has primarily focused on white-box attacks with constrained optimizations, and transferability based black-box attacks against commercial Automatic Speech Recognition devices, this paper explores cost efficient white-box attack and non transferability black-box adversarial attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition systems, drawing insights from approaches such as Fast Gradient Sign Method and Zeroth-Order Optimization. Further, the novelty of the paper includes how poisoning attack can degrade the performances of state-of-the-art models leading to misinterpretation of audio signals. Through experimentation and analysis, we illustrate how hybrid models can generate subtle yet impactful adversarial examples with very little perturbation having Signal Noise Ratio of 35dB that can be generated within a minute. These vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art open source model have practical security implications, and emphasize the need for adversarial security.</description>

      <title>Pitch Estimation With Mean Averaging Smoothed Product Spectrum And Musical Consonance Evaluation Using MASP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces Mean Averaging Smoothed Product (MASP) Spectrum, which is a modified version of the Harmonic Product Spectrum, designed to enhance pitch estimation for many algorithm-wise deceptive frequency spectra that still lead clear pitches, for both harmonic and inharmonic cases. By introducing a global mean based smoothing for spectrum, the MASP algorithm diminishes the unwanted sensitivity of HPS for spectra with missing partials. The method exhibited robust pitch estimations consistent with perceptual expectations. Motivated upon the strong correlation between consonance and periodicity, the same algorithm is extended and, with the proposition of a harmonicity measure (H), used to evaluate musical consonance for two and three tones; yielding consonance hierarchies that align with perception and practice of music theory. These findings suggest that perception of pitch and consonance may share a similar underlying mechanism that depend on spectrum.</description>

      <title>AcousTools: A 'Full-Stack', Python-Based, Acoustic Holography Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07336v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic Holography is an emerging field where mid-air ultrasound is controlled and manipulated for novel and exciting applications. These range from mid-air haptics, volumetric displays, contactless fabrication, and even chemical and biomedical applications such as drug delivery. To develop these applications, a software framework to predict acoustic behaviour and simulating resulting effects, such as applied forces or scattering patterns is desirable. There have been various software libraries and platforms that attempt to fill this role, but there is yet to be a single piece of software that acts as a 'full-stack' solution. We define this full-stack as the process from abstraction to physicalisation starting with setup, modelling acoustic propagation, transducer phase retrieval, sound field analysis, and control of the acoustic holographic hardware itself. Existing methods fail to fulfil one or more of these categories. To address this, we present AcousTools, a Python-based acoustic holography library, designed to support the full suite of acoustic holographic applications and we show AcousTools's ability to meet each step of the full-stack's requirements. AcousTools has the potential to become the standard code library for acoustic holography, with the uniquely complete suite of features wrapped in a language that is known to be easy to use, AcousTools will increase the ability for researchers to develop novel applications as well as accurately review other's work. The full-stack, aside from software, will also be useful for researchers - providing a way to view and compare methodologies by understanding where they fit into the stack.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Discrete Speech Tokens: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has established discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm for speech representation. These tokens, characterized by their discrete, compact, and concise nature, are not only advantageous for efficient transmission and storage, but also inherently compatible with the language modeling framework, enabling seamless integration of speech into text-dominated LLM architectures. Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: acoustic tokens and semantic tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches. This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types. Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens.</description>

      <title>UniVoice: Unifying Autoregressive ASR and Flow-Matching based TTS with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems, gradually becoming the mainstream approach. However, most current approaches address these tasks separately rather than through a unified framework. This work aims to integrate these two tasks into one unified model. Although discrete speech tokenization enables joint modeling, its inherent information loss limits performance in both recognition and generation. In this work, we present UniVoice, a unified LLM framework through continuous representations that seamlessly integrates speech recognition and synthesis within a single model. Our approach combines the strengths of autoregressive modeling for speech recognition with flow matching for high-quality generation. To mitigate the inherent divergence between autoregressive and flow-matching models, we further design a dual attention mechanism, which switches between a causal mask for recognition and a bidirectional attention mask for synthesis. Furthermore, the proposed text-prefix-conditioned speech infilling method enables high-fidelity zero-shot voice cloning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve or exceed current single-task modeling methods in both ASR and zero-shot TTS tasks. This work explores new possibilities for end-to-end speech understanding and generation. Code is available at https://github.com/gwh22/UniVoice.</description>

      <title>Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.</description>

      <title>FxSearcher: gradient-free text-driven audio transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving diverse and high-quality audio transformations from text prompts remains challenging, as existing methods are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on a limited set of differentiable audio effects. This paper proposes FxSearcher, a novel gradient-free framework that discovers the optimal configuration of audio effects (FX) to transform a source signal according to a text prompt. Our method employs Bayesian Optimization and CLAP-based score function to perform this search efficiently. Furthermore, a guiding prompt is introduced to prevent undesirable artifacts and enhance human preference. To objectively evaluate our method, we propose an AI-based evaluation framework. The results demonstrate that the highest scores achieved by our method on these metrics align closely with human preferences. Demos are available at https://hojoonki.github.io/FxSearcher/</description>
