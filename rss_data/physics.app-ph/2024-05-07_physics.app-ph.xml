      <title>AniMAIRE -- A New Openly Available Tool for Calculating Atmospheric Ionising Radiation Dose Rates and Single Event Effects During Anisotropic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Occasionally an eruption occurs on the surface of the Sun, ejecting high energy particles into the solar system in what are known as solar particle events. If this eruption of particles happens to hit Earth and have a sufficiently high kinetic energy, the particles can penetrate Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere, creating particle radiation showers that increase radiation dose rates in Earth's atmosphere. These situations are known as Ground-Level Enhancements (GLEs), which typically occur once every few years. GLEs can cause aircraft electronics issues and cause passengers and crew to experience heightened radiation doses. In this paper, we describe a new, openly available model we've created to calculate dose rates in the atmosphere during GLEs, called AniMAIRE. Most models that currently exist can only calculate radiation dose rates when all particles are hitting Earth equally from all directions, however this approximation is generally only reliable during the later stages of events, and isn't accurate for many GLEs. AniMAIRE has been designed so it doesn't require this approximation, and can calculate dose rates for situations where it's supplied a direction-dependent particle flux. We also analyse the dose rate maps AniMAIRE produces when running across the GLE from 2012, finding several interesting results.</description>

      <title>Research on signalized intersection mixed traffic flow platoon control method considering Backward-looking effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) technology facilitates the advancement of intelligent transportation. However, intelligent control techniques for mixed traffic flow at signalized intersections involving both CAVs and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) require further investigation into the impact of backward-looking effect. This paper proposes the concept of 1+n+1 mixed platoon considering the backward-looking effect, consisting of one leading CAV, n following HDVs, and one trailing CAV. The leading and trailing CAVs collectively guide the movement of intermediate HDVs at intersections, forming an optimal control framework for platoon-based CAVs at signalized intersections. Initially, a linearized dynamic model for the 1+n+1 mixed platoon is established and compared with a benchmark model focusing solely on controlling the lead vehicle. Subsequently, constraints are formulated for the optimal control framework, aiming to enhance overall intersection traffic efficiency and fuel economy by directly controlling the leading and trailing CAVs in the platoon. Finally, extensive numerical simulations compare vehicle throughput and fuel consumption at signalized intersections under different mixed platoon control methods, validating that considering both front and backward-looking effects in the mixed platoon control method outperforms traditional methods focusing solely on the lead CAV.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Current Concentration of Buffer Layer Material for Cable Ablation Failure: Role of Random Fiber Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the buffer layer ablation failures of high voltage cables are frequently reported by the power systems. Previous studies have dominantly regarded the buffer layer as the continuous homogeneous medium, whereas neglects its microstructures. In this paper, the current distribution within the random fiber networks of buffer layer are investigated. Experiment results of our self-designed platform revealed an uneven current distribution in buffer layer at the moment of bearing current. This phenomenon is named as the intrinsic current concentration where the current density concentrates at certain sites inner the buffer layer. And the degree of current concentration will be suppressed by compressing the sample. Then, a 2D simulation model of the random fiber networks was constructed based on the Mikado model. The simulation results also presented an uneven current distribution in the networks whose every fiber can be viewed as a micro-resistor. Two types of dimensionless current concentration factors were defined to describe the degree of current concentration, finding their values decreasing with the rise of fiber density. Meanwhile, it is equivalent of compressing the buffer layer and increasing the fiber density of model. We believe that the intrinsic current concentration phenomenon is mainly related with the inhomogeneity of geometry structure of buffer layer. The ablation traces and fracture fibers observed by the X-ray micro-computed tomography test supported this point. In addition, the non-ideal surface of sample can also induce this phenomenon. The intrinsic current concentration can aggravate the degree of originally existed macroscopic current concentration in cables, thus causing the ablation failure. Our work may unveil a deeper understanding on the cable ablation failure and the electrical response of the similar fibrous materials.</description>

Abstract: The quantum mechanical tunneling through multiple quantum barriers is a long-standing and well-known problem. Three methods proposed earlier to calculate the tunneling probabilities and energy splitting: (1). Instanton Method (2) WKb Approximation (3) Numerical Calculation.Instaton method is helpful to understand the physical insight of quantum tunneling but the validity is restricted to the case of large separation between the two potential minima. WKB approximation is widely used in its simple mathematical form, but the result is inaccurate due to its inherent defect in connection formula. Recently WKB approximation has been developed by changing the phase lose at the classical turning points but no above approximation have provide the perfect result to the best of knowledge of Author. Using numerical methods, one can get the solution up to the desired accuracy, but a considerable deal of physical insight is lost in this process. In this paper, the Author presented the developmentof models of multiple quantum wells or barriers potential by using analytical Transfer matrix method (TMM), which has been applied to any arbitrary potential wells and barriers successfully. The author applied the above theory to three electronic device models and got satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>Photonic Millimeter-wave Generation Beyond the Cavity Thermal Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation communications, radar and navigation systems will extend and exploit the higher bandwidth of the millimeter-wave domain for increased communication data rates as well as radar with higher sensitivity and increased spatial resolution. However, realizing these advantages will require the generation of millimeter-wave signals with low phase noise in simple and compact form-factors. The rapidly developing field of photonic integration addresses this challenge and provides a path toward simplified and portable, low-noise mm-wave generation for these applications. We leverage these advances by heterodyning two silicon photonic chip lasers, phase-locked to the same miniature Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity to demonstrate a simple framework for generating low-noise millimeter-waves with phase noise below the thermal limit of the F-P cavity. Specifically, we generate 94.5 GHz and 118.1 GHz millimeter-wave signals with phase noise of -117 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset, decreasing to -120 dBc/Hz at 40 kHz offset, a record low value for such photonic devices. We achieve this with existing technologies that can be integrated into a platform less than $\approx$ 10 mL in volume. Our work illustrates the significant potential and advantages of low size, weight, and power (SWaP) photonic-sourced mm-waves for communications and sensing.</description>

      <title>A Thin Film Lithium Niobate Near-Infrared Platform for Multiplexing Quantum Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practical quantum networks will require quantum nodes consisting of many memory qubits. This in turn will increase the complexity of the photonic circuits needed to control each qubit and will require strategies to multiplex memories and overcome the inhomogeneous distribution of their transition frequencies. Integrated photonics operating at visible to near-infrared (VNIR) wavelength range, compatible with the transition frequencies of leading quantum memory systems, can provide solutions to these needs. In this work, we realize a VNIR thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) integrated photonics platform with the key components to meet these requirements. These include low-loss couplers ($&lt;$ 1 dB/facet), switches ($&gt;$ 20 dB extinction), and high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators ($&gt;$ 50 GHz). With these devices we demonstrate high-efficiency and CW-compatible frequency shifting ($&gt;$ 50 $\%$ efficiency at 15 GHz), as well as simultaneous laser amplitude and frequency control through a nested modulator structure. Finally, we highlight an architecture for multiplexing quantum memories using the demonstrated TFLN components, and outline how this platform can enable a 2-order of magnitude improvement in entanglement rates over single memory nodes. Our results demonstrate that TFLN can meet the necessary performance and scalability benchmarks to enable large-scale quantum nodes.</description>

      <title>Economic Complexity in Mono-Partite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initially designed to predict and explain the economic trajectories of countries, cities, and regions, economic complexity has been found applicable in diverse contexts such as ecology and chess openings. The success of economic complexity stems from its capacity to assess hidden capabilities within a system indirectly. The existing algorithms for economic complexity operate only when the underlying interaction topology conforms to a bipartite graph. A single link disrupting the bipartite structure renders these algorithms inapplicable, even if the weight of that link is tiny compared to others. This paper presents a novel extension of economic complexity to encompass any graph, overcoming the constraints of bipartite structures. Additionally, it introduces fitness centrality and orthofitness centrality as new centrality measures in graphs. Fitness Centrality emerges as a promising metric for assessing node vulnerability, akin to node betweenness centrality. Furthermore, we unveil the cost functions that drive the minimization procedures underlying the economic complexity index and fitness centrality algorithms. This extension broadens the scope of economic complexity analysis, enabling its application in diverse network structures beyond bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>ChemPlasKin: a general-purpose program for unified gas and plasma kinetics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces ChemPlasKin, a freely accessible solver optimized for zero-dimensional (0D) simulations of chemical kinetics of neutral gas in non-equilibrium plasma environments. By integrating the electron Boltzmann equation solver, CppBOLOS, with the open-source combustion library, Cantera, at the source code level, ChemPlasKin computes time-resolved evolution of species concentration and gas temperature in a unified gas-plasma kinetics framework. The model allows high fidelity predictions of both chemical thermal effects and plasma-induced heating, including fast gas heating and slower vibrational-translational relaxation processes. Additionally, a new heat loss model is developed for nanosecond pulsed discharges, specifically within pin-pin electrode configurations. With its versatility, ChemPlasKin is well-suited for a wide range of applications, from plasma-assisted combustion (PAC) to fuel reforming. In this paper, the reliability, accuracy and efficiency of ChemPlasKin are validated through a number of test problems, demonstrating its utility in advancing gas-plasma kinetic studies.</description>

      <title>High velocity solid dust impacts on tiles of tokamak-relevant temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Runaway electron incidence on plasma facing components triggers explosive events that are accompanied by the expulsion of fast solid debris. Subsequent dust-wall high speed impacts constitute a mechanism of wall damage and dust destruction. Empirical damage laws that can be employed for erosion estimates are based on room-temperature impact experiments. We use light-gas gun shooting systems to accelerate solid tungsten dust to near-supersonic speeds towards bulk tungsten targets that are maintained at different temperatures. This concerns targets cooled down to $-100^{\circ}$C with liquid nitrogen and targets resistively heated up to $400^{\circ}$C. Post-mortem surface analysis reveals that the three erosion regimes (plastic deformation, bonding, partial disintegration) weakly depend on the target temperature within the investigated range. It is concluded that empirical damage laws based on room-temperature measurements can be safely employed for predictions.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the deposition of $\alpha$-tantalum (110) films on a-plane sapphire substrate by molecular beam epitaxy for superconducting circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polycrystalline {\alpha}-tantalum (110) films deposited on c-plane sapphire substrate by sputtering are used in superconducting qubits nowadays. However, these films always occasionally form other structures, such as {\alpha}-tantalum (111) grains and \b{eta}-tantalum grains. To improve the film quality, we investigate the growth of {\alpha}-tantalum (110) films on a-plane sapphire substrate under varying conditions by molecular beam epitaxy technology. The optimized {\alpha}-tantalum (110) film is single crystal, with a smooth surface and atomically flat metal-substrate interface. The film with thickness of 30 nm shows a Tc of 4.12K and a high residual resistance ratio of 9.53. The quarter wavelength coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated with the 150 nm optimized {\alpha}-tantalum (110) film, exhibits intrinsic quality factor of over one million under single photon excitation at millikelvin temperature.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Si:S barrier infrared detector with broadband response up to 4.4{\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mid-infrared spectrum is a critical tool for chemical analysis, industrial inspection, environment, and other fields due to its rich chemical bond information. However, the complicated growth or fabrication procedures of existing mid-infrared sensitive materials hinder the large-scale production and utilization of mid-infrared detectors. To address this issue, we developed Si:S barrier detectors employing sulfur doped silicon and a sophisticated band barrier design. Since the transport of dark current and photo current is separated, the barrier design effectively suppresses the dark current while allowing the photo current to leverage gain mechanisms, thereby substantially improving signal-to-noise ratio. As a result, the detector exhibits an infrared response range covering from 1.12 to 4.4{\mu}m with a peak at 3.3{\mu}m, excluding its intrinsic response in visible range. Its peak quantum efficiency surpasses that of the best mid-infrared silicon-based detector reported to date by an order of magnitude, reaching 2% at room temperature. The peak detectivity at 90K is 1.4E11 Jones @1.4V and decreases to 4.4E9 Jones @1.4V, 210K, comparable to the typical III-V and IV-VI photodetectors at one thousandth fabrication cost. Leveraging the well-established silicon-based manufacturing process, this device holds promise for large-scale production at a reduced price, offering a cost-effective solution for future mid-infrared detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) must take finite-size effects and composable aspects into consideration. This is also the case for continuous-variable (CV) protocols which are based on the transmission and detection of bosonic coherent states. In this paper, we refine and advance the previous theory in this area providing a more rigorous formulation for the composable key rate of a generic CV-QKD protocol. Thanks to these theoretical refinements, our general formulas allow us to prove more optimistic key rates with respect to previous literature.</description>

      <title>High Dynamic Range Vector Atomic Magnetometer with 1 part-per-billion Resolution in Earth Field Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a high-dynamic-range vector atomic magnetometer based on applying a fast-rotating magnetic field to a pulsed $^{87}$Rb scalar atomic magnetometer. This method enables simultaneous measurements of the total magnetic field and two polar angles relative to the plane of magnetic field rotation. Using two channels in a gradiometer mode, it provides simultaneous measurements of the total field gradient with a sensitivity of 50 $\mathrm{fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ (1 part per billion), as well as two polar angles with resolutions of 8 $\mathrm{nrad/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 50 $\mu$T Earth field strength. The noise spectrums of these measurements are flat down to 1 Hz and 0.1 Hz, respectively. Crucially, this approach avoids several metrological difficulties associated with vector magnetometers and gradiometers. We detail the fundamental, systematic, and practical limits of such vector magnetometers. Notably, we provide a comprehensive study of the systematic effects of vector atomic magnetometers. We introduce a new concept of dynamic heading error and investigate several other systematic effects. A unique cosine-altering rotating field modulation is proposed to cancel out these systematics. Additionally, we derive fundamental limits on the sensitivity of such sensors and demonstrate that the vector sensitivity of the sensor can approach its scalar sensitivity while retaining the accuracy and metrological advantages of scalar sensors. This high-dynamic-range vector magnetometer, with ultrahigh resolution and inherent calibration, is suitable for a wide array of applications.</description>

      <title>GaSb-based Interband Cascade Laser with hybrid superlattice plasmon-enhanced claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an interband cascade laser (ICL) emitting at 5.2 {\mu}m consisting of an 8-stage active region and a hybrid cladding composed of outer plasmon-enhanced InAs_0.915 Sb_0.085 and inner InAs/AlSb superlattice claddings. The hybrid cladding architecture shows an increase in mode-confinement in the active region by 11.2 % according to the simulation. This is a consequence of a significantly lower refractive index of plasmon-enhanced claddings. The threshold current density is 242 A/cm^2 in pulsed operation at room temperature. This is the lowest value reported to date for ICLs emitting at wavelengths longer than 5 {\mu}m. We also report close to record value threshold power density of 840 W/cm^2 for ICLs at such wavelengths.</description>

Abstract: Atmospheric interaction with light has been an area of fascination for many researchers over the last century. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and wind speed, heavily influence the complex and rapidly varying optical distortions propagating optical fields experience. The continuous random phase fluctuations commonly make deciphering the exact origins of specific optical aberrations challenging. The generation of eddies is a major contributor to atmospheric turbulence, similar in geometric structure to optical vortices that sit at the centre of OAM beams. Decomposing the received optical fields into OAM provides a unique spatial similarity that can be used to analyse turbulent channels. In this work, we present a novel mode decomposition assisted machine learning approach that reveals trainable features in the distortions of vortex beams that allow for effective environmental monitoring. This novel technique can be used reliably with Support Vector Machine regression models to measure temperature variations of 0.49C and wind speed variations of 0.029 m/s over a 36m experimental turbulent free-space channels with controllable and verifiable temperature and wind speed with short 3s measurement. The predictable nature of these findings could indicate the presence of an underlying physical relationship between environmental conditions that lead to specific eddy formation and the OAM spiral spectra.</description>
