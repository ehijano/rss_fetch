      <title>Doing Battle with the Sun: Lessons From LEO and Operating a Satellite Constellation in the Elevated Atmospheric Drag Environment of Solar Cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capella Space, which designs, builds, and operates a constellation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Earth-imaging small satellites, faced new challenges with the onset of Solar Cycle 25. By mid-2022, it had become clear that solar activity levels were far exceeding the 2019 prediction published by the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration's (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). This resulted in the atmospheric density of low Earth orbit (LEO) increasing 2-3x higher than predicted. While this raises difficulties for all satellite operators, Capella's satellites are especially sensitive to aerodynamic drag due to the high surface area of their large deployable radar reflectors. This unpredicted increase in drag threatened premature deorbit and reentry of some of Capella's fleet of spacecraft.
  This paper explores Capella's strategic response to this problem at all layers of the satellite lifecycle, examining the engineering challenges and insights gained from adapting an operational constellation to rapidly changing space weather conditions. A key development was the implementation of "low drag mode", which increased on-orbit satellite lifetime by 24% and decreased accumulated momentum from aerodynamic torques by 20-30%. The paper shares operational tradeoffs and lessons from the development, deployment, and validation of this flight mode, offering valuable insights for satellite operators facing similar challenges in LEO's current elevated drag environment.</description>

      <title>The unresolved mystery of dust particle swarms within the magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early-generation in-situ dust detectors in near-Earth space have reported the occurrence of clusters of sub-micron dust particles that seemed unrelated to human spaceflight activities. In particular, data from the impact ionization detector onboard the HEOS-2 satellite indicate that such swarms of particles occur throughout the Earth's magnetosphere up to altitudes of 60,000 km -- far beyond regions typically used by spacecraft. Further account of high-altitude clusters has since been given by the GEO-deployed GORID detector, however, explanations for the latter have so far only been sought in GEO spaceflight activity.
  This perspective piece reviews dust cluster detections in near-Earth space, emphasizing the natural swarm creation mechanism conjectured to explain the HEOS-2 data -- that is, the electrostatic disruption of meteoroids. Highlighting this mechanism offers a novel viewpoint on more recent near-Earth dust measurements. We further show that the impact clusters observed by both HEOS-2 and GORID are correlated with increased geomagnetic activity. This consistent correlation supports the notion that both sets of observations stem from the same underlying phenomenon and aligns with the hypothesis of the electrostatic breakup origin. We conclude that the nature of these peculiar swarms remains highly uncertain, advocating for their concerted investigation by forthcoming dust science endeavours, such as the JAXA/DLR DESTINY+ mission.</description>
