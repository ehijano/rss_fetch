      <title>Decoupling Training-Free Guided Diffusion by ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the conditional generation problem by guiding off-the-shelf unconditional diffusion models with differentiable loss functions in a plug-and-play fashion. While previous research has primarily focused on balancing the unconditional diffusion model and the guided loss through a tuned weight hyperparameter, we propose a novel framework that distinctly decouples these two components. Specifically, we introduce two variables ${x}$ and ${z}$, to represent the generated samples governed by the unconditional generation model and the guidance function, respectively. This decoupling reformulates conditional generation into two manageable subproblems, unified by the constraint ${x} = {z}$. Leveraging this setup, we develop a new algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to adaptively balance these components. Additionally, we establish the equivalence between the diffusion reverse step and the proximal operator of ADMM and provide a detailed convergence analysis of our algorithm under certain mild assumptions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method ADMMDiff consistently generates high-quality samples while ensuring strong adherence to the conditioning criteria. It outperforms existing methods across a range of conditional generation tasks, including image generation with various guidance and controllable motion synthesis.</description>

      <title>Faster Multi-GPU Training with PPLL: A Pipeline Parallelism Framework Leveraging Local Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, training large-scale deep learning models is typically achieved through parallel training across multiple GPUs. However, due to the inherent communication overhead and synchronization delays in traditional model parallelism methods, seamless parallel training cannot be achieved, which, to some extent, affects overall training efficiency. To address this issue, we present PPLL (Pipeline Parallelism based on Local Learning), a novel framework that leverages local learning algorithms to enable effective parallel training across multiple GPUs. PPLL divides the model into several distinct blocks, each allocated to a separate GPU. By utilizing queues to manage data transfers between GPUs, PPLL ensures seamless cross-GPU communication, allowing multiple blocks to execute forward and backward passes in a pipelined manner. This design minimizes idle times and prevents bottlenecks typically caused by sequential gradient updates, thereby accelerating the overall training process. We validate PPLL through extensive experiments using ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and STL-10 datasets. Our results demonstrate that PPLL significantly enhances the training speed of the local learning method while achieving comparable or even superior training speed to traditional pipeline parallelism (PP) without sacrificing model performance. In a 4-GPU training setup, PPLL accelerated local learning training on ViT and ResNet by 162% and 33%, respectively, achieving 1.25x and 0.85x the speed of traditional pipeline parallelism.</description>

      <title>FGP: Feature-Gradient-Prune for Efficient Convolutional Layer Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce computational overhead while maintaining model performance, model pruning techniques have been proposed. Among these, structured pruning, which removes entire convolutional channels or layers, significantly enhances computational efficiency and is compatible with hardware acceleration. However, existing pruning methods that rely solely on image features or gradients often result in the retention of redundant channels, negatively impacting inference efficiency. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel pruning method called Feature-Gradient Pruning (FGP). This approach integrates both feature-based and gradient-based information to more effectively evaluate the importance of channels across various target classes, enabling a more accurate identification of channels that are critical to model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves both model compactness and practicality while maintaining stable performance. Experiments conducted across multiple tasks and datasets show that FGP significantly reduces computational costs and minimizes accuracy loss compared to existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in optimizing pruning outcomes.

      <title>Med-2E3: A 2D-Enhanced 3D Medical Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of 3D medical images is crucial for modern healthcare, yet traditional task-specific models are becoming increasingly inadequate due to limited generalizability across diverse clinical scenarios. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a promising solution to these challenges. However, existing MLLMs have limitations in fully leveraging the rich, hierarchical information embedded in 3D medical images. Inspired by clinical practice, where radiologists focus on both 3D spatial structure and 2D planar content, we propose Med-2E3, a novel MLLM for 3D medical image analysis that integrates 3D and 2D encoders. To aggregate 2D features more effectively, we design a Text-Guided Inter-Slice (TG-IS) scoring module, which scores the attention of each 2D slice based on slice contents and task instructions. To the best of our knowledge, Med-2E3 is the first MLLM to integrate both 3D and 2D features for 3D medical image analysis. Experiments on a large-scale, open-source 3D medical multimodal benchmark demonstrate that Med-2E3 exhibits task-specific attention distribution and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art models, with a 14% improvement in report generation and a 5% gain in medical visual question answering (VQA), highlighting the model's potential in addressing complex multimodal clinical tasks. The code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Joint Vision-Language Social Bias Removal for CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language (V-L) pre-trained models such as CLIP show prominent capabilities in various downstream tasks. Despite this promise, V-L models are notoriously limited by their inherent social biases. A typical demonstration is that V-L models often produce biased predictions against specific groups of people, significantly undermining their real-world applicability. Existing approaches endeavor to mitigate the social bias problem in V-L models by removing biased attribute information from model embeddings. However, after our revisiting of these methods, we find that their bias removal is frequently accompanied by greatly compromised V-L alignment capabilities. We then reveal that this performance degradation stems from the unbalanced debiasing in image and text embeddings. To address this issue, we propose a novel V-L debiasing framework to align image and text biases followed by removing them from both modalities. By doing so, our method achieves multi-modal bias mitigation while maintaining the V-L alignment in the debiased embeddings. Additionally, we advocate a new evaluation protocol that can 1) holistically quantify the model debiasing and V-L alignment ability, and 2) evaluate the generalization of social bias removal models. We believe this work will offer new insights and guidance for future studies addressing the social bias problem in CLIP.</description>

      <title>Visual Cue Enhancement and Dual Low-Rank Adaptation for Efficient Visual Instruction Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents significant challenges, including a reliance on high-level visual features that limits fine-grained detail comprehension, and data conflicts that arise from task complexity. To address these issues, we propose an efficient fine-tuning framework with two novel approaches: Vision Cue Enhancement (VCE) and Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (Dual-LoRA). VCE enhances the vision projector by integrating multi-level visual cues, improving the model's ability to capture fine-grained visual features. Dual-LoRA introduces a dual low-rank structure for instruction tuning, decoupling learning into skill and task spaces to enable precise control and efficient adaptation across diverse tasks. Our method simplifies implementation, enhances visual comprehension, and improves adaptability. Experiments on both downstream tasks and general benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Mini-Splatting2: Building 360 Scenes within Minutes via Aggressive Gaussian Densification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the essential challenge of fast scene optimization for Gaussian Splatting. Through a thorough analysis of the geometry modeling process, we reveal that dense point clouds can be effectively reconstructed early in optimization through Gaussian representations. This insight leads to our approach of aggressive Gaussian densification, which provides a more efficient alternative to conventional progressive densification methods. By significantly increasing the number of critical Gaussians, we enhance the model capacity to capture dense scene geometry at the early stage of optimization. This strategy is seamlessly integrated into the Mini-Splatting densification and simplification framework, enabling rapid convergence without compromising quality. Additionally, we introduce visibility culling within Gaussian Splatting, leveraging per-view Gaussian importance as precomputed visibility to accelerate the optimization process. Our Mini-Splatting2 achieves a balanced trade-off among optimization time, the number of Gaussians, and rendering quality, establishing a strong baseline for future Gaussian-Splatting-based works. Our work sets the stage for more efficient, high-quality 3D scene modeling in real-world applications, and the code will be made available no matter acceptance.</description>

      <title>Automated 3D Physical Simulation of Open-world Scene with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D generation models have opened new possibilities for simulating dynamic 3D object movements and customizing behaviors, yet creating this content remains challenging. Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.</description>

      <title>Visual-Oriented Fine-Grained Knowledge Editing for MultiModal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently and cost-effectively correct inaccuracies and update outdated information. Recently, there has been growing interest in extending knowledge editing from Large Language Models (LLMs) to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate both textual and visual information, introducing additional editing complexities. Existing multimodal knowledge editing works primarily focus on text-oriented, coarse-grained scenarios, failing to address the unique challenges posed by multimodal contexts. In this paper, we propose a visual-oriented, fine-grained multimodal knowledge editing task that targets precise editing in images with multiple interacting entities. We introduce the Fine-Grained Visual Knowledge Editing (FGVEdit) benchmark to evaluate this task. Moreover, we propose a Multimodal Scope Classifier-based Knowledge Editor (MSCKE) framework. MSCKE leverages a multimodal scope classifier that integrates both visual and textual information to accurately identify and update knowledge related to specific entities within images. This approach ensures precise editing while preserving irrelevant information, overcoming the limitations of traditional text-only editing methods. Extensive experiments on the FGVEdit benchmark demonstrate that MSCKE outperforms existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in solving the complex challenges of multimodal knowledge editing.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Perception Bias: A Training-Free Approach to Enhance LMM for Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) in high-level visual tasks, their capacity for image quality assessment (IQA) remains limited. One main reason is that LMMs are primarily trained for high-level tasks (e.g., image captioning), emphasizing unified image semantics extraction under varied quality. Such semantic-aware yet quality-insensitive perception bias inevitably leads to a heavy reliance on image semantics when those LMMs are forced for quality rating. In this paper, instead of retraining or tuning an LMM costly, we propose a training-free debiasing framework, in which the image quality prediction is rectified by mitigating the bias caused by image semantics. Specifically, we first explore several semantic-preserving distortions that can significantly degrade image quality while maintaining identifiable semantics. By applying these specific distortions to the query or test images, we ensure that the degraded images are recognized as poor quality while their semantics remain. During quality inference, both a query image and its corresponding degraded version are fed to the LMM along with a prompt indicating that the query image quality should be inferred under the condition that the degraded one is deemed poor quality.This prior condition effectively aligns the LMM's quality perception, as all degraded images are consistently rated as poor quality, regardless of their semantic difference.Finally, the quality scores of the query image inferred under different prior conditions (degraded versions) are aggregated using a conditional probability model. Extensive experiments on various IQA datasets show that our debiasing framework could consistently enhance the LMM performance and the code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>CLIC: Contrastive Learning Framework for Unsupervised Image Complexity Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an essential visual attribute, image complexity affects human image comprehension and directly influences the performance of computer vision tasks. However, accurately assessing and quantifying image complexity faces significant challenges. Previous works needed more generalization capabilities and well-labeled datasets to learn image complexity features. However, creating such datasets requires expensive manual labeling costs, and the models inevitably learn about human subjective biases. To address the above problems, we propose CLIC, an unsupervised framework based on contrastive learning, for learning image complexity representations. The method learns image complexity features on unlabeled data, avoiding the high labeling cost. Specifically, we propose a unique positive and negative sample selection strategy to reinforce the differences in complexity features. At the same time, we introduce an image prior-based Complexity-Aware Loss to constrain the learning process of the model. We conducted extensive experiments for verification, and the results show that CLIC can effectively learn the image complexity representation. CLIC obtained competitive results with supervised methods by fine-tuning on IC9600. In addition, CLIC applied to downstream tasks shows significant performance improvements, demonstrating the potential for application in various real-world scenarios. \href{https://github.com/xauat-liushipeng/CLIC}{code}</description>

      <title>Stylecodes: Encoding Stylistic Information For Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel in image generation, but controlling them remains a challenge. We focus on the problem of style-conditioned image generation. Although example images work, they are cumbersome: srefs (style-reference codes) from MidJourney solve this issue by expressing a specific image style in a short numeric code. These have seen widespread adoption throughout social media due to both their ease of sharing and the fact they allow using an image for style control, without having to post the source images themselves. However, users are not able to generate srefs from their own images, nor is the underlying training procedure public. We propose StyleCodes: an open-source and open-research style encoder architecture and training procedure to express image style as a 20-symbol base64 code. Our experiments show that our encoding results in minimal loss in quality compared to traditional image-to-style techniques.</description>

      <title>Interactive Medical Image Segmentation: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive Medical Image Segmentation (IMIS) has long been constrained by the limited availability of large-scale, diverse, and densely annotated datasets, which hinders model generalization and consistent evaluation across different models. In this paper, we introduce the IMed-361M benchmark dataset, a significant advancement in general IMIS research. First, we collect and standardize over 6.4 million medical images and their corresponding ground truth masks from multiple data sources. Then, leveraging the strong object recognition capabilities of a vision foundational model, we automatically generated dense interactive masks for each image and ensured their quality through rigorous quality control and granularity management. Unlike previous datasets, which are limited by specific modalities or sparse annotations, IMed-361M spans 14 modalities and 204 segmentation targets, totaling 361 million masks-an average of 56 masks per image. Finally, we developed an IMIS baseline network on this dataset that supports high-quality mask generation through interactive inputs, including clicks, bounding boxes, text prompts, and their combinations. We evaluate its performance on medical image segmentation tasks from multiple perspectives, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability compared to existing interactive segmentation models. To facilitate research on foundational models in medical computer vision, we release the IMed-361M and model at https://github.com/uni-medical/IMIS-Bench.</description>

      <title>What Makes a Good Dataset for Knowledge Distillation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has been a popular and effective method for model compression. One important assumption of KD is that the teacher's original dataset will also be available when training the student. However, in situations such as continual learning and distilling large models trained on company-withheld datasets, having access to the original data may not always be possible. This leads practitioners towards utilizing other sources of supplemental data, which could yield mixed results. One must then ask: "what makes a good dataset for transferring knowledge from teacher to student?" Many would assume that only real in-domain imagery is viable, but is that the only option? In this work, we explore multiple possible surrogate distillation datasets and demonstrate that many different datasets, even unnatural synthetic imagery, can serve as a suitable alternative in KD. From examining these alternative datasets, we identify and present various criteria describing what makes a good dataset for distillation. Source code will be available in the future.</description>

      <title>Towards motion from video diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-conditioned video diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool in the realm of video generation and editing. But their ability to capture the nuances of human movement remains under-explored. Indeed the ability of these models to faithfully model an array of text prompts can lead to a wide host of applications in human and character animation. In this work, we take initial steps to investigate whether these models can effectively guide the synthesis of realistic human body animations. Specifically we propose to synthesize human motion by deforming an SMPL-X body representation guided by Score distillation sampling (SDS) calculated using a video diffusion model. By analyzing the fidelity of the resulting animations, we gain insights into the extent to which we can obtain motion using publicly available text-to-video diffusion models using SDS. Our findings shed light on the potential and limitations of these models for generating diverse and plausible human motions, paving the way for further research in this exciting area.</description>

      <title>HyperGAN-CLIP: A Unified Framework for Domain Adaptation, Image Synthesis and Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), particularly StyleGAN and its variants, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating highly realistic images. Despite their success, adapting these models to diverse tasks such as domain adaptation, reference-guided synthesis, and text-guided manipulation with limited training data remains challenging. Towards this end, in this study, we present a novel framework that significantly extends the capabilities of a pre-trained StyleGAN by integrating CLIP space via hypernetworks. This integration allows dynamic adaptation of StyleGAN to new domains defined by reference images or textual descriptions. Additionally, we introduce a CLIP-guided discriminator that enhances the alignment between generated images and target domains, ensuring superior image quality. Our approach demonstrates unprecedented flexibility, enabling text-guided image manipulation without the need for text-specific training data and facilitating seamless style transfer. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm the robustness and superior performance of our framework compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Data-to-Model Distillation: Data-Efficient Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to distill the knowledge of a large-scale real dataset into small yet informative synthetic data such that a model trained on it performs as well as a model trained on the full dataset. Despite recent progress, existing dataset distillation methods often struggle with computational efficiency, scalability to complex high-resolution datasets, and generalizability to deep architectures. These approaches typically require retraining when the distillation ratio changes, as knowledge is embedded in raw pixels. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Data-to-Model Distillation (D2M) to distill the real dataset's knowledge into the learnable parameters of a pre-trained generative model by aligning rich representations extracted from real and generated images. The learned generative model can then produce informative training images for different distillation ratios and deep architectures. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets of varying resolutions show D2M's superior performance, re-distillation efficiency, and cross-architecture generalizability. Our method effectively scales up to high-resolution 128x128 ImageNet-1K. Furthermore, we verify D2M's practical benefits for downstream applications in neural architecture search.</description>

      <title>From Text to Pose to Image: Improving Diffusion Model Control and Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last two years, text-to-image diffusion models have become extremely popular. As their quality and usage increase, a major concern has been the need for better output control. In addition to prompt engineering, one effective method to improve the controllability of diffusion models has been to condition them on additional modalities such as image style, depth map, or keypoints. This forms the basis of ControlNets or Adapters. When attempting to apply these methods to control human poses in outputs of text-to-image diffusion models, two main challenges have arisen. The first challenge is generating poses following a wide range of semantic text descriptions, for which previous methods involved searching for a pose within a dataset of (caption, pose) pairs. The second challenge is conditioning image generation on a specified pose while keeping both high aesthetic and high pose fidelity. In this article, we fix these two main issues by introducing a text-to-pose (T2P) generative model alongside a new sampling algorithm, and a new pose adapter that incorporates more pose keypoints for higher pose fidelity. Together, these two new state-of-the-art models enable, for the first time, a generative text-to-pose-to-image framework for higher pose control in diffusion models. We release all models and the code used for the experiments at https://github.com/clement-bonnet/text-to-pose.</description>

      <title>VILA-M3: Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Medical Expert Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalist vision language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in computer vision, but they fall short in specialized fields like healthcare, where expert knowledge is essential. In traditional computer vision tasks, creative or approximate answers may be acceptable, but in healthcare, precision is paramount.Current large multimodal models like Gemini and GPT-4o are insufficient for medical tasks due to their reliance on memorized internet knowledge rather than the nuanced expertise required in healthcare. VLMs are usually trained in three stages: vision pre-training, vision-language pre-training, and instruction fine-tuning (IFT). IFT has been typically applied using a mixture of generic and healthcare data. In contrast, we propose that for medical VLMs, a fourth stage of specialized IFT is necessary, which focuses on medical data and includes information from domain expert models. Domain expert models developed for medical use are crucial because they are specifically trained for certain clinical tasks, e.g. to detect tumors and classify abnormalities through segmentation and classification, which learn fine-grained features of medical data$-$features that are often too intricate for a VLM to capture effectively especially in radiology. This paper introduces a new framework, VILA-M3, for medical VLMs that utilizes domain knowledge via expert models. Through our experiments, we show an improved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an average improvement of ~9% over the prior SOTA model Med-Gemini and ~6% over models trained on the specific tasks. Our approach emphasizes the importance of domain expertise in creating precise, reliable VLMs for medical applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Thermal MOT: A Novel Box Association Method Leveraging Thermal Identity and Motion Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) in thermal imaging presents unique challenges due to the lack of visual features and the complexity of motion patterns. This paper introduces an innovative approach to improve MOT in the thermal domain by developing a novel box association method that utilizes both thermal object identity and motion similarity. Our method merges thermal feature sparsity and dynamic object tracking, enabling more accurate and robust MOT performance. Additionally, we present a new dataset comprised of a large-scale collection of thermal and RGB images captured in diverse urban environments, serving as both a benchmark for our method and a new resource for thermal imaging. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods, showing significant improvements in tracking accuracy and robustness under various conditions. Our findings suggest that incorporating thermal identity with motion data enhances MOT performance. The newly collected dataset and source code is available at https://github.com/wassimea/thermalMOT</description>

      <title>On the Consistency of Video Large Language Models in Temporal Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video large language models (Video-LLMs) can temporally ground language queries and retrieve video moments. Yet, such temporal comprehension capabilities are neither well-studied nor understood. So we conduct a study on prediction consistency -- a key indicator for robustness and trustworthiness of temporal grounding. After the model identifies an initial moment within the video content, we apply a series of probes to check if the model's responses align with this initial grounding as an indicator of reliable comprehension. Our results reveal that current Video-LLMs are sensitive to variations in video contents, language queries, and task settings, unveiling severe deficiencies in maintaining consistency. We further explore common prompting and instruction-tuning methods as potential solutions, but find that their improvements are often unstable. To that end, we propose event temporal verification tuning that explicitly accounts for consistency, and demonstrate significant improvements for both grounding and consistency. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/minjoong507/Consistency-of-Video-LLM.</description>

      <title>LaVida Drive: Vision-Text Interaction VLM for Autonomous Driving with Token Selection, Recovery and Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have made them crucial for visual question answering (VQA) in autonomous driving, enabling natural human-vehicle interactions. However, existing methods often struggle in dynamic driving environments, as they usually focus on static images or videos and rely on downsampling to manage computational costs. This results in the loss of critical details and the difficulty in effectively integrating spatial and temporal information, undermining fine-grained perception and temporal coherence essential for effective decision-making. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LaVida Drive, a novel and efficient VQA framework for autonomous driving. LaVida Drive seamlessly integrates temporal data while maintaining high-resolution inputs for detailed visual perception. It optimizes spatial processing by retaining high-resolution data for intricate details and using lower-resolution inputs for temporal analysis to focus on motion-related features, thereby boosting computational efficiency. The core of LaVida Drive consists of two modules: the \textit{Query-aware Token Selection} module and the \textit{Spatial-Temporal Token Recovery and Enhancement} module. The former dynamically selects the most relevant visual tokens based on semantic alignment with the input query, reducing the token count from high-resolution spatial input. The latter ensures smooth and coherent interactions between spatial and temporal information, preserving contextual continuity across frames. Extensive experiments on various autonomous driving question-answering benchmarks show that LaVida Drive significantly reduces visual tokens, enhances efficiency, and improves overall performance.</description>

      <title>GazeGaussian: High-Fidelity Gaze Redirection with 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaze estimation encounters generalization challenges when dealing with out-of-distribution data. To address this problem, recent methods use neural radiance fields (NeRF) to generate augmented data. However, existing methods based on NeRF are computationally expensive and lack facial details. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become the prevailing representation of neural fields. While 3DGS has been extensively examined in head avatars, it faces challenges with accurate gaze control and generalization across different subjects. In this work, we propose GazeGaussian, a high-fidelity gaze redirection method that uses a two-stream 3DGS model to represent the face and eye regions separately. By leveraging the unstructured nature of 3DGS, we develop a novel eye representation for rigid eye rotation based on the target gaze direction. To enhance synthesis generalization across various subjects, we integrate an expression-conditional module to guide the neural renderer. Comprehensive experiments show that GazeGaussian outperforms existing methods in rendering speed, gaze redirection accuracy, and facial synthesis across multiple datasets. We also demonstrate that existing gaze estimation methods can leverage GazeGaussian to improve their generalization performance. The code will be available at: https://ucwxb.github.io/GazeGaussian/.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Feature-Logits Contrastive Learning for Open-Set Semi-Supervised Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD) methods enhance detector performance by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data, assuming that both labeled and unlabeled data share the same label space. However, in open-set scenarios, the unlabeled dataset contains both in-distribution (ID) classes and out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Applying semi-supervised detectors in such settings can lead to misclassifying OOD class as ID classes. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, termed Collaborative Feature-Logits Detector (CFL-Detector). Specifically, we introduce a feature-level clustering method using contrastive loss to clarify vector boundaries in the feature space and highlight class differences. Additionally, by optimizing the logits-level uncertainty classification loss, the model enhances its ability to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>DT-LSD: Deformable Transformer-based Line Segment Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line segment detection is a fundamental low-level task in computer vision, and improvements in this task can impact more advanced methods that depend on it. Most new methods developed for line segment detection are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our paper seeks to address challenges that prevent the wider adoption of transformer-based methods for line segment detection. More specifically, we introduce a new model called Deformable Transformer-based Line Segment Detection (DT-LSD) that supports cross-scale interactions and can be trained quickly. This work proposes a novel Deformable Transformer-based Line Segment Detector (DT-LSD) that addresses LETR's drawbacks. For faster training, we introduce Line Contrastive DeNoising (LCDN), a technique that stabilizes the one-to-one matching process and speeds up training by 34$\times$. We show that DT-LSD is faster and more accurate than its predecessor transformer-based model (LETR) and outperforms all CNN-based models in terms of accuracy. In the Wireframe dataset, DT-LSD achieves 71.7 for $sAP^{10}$ and 73.9 for $sAP^{15}$; while 33.2 for $sAP^{10}$ and 35.1 for $sAP^{15}$ in the YorkUrban dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and reconstructing occluded objects is a challenging problem, especially in open-world scenarios where categories and contexts are diverse and unpredictable. Traditional methods, however, are typically restricted to closed sets of object categories, limiting their use in complex, open-world scenes. We introduce Open-World Amodal Appearance Completion, a training-free framework that expands amodal completion capabilities by accepting flexible text queries as input. Our approach generalizes to arbitrary objects specified by both direct terms and abstract queries. We term this capability reasoning amodal completion, where the system reconstructs the full appearance of the queried object based on the provided image and language query. Our framework unifies segmentation, occlusion analysis, and inpainting to handle complex occlusions and generates completed objects as RGBA elements, enabling seamless integration into applications such as 3D reconstruction and image editing. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generalizing to novel objects and occlusions, establishing a new benchmark for amodal completion in open-world settings. The code and datasets will be released after paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>Chanel-Orderer: A Channel-Ordering Predictor for Tri-Channel Natural Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows a proof-of-concept that, given a typical 3-channel images but in a randomly permuted channel order, a model (termed as Chanel-Orderer) with ad-hoc inductive biases in terms of both architecture and loss functions can accurately predict the channel ordering and knows how to make it right. Specifically, Chanel-Orderer learns to score each of the three channels with the priors of object semantics and uses the resulting scores to predict the channel ordering. This brings up benefits into a typical scenario where an \texttt{RGB} image is often mis-displayed in the \texttt{BGR} format and needs to be corrected into the right order. Furthermore, as a byproduct, the resulting model Chanel-Orderer is able to tell whether a given image is a near-gray-scale image (near-monochromatic) or not (polychromatic). Our research suggests that Chanel-Orderer mimics human visual coloring of our physical natural world.</description>

      <title>Prior-based Objective Inference Mining Potential Uncertainty for Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Annotation ambiguity caused by the inherent subjectivity of visual judgment has always been a major challenge for Facial Expression Recognition (FER) tasks, particularly for largescale datasets from in-the-wild scenarios. A potential solution is the evaluation of relatively objective emotional distributions to help mitigate the ambiguity of subjective annotations. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Prior-based Objective Inference (POI) network. This network employs prior knowledge to derive a more objective and varied emotional distribution and tackles the issue of subjective annotation ambiguity through dynamic knowledge transfer. POI comprises two key networks: Firstly, the Prior Inference Network (PIN) utilizes the prior knowledge of AUs and emotions to capture intricate motion details. To reduce over-reliance on priors and facilitate objective emotional inference, PIN aggregates inferential knowledge from various key facial subregions, encouraging mutual learning. Secondly, the Target Recognition Network (TRN) integrates subjective emotion annotations and objective inference soft labels provided by the PIN, fostering an understanding of inherent facial expression diversity, thus resolving annotation ambiguity. Moreover, we introduce an uncertainty estimation module to quantify and balance facial expression confidence. This module enables a flexible approach to dealing with the uncertainties of subjective annotations. Extensive experiments show that POI exhibits competitive performance on both synthetic noisy datasets and multiple real-world datasets. All codes and training logs will be publicly available at https://github.com/liuhw01/POI.</description>

      <title>ORID: Organ-Regional Information Driven Framework for Radiology Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is to automatically generate coherent textual analyses of diseases based on radiological images, thereby alleviating the workload of radiologists. Current AI-based methods for RRG primarily focus on modifications to the encoder-decoder model architecture. To advance these approaches, this paper introduces an Organ-Regional Information Driven (ORID) framework which can effectively integrate multi-modal information and reduce the influence of noise from unrelated organs. Specifically, based on the LLaVA-Med, we first construct an RRG-related instruction dataset to improve organ-regional diagnosis description ability and get the LLaVA-Med-RRG. After that, we propose an organ-based cross-modal fusion module to effectively combine the information from the organ-regional diagnosis description and radiology image. To further reduce the influence of noise from unrelated organs on the radiology report generation, we introduce an organ importance coefficient analysis module, which leverages Graph Neural Network (GNN) to examine the interconnections of the cross-modal information of each organ region. Extensive experiments an1d comparisons with state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>X as Supervision: Contending with Depth Ambiguity in Unsupervised Monocular 3D Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent unsupervised methods for monocular 3D pose estimation have endeavored to reduce dependence on limited annotated 3D data, but most are solely formulated in 2D space, overlooking the inherent depth ambiguity issue. Due to the information loss in 3D-to-2D projection, multiple potential depths may exist, yet only some of them are plausible in human structure. To tackle depth ambiguity, we propose a novel unsupervised framework featuring a multi-hypothesis detector and multiple tailored pretext tasks. The detector extracts multiple hypotheses from a heatmap within a local window, effectively managing the multi-solution problem. Furthermore, the pretext tasks harness 3D human priors from the SMPL model to regularize the solution space of pose estimation, aligning it with the empirical distribution of 3D human structures. This regularization is partially achieved through a GCN-based discriminator within the discriminative learning, and is further complemented with synthetic images through rendering, ensuring plausible estimations. Consequently, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art unsupervised 3D pose estimation performance on various human datasets. Further evaluations on data scale-up and one animal dataset highlight its generalization capabilities. Code will be available at https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/X-as-Supervision.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Homography Estimation on Multimodal Image Pair via Alternating Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the homography between two images is crucial for mid- or high-level vision tasks, such as image stitching and fusion. However, using supervised learning methods is often challenging or costly due to the difficulty of collecting ground-truth data. In response, unsupervised learning approaches have emerged. Most early methods, though, assume that the given image pairs are from the same camera or have minor lighting differences. Consequently, while these methods perform effectively under such conditions, they generally fail when input image pairs come from different domains, referred to as multimodal image pairs. To address these limitations, we propose AltO, an unsupervised learning framework for estimating homography in multimodal image pairs. Our method employs a two-phase alternating optimization framework, similar to Expectation-Maximization (EM), where one phase reduces the geometry gap and the other addresses the modality gap. To handle these gaps, we use Barlow Twins loss for the modality gap and propose an extended version, Geometry Barlow Twins, for the geometry gap. As a result, we demonstrate that our method, AltO, can be trained on multimodal datasets without any ground-truth data. It not only outperforms other unsupervised methods but is also compatible with various architectures of homography estimators.

      <title>RobustFormer: Noise-Robust Pre-training for images and videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning models are powerful tools that revolutionized many areas, they are also vulnerable to noise as they rely heavily on learning patterns and features from the exact details of the clean data. Transformers, which have become the backbone of modern vision models, are no exception. Current Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) based methods do not benefit from masked autoencoder (MAE) pre-training since the inverse DWT (iDWT) introduced in these approaches is computationally inefficient and lacks compatibility with video inputs in transformer architectures.
  In this work, we present RobustFormer, a method that overcomes these limitations by enabling noise-robust pre-training for both images and videos; improving the efficiency of DWT-based methods by removing the need for computationally iDWT steps and simplifying the attention mechanism. To our knowledge, the proposed method is the first DWT-based method compatible with video inputs and masked pre-training. Our experiments show that MAE-based pre-training allows us to bypass the iDWT step, greatly reducing computation. Through extensive tests on benchmark datasets, RobustFormer achieves state-of-the-art results for both image and video tasks.</description>

      <title>Attentive Contextual Attention for Cloud Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud cover can significantly hinder the use of remote sensing images for Earth observation, prompting urgent advancements in cloud removal technology. Recently, deep learning strategies have shown strong potential in restoring cloud-obscured areas. These methods utilize convolution to extract intricate local features and attention mechanisms to gather long-range information, improving the overall comprehension of the scene. However, a common drawback of these approaches is that the resulting images often suffer from blurriness, artifacts, and inconsistencies. This is partly because attention mechanisms apply weights to all features based on generalized similarity scores, which can inadvertently introduce noise and irrelevant details from cloud-covered areas. To overcome this limitation and better capture relevant distant context, we introduce a novel approach named Attentive Contextual Attention (AC-Attention). This method enhances conventional attention mechanisms by dynamically learning data-driven attentive selection scores, enabling it to filter out noise and irrelevant features effectively. By integrating the AC-Attention module into the DSen2-CR cloud removal framework, we significantly improve the model's ability to capture essential distant information, leading to more effective cloud removal. Our extensive evaluation of various datasets shows that our method outperforms existing ones regarding image reconstruction quality. Additionally, we conducted ablation studies by integrating AC-Attention into multiple existing methods and widely used network architectures. These studies demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of AC-Attention and reveal its ability to focus on relevant features, thereby improving the overall performance of the networks. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/huangwenwenlili/ACA-CRNet}.</description>

      <title>MEGL: Multimodal Explanation-Guided Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining the decision-making processes of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models is crucial for addressing their "black box" nature, particularly in tasks like image classification. Traditional eXplainable AI (XAI) methods typically rely on unimodal explanations, either visual or textual, each with inherent limitations. Visual explanations highlight key regions but often lack rationale, while textual explanations provide context without spatial grounding. Further, both explanation types can be inconsistent or incomplete, limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multimodal Explanation-Guided Learning (MEGL) framework that leverages both visual and textual explanations to enhance model interpretability and improve classification performance. Our Saliency-Driven Textual Grounding (SDTG) approach integrates spatial information from visual explanations into textual rationales, providing spatially grounded and contextually rich explanations. Additionally, we introduce Textual Supervision on Visual Explanations to align visual explanations with textual rationales, even in cases where ground truth visual annotations are missing. A Visual Explanation Distribution Consistency loss further reinforces visual coherence by aligning the generated visual explanations with dataset-level patterns, enabling the model to effectively learn from incomplete multimodal supervision. We validate MEGL on two new datasets, Object-ME and Action-ME, for image classification with multimodal explanations. Experimental results demonstrate that MEGL outperforms previous approaches in prediction accuracy and explanation quality across both visual and textual domains. Our code will be made available upon the acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Efficient Masked AutoEncoder for Video Object Counting and A Large-Scale Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic imbalance of the fore-background is a major challenge in video object counting, which is usually caused by the sparsity of foreground objects. This often leads to severe under- and over-prediction problems and has been less studied in existing works. To tackle this issue in video object counting, we propose a density-embedded Efficient Masked Autoencoder Counting (E-MAC) framework in this paper. To effectively capture the dynamic variations across frames, we utilize an optical flow-based temporal collaborative fusion that aligns features to derive multi-frame density residuals. The counting accuracy of the current frame is boosted by harnessing the information from adjacent frames. More importantly, to empower the representation ability of dynamic foreground objects for intra-frame, we first take the density map as an auxiliary modality to perform $\mathtt{D}$ensity-$\mathtt{E}$mbedded $\mathtt{M}$asked m$\mathtt{O}$deling ($\mathtt{DEMO}$) for multimodal self-representation learning to regress density map. However, as $\mathtt{DEMO}$ contributes effective cross-modal regression guidance, it also brings in redundant background information and hard to focus on foreground regions. To handle this dilemma, we further propose an efficient spatial adaptive masking derived from density maps to boost efficiency. In addition, considering most existing datasets are limited to human-centric scenarios, we first propose a large video bird counting dataset $\textit{DroneBird}$, in natural scenarios for migratory bird protection. Extensive experiments on three crowd datasets and our $\textit{DroneBird}$ validate our superiority against the counterparts.</description>

      <title>Towards Unbiased and Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Anticipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs (STSGs) provide a concise and expressive representation of dynamic scenes by modelling objects and their evolving relationships over time. However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages curriculum learning and loss masking to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Our approach gradually decreases the dominance of the head relationship classes during training and focuses more on tail classes, leading to more balanced training. Furthermore, we introduce two new tasks, Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation, designed to evaluate the robustness of STSG models against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the unbiased performance and robustness of STSG models compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Automatic marker-free registration based on similar tetrahedras for single-tree point clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, terrestrial laser scanning technology has been widely used to collect tree point cloud data, aiding in measurements of diameter at breast height, biomass, and other forestry survey data. Since a single scan from terrestrial laser systems captures data from only one angle, multiple scans must be registered and fused to obtain complete tree point cloud data. This paper proposes a marker-free automatic registration method for single-tree point clouds based on similar tetrahedras. First, two point clouds from two scans of the same tree are used to generate tree skeletons, and key point sets are constructed from these skeletons. Tetrahedra are then filtered and matched according to similarity principles, with the vertices of these two matched tetrahedras selected as matching point pairs, thus completing the coarse registration of the point clouds from the two scans. Subsequently, the ICP method is applied to the coarse-registered leaf point clouds to obtain fine registration parameters, completing the precise registration of the two tree point clouds. Experiments were conducted using terrestrial laser scanning data from eight trees, each from different species and with varying shapes. The proposed method was evaluated using RMSE and Hausdorff distance, compared against the traditional ICP and NDT methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms both ICP and NDT in registration accuracy, achieving speeds up to 593 times and 113 times faster than ICP and NDT, respectively. In summary, the proposed method shows good robustness in single-tree point cloud registration, with significant advantages in accuracy and speed compared to traditional ICP and NDT methods, indicating excellent application prospects in practical registration scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hints of Prompt: Enhancing Visual Representation for Multimodal LLMs in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the dynamic nature of autonomous driving environments and stringent safety requirements, general MLLMs combined with CLIP alone often struggle to represent driving-specific scenarios accurately, particularly in complex interactions and long-tail cases. To address this, we propose the Hints of Prompt (HoP) framework, which introduces three key enhancements: Affinity hint to emphasize instance-level structure by strengthening token-wise connections, Semantic hint to incorporate high-level information relevant to driving-specific cases, such as complex interactions among vehicles and traffic signs, and Question hint to align visual features with the query context, focusing on question-relevant regions. These hints are fused through a Hint Fusion module, enriching visual representations and enhancing multimodal reasoning for autonomous driving VQA tasks. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the HoP framework, showing it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across all key metrics.</description>

      <title>Practical Compact Deep Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of deep networks in compressed sensing (CS), which allows for a significant reduction in sampling cost and has gained growing attention since its inception. In this paper, we propose a new practical and compact network dubbed PCNet for general image CS. Specifically, in PCNet, a novel collaborative sampling operator is designed, which consists of a deep conditional filtering step and a dual-branch fast sampling step. The former learns an implicit representation of a linear transformation matrix into a few convolutions and first performs adaptive local filtering on the input image, while the latter then uses a discrete cosine transform and a scrambled block-diagonal Gaussian matrix to generate under-sampled measurements. Our PCNet is equipped with an enhanced proximal gradient descent algorithm-unrolled network for reconstruction. It offers flexibility, interpretability, and strong recovery performance for arbitrary sampling rates once trained. Additionally, we provide a deployment-oriented extraction scheme for single-pixel CS imaging systems, which allows for the convenient conversion of any linear sampling operator to its matrix form to be loaded onto hardware like digital micro-mirror devices. Extensive experiments on natural image CS, quantized CS, and self-supervised CS demonstrate the superior reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability of PCNet compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly for high-resolution images.

      <title>ESARM: 3D Emotional Speech-to-Animation via Reward Model from Automatically-Ranked Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel 3D speech-to-animation (STA) generation framework designed to address the shortcomings of existing models in producing diverse and emotionally resonant animations. Current STA models often generate animations that lack emotional depth and variety, failing to align with human expectations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel STA model coupled with a reward model. This combination enables the decoupling of emotion and content under audio conditions through a cross-coupling training approach. Additionally, we develop a training methodology that leverages automatic quality evaluation of generated facial animations to guide the reinforcement learning process. This methodology encourages the STA model to explore a broader range of possibilities, resulting in the generation of diverse and emotionally expressive facial animations of superior quality. We conduct extensive empirical experiments on a benchmark dataset, and the results validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in generating high-quality, emotionally rich 3D animations that are better aligned with human preferences.</description>

      <title>Video-RAG: Visually-aligned Retrieval-Augmented Long Video Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing large video-language models (LVLMs) struggle to comprehend long videos correctly due to limited context. To address this problem, fine-tuning long-context LVLMs and employing GPT-based agents have emerged as promising solutions. However, fine-tuning LVLMs would require extensive high-quality data and substantial GPU resources, while GPT-based agents would rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this paper, we propose Video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Video-RAG), a training-free and cost-effective pipeline that employs visually-aligned auxiliary texts to help facilitate cross-modality alignment while providing additional information beyond the visual content. Specifically, we leverage open-source external tools to extract visually-aligned information from pure video data (e.g., audio, optical character, and object detection), and incorporate the extracted information into an existing LVLM as auxiliary texts, alongside video frames and queries, in a plug-and-play manner. Our Video-RAG offers several key advantages: (i) lightweight with low computing overhead due to single-turn retrieval; (ii) easy implementation and compatibility with any LVLM; and (iii) significant, consistent performance gains across long video understanding benchmarks, including Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench. Notably, our model demonstrates superior performance over proprietary models like Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o when utilized with a 72B model.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we concentrate on exciting the intrinsic local consistency of stereo matching through the incorporation of superpixel soft constraints, with the objective of mitigating inaccuracies at the boundaries of predicted disparity maps. Our approach capitalizes on the observation that neighboring pixels are predisposed to belong to the same object and exhibit closely similar intensities within the probability volume of superpixels. By incorporating this insight, our method encourages the network to generate consistent probability distributions of disparity within each superpixel, aiming to improve the overall accuracy and coherence of predicted disparity maps. Experimental evalua tions on widely-used datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to assist cost volume-based matching networks in restoring competitive performance.</description>

      <title>DriveMLLM: A Benchmark for Spatial Understanding with Multimodal Large Language Models in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires a comprehensive understanding of 3D environments to facilitate high-level tasks such as motion prediction, planning, and mapping. In this paper, we introduce DriveMLLM, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in autonomous driving. DriveMLLM includes 2,734 front-facing camera images and introduces both absolute and relative spatial reasoning tasks, accompanied by linguistically diverse natural language questions. To measure MLLMs' performance, we propose novel evaluation metrics focusing on spatial understanding. We evaluate several state-of-the-art MLLMs on DriveMLLM, and our results reveal the limitations of current models in understanding complex spatial relationships in driving contexts. We believe these findings underscore the need for more advanced MLLM-based spatial reasoning methods and highlight the potential for DriveMLLM to drive further research in autonomous driving.

      <title>Virtual Staining of Label-Free Tissue in Imaging Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a powerful tool for untargeted, highly multiplexed molecular mapping of tissue in biomedical research. IMS offers a means of mapping the spatial distributions of molecular species in biological tissue with unparalleled chemical specificity and sensitivity. However, most IMS platforms are not able to achieve microscopy-level spatial resolution and lack cellular morphological contrast, necessitating subsequent histochemical staining, microscopic imaging and advanced image registration steps to enable molecular distributions to be linked to specific tissue features and cell types. Here, we present a virtual histological staining approach that enhances spatial resolution and digitally introduces cellular morphological contrast into mass spectrometry images of label-free human tissue using a diffusion model. Blind testing on human kidney tissue demonstrated that the virtually stained images of label-free samples closely match their histochemically stained counterparts (with Periodic Acid-Schiff staining), showing high concordance in identifying key renal pathology structures despite utilizing IMS data with 10-fold larger pixel size. Additionally, our approach employs an optimized noise sampling technique during the diffusion model's inference process to reduce variance in the generated images, yielding reliable and repeatable virtual staining. We believe this virtual staining method will significantly expand the applicability of IMS in life sciences and open new avenues for mass spectrometry-based biomedical research.</description>

      <title>Adapting Vision Foundation Models for Robust Cloud Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical challenge in remote sensing image interpretation, as its accuracy directly impacts the effectiveness of subsequent data processing and analysis. Recently, vision foundation models (VFM) have demonstrated powerful generalization capabilities across various visual tasks. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient adaptive approach, termed Cloud-Adapter, designed to enhance the accuracy and robustness of cloud segmentation. Our method leverages a VFM pretrained on general domain data, which remains frozen, eliminating the need for additional training. Cloud-Adapter incorporates a lightweight spatial perception module that initially utilizes a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) to extract dense spatial representations. These multi-scale features are then aggregated and serve as contextual inputs to an adapting module, which modulates the frozen transformer layers within the VFM. Experimental results demonstrate that the Cloud-Adapter approach, utilizing only 0.6% of the trainable parameters of the frozen backbone, achieves substantial performance gains. Cloud-Adapter consistently attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across a wide variety of cloud segmentation datasets from multiple satellite sources, sensor series, data processing levels, land cover scenarios, and annotation granularities. We have released the source code and pretrained models at https://github.com/XavierJiezou/Cloud-Adapter to support further research.</description>

      <title>TAPT: Test-Time Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Robust Inference in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated excellent zero-shot generalizability across various downstream tasks. However, recent studies have shown that the inference performance of CLIP can be greatly degraded by small adversarial perturbations, especially its visual modality, posing significant safety threats. To mitigate this vulnerability, in this paper, we propose a novel defense method called Test-Time Adversarial Prompt Tuning (TAPT) to enhance the inference robustness of CLIP against visual adversarial attacks. TAPT is a test-time defense method that learns defensive bimodal (textual and visual) prompts to robustify the inference process of CLIP. Specifically, it is an unsupervised method that optimizes the defensive prompts for each test sample by minimizing a multi-view entropy and aligning adversarial-clean distributions. We evaluate the effectiveness of TAPT on 11 benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and 10 other zero-shot datasets, demonstrating that it enhances the zero-shot adversarial robustness of the original CLIP by at least 48.9% against AutoAttack (AA), while largely maintaining performance on clean examples. Moreover, TAPT outperforms existing adversarial prompt tuning methods across various backbones, achieving an average robustness improvement of at least 36.6%.</description>

      <title>Globally Correlation-Aware Hard Negative Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard negative generation aims to generate informative negative samples that help to determine the decision boundaries and thus facilitate advancing deep metric learning. Current works select pair/triplet samples, learn their correlations, and fuse them to generate hard negatives. However, these works merely consider the local correlations of selected samples, ignoring global sample correlations that would provide more significant information to generate more informative negatives. In this work, we propose a Globally Correlation-Aware Hard Negative Generation (GCA-HNG) framework, which first learns sample correlations from a global perspective and exploits these correlations to guide generating hardness-adaptive and diverse negatives. Specifically, this approach begins by constructing a structured graph to model sample correlations, where each node represents a specific sample and each edge represents the correlations between corresponding samples. Then, we introduce an iterative graph message propagation to propagate the messages of node and edge through the whole graph and thus learn the sample correlations globally. Finally, with the guidance of the learned global correlations, we propose a channel-adaptive manner to combine an anchor and multiple negatives for HNG. Compared to current methods, GCA-HNG allows perceiving sample correlations with numerous negatives from a global and comprehensive perspective and generates the negatives with better hardness and diversity. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed GCA-HNG is superior to related methods on four image retrieval benchmark datasets. Codes and trained models are available at \url{https://github.com/PWenJay/GCA-HNG}.</description>

      <title>GraphCL: Graph-based Clustering for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has made notable advancements in medical image segmentation (MIS), particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data and significantly enhancing data utilization efficiency. Previous methods primarily focus on complex training strategies to utilize unlabeled data but neglect the importance of graph structural information. Different from existing methods, we propose a graph-based clustering for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (GraphCL) by jointly modeling graph data structure in a unified deep model. The proposed GraphCL model enjoys several advantages. Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model the data structure information for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS). Secondly, to get the clustered features across different graphs, we integrate both pairwise affinities between local image features and raw features as inputs. Extensive experimental results on three standard benchmarks show that the proposed GraphCL algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods.</description>

      <title>YCB-LUMA: YCB Object Dataset with Luminance Keying for Object Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localizing target objects in images is an important task in computer vision. Often it is the first step towards solving a variety of applications in autonomous driving, maintenance, quality insurance, robotics, and augmented reality. Best in class solutions for this task rely on deep neural networks, which require a set of representative training data for best performance. Creating sets of sufficient quality, variety, and size is often difficult, error prone, and expensive. This is where the method of luminance keying can help: it provides a simple yet effective solution to record high quality data for training object detection and segmentation. We extend previous work that presented luminance keying on the common YCB-V set of household objects by recording the remaining objects of the YCB superset. The additional variety of objects - addition of transparency, multiple color variations, non-rigid objects - further demonstrates the usefulness of luminance keying and might be used to test the applicability of the approach on new 2D object detection and segmentation algorithms.</description>

      <title>RAW-Diffusion: RGB-Guided Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity RAW Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current deep learning approaches in computer vision primarily focus on RGB data sacrificing information. In contrast, RAW images offer richer representation, which is crucial for precise recognition, particularly in challenging conditions like low-light environments. The resultant demand for comprehensive RAW image datasets contrasts with the labor-intensive process of creating specific datasets for individual sensors. To address this, we propose a novel diffusion-based method for generating RAW images guided by RGB images. Our approach integrates an RGB-guidance module for feature extraction from RGB inputs, then incorporates these features into the reverse diffusion process with RGB-guided residual blocks across various resolutions. This approach yields high-fidelity RAW images, enabling the creation of camera-specific RAW datasets. Our RGB2RAW experiments on four DSLR datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, RAW-Diffusion demonstrates exceptional data efficiency, achieving remarkable performance with as few as 25 training samples or even fewer. We extend our method to create BDD100K-RAW and Cityscapes-RAW datasets, revealing its effectiveness for object detection in RAW imagery, significantly reducing the amount of required RAW images.</description>

      <title>AGLP: A Graph Learning Perspective for Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA), the model aims to leverage partially labeled target domain data along with a large amount of labeled source domain data to enhance its generalization capability for the target domain. A key advantage of SSDA is its ability to significantly reduce reliance on labeled data, thereby lowering the costs and time associated with data preparation. Most existing SSDA methods utilize information from domain labels and class labels but overlook the structural information of the data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a graph learning perspective (AGLP) for semi-supervised domain adaptation. We apply the graph convolutional network to the instance graph which allows structural information to propagate along the weighted graph edges. The proposed AGLP model has several advantages. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model structural information in SSDA. Second, the proposed model can effectively learn domain-invariant and semantic representations, reducing domain discrepancies in SSDA. Extensive experimental results on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed AGLP algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain adaptation methods.</description>

      <title>Cross-Camera Distracted Driver Classification through Feature Disentanglement and Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of distracted drivers is pivotal for ensuring safe driving. Previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of neural networks in automatically predicting driver distraction, fatigue, and potential hazards. However, recent research has uncovered a significant loss of accuracy in these models when applied to samples acquired under conditions that differ from the training data. In this paper, we introduce a robust model designed to withstand changes in camera position within the vehicle. Our Driver Behavior Monitoring Network (DBMNet) relies on a lightweight backbone and integrates a disentanglement module to discard camera view information from features, coupled with contrastive learning to enhance the encoding of various driver actions. Experiments conducted on the daytime and nighttime subsets of the 100-Driver dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach with an increment on average of 9\% in Top-1 accuracy in comparison with the state of the art. In addition, cross-dataset and cross-camera experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely AUCDD-V1, EZZ2021 and SFD, demonstrate the superior generalization capability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Click; Single Object Tracking; Video Object Segmentation; Real-time Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single object tracking(SOT) relies on precise object bounding box initialization. In this paper, we reconsidered the deficiencies in the current approaches to initializing single object trackers and propose a new paradigm for single object tracking algorithms, ClickTrack, a new paradigm using clicking interaction for real-time scenarios. Moreover, click as an input type inherently lack hierarchical information. To address ambiguity in certain special scenarios, we designed the Guided Click Refiner(GCR), which accepts point and optional textual information as inputs, transforming the point into the bounding box expected by the operator. The bounding box will be used as input of single object trackers. Experiments on LaSOT and GOT-10k benchmarks show that tracker combined with GCR achieves stable performance in real-time interactive scenarios. Furthermore, we explored the integration of GCR into the Segment Anything model(SAM), significantly reducing ambiguity issues when SAM receives point inputs.</description>

      <title>VADet: Multi-frame LiDAR 3D Object Detection using Variable Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Input aggregation is a simple technique used by state-of-the-art LiDAR 3D object detectors to improve detection. However, increasing aggregation is known to have diminishing returns and even performance degradation, due to objects responding differently to the number of aggregated frames. To address this limitation, we propose an efficient adaptive method, which we call Variable Aggregation Detection (VADet). Instead of aggregating the entire scene using a fixed number of frames, VADet performs aggregation per object, with the number of frames determined by an object's observed properties, such as speed and point density. VADet thus reduces the inherent trade-offs of fixed aggregation and is not architecture specific. To demonstrate its benefits, we apply VADet to three popular single-stage detectors and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo dataset.</description>

      <title>ViSTa Dataset: Do vision-language models understand sequential tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13211v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using vision-language models (VLMs) as reward models in reinforcement learning holds promise for reducing costs and improving safety. So far, VLM reward models have only been used for goal-oriented tasks, where the agent must reach a particular final outcome. We explore VLMs' potential to supervise tasks that cannot be scored by the final state alone. To this end, we introduce ViSTa, a dataset for evaluating Vision-based understanding of Sequential Tasks. ViSTa comprises over 4,000 videos with step-by-step descriptions in virtual home, Minecraft, and real-world environments. Its novel hierarchical structure -- basic single-step tasks composed into more and more complex sequential tasks -- allows a fine-grained understanding of how well VLMs can judge tasks with varying complexity. To illustrate this, we use ViSTa to evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs, including CLIP, ViCLIP, and GPT-4o. We find that, while they are all good at object recognition, they fail to understand sequential tasks, with only GPT-4o achieving non-trivial performance.</description>

      <title>XMask3D: Cross-modal Mask Reasoning for Open Vocabulary 3D Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methodologies in open vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation primarily concentrate on establishing a unified feature space encompassing 3D, 2D, and textual modalities. Nevertheless, traditional techniques such as global feature alignment or vision-language model distillation tend to impose only approximate correspondence, struggling notably with delineating fine-grained segmentation boundaries. To address this gap, we propose a more meticulous mask-level alignment between 3D features and the 2D-text embedding space through a cross-modal mask reasoning framework, XMask3D. In our approach, we developed a mask generator based on the denoising UNet from a pre-trained diffusion model, leveraging its capability for precise textual control over dense pixel representations and enhancing the open-world adaptability of the generated masks. We further integrate 3D global features as implicit conditions into the pre-trained 2D denoising UNet, enabling the generation of segmentation masks with additional 3D geometry awareness. Subsequently, the generated 2D masks are employed to align mask-level 3D representations with the vision-language feature space, thereby augmenting the open vocabulary capability of 3D geometry embeddings. Finally, we fuse complementary 2D and 3D mask features, resulting in competitive performance across multiple benchmarks for 3D open vocabulary semantic segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzy22/XMask3D.</description>

      <title>BelHouse3D: A Benchmark Dataset for Assessing Occlusion Robustness in 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale 2D datasets have been instrumental in advancing machine learning; however, progress in 3D vision tasks has been relatively slow. This disparity is largely due to the limited availability of 3D benchmarking datasets. In particular, creating real-world point cloud datasets for indoor scene semantic segmentation presents considerable challenges, including data collection within confined spaces and the costly, often inaccurate process of per-point labeling to generate ground truths. While synthetic datasets address some of these challenges, they often fail to replicate real-world conditions, particularly the occlusions that occur in point clouds collected from real environments. Existing 3D benchmarking datasets typically evaluate deep learning models under the assumption that training and test data are independently and identically distributed (IID), which affects the models' usability for real-world point cloud segmentation. To address these challenges, we introduce the BelHouse3D dataset, a new synthetic point cloud dataset designed for 3D indoor scene semantic segmentation. This dataset is constructed using real-world references from 32 houses in Belgium, ensuring that the synthetic data closely aligns with real-world conditions. Additionally, we include a test set with data occlusion to simulate out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, reflecting the occlusions commonly encountered in real-world point clouds. We evaluate popular point-based semantic segmentation methods using our OOD setting and present a benchmark. We believe that BelHouse3D and its OOD setting will advance research in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation for indoor scenes, providing valuable insights for the development of more generalizable models.</description>

      <title>Paying more attention to local contrast: improving infrared small target detection performance via prior knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data-driven method for infrared small target detection (IRSTD) has achieved promising results. However, due to the small scale of infrared small target datasets and the limited number of pixels occupied by the targets themselves, it is a challenging task for deep learning methods to directly learn from these samples. Utilizing human expert knowledge to assist deep learning methods in better learning is worthy of exploration. To effectively guide the model to focus on targets' spatial features, this paper proposes the Local Contrast Attention Enhanced infrared small target detection Network (LCAE-Net), combining prior knowledge with data-driven deep learning methods. LCAE-Net is a U-shaped neural network model which consists of two developed modules: a Local Contrast Enhancement (LCE) module and a Channel Attention Enhancement (CAE) module. The LCE module takes advantages of prior knowledge, leveraging handcrafted convolution operator to acquire Local Contrast Attention (LCA), which could realize background suppression while enhance the potential target region, thus guiding the neural network to pay more attention to potential infrared small targets' location information. To effectively utilize the response information throughout downsampling progresses, the CAE module is proposed to achieve the information fusion among feature maps' different channels. Experimental results indicate that our LCAE-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the three public datasets NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K, and its detection speed could reach up to 70 fps. Meanwhile, our model has a parameter count and Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs) of 1.945M and 4.862G respectively, which is suitable for deployment on edge devices.</description>

      <title>VideoAutoArena: An Automated Arena for Evaluating Large Multimodal Models in Video Analysis through User Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) with advanced video analysis capabilities have recently garnered significant attention. However, most evaluations rely on traditional methods like multiple-choice questions in benchmarks such as VideoMME and LongVideoBench, which are prone to lack the depth needed to capture the complex demands of real-world users. To address this limitation-and due to the prohibitive cost and slow pace of human annotation for video tasks-we introduce VideoAutoArena, an arena-style benchmark inspired by LMSYS Chatbot Arena's framework, designed to automatically assess LMMs' video analysis abilities. VideoAutoArena utilizes user simulation to generate open-ended, adaptive questions that rigorously assess model performance in video understanding. The benchmark features an automated, scalable evaluation framework, incorporating a modified ELO Rating System for fair and continuous comparisons across multiple LMMs. To validate our automated judging system, we construct a 'gold standard' using a carefully curated subset of human annotations, demonstrating that our arena strongly aligns with human judgment while maintaining scalability. Additionally, we introduce a fault-driven evolution strategy, progressively increasing question complexity to push models toward handling more challenging video analysis scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoAutoArena effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LMMs, providing insights into model strengths and areas for improvement. To further streamline our evaluation, we introduce VideoAutoBench as an auxiliary benchmark, where human annotators label winners in a subset of VideoAutoArena battles. We use GPT-4o as a judge to compare responses against these human-validated answers. Together, VideoAutoArena and VideoAutoBench offer a cost-effective, and scalable framework for evaluating LMMs in user-centric video analysis.</description>

      <title>DATTA: Domain-Adversarial Test-Time Adaptation for Cross-Domain WiFi-Based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is an open problem in WiFi-based sensing due to variations in environments, devices, and subjects, causing domain shifts in channel state information. To address this, we propose Domain-Adversarial Test-Time Adaptation (DATTA), a novel framework combining domain-adversarial training (DAT), test-time adaptation (TTA), and weight resetting to facilitate adaptation to unseen target domains and to prevent catastrophic forgetting. DATTA is integrated into a lightweight, flexible architecture optimized for speed. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of DATTA, including an ablation study on all key components using publicly available data, and verify its suitability for real-time applications such as human activity recognition. When combining a SotA video-based variant of TTA with WiFi-based DAT and comparing it to DATTA, our method achieves an 8.1% higher F1-Score. The PyTorch implementation of DATTA is publicly available at: https://github.com/StrohmayerJ/DATTA.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Scene Graph Generation by Type-Aware Message Passing on Heterogeneous and Dual Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although great progress has been made in the research of unbiased scene graph generation, issues still hinder improving the predictive performance of both head and tail classes. An unbiased scene graph generation (TA-HDG) is proposed to address these issues. For modeling interactive and non-interactive relations, the Interactive Graph Construction is proposed to model the dependence of relations on objects by combining heterogeneous and dual graph, when modeling relations between multiple objects. It also implements a subject-object pair selection strategy to reduce meaningless edges. Moreover, the Type-Aware Message Passing enhances the understanding of complex interactions by capturing intra- and inter-type context in the Intra-Type and Inter-Type stages. The Intra-Type stage captures the semantic context of inter-relaitons and inter-objects. On this basis, the Inter-Type stage captures the context between objects and relations for interactive and non-interactive relations, respectively. Experiments on two datasets show that TA-HDG achieves improvements in the metrics of R@K and mR@K, which proves that TA-HDG can accurately predict the tail class while maintaining the competitive performance of the head class.</description>

      <title>DATAP-SfM: Dynamic-Aware Tracking Any Point for Robust Structure from Motion in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a concise, elegant, and robust pipeline to estimate smooth camera trajectories and obtain dense point clouds for casual videos in the wild. Traditional frameworks, such as ParticleSfM~\cite{zhao2022particlesfm}, address this problem by sequentially computing the optical flow between adjacent frames to obtain point trajectories. They then remove dynamic trajectories through motion segmentation and perform global bundle adjustment. However, the process of estimating optical flow between two adjacent frames and chaining the matches can introduce cumulative errors. Additionally, motion segmentation combined with single-view depth estimation often faces challenges related to scale ambiguity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a dynamic-aware tracking any point (DATAP) method that leverages consistent video depth and point tracking. Specifically, our DATAP addresses these issues by estimating dense point tracking across the video sequence and predicting the visibility and dynamics of each point. By incorporating the consistent video depth prior, the performance of motion segmentation is enhanced. With the integration of DATAP, it becomes possible to estimate and optimize all camera poses simultaneously by performing global bundle adjustments for point tracking classified as static and visible, rather than relying on incremental camera registration. Extensive experiments on dynamic sequences, e.g., Sintel and TUM RGBD dynamic sequences, and on the wild video, e.g., DAVIS, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of camera pose estimation even in complex dynamic challenge scenes.</description>

      <title>Can Reasons Help Improve Pedestrian Intent Estimation? A Cross-Modal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increased importance of autonomous navigation systems has come an increasing need to protect the safety of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) such as pedestrians. Predicting pedestrian intent is one such challenging task, where prior work predicts the binary cross/no-cross intention with a fusion of visual and motion features. However, there has been no effort so far to hedge such predictions with human-understandable reasons. We address this issue by introducing a novel problem setting of exploring the intuitive reasoning behind a pedestrian's intent. In particular, we show that predicting the 'WHY' can be very useful in understanding the 'WHAT'. To this end, we propose a novel, reason-enriched PIE++ dataset consisting of multi-label textual explanations/reasons for pedestrian intent. We also introduce a novel multi-task learning framework called MINDREAD, which leverages a cross-modal representation learning framework for predicting pedestrian intent as well as the reason behind the intent. Our comprehensive experiments show significant improvement of 5.6% and 7% in accuracy and F1-score for the task of intent prediction on the PIE++ dataset using MINDREAD. We also achieved a 4.4% improvement in accuracy on a commonly used JAAD dataset. Extensive evaluation using quantitative/qualitative metrics and user studies shows the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>A Resource Efficient Fusion Network for Object Detection in Bird's-Eye View using Camera and Raw Radar Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cameras can be used to perceive the environment around the vehicle, while affordable radar sensors are popular in autonomous driving systems as they can withstand adverse weather conditions unlike cameras. However, radar point clouds are sparser with low azimuth and elevation resolution that lack semantic and structural information of the scenes, resulting in generally lower radar detection performance. In this work, we directly use the raw range-Doppler (RD) spectrum of radar data, thus avoiding radar signal processing. We independently process camera images within the proposed comprehensive image processing pipeline. Specifically, first, we transform the camera images to Bird's-Eye View (BEV) Polar domain and extract the corresponding features with our camera encoder-decoder architecture. The resultant feature maps are fused with Range-Azimuth (RA) features, recovered from the RD spectrum input from the radar decoder to perform object detection. We evaluate our fusion strategy with other existing methods not only in terms of accuracy but also on computational complexity metrics on RADIal dataset.</description>

      <title>Teaching VLMs to Localize Specific Objects from In-context Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse visual tasks, including image recognition, video understanding, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) when explicitly trained for these tasks. Despite these advances, we find that current VLMs lack a fundamental cognitive ability: learning to localize objects in a scene by taking into account the context. In this work, we focus on the task of few-shot personalized localization, where a model is given a small set of annotated images (in-context examples) -- each with a category label and bounding box -- and is tasked with localizing the same object type in a query image. To provoke personalized localization abilities in models, we present a data-centric solution that fine-tunes them using carefully curated data from video object tracking datasets. By leveraging sequences of frames tracking the same object across multiple shots, we simulate instruction-tuning dialogues that promote context awareness. To reinforce this, we introduce a novel regularization technique that replaces object labels with pseudo-names, ensuring the model relies on visual context rather than prior knowledge. Our method significantly enhances few-shot localization performance without sacrificing generalization, as demonstrated on several benchmarks tailored to personalized localization. This work is the first to explore and benchmark personalized few-shot localization for VLMs, laying a foundation for future research in context-driven vision-language applications.

      <title>WHALES: A Multi-agent Scheduling Dataset for Enhanced Cooperation in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high levels of safety and reliability in autonomous driving remains a critical challenge, especially due to occlusion and limited perception ranges in standalone systems. Cooperative perception among vehicles offers a promising solution, but existing research is hindered by datasets with a limited number of agents. Scaling up the number of cooperating agents is non-trivial and introduces significant computational and technical hurdles that have not been addressed in previous works. To bridge this gap, we present Wireless enHanced Autonomous vehicles with Large number of Engaged agentS (WHALES), a dataset generated using CARLA simulator that features an unprecedented average of 8.4 agents per driving sequence. In addition to providing the largest number of agents and viewpoints among autonomous driving datasets, WHALES records agent behaviors, enabling cooperation across multiple tasks. This expansion allows for new supporting tasks in cooperative perception. As a demonstration, we conduct experiments on agent scheduling task, where the ego agent selects one of multiple candidate agents to cooperate with, optimizing perception gains in autonomous driving. The WHALES dataset and codebase can be found at https://github.com/chensiweiTHU/WHALES.</description>

      <title>Learning based Ge'ez character handwritten recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ge'ez, an ancient Ethiopic script of cultural and historical significance, has been largely neglected in handwriting recognition research, hindering the digitization of valuable manuscripts. Our study addresses this gap by developing a state-of-the-art Ge'ez handwriting recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our approach uses a two-stage recognition process. First, a CNN is trained to recognize individual characters, which then acts as a feature extractor for an LSTM-based system for word recognition. Our dual-stage recognition approach achieves new top scores in Ge'ez handwriting recognition, outperforming eight state-of-the-art methods, which are SVTR, ASTER, and others as well as human performance, as measured in the HHD-Ethiopic dataset work. This research significantly advances the preservation and accessibility of Ge'ez cultural heritage, with implications for historical document digitization, educational tools, and cultural preservation. The code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Brain: Quantum-Inspired Neural Network Approach to Vision-Brain Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-brain understanding aims to extract semantic information about brain signals from human perceptions. Existing deep learning methods for vision-brain understanding are usually introduced in a traditional learning paradigm missing the ability to learn the connectivities between brain regions. Meanwhile, the quantum computing theory offers a new paradigm for designing deep learning models. Motivated by the connectivities in the brain signals and the entanglement properties in quantum computing, we propose a novel Quantum-Brain approach, a quantum-inspired neural network, to tackle the vision-brain understanding problem. To compute the connectivity between areas in brain signals, we introduce a new Quantum-Inspired Voxel-Controlling module to learn the impact of a brain voxel on others represented in the Hilbert space. To effectively learn connectivity, a novel Phase-Shifting module is presented to calibrate the value of the brain signals. Finally, we introduce a new Measurement-like Projection module to present the connectivity information from the Hilbert space into the feature space. The proposed approach can learn to find the connectivities between fMRI voxels and enhance the semantic information obtained from human perceptions. Our experimental results on the Natural Scene Dataset benchmarks illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with Top-1 accuracies of 95.1% and 95.6% on image and brain retrieval tasks and an Inception score of 95.3% on fMRI-to-image reconstruction task. Our proposed quantum-inspired network brings a potential paradigm to solving the vision-brain problems via the quantum computing theory.</description>

      <title>VBench++: Comprehensive and Versatile Benchmark Suite for Video Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation has witnessed significant advancements, yet evaluating these models remains a challenge. A comprehensive evaluation benchmark for video generation is indispensable for two reasons: 1) Existing metrics do not fully align with human perceptions; 2) An ideal evaluation system should provide insights to inform future developments of video generation. To this end, we present VBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite that dissects "video generation quality" into specific, hierarchical, and disentangled dimensions, each with tailored prompts and evaluation methods. VBench has several appealing properties: 1) Comprehensive Dimensions: VBench comprises 16 dimensions in video generation (e.g., subject identity inconsistency, motion smoothness, temporal flickering, and spatial relationship, etc). The evaluation metrics with fine-grained levels reveal individual models' strengths and weaknesses. 2) Human Alignment: We also provide a dataset of human preference annotations to validate our benchmarks' alignment with human perception, for each evaluation dimension respectively. 3) Valuable Insights: We look into current models' ability across various evaluation dimensions, and various content types. We also investigate the gaps between video and image generation models. 4) Versatile Benchmarking: VBench++ supports evaluating text-to-video and image-to-video. We introduce a high-quality Image Suite with an adaptive aspect ratio to enable fair evaluations across different image-to-video generation settings. Beyond assessing technical quality, VBench++ evaluates the trustworthiness of video generative models, providing a more holistic view of model performance. 5) Full Open-Sourcing: We fully open-source VBench++ and continually add new video generation models to our leaderboard to drive forward the field of video generation.</description>

      <title>Geometric Algebra Planes: Convex Implicit Neural Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13525v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volume parameterizations abound in recent literature, from the classic voxel grid to the implicit neural representation and everything in between. While implicit representations have shown impressive capacity and better memory efficiency compared to voxel grids, to date they require training via nonconvex optimization. This nonconvex training process can be slow to converge and sensitive to initialization and hyperparameter choices that affect the final converged result. We introduce a family of models, GA-Planes, that is the first class of implicit neural volume representations that can be trained by convex optimization. GA-Planes models include any combination of features stored in tensor basis elements, followed by a neural feature decoder. They generalize many existing representations and can be adapted for convex, semiconvex, or nonconvex training as needed for different inverse problems. In the 2D setting, we prove that GA-Planes is equivalent to a low-rank plus low-resolution matrix factorization; we show that this approximation outperforms the classic low-rank plus sparse decomposition for fitting a natural image. In 3D, we demonstrate GA-Planes' competitive performance in terms of expressiveness, model size, and optimizability across three volume fitting tasks: radiance field reconstruction, 3D segmentation, and video segmentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopy structure segmentation, such as detecting cells or nuclei, generally requires a human to draw a ground truth contour around each instance. Weakly supervised approaches (e.g. consisting of only single point labels) have the potential to reduce this workload significantly. Our approach uses individual point labels for an entropy estimation to approximate an underlying distribution of cell pixels. We infer full cell masks from this distribution, and use Mask-RCNN to produce an instance segmentation output. We compare this point--annotated approach with training on the full ground truth masks. We show that our method achieves a comparatively good level of performance, despite a 95% reduction in pixel labels.</description>

      <title>Identity Preserving 3D Head Stylization with Multiview Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic representations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality applications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

      <title>DIS-Mine: Instance Segmentation for Disaster-Awareness in Poor-Light Condition in Underground Mines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting disasters in underground mining, such as explosions and structural damage, has been a persistent challenge over the years. This problem is compounded for first responders, who often have no clear information about the extent or nature of the damage within the mine. The poor-light or even total darkness inside the mines makes rescue efforts incredibly difficult, leading to a tragic loss of life. In this paper, we propose a novel instance segmentation method called DIS-Mine, specifically designed to identify disaster-affected areas within underground mines under low-light or poor visibility conditions, aiding first responders in rescue efforts. DIS-Mine is capable of detecting objects in images, even in complete darkness, by addressing challenges such as high noise, color distortions, and reduced contrast. The key innovations of DIS-Mine are built upon four core components: i) Image brightness improvement, ii) Instance segmentation with SAM integration, iii) Mask R-CNN-based segmentation, and iv) Mask alignment with feature matching. On top of that, we have collected real-world images from an experimental underground mine, introducing a new dataset named ImageMine, specifically gathered in low-visibility conditions. This dataset serves to validate the performance of DIS-Mine in realistic, challenging environments. Our comprehensive experiments on the ImageMine dataset, as well as on various other datasets demonstrate that DIS-Mine achieves a superior F1 score of 86.0% and mIoU of 72.0%, outperforming state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, with at least 15x improvement and up to 80% higher precision in object detection.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Limits of Sparsity: A Bag of Tricks for Extreme Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13545v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pruning of deep neural networks has been an effective technique for reducing model size while preserving most of the performance of dense networks, crucial for deploying models on memory and power-constrained devices. While recent sparse learning methods have shown promising performance up to moderate sparsity levels such as 95% and 98%, accuracy quickly deteriorates when pushing sparsities to extreme levels. Obtaining sparse networks at such extreme sparsity levels presents unique challenges, such as fragile gradient flow and heightened risk of layer collapse. In this work, we explore network performance beyond the commonly studied sparsities, and propose a collection of techniques that enable the continuous learning of networks without accuracy collapse even at extreme sparsities, including 99.90%, 99.95% and 99.99% on ResNet architectures. Our approach combines 1) Dynamic ReLU phasing, where DyReLU initially allows for richer parameter exploration before being gradually replaced by standard ReLU, 2) weight sharing which reuses parameters within a residual layer while maintaining the same number of learnable parameters, and 3) cyclic sparsity, where both sparsity levels and sparsity patterns evolve dynamically throughout training to better encourage parameter exploration. We evaluate our method, which we term Extreme Adaptive Sparse Training (EAST) at extreme sparsities using ResNet-34 and ResNet-50 on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods we compared with.</description>

      <title>HF-Diff: High-Frequency Perceptual Loss and Distribution Matching for One-Step Diffusion-Based Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent diffusion-based single-step super-resolution methods achieve better performance as compared to SinSR, they are computationally complex. To improve the performance of SinSR, we investigate preserving the high-frequency detail features during super-resolution (SR) because the downgraded images lack detailed information. For this purpose, we introduce a high-frequency perceptual loss by utilizing an invertible neural network (INN) pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. Different feature maps of pretrained INN produce different high-frequency aspects of an image. During the training phase, we impose to preserve the high-frequency features of super-resolved and ground truth (GT) images that improve the SR image quality during inference. Furthermore, we also utilize the Jenson-Shannon divergence between GT and SR images in the pretrained DINO-v2 embedding space to match their distribution. By introducing the $\textbf{h}igh$- $\textbf{f}requency$ preserving loss and distribution matching constraint in the single-step $\textbf{diff}usion-based$ SR ($\textbf{HF-Diff}$), we achieve a state-of-the-art CLIPIQA score in the benchmark RealSR, RealSet65, DIV2K-Val, and ImageNet datasets. Furthermore, the experimental results in several datasets demonstrate that our high-frequency perceptual loss yields better SR image quality than LPIPS and VGG-based perceptual losses. Our code will be released at https://github.com/shoaib-sami/HF-Diff.</description>

      <title>Generating 3D-Consistent Videos from Unposed Internet Photos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of generating videos from unposed internet photos. A handful of input images serve as keyframes, and our model interpolates between them to simulate a path moving between the cameras. Given random images, a model's ability to capture underlying geometry, recognize scene identity, and relate frames in terms of camera position and orientation reflects a fundamental understanding of 3D structure and scene layout. However, existing video models such as Luma Dream Machine fail at this task. We design a self-supervised method that takes advantage of the consistency of videos and variability of multiview internet photos to train a scalable, 3D-aware video model without any 3D annotations such as camera parameters. We validate that our method outperforms all baselines in terms of geometric and appearance consistency. We also show our model benefits applications that enable camera control, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our results suggest that we can scale up scene-level 3D learning using only 2D data such as videos and multiview internet photos.</description>

      <title>Find Any Part in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study open-world part segmentation in 3D: segmenting any part in any object based on any text query. Prior methods are limited in object categories and part vocabularies. Recent advances in AI have demonstrated effective open-world recognition capabilities in 2D. Inspired by this progress, we propose an open-world, direct-prediction model for 3D part segmentation that can be applied zero-shot to any object. Our approach, called Find3D, trains a general-category point embedding model on large-scale 3D assets from the internet without any human annotation. It combines a data engine, powered by foundation models for annotating data, with a contrastive training method. We achieve strong performance and generalization across multiple datasets, with up to a 3x improvement in mIoU over the next best method. Our model is 6x to over 300x faster than existing baselines. To encourage research in general-category open-world 3D part segmentation, we also release a benchmark for general objects and parts.

      <title>REDUCIO! Generating 1024$\times$1024 Video within 16 Seconds using Extremely Compressed Motion Latents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial video generation models have exhibited realistic, high-fidelity results but are still restricted to limited access. One crucial obstacle for large-scale applications is the expensive training and inference cost. In this paper, we argue that videos contain much more redundant information than images, thus can be encoded by very few motion latents based on a content image. Towards this goal, we design an image-conditioned VAE to encode a video to an extremely compressed motion latent space. This magic Reducio charm enables 64x reduction of latents compared to a common 2D VAE, without sacrificing the quality. Training diffusion models on such a compact representation easily allows for generating 1K resolution videos. We then adopt a two-stage video generation paradigm, which performs text-to-image and text-image-to-video sequentially. Extensive experiments show that our Reducio-DiT achieves strong performance in evaluation, though trained with limited GPU resources. More importantly, our method significantly boost the efficiency of video LDMs both in training and inference. We train Reducio-DiT in around 3.2K training hours in total and generate a 16-frame 1024*1024 video clip within 15.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

      <title>SAM-I2I: Unleash the Power of Segment Anything Model for Medical Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image translation is crucial for reducing the need for redundant and expensive multi-modal imaging in clinical field. However, current approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers often fail to capture fine-grain semantic features, resulting in suboptimal image quality. To address this challenge, we propose SAM-I2I, a novel image-to-image translation framework based on the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). SAM-I2I utilizes a pre-trained image encoder to extract multiscale semantic features from the source image and a decoder, based on the mask unit attention module, to synthesize target modality images. Our experiments on multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that SAM-I2I outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering more efficient and accurate medical image translation.</description>

      <title>FedCL-Ensemble Learning: A Framework of Federated Continual Learning with Ensemble Transfer Learning Enhanced for Alzheimer's MRI Classifications while Preserving Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research work introduces a novel approach to the classification of Alzheimer's disease by using the advanced deep learning techniques combined with secure data processing methods. This research work primary uses transfer learning models such as ResNet, ImageNet, and VNet to extract high-level features from medical image data. Thereafter, these pre-trained models were fine-tuned for Alzheimer's related subtle patterns such that the model is capable of robust feature extraction over varying data sources. Further, the federated learning approaches were incorporated to tackle a few other challenges related to classification, aimed to provide better prediction performance and protect data privacy. The proposed model was built using federated learning without sharing sensitive patient data. This way, the decentralized model benefits from the large and diversified dataset that it is trained upon while ensuring confidentiality. The cipher-based encryption mechanism is added that allows us to secure the transportation of data and further ensure the privacy and integrity of patient information throughout training and classification. The results of the experiments not only help to improve the accuracy of the classification of Alzheimer's but at the same time provides a framework for secure and collaborative analysis of health care data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Medicinal Image Transmission and Resolution Enhancement via GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While X-ray imaging is indispensable in medical diagnostics, it inherently carries with it those noises and limitations on resolution that mask the details necessary for diagnosis. B/W X-ray images require a careful balance between noise suppression and high-detail preservation to ensure clarity in soft-tissue structures and bone edges. While traditional methods, such as CNNs and early super-resolution models like ESRGAN, have enhanced image resolution, they often perform poorly regarding high-frequency detail preservation and noise control for B/W imaging. We are going to present one efficient approach that improves the quality of an image with the optimization of network transmission in the following paper. The pre-processing of X-ray images into low-resolution files by Real-ESRGAN, a version of ESRGAN elucidated and improved, helps reduce the server load and transmission bandwidth. Lower-resolution images are upscaled at the receiving end using Real-ESRGAN, fine-tuned for real-world image degradation. The model integrates Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks with perceptual and adversarial loss functions for high-quality upscaled images with low noise. We further fine-tune Real-ESRGAN by adapting it to the specific B/W noise and contrast characteristics. This suppresses noise artifacts without compromising detail. The comparative evaluation conducted shows that our approach achieves superior noise reduction and detail clarity compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based and ESRGAN models, apart from reducing network bandwidth requirements. These benefits are confirmed both by quantitative metrics, including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index, and by qualitative assessments, which indicate the potential of Real-ESRGAN for diagnostic-quality X-ray imaging and for efficient medical data transmission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early and accurate melanoma detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence AI have shown promise in this area, but the technologys effectiveness across diverse skin tones remains a critical challenge. This study conducts a systematic review and preliminary analysis of AI based melanoma detection research published between 2013 and 2024, focusing on deep learning methodologies, datasets, and skin tone representation. Our findings indicate that while AI can enhance melanoma detection, there is a significant bias towards lighter skin tones. To address this, we propose including skin hue in addition to skin tone as represented by the LOreal Color Chart Map for a more comprehensive skin tone assessment technique. This research highlights the need for diverse datasets and robust evaluation metrics to develop AI models that are equitable and effective for all patients. By adopting best practices outlined in a PRISMA Equity framework tailored for healthcare and melanoma detection, we can work towards reducing disparities in melanoma outcomes.</description>

      <title>Residual Vision Transformer (ResViT) Based Self-Supervised Learning Model for Brain Tumor Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has proven very promising for interpreting MRI in brain tumor diagnosis. However, deep learning models suffer from a scarcity of brain MRI datasets for effective training. Self-supervised learning (SSL) models provide data-efficient and remarkable solutions to limited dataset problems. Therefore, this paper introduces a generative SSL model for brain tumor classification in two stages. The first stage is designed to pre-train a Residual Vision Transformer (ResViT) model for MRI synthesis as a pretext task. The second stage includes fine-tuning a ResViT-based classifier model as a downstream task. Accordingly, we aim to leverage local features via CNN and global features via ViT, employing a hybrid CNN-transformer architecture for ResViT in pretext and downstream tasks. Moreover, synthetic MRI images are utilized to balance the training set. The proposed model performs on public BraTs 2023, Figshare, and Kaggle datasets. Furthermore, we compare the proposed model with various deep learning models, including A-UNet, ResNet-9, pix2pix, pGAN for MRI synthesis, and ConvNeXtTiny, ResNet101, DenseNet12, Residual CNN, ViT for classification. According to the results, the proposed model pretraining on the MRI dataset is superior compared to the pretraining on the ImageNet dataset. Overall, the proposed model attains the highest accuracy, achieving 90.56% on the BraTs dataset with T1 sequence, 98.53% on the Figshare, and 98.47% on the Kaggle brain tumor datasets. As a result, the proposed model demonstrates a robust, effective, and successful approach to handling insufficient dataset challenges in MRI analysis by incorporating SSL, fine-tuning, data augmentation, and combining CNN and ViT.</description>

      <title>Tree Species Classification using Machine Learning and 3D Tomographic SAR -- a case study in Northern Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree species classification plays an important role in nature conservation, forest inventories, forest management, and the protection of endangered species. Over the past four decades, remote sensing technologies have been extensively utilized for tree species classification, with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) emerging as a key technique. In this study, we employed TomoSense, a 3D tomographic dataset, which utilizes a stack of single-look complex (SLC) images, a byproduct of SAR, captured at different incidence angles to generate a three-dimensional representation of the terrain. Our research focuses on evaluating multiple tabular machine-learning models using the height information derived from the tomographic image intensities to classify eight distinct tree species. The SLC data and tomographic imagery were analyzed across different polarimetric configurations and geosplit configurations. We investigated the impact of these variations on classification accuracy, comparing the performance of various tabular machine-learning models and optimizing them using Bayesian optimization. Additionally, we incorporated a proxy for actual tree height using point cloud data from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to provide height statistics associated with the model's predictions. This comparison offers insights into the reliability of tomographic data in predicting tree species classification based on height.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign language translation, especially in gloss-free paradigm, is confronting a dilemma of impracticality and unsustainability due to growing resource-intensive methodologies. Contemporary state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) have significantly hinged on pretrained sophiscated backbones such as Large Language Models (LLMs), embedding sources, or extensive datasets, inducing considerable parametric and computational inefficiency for sustainable use in real-world scenario. Despite their success, following this research direction undermines the overarching mission of this domain to create substantial value to bridge hard-hearing and common populations. Committing to the prevailing trend of LLM and Natural Language Processing (NLP) studies, we pursue a profound essential change in architecture to achieve ground-up improvements without external aid from pretrained models, prior knowledge transfer, or any NLP strategies considered not-from-scratch.
  Introducing Signformer, a from-scratch Feather-Giant transforming the area towards Edge AI that redefines extremities of performance and efficiency with LLM-competence and edgy-deployable compactness. In this paper, we present nature analysis of sign languages to inform our algorithmic design and deliver a scalable transformer pipeline with convolution and attention novelty. We achieve new 2nd place on leaderboard with a parametric reduction of 467-1807x against the finests as of 2024 and outcompete almost every other methods in a lighter configuration of 0.57 million parameters.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Deep Learning-Driven Multi-Coil MRI Reconstruction via Self-Supervised Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the effect of incorporating self-supervised denoising as a pre-processing step for training deep learning (DL) based reconstruction methods on data corrupted by Gaussian noise. K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical. We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans. We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32dB, 22dB, and 12dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24dB, 14dB, and 4dB for fat-suppressed knee data. Overall, we showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions. By refining the quality of input data, denoising can enable the training of more effective DL networks, potentially bypassing the need for noise-free reference MRI scans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research presents an advanced AI-powered ultrasound imaging system that incorporates real-time image processing, organ tracking, and voice commands to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of diagnoses in clinical practice. Traditional ultrasound diagnostics often require significant time and introduce a degree of subjectivity due to user interaction. The goal of this innovative solution is to provide Sonologists with a more predictable and productive imaging procedure utilizing artificial intelligence, computer vision, and voice technology. The functionality of the system employs computer vision and deep learning algorithms, specifically adopting the Mask R-CNN model from Detectron2 for semantic segmentation of organs and key landmarks. This automation improves diagnostic accuracy by enabling the extraction of valuable information with minimal human input. Additionally, it includes a voice recognition feature that allows for hands-free operation, enabling users to control the system with commands such as freeze or liver, all while maintaining their focus on the patient. The architecture comprises video processing and real-time segmentation modules that prepare the system to perform essential imaging functions, such as freezing and zooming in on frames. The liver histopathology module, optimized for detecting fibrosis, achieved an impressive accuracy of 98.6%. Furthermore, the organ segmentation module produces output confidence levels between 50% and 95%, demonstrating its efficacy in organ detection.</description>

      <title>Training Physics-Driven Deep Learning Reconstruction without Raw Data Access for Equitable Fast MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Even though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates compared to existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. One impediment for their deployment is the difficulties with generalization to pathologies or population groups that are not well-represented in training sets. This has been noted in several studies, and fine-tuning on target populations to improve reconstruction has been suggested. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and underserved areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training, using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates the goodness of the output with a compressibility-based approach, while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show that CUPID achieves similar quality compared to well-established PD-DL training strategies that require raw k-space data access, while outperforming conventional compressed sensing (CS) and state-of-the-art generative methods. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden.</description>

      <title>LMM-driven Semantic Image-Text Coding for Ultra Low-bitrate Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supported by powerful generative models, low-bitrate learned image compression (LIC) models utilizing perceptual metrics have become feasible. Some of the most advanced models achieve high compression rates and superior perceptual quality by using image captions as sub-information. This paper demonstrates that using a large multi-modal model (LMM), it is possible to generate captions and compress them within a single model. We also propose a novel semantic-perceptual-oriented fine-tuning method applicable to any LIC network, resulting in a 41.58\% improvement in LPIPS BD-rate compared to existing methods. Our implementation and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/tokkiwa/ImageTextCoding.</description>

      <title>Bounding-box Watermarking: Defense against Model Extraction Attacks on Object Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) deployed in a cloud often allow users to query models via the APIs. However, these APIs expose the models to model extraction attacks (MEAs). In this attack, the attacker attempts to duplicate the target model by abusing the responses from the API. Backdoor-based DNN watermarking is known as a promising defense against MEAs, wherein the defender injects a backdoor into extracted models via API responses. The backdoor is used as a watermark of the model; if a suspicious model has the watermark (i.e., backdoor), it is verified as an extracted model. This work focuses on object detection (OD) models. Existing backdoor attacks on OD models are not applicable for model watermarking as the defense against MEAs on a realistic threat model. Our proposed approach involves inserting a backdoor into extracted models via APIs by stealthily modifying the bounding-boxes (BBs) of objects detected in queries while keeping the OD capability. In our experiments on three OD datasets, the proposed approach succeeded in identifying the extracted models with 100% accuracy in a wide variety of experimental scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of self-supervised pre-trained embeddings on out-of-distribution (OOD) data is poor without fine-tuning. A straightforward and simple approach to improving the generalization of pre-trained representation to OOD data is the use of deep ensembles. However, obtaining an effective ensemble in the embedding space with only unlabeled data remains an unsolved problem. We first perform a theoretical analysis that reveals the relationship between individual hyperspherical embedding spaces in an ensemble. We then design a principled method to align these embedding spaces in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results on the MNIST dataset show that our embedding-space ensemble method improves pre-trained embedding quality on in-distribution and OOD data compared to single encoders.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the Suitability of Neuromorphic, Event-Based, Dynamic Vision Sensors for In Process Monitoring of Metallic Additive Manufacturing and Welding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the suitability of high dynamic range, high-speed, neuromorphic event-based, dynamic vision sensors for metallic additive manufacturing and welding for in-process monitoring applications. In-process monitoring to enable quality control of mission critical components produced using metallic additive manufacturing is of high interest. However, the extreme light environment and high speed dynamics of metallic melt pools have made this a difficult environment in which to make measurements. Event-based sensing is an alternative measurement paradigm where data is only transmitted/recorded when a measured quantity exceeds a threshold resolution. The result is that event-based sensors consume less power and less memory/bandwidth, and they operate across a wide range of timescales and dynamic ranges. Event-driven driven imagers stand out from conventional imager technology in that they have a very high dynamic range of approximately 120 dB. Conventional 8 bit imagers only have a dynamic range of about 48 dB. This high dynamic range makes them a good candidate for monitoring manufacturing processes that feature high intensity light sources/generation such as metallic additive manufacturing and welding. In addition event based imagers are able to capture data at timescales on the order of 100 {\mu}s, which makes them attractive to capturing fast dynamics in a metallic melt pool. In this work we demonstrate that event-driven imagers have been shown to be able to observe tungsten inert gas (TIG) and laser welding melt pools. The results of this effort suggest that with additional engineering effort, neuromorphic event imagers should be capable of 3D geometry measurements of the melt pool, and anomaly detection/classification/prediction.</description>

      <title>CopyrightMeter: Revisiting Copyright Protection in Text-to-image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, their increasing popularity has raised significant copyright concerns, as these models can be misused to reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. In response, recent studies have proposed various copyright protection methods, including adversarial perturbation, concept erasure, and watermarking techniques. However, their effectiveness and robustness against advanced attacks remain largely unexplored. Moreover, the lack of unified evaluation frameworks has hindered systematic comparison and fair assessment of different approaches. To bridge this gap, we systematize existing copyright protection methods and attacks, providing a unified taxonomy of their design spaces. We then develop CopyrightMeter, a unified evaluation framework that incorporates 17 state-of-the-art protections and 16 representative attacks. Leveraging CopyrightMeter, we comprehensively evaluate protection methods across multiple dimensions, thereby uncovering how different design choices impact fidelity, efficacy, and resilience under attacks. Our analysis reveals several key findings: (i) most protections (16/17) are not resilient against attacks; (ii) the "best" protection varies depending on the target priority; (iii) more advanced attacks significantly promote the upgrading of protections. These insights provide concrete guidance for developing more robust protection methods, while its unified evaluation protocol establishes a standard benchmark for future copyright protection research in text-to-image generation.</description>

      <title>SONNET: Enhancing Time Delay Estimation by Leveraging Simulated Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delay estimation or Time-Difference-Of-Arrival estimates is a critical component for multiple localization applications such as multilateration, direction of arrival, and self-calibration. The task is to estimate the time difference between a signal arriving at two different sensors. For the audio sensor modality, most current systems are based on classical methods such as the Generalized Cross-Correlation Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) method. In this paper we demonstrate that learning based methods can, even based on synthetic data, significantly outperform GCC-PHAT on novel real world data. To overcome the lack of data with ground truth for the task, we train our model on a simulated dataset which is sufficiently large and varied, and that captures the relevant characteristics of the real world problem. We provide our trained model, SONNET (Simulation Optimized Neural Network Estimator of Timeshifts), which is runnable in real-time and works on novel data out of the box for many real data applications, i.e. without re-training. We further demonstrate greatly improved performance on the downstream task of self-calibration when using our model compared to classical methods.</description>

      <title>Intensity-Spatial Dual Masked Autoencoder for Multi-Scale Feature Learning in Chest CT Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of medical image segmentation, challenges such as indistinct lesion features, ambiguous boundaries,and multi-scale characteristics have long revailed. This paper proposes an improved method named Intensity-Spatial Dual Masked AutoEncoder (ISD-MAE). Based on the tissue-contrast semi-masked autoencoder, a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) branch is introduced to perform intensity masking and spatial masking operations on chest CT images for multi-scale feature learning and segmentation tasks. The model utilizes a dual-branch structure and contrastive learning to enhance the ability to learn tissue features and boundary details. Experiments are conducted on multiple 2D and 3D datasets. The results show that ISD-MAE significantly outperforms other methods in 2D pneumonia and mediastinal tumor segmentation tasks. For example, the Dice score reaches 90.10% on the COVID19 LESION dataset, and the performance is relatively stable. However, there is still room for improvement on 3D datasets. In response to this, improvement directions are proposed, including optimizing the loss function, using enhanced 3D convolution blocks, and processing datasets from multiple perspectives.Our code is available at:https://github.com/prowontheus/ISD-MAE.</description>

Abstract: In response to the growing challenges of manual labor and efficiency in warehouse operations, Amazon has embarked on a significant transformation by incorporating robotics to assist with various tasks. While a substantial number of robots have been successfully deployed for tasks such as item transportation within warehouses, the complex process of object picking from shelves remains a significant challenge. This project addresses the issue by developing an innovative robotic system capable of autonomously fulfilling a simulated order by efficiently selecting specific items from shelves. A distinguishing feature of the proposed robotic system is its capacity to navigate the challenge of uncertain object positions within each bin of the shelf. The system is engineered to autonomously adapt its approach, employing strategies that enable it to efficiently locate and retrieve the desired items, even in the absence of pre-established knowledge about their placements.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Synthesis Denoisers for Forward-Backward Plug-and-Play Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the behavior of the forward-backward (FB) algorithm when the proximity operator is replaced by a sub-iterative procedure to approximate a Gaussian denoiser, in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) fashion. In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</description>

      <title>RTSR: A Real-Time Super-Resolution Model for AV1 Compressed Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is a key technique for improving the visual quality of video content by increasing its spatial resolution while reconstructing fine details. SR has been employed in many applications including video streaming, where compressed low-resolution content is typically transmitted to end users and then reconstructed with a higher resolution and enhanced quality. To support real-time playback, it is important to implement fast SR models while preserving reconstruction quality; however most existing solutions, in particular those based on complex deep neural networks, fail to do so. To address this issue, this paper proposes a low-complexity SR method, RTSR, designed to enhance the visual quality of compressed video content, focusing on resolution up-scaling from a) 360p to 1080p and from b) 540p to 4K. The proposed approach utilizes a CNN-based network architecture, which was optimized for AV1 (SVT)-encoded content at various quantization levels based on a dual-teacher knowledge distillation method. This method was submitted to the AIM 2024 Video Super-Resolution Challenge, specifically targeting the Efficient/Mobile Real-Time Video Super-Resolution competition. It achieved the best trade-off between complexity and coding performance (measured in PSNR, SSIM and VMAF) among all six submissions. The code will be available soon.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Diffusion Compression for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs degraded by complex, unknown processes. While many Stable Diffusion (SD)-based Real-ISR methods have achieved remarkable success, their slow, multi-step inference hinders practical deployment. Recent SD-based one-step networks like OSEDiff and S3Diff alleviate this issue but still incur high computational costs due to their reliance on large pretrained SD models. This paper proposes a novel Real-ISR method, AdcSR, by distilling the one-step diffusion network OSEDiff into a streamlined diffusion-GAN model under our Adversarial Diffusion Compression (ADC) framework. We meticulously examine the modules of OSEDiff, categorizing them into two types: (1) Removable (VAE encoder, prompt extractor, text encoder, etc.) and (2) Prunable (denoising UNet and VAE decoder). Since direct removal and pruning can degrade the model's generation capability, we pretrain our pruned VAE decoder to restore its ability to decode images and employ adversarial distillation to compensate for performance loss. This ADC-based diffusion-GAN hybrid design effectively reduces complexity by 73% in inference time, 78% in computation, and 74% in parameters, while preserving the model's generation capability. Experiments manifest that our proposed AdcSR achieves competitive recovery quality on both synthetic and real-world datasets, offering up to 9.3$\times$ speedup over previous one-step diffusion-based methods. Code and models will be made available.</description>

      <title>Unification of Balti and trans-border sister dialects in the essence of LLMs and AI Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The language called Balti belongs to the Sino-Tibetan, specifically the Tibeto-Burman language family. It is understood with variations, across populations in India, China, Pakistan, Nepal, Tibet, Burma, and Bhutan, influenced by local cultures and producing various dialects. Considering the diverse cultural, socio-political, religious, and geographical impacts, it is important to step forward unifying the dialects, the basis of common root, lexica, and phonological perspectives, is vital. In the era of globalization and the increasingly frequent developments in AI technology, understanding the diversity and the efforts of dialect unification is important to understanding commonalities and shortening the gaps impacted by unavoidable circumstances. This article analyzes and examines how artificial intelligence AI in the essence of Large Language Models LLMs, can assist in analyzing, documenting, and standardizing the endangered Balti Language, based on the efforts made in different dialects so far.</description>

      <title>Efficient Brain Imaging Analysis for Alzheimer's and Dementia Detection Using Convolution-Derivative Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and results in detrimental structural changes in human brains. Detecting these changes is crucial for early diagnosis and timely intervention of disease progression. Jacobian maps, derived from spatial normalization in voxel-based morphometry (VBM), have been instrumental in interpreting volume alterations associated with AD. However, the computational cost of generating Jacobian maps limits its clinical adoption. In this study, we explore alternative methods and propose Sobel kernel angle difference (SKAD) as a computationally efficient alternative. SKAD is a derivative operation that offers an optimized approach to quantifying volumetric alterations through localized analysis of the gradients. By efficiently extracting gradient amplitude changes at critical spatial regions, this derivative operation captures regional volume variations Evaluation of SKAD over various medical datasets demonstrates that it is 6.3x faster than Jacobian maps while still maintaining comparable accuracy. This makes it an efficient and competitive approach in neuroimaging research and clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models for Classifying Squamous Epithelial Cells of the Cervix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus that connects to the vagina in the female reproductive system. Abnormal cell growth in the squamous epithelial lining of the cervix leads to cervical cancer in females. A Pap smear is a diagnostic procedure used to detect cervical cancer by gently collecting cells from the surface of the cervix with a small brush and analyzing their changes under a microscope. For population-based cervical cancer screening, visual inspection with acetic acid is a cost-effective method with high sensitivity. However, Pap smears are also suitable for mass screening due to their higher specificity. The current Pap smear analysis method is manual, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. Therefore, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach for automatic cell classification is needed. In this study, we aimed to classify cells in Pap smear images into five categories: superficial-intermediate, parabasal, koilocytes, dyskeratotic, and metaplastic. Various machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and k-Nearest Neighbor, as well as deep learning (DL) approaches like ResNet-50, were employed for this classification task. The ML models demonstrated high classification accuracy; however, ResNet-50 outperformed the others, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.06%. This study highlights the efficiency of DL models for cell-level classification and their potential to aid in the early diagnosis of cervical cancer from Pap smear images.</description>

      <title>AI-generated Image Detection: Passive or Watermark?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While text-to-image models offer numerous benefits, they also pose significant societal risks. Detecting AI-generated images is crucial for mitigating these risks. Detection methods can be broadly categorized into passive and watermark-based approaches: passive detectors rely on artifacts present in AI-generated images, whereas watermark-based detectors proactively embed watermarks into such images. A key question is which type of detector performs better in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of this issue. In this work, we aim to bridge that gap by developing ImageDetectBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to compare the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of passive and watermark-based detectors. Our benchmark includes four datasets, each containing a mix of AI-generated and non-AI-generated images. We evaluate five passive detectors and four watermark-based detectors against eight types of common perturbations and three types of adversarial perturbations. Our benchmark results reveal several interesting findings. For instance, watermark-based detectors consistently outperform passive detectors, both in the presence and absence of perturbations. Based on these insights, we provide recommendations for detecting AI-generated images, e.g., when both types of detectors are applicable, watermark-based detectors should be the preferred choice.</description>

      <title>Word-level Sign Language Recognition with Multi-stream Neural Networks Focusing on Local Regions and Skeletal Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Word-level sign language recognition (WSLR) has attracted attention because it is expected to overcome the communication barrier between people with speech impairment and those who can hear. In the WSLR problem, a method designed for action recognition has achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy. Indeed, it sounds reasonable for an action recognition method to perform well on WSLR because sign language is regarded as an action. However, a careful evaluation of the tasks reveals that the tasks of action recognition and WSLR are inherently different. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel WSLR method that takes into account information specifically useful for the WSLR problem. We realize it as a multi-stream neural network (MSNN), which consist of three streams: 1) base stream, 2) local image stream, and 3) skeleton stream. Each stream is designed to handle different types of information. The base stream deals with quick and detailed movements of the hands and body, the local image stream focuses on handshapes and facial expressions, and the skeleton stream captures the relative positions of the body and both hands. This approach allows us to combine various types of data for more comprehensive gesture analysis. Experimental results on the WLASL and MS-ASL datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method; it achieved an improvement of approximately 10\%--15\% in Top-1 accuracy when compared with conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Place Recognition by Refining Temporal and Featural Pseudo Labels from Panoramic Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) using deep networks has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, most of them require a training set with ground truth sensor poses to obtain positive and negative samples of each observation's spatial neighborhood for supervised learning. When such information is unavailable, temporal neighborhoods from a sequentially collected data stream could be exploited for self-supervised training, although we find its performance suboptimal. Inspired by noisy label learning, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named TF-VPR that uses temporal neighborhoods and learnable feature neighborhoods to discover unknown spatial neighborhoods. Our method follows an iterative training paradigm which alternates between: (1) representation learning with data augmentation, (2) positive set expansion to include the current feature space neighbors, and (3) positive set contraction via geometric verification. We conduct auto-labeling and generalization tests on both simulated and real datasets, with either RGB images or point clouds as inputs. The results show that our method outperforms self-supervised baselines in recall rate, robustness, and heading diversity, a novel metric we propose for VPR. Our code and datasets can be found at https://ai4ce.github.io/TF-VPR/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emphasis on healthcare, early childhood education, and fitness, non-invasive measurement and recognition methods have received more attention. Pressure sensing has been extensively studied because of its advantages of simple structure, easy access, visualization application, and harmlessness. This paper introduces a Smart Pressure e-Mat (SPeM) system based on piezoresistive material, Velostat, for human monitoring applications, including recognition of sleeping postures, sports, and yoga. After a subsystem scans the e-mat readings and processes the signal, it generates a pressure image stream. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to fit and train the pressure image stream and recognize the corresponding human behavior. Four sleeping postures and 13 dynamic activities inspired by Nintendo Switch Ring Fit Adventure (RFA) are used as a preliminary validation of the proposed SPeM system. The SPeM system achieves high accuracies in both applications, demonstrating the high accuracy and generalizability of the models. Compared with other pressure sensor-based systems, SPeM possesses more flexible applications and commercial application prospects, with reliable, robust, and repeatable properties.</description>

      <title>VAST: Vivify Your Talking Avatar via Zero-Shot Expressive Facial Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current talking face generation methods mainly focus on speech-lip synchronization. However, insufficient investigation on the facial talking style leads to a lifeless and monotonous avatar. Most previous works fail to imitate expressive styles from arbitrary video prompts and ensure the authenticity of the generated video. This paper proposes an unsupervised variational style transfer model (VAST) to vivify the neutral photo-realistic avatars. Our model consists of three key components: a style encoder that extracts facial style representations from the given video prompts; a hybrid facial expression decoder to model accurate speech-related movements; a variational style enhancer that enhances the style space to be highly expressive and meaningful. With our essential designs on facial style learning, our model is able to flexibly capture the expressive facial style from arbitrary video prompts and transfer it onto a personalized image renderer in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed approach contributes to a more vivid talking avatar with higher authenticity and richer expressiveness.</description>

      <title>High-Level Parallelism and Nested Features for Dynamic Inference Cost and Top-Down Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel network topology that seamlessly integrates dynamic inference cost with a top-down attention mechanism, addressing two significant gaps in traditional deep learning models. Drawing inspiration from human perception, we combine sequential processing of generic low-level features with parallelism and nesting of high-level features. This design not only reflects a finding from recent neuroscience research regarding - spatially and contextually distinct neural activations - in human cortex, but also introduces a novel "cutout" technique: the ability to selectively activate %segments of the network for task-relevant only network segments of task-relevant categories to optimize inference cost and eliminate the need for re-training. We believe this paves the way for future network designs that are lightweight and adaptable, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, from compact edge devices to large-scale clouds. Our proposed topology also comes with a built-in top-down attention mechanism, which allows processing to be directly influenced by either enhancing or inhibiting category-specific high-level features, drawing parallels to the selective attention mechanism observed in human cognition. Using targeted external signals, we experimentally enhanced predictions across all tested models. In terms of dynamic inference cost our methodology can achieve an exclusion of up to $73.48\,\%$ of parameters and $84.41\,\%$ fewer giga-multiply-accumulate (GMAC) operations, analysis against comparative baselines show an average reduction of $40\,\%$ in parameters and $8\,\%$ in GMACs across the cases we evaluated.</description>

      <title>Informative Scene Graph Generation via Debiasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scene graph generation aims to detect visual relationship triplets, (subject, predicate, object). Due to biases in data, current models tend to predict common predicates, e.g. "on" and "at", instead of informative ones, e.g. "standing on" and "looking at". This tendency results in the loss of precise information and overall performance. If a model only uses "stone on road" rather than "stone blocking road" to describe an image, it may be a grave misunderstanding. We argue that this phenomenon is caused by two imbalances: semantic space level imbalance and training sample level imbalance. For this problem, we propose DB-SGG, an effective framework based on debiasing but not the conventional distribution fitting. It integrates two components: Semantic Debiasing (SD) and Balanced Predicate Learning (BPL), for these imbalances. SD utilizes a confusion matrix and a bipartite graph to construct predicate relationships. BPL adopts a random undersampling strategy and an ambiguity removing strategy to focus on informative predicates. Benefiting from the model-agnostic process, our method can be easily applied to SGG models and outperforms Transformer by 136.3%, 119.5%, and 122.6% on mR@20 at three SGG sub-tasks on the SGG-VG dataset. Our method is further verified on another complex SGG dataset (SGG-GQA) and two downstream tasks (sentence-to-graph retrieval and image captioning).</description>

      <title>Accurate Eye Tracking from Dense 3D Surface Reconstructions using Single-Shot Deflectometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eye-tracking plays a crucial role in the development of virtual reality devices, neuroscience research, and psychology. Despite its significance in numerous applications, achieving an accurate, robust, and fast eye-tracking solution remains a considerable challenge for current state-of-the-art methods. While existing reflection-based techniques (e.g., "glint tracking") are considered to be very accurate, their performance is limited by their reliance on sparse 3D surface data acquired solely from the cornea surface. In this paper, we rethink the way how specular reflections can be used for eye tracking: We propose a novel method for accurate and fast evaluation of the gaze direction that exploits teachings from single-shot phase-measuring-deflectometry(PMD). In contrast to state-of-the-art reflection-based methods, our method acquires dense 3D surface information of both cornea and sclera within only one single camera frame (single-shot). For a typical measurement, we acquire $&gt;3000 \times$ more surface reflection points ("glints") than conventional methods. We show the feasibility of our approach with experimentally evaluated gaze errors on a realistic model eye below only $0.12^\circ$. Moreover, we demonstrate quantitative measurements on real human eyes in vivo, reaching accuracy values between only $0.46^\circ$ and $0.97^\circ$.</description>

      <title>HHAvatar: Gaussian Head Avatar with Dynamic Hairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D head avatars has always been a research hotspot, but it remains a great challenge under lightweight sparse view setups. In this paper, we propose HHAvatar represented by controllable 3D Gaussians for high-fidelity head avatar with dynamic hair modeling. We first use 3D Gaussians to represent the appearance of the head, and then jointly optimize neutral 3D Gaussians and a fully learned MLP-based deformation field to capture complex expressions. The two parts benefit each other, thereby our method can model fine-grained dynamic details while ensuring expression accuracy. Furthermore, we devise a well-designed geometry-guided initialization strategy based on implicit SDF and Deep Marching Tetrahedra for the stability and convergence of the training procedure. To address the problem of dynamic hair modeling, we introduce a hybrid head model into our avatar representation based Gaussian Head Avatar and a training method that considers timing information and an occlusion perception module to model the non-rigid motion of hair. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art sparse-view methods, achieving ultra high-fidelity rendering quality at 2K resolution even under exaggerated expressions and driving hairs reasonably with the motion of the head</description>

      <title>A Multi-scale Information Integration Framework for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims at generating a fused image containing the intensity and detail information of source images, and the key issue is effectively measuring and integrating the complementary information of multi-modality images from the same scene. Existing methods mostly adopt a simple weight in the loss function to decide the information retention of each modality rather than adaptively measuring complementary information for different image pairs. In this study, we propose a multi-scale dual attention (MDA) framework for infrared and visible image fusion, which is designed to measure and integrate complementary information in both structure and loss function at the image and patch level. In our method, the residual downsample block decomposes source images into three scales first. Then, dual attention fusion block integrates complementary information and generates a spatial and channel attention map at each scale for feature fusion. Finally, the output image is reconstructed by the residual reconstruction block. Loss function consists of image-level, feature-level and patch-level three parts, of which the calculation of the image-level and patch-level two parts are based on the weights generated by the complementary information measurement. Indeed, to constrain the pixel intensity distribution between the output and infrared image, a style loss is added. Our fusion results perform robust and informative across different scenarios. Qualitative and quantitative results on two datasets illustrate that our method is able to preserve both thermal radiation and detailed information from two modalities and achieve comparable results compared with the other state-of-the-art methods. Ablation experiments show the effectiveness of our information integration architecture and adaptively measure complementary information retention in the loss function.</description>

Abstract: Talking face generation has gained immense popularity in the computer vision community, with various applications including AR, VR, teleconferencing, digital assistants, and avatars. Traditional methods are mainly audio-driven, which have to deal with the inevitable resource-intensive nature of audio storage and processing. To address such a challenge, we propose FT2TF - First-Person Statement Text-To-Talking Face Generation, a novel one-stage end-to-end pipeline for talking face generation driven by first-person statement text. Different from previous work, our model only leverages visual and textual information without any other sources (e.g., audio/landmark/pose) during inference. Extensive experiments are conducted on LRS2 and LRS3 datasets, and results on multi-dimensional evaluation metrics are reported. Both quantitative and qualitative results showcase that FT2TF outperforms existing relevant methods and reaches the state-of-the-art. This achievement highlights our model's capability to bridge first-person statements and dynamic face generation, providing insightful guidance for future work.</description>

      <title>Erasing Undesirable Influence in Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05779v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models are highly effective at generating high-quality images but pose risks, such as the unintentional generation of NSFW (not safe for work) content. Although various techniques have been proposed to mitigate unwanted influences in diffusion models while preserving overall performance, achieving a balance between these goals remains challenging. In this work, we introduce EraseDiff, an algorithm designed to preserve the utility of the diffusion model on retained data while removing the unwanted information associated with the data to be forgotten. Our approach formulates this task as a constrained optimization problem using the value function, resulting in a natural first-order algorithm for solving the optimization problem. By altering the generative process to deviate away from the ground-truth denoising trajectory, we update parameters for preservation while controlling constraint reduction to ensure effective erasure, striking an optimal trade-off. Extensive experiments and thorough comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that EraseDiff effectively preserves the model's utility, efficacy, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Random Representations Outperform Online Continually Learned Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning has primarily focused on the issue of catastrophic forgetting and the associated stability-plasticity tradeoffs. However, little attention has been paid to the efficacy of continually learned representations, as representations are learned alongside classifiers throughout the learning process. Our primary contribution is empirically demonstrating that existing online continually trained deep networks produce inferior representations compared to a simple pre-defined random transforms. Our approach projects raw pixels using a fixed random transform, approximating an RBF-Kernel initialized before any data is seen. We then train a simple linear classifier on top without storing any exemplars, processing one sample at a time in an online continual learning setting. This method, called RanDumb, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art continually learned representations across all standard online continual learning benchmarks. Our study reveals the significant limitations of representation learning, particularly in low-exemplar and online continual learning scenarios. Extending our investigation to popular exemplar-free scenarios with pretrained models, we find that training only a linear classifier on top of pretrained representations surpasses most continual fine-tuning and prompt-tuning strategies. Overall, our investigation challenges the prevailing assumptions about effective representation learning in online continual learning. Our code is available at://github.com/drimpossible/RanDumb.</description>

      <title>Voxel-Mesh Hybrid Representation for Real-Time View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neural radiance fields (NeRF) have emerged as a prominent methodology for synthesizing realistic images of novel views. While neural radiance representations based on voxels or mesh individually offer distinct advantages, excelling in either rendering quality or speed, each has limitations in the other aspect. In response, we propose a hybrid representation named Vosh, seamlessly combining both voxel and mesh components in hybrid rendering for view synthesis. Vosh is meticulously crafted by optimizing the voxel grid based on neural rendering, strategically meshing a portion of the volumetric density field to surface. Therefore, it excels in fast rendering scenes with simple geometry and textures through its mesh component, while simultaneously enabling high-quality rendering in intricate regions by leveraging voxel component. The flexibility of Vosh is showcased through the ability to adjust hybrid ratios, providing users the ability to control the balance between rendering quality and speed based on flexible usage. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves commendable trade-off between rendering quality and speed, and notably has real-time performance on mobile devices. The interactive web demo and code are available at https://zyyzyy06.github.io/Vosh.</description>

      <title>Q-SLAM: Quadric Representations for Monocular SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we reimagine volumetric representations through the lens of quadrics. We posit that rigid scene components can be effectively decomposed into quadric surfaces. Leveraging this assumption, we reshape the volumetric representations with million of cubes by several quadric planes, which results in more accurate and efficient modeling of 3D scenes in SLAM contexts. First, we use the quadric assumption to rectify noisy depth estimations from RGB inputs. This step significantly improves depth estimation accuracy, and allows us to efficiently sample ray points around quadric planes instead of the entire volume space in previous NeRF-SLAM systems. Second, we introduce a novel quadric-decomposed transformer to aggregate information across quadrics. The quadric semantics are not only explicitly used for depth correction and scene decomposition, but also serve as an implicit supervision signal for the mapping network. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, our method exhibits superior performance over other approaches relying on estimated depth, and achieves comparable accuracy to methods utilizing ground truth depth on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Perspective-Equivariance for Unsupervised Imaging with Camera Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ill-posed image reconstruction problems appear in many scenarios such as remote sensing, where obtaining high quality images is crucial for environmental monitoring, disaster management and urban planning. Deep learning has seen great success in overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. However, these inverse problems rarely come with ground truth data, highlighting the importance of unsupervised learning from partial and noisy measurements alone. We propose perspective-equivariant imaging (EI), a framework that leverages classical projective camera geometry in optical imaging systems, such as satellites or handheld cameras, to recover information lost in ill-posed camera imaging problems. We show that our much richer non-linear class of group transforms, derived from camera geometry, generalises previous EI work and is an excellent prior for satellite and urban image data. Perspective-EI achieves state-of-the-art results in multispectral pansharpening, outperforming other unsupervised methods in the literature.

      <title>MMTryon: Multi-Modal Multi-Reference Control for High-Quality Fashion Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00448v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces MMTryon, a multi-modal multi-reference VIrtual Try-ON (VITON) framework, which can generate high-quality compositional try-on results by taking a text instruction and multiple garment images as inputs. Our MMTryon addresses three problems overlooked in prior literature: 1) Support of multiple try-on items. Existing methods are commonly designed for single-item try-on tasks (e.g., upper/lower garments, dresses). 2)Specification of dressing style. Existing methods are unable to customize dressing styles based on instructions (e.g., zipped/unzipped, tuck-in/tuck-out, etc.) 3) Segmentation Dependency. They further heavily rely on category-specific segmentation models to identify the replacement regions, with segmentation errors directly leading to significant artifacts in the try-on results. To address the first two issues, our MMTryon introduces a novel multi-modality and multi-reference attention mechanism to combine the garment information from reference images and dressing-style information from text instructions. Besides, to remove the segmentation dependency, MMTryon uses a parsing-free garment encoder and leverages a novel scalable data generation pipeline to convert existing VITON datasets to a form that allows MMTryon to be trained without requiring any explicit segmentation. Extensive experiments on high-resolution benchmarks and in-the-wild test sets demonstrate MMTryon's superiority over existing SOTA methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. MMTryon's impressive performance on multi-item and style-controllable virtual try-on scenarios and its ability to try on any outfit in a large variety of scenarios from any source image, opens up a new avenue for future investigation in the fashion community.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Low-Pass Filtering Behavior in Image Super-Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07919v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks for image super-resolution (ISR) have shown significant advantages over traditional approaches like the interpolation. However, they are often criticized as 'black boxes' compared to traditional approaches with solid mathematical foundations. In this paper, we attempt to interpret the behavior of deep neural networks in ISR using theories from the field of signal processing. First, we report an intriguing phenomenon, referred to as `the sinc phenomenon.' It occurs when an impulse input is fed to a neural network. Then, building on this observation, we propose a method named Hybrid Response Analysis (HyRA) to analyze the behavior of neural networks in ISR tasks. Specifically, HyRA decomposes a neural network into a parallel connection of a linear system and a non-linear system and demonstrates that the linear system functions as a low-pass filter while the non-linear system injects high-frequency information. Finally, to quantify the injected high-frequency information, we introduce a metric for image-to-image tasks called Frequency Spectrum Distribution Similarity (FSDS). FSDS reflects the distribution similarity of different frequency components and can capture nuances that traditional metrics may overlook. Code, videos and raw experimental results for this paper can be found in: https://github.com/RisingEntropy/LPFInISR.</description>

      <title>Capsule Network Projectors are Equivariant and Invariant Learners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning invariant representations has been the longstanding approach to self-supervised learning. However, recently progress has been made in preserving equivariant properties in representations, yet do so with highly prescribed architectures. In this work, we propose an invariant-equivariant self-supervised architecture that employs Capsule Networks (CapsNets) which have been shown to capture equivariance with respect to novel viewpoints. We demonstrate that the use of CapsNets in equivariant self-supervised architectures achieves improved downstream performance on equivariant tasks with higher efficiency and fewer network parameters. To accommodate the architectural changes of CapsNets, we introduce a new objective function based on entropy minimisation. This approach which we name CapsIE (Capsule Invariant Equivariant Network) achieves state-of-the-art performance on the equivariant rotation tasks on the 3DIEBench dataset compared to prior equivariant SSL methods, while performing competitively against supervised counterparts. Our results demonstrate the ability of CapsNets to learn complex and generalised representations for large-scale, multi-task datasets compared to previous CapsNet benchmarks.

      <description>arXiv:2405.14475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While controllable generative models for images and videos have achieved remarkable success, high-quality models for 3D scenes, particularly in unbounded scenarios like autonomous driving, remain underdeveloped due to high data acquisition costs. In this paper, we introduce MagicDrive3D, a novel pipeline for controllable 3D street scene generation that supports multi-condition control, including BEV maps, 3D objects, and text descriptions. Unlike previous methods that reconstruct before training the generative models, MagicDrive3D first trains a video generation model and then reconstructs from the generated data. This innovative approach enables easily controllable generation and static scene acquisition, resulting in high-quality scene reconstruction. To address the minor errors in generated content, we propose deformable Gaussian splatting with monocular depth initialization and appearance modeling to manage exposure discrepancies across viewpoints. Validated on the nuScenes dataset, MagicDrive3D generates diverse, high-quality 3D driving scenes that support any-view rendering and enhance downstream tasks like BEV segmentation. Our results demonstrate the framework's superior performance, showcasing its potential for autonomous driving simulation and beyond.</description>

      <title>Q-DiT: Accurate Post-Training Quantization for Diffusion Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models, particularly the architectural transformation from UNet-based models to Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), significantly improve the quality and scalability of image and video generation. However, despite their impressive capabilities, the substantial computational costs of these large-scale models pose significant challenges for real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution, enabling model compression and accelerated inference for pretrained models, without the costly retraining. However, research on DiT quantization remains sparse, and existing PTQ frameworks, primarily designed for traditional diffusion models, tend to suffer from biased quantization, leading to notable performance degradation. In this work, we identify that DiTs typically exhibit significant spatial variance in both weights and activations, along with temporal variance in activations. To address these issues, we propose Q-DiT, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates two key techniques: automatic quantization granularity allocation to handle the significant variance of weights and activations across input channels, and sample-wise dynamic activation quantization to adaptively capture activation changes across both timesteps and samples. Extensive experiments conducted on ImageNet and VBench demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Q-DiT. Specifically, when quantizing DiT-XL/2 to W6A8 on ImageNet ($256 \times 256$), Q-DiT achieves a remarkable reduction in FID by 1.09 compared to the baseline. Under the more challenging W4A8 setting, it maintains high fidelity in image and video generation, establishing a new benchmark for efficient, high-quality quantization in DiTs.

Abstract: Panoramic images can broaden the Field of View (FoV), occlusion-aware prediction can deepen the understanding of the scene, and domain adaptation can transfer across viewing domains. In this work, we introduce a novel task, Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (OASS), which simultaneously tackles all these three challenges. For benchmarking OASS, we establish a new human-annotated dataset for Blending Panoramic Amodal Seamless Segmentation, i.e., BlendPASS. Besides, we propose the first solution UnmaskFormer, aiming at unmasking the narrow FoV, occlusions, and domain gaps all at once. Specifically, UnmaskFormer includes the crucial designs of Unmasking Attention (UA) and Amodal-oriented Mix (AoMix). Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BlendPASS dataset, reaching a remarkable mAPQ of 26.58% and mIoU of 43.66%. On public panoramic semantic segmentation datasets, i.e., SynPASS and DensePASS, our method outperforms previous methods and obtains 45.34% and 48.08% in mIoU, respectively. The fresh BlendPASS dataset and our source code are available at https://github.com/yihong-97/OASS.</description>

Abstract: Egocentric videos present unique challenges for 3D scene understanding due to rapid camera motion, frequent object occlusions, and limited object visibility. This paper introduces a novel approach to instance segmentation and tracking in first-person video that leverages 3D awareness to overcome these obstacles. Our method integrates scene geometry, 3D object centroid tracking, and instance segmentation to create a robust framework for analyzing dynamic egocentric scenes. By incorporating spatial and temporal cues, we achieve superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 2D approaches. Extensive evaluations on the challenging EPIC Fields dataset demonstrate significant improvements across a range of tracking and segmentation consistency metrics. Specifically, our method outperforms the next best performing approach by $7$ points in Association Accuracy (AssA) and $4.5$ points in IDF1 score, while reducing the number of ID switches by $73\%$ to $80\%$ across various object categories. Leveraging our tracked instance segmentations, we showcase downstream applications in 3D object reconstruction and amodal video object segmentation in these egocentric settings.</description>

      <title>MiniDrive: More Efficient Vision-Language Models with Multi-Level 2D Features as Text Tokens for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) serve as general-purpose end-to-end models in autonomous driving, performing subtasks such as prediction, planning, and perception through question-and-answer interactions. However, most existing methods rely on computationally expensive visual encoders and large language models (LLMs), making them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios and real-time applications. Meanwhile, most existing VLMs lack the ability to process multiple images, making it difficult to adapt to multi-camera perception in autonomous driving. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called MiniDrive, which incorporates our proposed Feature Engineering Mixture of Experts (FE-MoE) module and Dynamic Instruction Adapter (DI-Adapter). The FE-MoE effectively maps 2D features into visual token embeddings before being input into the language model. The DI-Adapter enables the visual token embeddings to dynamically change with the instruction text embeddings, resolving the issue of static visual token embeddings for the same image in previous approaches. Compared to previous works, MiniDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of parameter size, floating point operations, and response efficiency, with the smallest version containing only 83M parameters.</description>

      <title>Region Prompt Tuning: Fine-grained Scene Text Detection Utilizing Region Text Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in prompt tuning have successfully adapted large-scale models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained (CLIP) for downstream tasks such as scene text detection. Typically, text prompt complements the text encoder's input, focusing on global features while neglecting fine-grained details, leading to fine-grained text being ignored in task of scene text detection. In this paper, we propose the region prompt tuning (RPT) method for fine-grained scene text detection, where region text prompt proposed would help focus on fine-grained features. Region prompt tuning method decomposes region text prompt into individual characters and splits visual feature map into region visual tokens, creating a one-to-one correspondence between characters and tokens. This allows a character matches the local features of a token, thereby avoiding the omission of detailed features and fine-grained text. To achieve this, we introduce a sharing position embedding to link each character with its corresponding token and employ a bidirectional distance loss to align each region text prompt character with the target ``text''. To refine the information at fine-grained level, we implement character-token level interactions before and after encoding. Our proposed method combines a general score map from the image-text process with a region score map derived from character-token matching, producing a final score map that could balance the global and local features and be fed into DBNet to detect the text. Experiments on benchmarks like ICDAR2015, TotalText, and CTW1500 demonstrate RPT impressive performance, underscoring its effectiveness for scene text detection.</description>

      <title>DAOcc: 3D Object Detection Assisted Multi-Sensor Fusion for 3D Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of 3D semantic occupancy prediction, which is crucial for autonomous driving and robotics. However, most existing approaches depend on large image resolutions and complex networks to achieve top performance, hindering their application in practical scenarios. Additionally, most multi-sensor fusion approaches focus on improving fusion features while overlooking the exploration of supervision strategies for these features. To this end, we propose DAOcc, a novel multi-modal occupancy prediction framework that leverages 3D object detection supervision to assist in achieving superior performance, while using a deployment-friendly image feature extraction network and practical input image resolution. Furthermore, we introduce a BEV View Range Extension strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of reduced image resolution. Experimental results show that DAOcc achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D-nuScenes and SurroundOcc benchmarks, and surpasses other methods by a significant margin while using only ResNet50 and 256*704 input image resolution. Code will be made available at https://github.com/AlphaPlusTT/DAOcc.</description>

      <title>Classification of Buried Objects from Ground Penetrating Radar Images by using Second Order Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a new classification model based on covariance matrices is built in order to classify buried objects. The inputs of the proposed models are the hyperbola thumbnails obtained with a classical Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) system. These thumbnails are then inputs to the first layers of a classical CNN, which then produces a covariance matrix using the outputs of the convolutional filters. Next, the covariance matrix is given to a network composed of specific layers to classify Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. We show in a large database that our approach outperform shallow networks designed for GPR data and conventional CNNs typically used in computer vision applications, particularly when the number of training data decreases and in the presence of mislabeled data. We also illustrate the interest of our models when training data and test sets are obtained from different weather modes or considerations.</description>

      <title>Mono-InternVL: Pushing the Boundaries of Monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models with Endogenous Visual Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single LLM. In particular, we identify that existing pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often suffer from unstable optimization or catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, our core idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM, thereby stably learning visual knowledge from noisy data while freezing the LLM. Based on this principle, we present Mono-InternVL, a novel monolithic MLLM that seamlessly integrates a set of visual experts via a multimodal mixture-of-experts structure. Moreover, we propose an innovative pre-training strategy to maximize the visual capability of Mono-InternVL, namely Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP). In particular, EViP is designed as a progressive learning process for visual experts, which aims to fully exploit the visual knowledge from noisy data to high-quality data. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 16 benchmarks. Experimental results confirm the superior performance of Mono-InternVL than existing monolithic MLLMs on 13 of 16 multimodal benchmarks, e.g., +80 points over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared to the modular baseline, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL still retains comparable multimodal performance while reducing up to 67% first token latency. Code and model are released at https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/Mono-InternVL-2B.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Single Image to 3D Generation using Gaussian Splatting and Hybrid Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D object generation from a single image involves estimating the full 3D geometry and texture of unseen views from an unposed RGB image captured in the wild. Accurately reconstructing an object's complete 3D structure and texture has numerous applications in real-world scenarios, including robotic manipulation, grasping, 3D scene understanding, and AR/VR. Recent advancements in 3D object generation have introduced techniques that reconstruct an object's 3D shape and texture by optimizing the efficient representation of Gaussian Splatting, guided by pre-trained 2D or 3D diffusion models. However, a notable disparity exists between the training datasets of these models, leading to distinct differences in their outputs. While 2D models generate highly detailed visuals, they lack cross-view consistency in geometry and texture. In contrast, 3D models ensure consistency across different views but often result in overly smooth textures. We propose bridging the gap between 2D and 3D diffusion models to address this limitation by integrating a two-stage frequency-based distillation loss with Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we leverage geometric priors in the low-frequency spectrum from a 3D diffusion model to maintain consistent geometry and use a 2D diffusion model to refine the fidelity and texture in the high-frequency spectrum of the generated 3D structure, resulting in more detailed and fine-grained outcomes. Our approach enhances geometric consistency and visual quality, outperforming the current SOTA. Additionally, we demonstrate the easy adaptability of our method for efficient object pose estimation and tracking.</description>

      <title>SynFER: Towards Boosting Facial Expression Recognition with Synthetic Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Facial expression datasets remain limited in scale due to privacy concerns, the subjectivity of annotations, and the labor-intensive nature of data collection. This limitation poses a significant challenge for developing modern deep learning-based facial expression analysis models, particularly foundation models, that rely on large-scale data for optimal performance. To tackle the overarching and complex challenge, we introduce SynFER (Synthesis of Facial Expressions with Refined Control), a novel framework for synthesizing facial expression image data based on high-level textual descriptions as well as more fine-grained and precise control through facial action units. To ensure the quality and reliability of the synthetic data, we propose a semantic guidance technique to steer the generation process and a pseudo-label generator to help rectify the facial expression labels for the synthetic images. To demonstrate the generation fidelity and the effectiveness of the synthetic data from SynFER, we conduct extensive experiments on representation learning using both synthetic data and real-world data. Experiment results validate the efficacy of the proposed approach and the synthetic data. Notably, our approach achieves a 67.23% classification accuracy on AffectNet when training solely with synthetic data equivalent to the AffectNet training set size, which increases to 69.84% when scaling up to five times the original size. Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant advances in computer vision tasks, yet their high inference times and latency often limit real-world applicability. While model compression techniques have gained popularity as solutions, they often overlook the critical balance between low latency and uncompromised accuracy. By harnessing quantum-inspired pruning, tensor decomposition, and annealing-based matrix factorization - three quantum-inspired concepts - we introduce QIANets: a novel approach of redesigning the traditional GoogLeNet, DenseNet, and ResNet-18 model architectures to process more parameters and computations whilst maintaining low inference times. Despite experimental limitations, the method was tested and evaluated, demonstrating reductions in inference times, along with effective accuracy preservations.</description>

      <title>Multiview Scene Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proper scene representation is central to the pursuit of spatial intelligence where agents can robustly reconstruct and efficiently understand 3D scenes. A scene representation is either metric, such as landmark maps in 3D reconstruction, 3D bounding boxes in object detection, or voxel grids in occupancy prediction, or topological, such as pose graphs with loop closures in SLAM or visibility graphs in SfM. In this work, we propose to build Multiview Scene Graphs (MSG) from unposed images, representing a scene topologically with interconnected place and object nodes. The task of building MSG is challenging for existing representation learning methods since it needs to jointly address both visual place recognition, object detection, and object association from images with limited fields of view and potentially large viewpoint changes. To evaluate any method tackling this task, we developed an MSG dataset and annotation based on a public 3D dataset. We also propose an evaluation metric based on the intersection-over-union score of MSG edges. Moreover, we develop a novel baseline method built on mainstream pretrained vision models, combining visual place recognition and object association into one Transformer decoder architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method has superior performance compared to existing relevant baselines.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Score identity Distillation: Rapidly Surpassing the Teacher in One Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score identity Distillation (SiD) is a data-free method that has achieved SOTA performance in image generation by leveraging only a pretrained diffusion model, without requiring any training data. However, its ultimate performance is constrained by how accurate the pretrained model captures the true data scores at different stages of the diffusion process. In this paper, we introduce SiDA (SiD with Adversarial Loss), which not only enhances generation quality but also improves distillation efficiency by incorporating real images and adversarial loss. SiDA utilizes the encoder from the generator's score network as a discriminator, boosting its ability to distinguish between real images and those generated by SiD. The adversarial loss is batch-normalized within each GPU and then combined with the original SiD loss. This integration effectively incorporates the average "fakeness" per GPU batch into the pixel-based SiD loss, enabling SiDA to distill a single-step generator either from scratch or by fine-tuning an existing one. SiDA converges significantly faster than its predecessor when trained from scratch, and swiftly improves upon the original model's performance after an initial warmup period during fine-tuning from a pre-distilled SiD generator. This one-step adversarial distillation method establishes new benchmarks in generation performance when distilling EDM diffusion models pretrained on CIFAR-10 (32x32) and ImageNet (64x64), achieving FID score of 1.110 on ImageNet 64x64. It sets record-low FID scores when distilling EDM2 models trained on ImageNet (512x512), surpassing even the largest teacher model, EDM2-XXL. Our SiDA's results record FID scores of 2.156 for EDM2-XS, 1.669 for S, 1.488 for M, 1.413 for L, 1.379 for XL, and 1.366 for XXL, demonstrating significant improvements across all model sizes. Our open-source code will be integrated into the SiD codebase.</description>

      <title>TALoS: Enhancing Semantic Scene Completion via Test-time Adaptation on the Line of Sight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to perform geometric completion and semantic segmentation simultaneously. Despite the promising results achieved by existing studies, the inherently ill-posed nature of the task presents significant challenges in diverse driving scenarios. This paper introduces TALoS, a novel test-time adaptation approach for SSC that excavates the information available in driving environments. Specifically, we focus on that observations made at a certain moment can serve as Ground Truth (GT) for scene completion at another moment. Given the characteristics of the LiDAR sensor, an observation of an object at a certain location confirms both 1) the occupation of that location and 2) the absence of obstacles along the line of sight from the LiDAR to that point. TALoS utilizes these observations to obtain self-supervision about occupancy and emptiness, guiding the model to adapt to the scene in test time. In a similar manner, we aggregate reliable SSC predictions among multiple moments and leverage them as semantic pseudo-GT for adaptation. Further, to leverage future observations that are not accessible at the current time, we present a dual optimization scheme using the model in which the update is delayed until the future observation is available. Evaluations on the SemanticKITTI validation and test sets demonstrate that TALoS significantly improves the performance of the pre-trained SSC model. Our code is available at https://github.com/blue-531/TALoS.</description>

      <title>Copula-Linked Parallel ICA: A Method for Coupling Structural and Functional MRI brain Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different brain imaging modalities offer unique insights into brain function and structure. Combining them enhances our understanding of neural mechanisms. Prior multimodal studies fusing functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) have shown the benefits of this approach. Since sMRI lacks temporal data, existing fusion methods often compress fMRI temporal information into summary measures, sacrificing rich temporal dynamics. Motivated by the observation that covarying networks are identified in both sMRI and resting-state fMRI, we developed a novel fusion method, by combining deep learning frameworks, copulas and independent component analysis (ICA), named copula linked parallel ICA (CLiP-ICA). This method estimates independent sources for each modality and links the spatial sources of fMRI and sMRI using a copula-based model for more flexible integration of temporal and spatial data. We tested CLiP-ICA using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results showed that CLiP-ICA effectively captures both strongly and weakly linked sMRI and fMRI networks, including the cerebellum, sensorimotor, visual, cognitive control, and default mode networks. It revealed more meaningful components and fewer artifacts, addressing the long-standing issue of optimal model order in ICA. CLiP-ICA also detected complex functional connectivity patterns across stages of cognitive decline, with cognitively normal subjects generally showing higher connectivity in sensorimotor and visual networks compared to patients with Alzheimer, along with patterns suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Contextual Uncertainty of Visual Data for Efficient Training of Deep Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objects, in the real world, rarely occur in isolation and exhibit typical arrangements governed by their independent utility, and their expected interaction with humans and other objects in the context. For example, a chair is expected near a table, and a computer is expected on top. Humans use this spatial context and relative placement as an important cue for visual recognition in case of ambiguities. Similar to human's, DNN's exploit contextual information from data to learn representations. Our research focuses on harnessing the contextual aspects of visual data to optimize data annotation and enhance the training of deep networks. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We introduce the notion of contextual diversity for active learning CDAL and show its applicability in three different visual tasks semantic segmentation, object detection and image classification, (2) We propose a data repair algorithm to curate contextually fair data to reduce model bias, enabling the model to detect objects out of their obvious context, (3) We propose Class-based annotation, where contextually relevant classes are selected that are complementary for model training under domain shift. Understanding the importance of well-curated data, we also emphasize the necessity of involving humans in the loop to achieve accurate annotations and to develop novel interaction strategies that allow humans to serve as fact-checkers. In line with this we are working on developing image retrieval system for wildlife camera trap images and reliable warning system for poor quality rural roads. For large-scale annotation, we are employing a strategic combination of human expertise and zero-shot models, while also integrating human input at various stages for continuous feedback.</description>

      <title>CRT-Fusion: Camera, Radar, Temporal Fusion Using Motion Information for 3D Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and robust 3D object detection is a critical component in autonomous vehicles and robotics. While recent radar-camera fusion methods have made significant progress by fusing information in the bird's-eye view (BEV) representation, they often struggle to effectively capture the motion of dynamic objects, leading to limited performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CRT-Fusion, a novel framework that integrates temporal information into radar-camera fusion to address this challenge. Our approach comprises three key modules: Multi-View Fusion (MVF), Motion Feature Estimator (MFE), and Motion Guided Temporal Fusion (MGTF). The MVF module fuses radar and image features within both the camera view and bird's-eye view, thereby generating a more precise unified BEV representation. The MFE module conducts two simultaneous tasks: estimation of pixel-wise velocity information and BEV segmentation. Based on the velocity and the occupancy score map obtained from the MFE module, the MGTF module aligns and fuses feature maps across multiple timestamps in a recurrent manner. By considering the motion of dynamic objects, CRT-Fusion can produce robust BEV feature maps, thereby improving detection accuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CRT-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance for radar-camera-based 3D object detection. Our approach outperforms the previous best method in terms of NDS by +1.7%, while also surpassing the leading approach in mAP by +1.4%. These significant improvements in both metrics showcase the effectiveness of our proposed fusion strategy in enhancing the reliability and accuracy of 3D object detection.</description>

      <title>Constraint Learning for Parametric Point Cloud</title>

Abstract: Parametric point clouds are sampled from CAD shapes, and have become increasingly prevalent in industrial manufacturing. However, most existing point cloud learning methods focus on the geometric features, such as developing efficient convolution operations, overlooking the important attribute of constraints inherent in CAD shapes, which limits these methods' ability to comprehend CAD shapes fully. To address this issue, we analyzed the effect of constraints, and proposed its deep learning-friendly representation, after that, the Constraint Feature Learning Network (CstNet) was developed to extract and leverage constraints. Our CstNet includes two stages. Stage 1 extracts constraints from B-Rep data or point cloud. Stage 2 leverages coordinates and constraints to enhance the comprehension of CAD shapes. Additionally, we built up the Parametric 20,000 Multi-modal Dataset for the scarcity of labeled B-Rep datasets. Experiments demonstrate that our CstNet achieved state-of-the-art performance on both public and proposed CAD shape datasets. To the best of our knowledge, CstNet is the first constraint-based learning method tailored for CAD shape analysis.</description>

      <title>JoyVASA: Portrait and Animal Image Animation with Diffusion-Based Audio-Driven Facial Dynamics and Head Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation has made significant advances with diffusion-based models, improving video quality and lipsync accuracy. However, the increasing complexity of these models has led to inefficiencies in training and inference, as well as constraints on video length and inter-frame continuity. In this paper, we propose JoyVASA, a diffusion-based method for generating facial dynamics and head motion in audio-driven facial animation. Specifically, in the first stage, we introduce a decoupled facial representation framework that separates dynamic facial expressions from static 3D facial representations. This decoupling allows the system to generate longer videos by combining any static 3D facial representation with dynamic motion sequences. Then, in the second stage, a diffusion transformer is trained to generate motion sequences directly from audio cues, independent of character identity. Finally, a generator trained in the first stage uses the 3D facial representation and the generated motion sequences as inputs to render high-quality animations. With the decoupled facial representation and the identity-independent motion generation process, JoyVASA extends beyond human portraits to animate animal faces seamlessly. The model is trained on a hybrid dataset of private Chinese and public English data, enabling multilingual support. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Future work will focus on improving real-time performance and refining expression control, further expanding the applications in portrait animation. The code is available at: https://github.com/jdh-algo/JoyVASA.</description>

      <title>Generation of synthetic gait data: application to multiple sclerosis patients' gait patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading cause of severe non-traumatic disability in young adults and its incidence is increasing worldwide. The variability of gait impairment in MS necessitates the development of a non-invasive, sensitive, and cost-effective tool for quantitative gait evaluation. The eGait movement sensor, designed to characterize human gait through unit quaternion time series (QTS) representing hip rotations, is a promising approach. However, the small sample sizes typical of clinical studies pose challenges for the stability of gait data analysis tools. To address these challenges, this article presents two key scientific contributions. First, a comprehensive framework is proposed for transforming QTS data into a form that preserves the essential geometric properties of gait while enabling the use of any tabular synthetic data generation method. Second, a synthetic data generation method is introduced, based on nearest neighbors weighting, which produces high-fidelity synthetic QTS data suitable for small datasets and private data environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method, is demonstrated through its application to MS gait data, showing very good fidelity and respect of the initial geometry of the data. Thanks to this work, we are able to produce synthetic data sets and work on the stability of clustering methods.</description>

      <title>TSFormer: A Robust Framework for Efficient UHD Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-high-definition (UHD) image restoration is vital for applications demanding exceptional visual fidelity, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency, limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose TSFormer, an all-in-one framework that integrates \textbf{T}rusted learning with \textbf{S}parsification to boost both generalization capability and computational efficiency in UHD image restoration. The key is that only a small amount of token movement is allowed within the model. To efficiently filter tokens, we use Min-$p$ with random matrix theory to quantify the uncertainty of tokens, thereby improving the robustness of the model. Our model can run a 4K image in real time (40fps) with 3.38 M parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSFormer achieves state-of-the-art restoration quality while enhancing generalization and reducing computational demands. In addition, our token filtering method can be applied to other image restoration models to effectively accelerate inference and maintain performance.</description>

      <title>Time Step Generating: A Universal Synthesized Deepfake Image Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently, high-fidelity text-to-image models are developed in an accelerating pace. Among them, Diffusion Models have led to a remarkable improvement in the quality of image generation, making it vary challenging to distinguish between real and synthesized images. It simultaneously raises serious concerns regarding privacy and security. Some methods are proposed to distinguish the diffusion model generated images through reconstructing. However, the inversion and denoising processes are time-consuming and heavily reliant on the pre-trained generative model. Consequently, if the pre-trained generative model meet the problem of out-of-domain, the detection performance declines. To address this issue, we propose a universal synthetic image detector Time Step Generating (TSG), which does not rely on pre-trained models' reconstructing ability, specific datasets, or sampling algorithms. Our method utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model's network as a feature extractor to capture fine-grained details, focusing on the subtle differences between real and synthetic images. By controlling the time step t of the network input, we can effectively extract these distinguishing detail features. Then, those features can be passed through a classifier (i.e. Resnet), which efficiently detects whether an image is synthetic or real. We test the proposed TSG on the large-scale GenImage benchmark and it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and generalizability.</description>

      <title>TP-UNet: Temporal Prompt Guided UNet for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of medical image segmentation techniques has been propelled by the adoption of deep learning techniques, particularly UNet-based approaches, which exploit semantic information to improve the accuracy of segmentations. However, the order of organs in scanned images has been disregarded by current medical image segmentation approaches based on UNet. Furthermore, the inherent network structure of UNet does not provide direct capabilities for integrating temporal information. To efficiently integrate temporal information, we propose TP-UNet that utilizes temporal prompts, encompassing organ-construction relationships, to guide the segmentation UNet model. Specifically, our framework is featured with cross-attention and semantic alignment based on unsupervised contrastive learning to combine temporal prompts and image features effectively. Extensive evaluations on two medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TP-UNet. Our implementation will be open-sourced after acceptance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-phase text-to-floorplan generation method, which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an initial layout (Layout-LLM) and refines them into the final floorplans through conditional diffusion model. We incorporate a Chain-of-Thought approach to prompt the LLM based on user text specifications, enabling a more user-friendly and intuitive house layout design. This method allows users to describe their needs in natural language, enhancing accessibility and providing clearer geometric constraints. The final floorplans generated by Layout-LLM through conditional diffusion refinement are more accurate and better meet user requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics, validating its effectiveness in practical home design applications. We plan to release our code for public use.</description>

      <title>DGTR: Distributed Gaussian Turbo-Reconstruction for Sparse-View Vast Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel-view synthesis (NVS) approaches play a critical role in vast scene reconstruction. However, these methods rely heavily on dense image inputs and prolonged training times, making them unsuitable where computational resources are limited. Additionally, few-shot methods often struggle with poor reconstruction quality in vast environments. This paper presents DGTR, a novel distributed framework for efficient Gaussian reconstruction for sparse-view vast scenes. Our approach divides the scene into regions, processed independently by drones with sparse image inputs. Using a feed-forward Gaussian model, we predict high-quality Gaussian primitives, followed by a global alignment algorithm to ensure geometric consistency. Synthetic views and depth priors are incorporated to further enhance training, while a distillation-based model aggregation mechanism enables efficient reconstruction. Our method achieves high-quality large-scale scene reconstruction and novel-view synthesis in significantly reduced training times, outperforming existing approaches in both speed and scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on vast aerial scenes, achieving high-quality results within minutes. Code will released on our [https://3d-aigc.github.io/DGTR].</description>

      <title>CLIP Unreasonable Potential in Single-Shot Face Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Face recognition is a core task in computer vision designed to identify and authenticate individuals by analyzing facial patterns and features. This field intersects with artificial intelligence image processing and machine learning with applications in security authentication and personalization. Traditional approaches in facial recognition focus on capturing facial features like the eyes, nose and mouth and matching these against a database to verify identities. However challenges such as high false positive rates have persisted often due to the similarity among individuals facial features. Recently Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) a model developed by OpenAI has shown promising advancements by linking natural language processing with vision tasks allowing it to generalize across modalities. Using CLIP's vision language correspondence and single-shot finetuning the model can achieve lower false positive rates upon deployment without the need of mass facial features extraction. This integration demonstrating CLIP's potential to address persistent issues in face recognition model performance without complicating our training paradigm.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gaussians: Fast and High-Fidelity 3D Splatting with Linear Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have substantially improved novel view synthesis, enabling high-quality reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, blurring artifacts, such as floating primitives and over-reconstruction, remain challenging. Current methods address these issues by refining scene structure, enhancing geometric representations, addressing blur in training images, improving rendering consistency, and optimizing density control, yet the role of kernel design remains underexplored. We identify the soft boundaries of Gaussian ellipsoids as one of the causes of these artifacts, limiting detail capture in high-frequency regions. To bridge this gap, we introduce 3D Linear Splatting (3DLS), which replaces Gaussian kernels with linear kernels to achieve sharper and more precise results, particularly in high-frequency regions. Through evaluations on three datasets, 3DLS demonstrates state-of-the-art fidelity and accuracy, along with a 30% FPS improvement over baseline 3DGS. The implementation will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Topological Symmetry Enhanced Graph Convolution for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition has achieved remarkable performance with the development of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). However, most of these methods tend to construct complex topology learning mechanisms while neglecting the inherent symmetry of the human body. Additionally, the use of temporal convolutions with certain fixed receptive fields limits their capacity to effectively capture dependencies in time sequences. To address the issues, we (1) propose a novel Topological Symmetry Enhanced Graph Convolution (TSE-GC) to enable distinct topology learning across different channel partitions while incorporating topological symmetry awareness and (2) construct a Multi-Branch Deformable Temporal Convolution (MBDTC) for skeleton-based action recognition. The proposed TSE-GC emphasizes the inherent symmetry of the human body while enabling efficient learning of dynamic topologies. Meanwhile, the design of MBDTC introduces the concept of deformable modeling, leading to more flexible receptive fields and stronger modeling capacity of temporal dependencies. Combining TSE-GC with MBDTC, our final model, TSE-GCN, achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters compared with state-of-the-art methods on three large datasets, NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA. On the cross-subject and cross-set evaluations of NTU RGB+D 120, the accuracies of our model reach 90.0\% and 91.1\%, with 1.1M parameters and 1.38 GFLOPS for one stream.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise reconstruction of 3D objects from a single RGB image in complex scenes presents a critical challenge in virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. Existing neural implicit 3D representation methods face significant difficulties in balancing the extraction of global and local features, particularly in diverse and complex environments, leading to insufficient reconstruction precision and quality. We propose M3D, a novel single-view 3D reconstruction framework, to tackle these challenges. This framework adopts a dual-stream feature extraction strategy based on Selective State Spaces to effectively balance the extraction of global and local features, thereby improving scene comprehension and representation precision. Additionally, a parallel branch extracts depth information, effectively integrating visual and geometric features to enhance reconstruction quality and preserve intricate details. Experimental results indicate that the fusion of multi-scale features with depth information via the dual-branch feature extraction significantly boosts geometric consistency and fidelity, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction performance.</description>

      <title>Rotation Equivariant Proximal Operator for Deep Unfolding Methods in Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deep unfolding approach has attracted significant attention in computer vision tasks, which well connects conventional image processing modeling manners with more recent deep learning techniques. Specifically, by establishing a direct correspondence between algorithm operators at each implementation step and network modules within each layer, one can rationally construct an almost ``white box'' network architecture with high interpretability. In this architecture, only the predefined component of the proximal operator, known as a proximal network, needs manual configuration, enabling the network to automatically extract intrinsic image priors in a data-driven manner. In current deep unfolding methods, such a proximal network is generally designed as a CNN architecture, whose necessity has been proven by a recent theory. That is, CNN structure substantially delivers the translational invariant image prior, which is the most universally possessed structural prior across various types of images. However, standard CNN-based proximal networks have essential limitations in capturing the rotation symmetry prior, another universal structural prior underlying general images. This leaves a large room for further performance improvement in deep unfolding approaches. To address this issue, this study makes efforts to suggest a high-accuracy rotation equivariant proximal network that effectively embeds rotation symmetry priors into the deep unfolding framework. Especially, we deduce, for the first time, the theoretical equivariant error for such a designed proximal network with arbitrary layers under arbitrary rotation degrees. This analysis should be the most refined theoretical conclusion for such error evaluation to date and is also indispensable for supporting the rationale behind such networks with intrinsic interpretability requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, numerous approaches have achieved notable success in compressed video quality enhancement (VQE). However, these methods usually ignore the utilization of valuable coding priors inherently embedded in compressed videos, such as motion vectors and residual frames, which carry abundant temporal and spatial information. To remedy this problem, we propose the Coding Priors-Guided Aggregation (CPGA) network to utilize temporal and spatial information from coding priors. The CPGA mainly consists of an inter-frame temporal aggregation (ITA) module and a multi-scale non-local aggregation (MNA) module. Specifically, the ITA module aggregates temporal information from consecutive frames and coding priors, while the MNA module globally captures spatial information guided by residual frames. In addition, to facilitate research in VQE task, we newly construct the Video Coding Priors (VCP) dataset, comprising 300 videos with various coding priors extracted from corresponding bitstreams. It remedies the shortage of previous datasets on the lack of coding information. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/VQE-CPGA/CPGA.git .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PDE-based Group Convolutional Neural Networks (PDE-G-CNNs) use solvers of evolution PDEs as substitutes for the conventional components in G-CNNs. PDE-G-CNNs can offer several benefits simultaneously: fewer parameters, inherent equivariance, better accuracy, and data efficiency.
  In this article we focus on Euclidean equivariant PDE-G-CNNs where the feature maps are two-dimensional throughout. We call this variant of the framework a PDE-CNN.
  From a machine learning perspective, we list several practically desirable axioms and derive from these which PDEs should be used in a PDE-CNN, this being our main contribution. Our approach to geometric learning via PDEs is inspired by the axioms of scale-space theory, which we generalize by introducing semifield-valued signals.
  Our theory reveals new PDEs that can be used in PDE-CNNs and we experimentally examine what impact these have on the accuracy of PDE-CNNs. We also confirm for small networks that PDE-CNNs offer fewer parameters, increased accuracy, and better data efficiency when compared to CNNs.</description>

Abstract: Palm oil production has been identified as one of the major drivers of deforestation for tropical countries. To meet supply chain objectives, commodity producers and other stakeholders need timely information of land cover dynamics in their supply shed. However, such data are difficult to obtain from suppliers who may lack digital geographic representations of their supply sheds and production locations. Here we present a "community model," a machine learning model trained on pooled data sourced from many different stakeholders, to produce a map of palm probability at global scale. An advantage of this method is the inclusion of varied inputs, the ability to easily update the model as new training data becomes available and run the model on any year that input imagery is available. Inclusion of diverse data sources into one probability map can help establish a shared understanding across stakeholders on the presence and absence of a land cover or commodity (in this case oil palm). The model predictors are annual composites built from publicly available satellite imagery provided by Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS-2, and terrain data from Jaxa (AW3D30) and Copernicus (GLO-30). We provide map outputs as the probability of palm in a given pixel, to reflect the uncertainty of the underlying state (palm or not palm). This version of this model provides global accuracy estimated to be 92% (at 0.5 probability threshold) on an independent test set. This model, and resulting oil palm probability map products are useful for accurately identifying the geographic footprint of palm cultivation. Used in conjunction with timely deforestation information, this palm model is useful for understanding the risk of continued oil palm plantation expansion in sensitive forest areas.</description>

      <title>Whisper-Flamingo: Integrating Visual Features into Whisper for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition and Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) uses lip-based video to improve performance in noise. Since videos are harder to obtain than audio, the video training data of AVSR models is usually limited to a few thousand hours. In contrast, speech models such as Whisper are trained with hundreds of thousands of hours of data, and thus learn a better speech-to-text decoder. The huge training data difference motivates us to adapt Whisper to handle video inputs. Inspired by Flamingo which injects visual features into language models, we propose Whisper-Flamingo which integrates visual features into the Whisper speech recognition and translation model with gated cross attention. Our models achieve state-of-the-art ASR WER (0.68%) and AVSR WER (0.76%) on LRS3, and state-of-the-art ASR WER (1.3%) and AVSR WER (1.4%) on LRS2. Audio-visual Whisper-Flamingo outperforms audio-only Whisper on English speech recognition and En-X translation for 6 languages in noisy conditions. Moreover, Whisper-Flamingo is versatile and conducts all of these tasks using one set of parameters, while prior methods are trained separately on each language.</description>

      <title>Next Best Sense: Guiding Vision and Touch with FisherRF for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for active next best view and touch selection for robotic manipulators using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). 3DGS is emerging as a useful explicit 3D scene representation for robotics, as it has the ability to represent scenes in a both photorealistic and geometrically accurate manner. However, in real-world, online robotic scenes where the number of views is limited given efficiency requirements, random view selection for 3DGS becomes impractical as views are often overlapping and redundant. We address this issue by proposing an end-to-end online training and active view selection pipeline, which enhances the performance of 3DGS in few-view robotics settings. We first elevate the performance of few-shot 3DGS with a novel semantic depth alignment method using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) that we supplement with Pearson depth and surface normal loss to improve color and depth reconstruction of real-world scenes. We then extend FisherRF, a next-best-view selection method for 3DGS, to select views and touch poses based on depth uncertainty. We perform online view selection on a real robot system during live 3DGS training. We motivate our improvements to few-shot GS scenes, and extend depth-based FisherRF to them, where we demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements on challenging robot scenes.

      <title>ONCOPILOT: A Promptable CT Foundation Model For Solid Tumor Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07908</link>

Abstract: Carcinogenesis is a proteiform phenomenon, with tumors emerging in various locations and displaying complex, diverse shapes. At the crucial intersection of research and clinical practice, it demands precise and flexible assessment. However, current biomarkers, such as RECIST 1.1's long and short axis measurements, fall short of capturing this complexity, offering an approximate estimate of tumor burden and a simplistic representation of a more intricate process. Additionally, existing supervised AI models face challenges in addressing the variability in tumor presentations, limiting their clinical utility. These limitations arise from the scarcity of annotations and the models' focus on narrowly defined tasks.
  To address these challenges, we developed ONCOPILOT, an interactive radiological foundation model trained on approximately 7,500 CT scans covering the whole body, from both normal anatomy and a wide range of oncological cases. ONCOPILOT performs 3D tumor segmentation using visual prompts like point-click and bounding boxes, outperforming state-of-the-art models (e.g., nnUnet) and achieving radiologist-level accuracy in RECIST 1.1 measurements. The key advantage of this foundation model is its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance while keeping the radiologist in the loop, a capability that previous models could not achieve. When radiologists interactively refine the segmentations, accuracy improves further. ONCOPILOT also accelerates measurement processes and reduces inter-reader variability, facilitating volumetric analysis and unlocking new biomarkers for deeper insights.
  This AI assistant is expected to enhance the precision of RECIST 1.1 measurements, unlock the potential of volumetric biomarkers, and improve patient stratification and clinical care, while seamlessly integrating into the radiological workflow.</description>

      <title>DINO-LG: A Task-Specific DINO Model for Coronary Calcium Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the most common cause of mortality in the world. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring using computed tomography (CT) is key for risk assessment to prevent coronary disease. Previous studies on risk assessment and calcification detection in CT scans primarily use approaches based on UNET architecture, frequently implemented on pre-built models. However, these models are limited by the availability of annotated CT scans containing CAC and suffering from imbalanced dataset, decreasing performance of CAC segmentation and scoring. In this study, we extend this approach by incorporating the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of DINO (self-distillation with no labels) to eliminate limitations of scarce annotated data in CT scans. The DINO model's ability to train without requiring CAC area annotations enhances its robustness in generating distinct features. The DINO model is trained on to focus specifically on calcified areas by using labels, aiming to generate features that effectively capture and highlight key characteristics. The label-guided DINO (DINO-LG) enhances classification by distinguishing CT slices that contain calcification from those that do not, performing 57% better than the standard DINO model in this task. CAC scoring and segmentation tasks are performed by a basic U-NET architecture, fed specifically with CT slices containing calcified areas as identified by the DINO-LG model. This targeted identification performed by DINO-LG model improves CAC segmentation performance by approximately 10% and significant increase in CAC scoring accuracy.</description>
