      <title>Type-I two-Higgs-doublet model and gravitational waves from domain walls bounded by strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry via an intermediate discrete symmetry may yield a hybrid topological defect of "domain walls bounded by cosmic strings". The decay of this defect network leads to a unique gravitational wave signal spanning many orders in observable frequencies, that can be distinguished from signals generated by other sources. We investigate the production of gravitational waves from this mechanism in the context of the type-I two-Higgs-doublet model extended by a $U(1)_R$ symmetry, that simultaneously accommodates the seesaw mechanism, anomaly cancellation, and eliminates flavour-changing neutral currents. The gravitational wave spectrum produced by the string-bounded-wall network can be detected for $U(1)_R$ breaking scale from $10^{12}$ to $10^{15}$ GeV in forthcoming interferometers including LISA and Einstein Telescope, with a distinctive $f^{3}$ slope and inflexion in the frequency range between microhertz and hertz.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of post-fragmentation reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After cosmic inflation, coherent oscillations of the inflaton field about a monomial potential $V(\phi)\sim \phi^k$ result in an expansion phase characterized by a stiff equation-of-state $w\simeq(k-2)/(k+2)$. Sourced by the oscillating inflaton condensate, parametric (self)resonant effects can induce the exponential growth of inhomogeneities eventually backreacting and leading to the fragmentation of the condensate. In this work, we investigate realizations of inflation giving rise to such dynamics, assuming an inflaton weakly coupled to its decay products. As a result, the transition to a radiation-dominated universe, i.e. reheating, occurs after fragmentation. We estimate the consequences on the production of gravitational waves by computing the contribution induced by the stiff equation-of-state era in addition to the signal generated by the fragmentation process for $k=4,6,8,10$. Our results are independent of the reheating temperature provided that reheating is achieved posterior to fragmentation. Our work shows that the dynamics of such weakly-coupled inflaton scenario can actually result in characteristic gravitational wave spectra with frequencies from Hz to GHz, in the reach of future gravitational wave observatories, in addition to the complementarity between upcoming detectors in discriminating (post)inflation scenarios. We advocate the need of developing high-frequency gravitational wave detectors to gain insight into the dynamics of inflation and reheating.</description>

      <title>Dirac leptogenesis from asymmetry wash-in via scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptogenesis typically requires the introduction of heavy particles whose out-of-equilibrium decays are essential for generating a matter-antimatter asymmetry, according to one of Sakharov's conditions. We demonstrate that in Dirac leptogenesis, scatterings between the light degrees of freedom - Standard Model particles plus Dirac neutrinos - are sufficient to generate the asymmetry. Due to its vanishing source term in the Boltzmann equations, the asymmetry of right-handed neutrinos solely arises through wash-in processes. Sakharov's conditions are satisfied because the right-handed neutrino partners are out of equilibrium. Consequently, heavy degrees of freedom never needed to be produced in the early universe, allowing for a reheating temperature well below their mass scale. Considering a minimal leptoquark model, we discuss the viable parameter space along with the observational signature of an increased number of effective neutrinos in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Seesaw Limit of the Nelson-Barr Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the solution to the strong CP problem and the explanation for the observed fermion mass hierarchies can be intrinsically related. Specifically, we explore the Nelson-Barr mechanism and identify its "seesaw limit", where light quark masses are suppressed by large CP-violating terms. Upon adding three (two) vector-like quarks that mix with the down-type (up-type) quark sector of the Standard Model, we demonstrate how the lack of CP violation in the strong sector and the observed quark mass hierarchy can be simultaneously achieved.</description>

      <title>The Theoretical Study of $p\bar{p}\to\bar{\Lambda}\Sigma\eta$ Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of hyperon resonances in the $p\bar{p}\to\bar{\Lambda}\Sigma\eta$ reaction within an effective Lagrangian approach. The model includes the production of $\Sigma(1750)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ in the intermediate state excited by the $K$ and $K^*$ meson exchanges between the initial proton and antiproton. Due to the large coupling of $\Sigma(1750)\Sigma\eta$ vertex, $\Sigma(1750)$ is found a significant contribution near the threshold in this reaction. We provide total and differential cross section predictions for the reation and discuss the possible influence of $\Sigma(1750)\Sigma\eta$ vertex coupling and model parameters, which will be useful in future experimental studies. This reaction can provide a platform for studying the features of $\Sigma(1750)$ resonance, especially the coupling to $\Sigma\eta$ channel.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing charged lepton flavor violation scenarios with inelastic $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mu2e and COMET experiments are expected to improve existing limits on charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) by roughly four orders of magnitude. $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion experiments are typically optimized for electrons produced without nuclear excitation, as this maximizes the electron energy and minimizes backgrounds from the free decay of the muon. Here we argue that Mu2e and COMET will be able to extract additional constraints on CLFV from inelastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion, given the $^{27}$Al target they have chosen and backgrounds they anticipate. We describe CLFV scenarios in which inelastic CLFV can induce measurable distortions in the near-endpoint spectrum of conversion electrons, including cases where certain contributing operators cannot be probed in elastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion. We extend the nonrelativistic EFT treatment of elastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion to include the new nuclear operators needed for the inelastic process, evaluate the associated nuclear response functions, and describe several new-physics scenarios where the inelastic process can provide additional information on CLFV.</description>

      <title>Most general neutron decay correlations: Standard Model recoil and radiative corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To continue from our previous work \textit{Phys.Rev.D\textbf{109}(2024),073007}, we derive the full Standard Model prediction of the most general free neutron differential decay rate with all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) polarized, including the $\mathcal{O}(1/m_N)$ recoil corrections and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha/\pi)$ radiative corrections. For the latter we adopt the newly-developed pseudo-neutrino formalism which is compatible to realistic experimental setups, in which neutrinos and photons are not detected. We also provide readily-executable \textit{Mathematica} notebooks to evaluate these corrections.</description>

      <title>Canonical interpretation of the newly observed $J^P =1^+$ structure $X(2085)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the newly observed $X(2085)$ by the BESIII Collaboration, we study the strong decay behaviors of excited axialvector strange mesons within the quark pair creation model. Our results indicate that the $K_1(1793)/K_1(1861)$ can be regarded as the same $K_1(2P)$ state, and the $K_1(1911)$ is assigned as the $K_1(2P^\prime)$ state. Considering the mass, spin-parity, and decay behaviors, we interpret the newly observed $X(2085)$ as the radially excited $K_1(3P)$ state, which mainly decays into the $\rho(1450) K$, $\omega(1420)K$, $\pi K^*(1410)$, $\rho K_1(1270)$, and $\rho K^*(892)$ final states. Also, the width of $K_1(3P^\prime)$ state is predicted to be about 300 MeV, which can be searched for by future experiments. We expect that present calculations can help us to better understand the nature of the $X(2085)$ structure.</description>

      <title>Inflation via Moduli Potentials in a Nested Warped Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effective four-dimensional dynamics of the extra-dimensional moduli fields in curved braneworlds having nested warping, with particular emphasis on the doubly warped model which is interesting in the light of current collider constraints on the mass of the Kaluza-Klein graviton. The presence of a non-zero brane cosmological constant ($\Omega$) naturally induces an effective moduli potential in the four-dimensional action, which shows distinct features in dS ($\Omega&gt;0$) and AdS ($\Omega&lt;0$) branches. For the observationally interesting case of dS 4-branes, a metastable minimum in the potential arises along the first modulus, with no minima along the higher moduli. The underlying nested geometry also leads to interesting separable forms of the non-canonical kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, where the brane curvature directly impacts the kinetic properties of only the first modulus. We subsequently explore the ability of curved multiply warped geometries to drive inflation with an in-built exit mechanism, by assuming predominant slow roll along each modular direction on a case-by-case basis. We find slow roll on top of the metastable plateau along the first modular direction to be the most viable scenario, with the higher-dimensional moduli parametrically tuning the height of the potential without significant impact on the inflationary observables. On the other hand, while slow roll along the higher moduli can successfully inflate the background and eventually lead to an exit, consistency with observations seemingly requires unphysical hierarchies among the extra-dimensional radii, thus disfavouring such scenarios.</description>

      <title>New bounds on heavy axions with an X-ray free electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new exclusion bounds obtained at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser facility (EuXFEL) on axion-like particles (ALPs) in the mass range $10^{-3}\;\rm{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{4}\;\rm{eV}$, which is relatively unconstrained by laboratory searches. Our experiment exploits the Primakoff effect via which photons can, in the presence of a strong external electric field, decay into axions, which then convert back into photons after passing through an opaque wall. While similar searches have been performed previously at a 3$^{\rm rd}$ generation synchrotron \cite{Yamaji:2018ufo} our work demonstrates improved sensitivity, exploiting the higher brightness of X-rays at EuXFEL.</description>

      <title>Testing the Origins of Neutrino Mass with Supernova Neutrino Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of neutrino masses remains unknown. Both the vacuum mass and the dark mass generated by the neutrino interactions with DM particles or fields can fit the current oscillation data. The dark mass squared is proportional to the DM number density and therefore varies on the galactic scale with much larger values around the Galactic Center. This affects the group velocity and the arrival time delay of core-collapse supernovae neutrinos. This time delay, especially for the $\nu_e$ neutronization peak with a sharp time structure, can be used to distinguish the vacuum and dark neutrino masses. For illustration, we explore the potential of DUNE which is sensitive to $\nu_e$. Our simulations show that DUNE can distinguish the two neutrino mass origins at more than $5\sigma\,$C.L., depending on the observed local value of neutrino mass, the neutrino mass ordering, the DM density profile, and the SN location.</description>

      <title>Indirect detection of dark matter absorption in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nuclear absorption of dark matter as an alternative to the typical indirect detection search channels of dark matter decay or annihilation. In this scenario, an atomic nucleus transitions to an excited state by absorbing a pseudoscalar dark matter particle and promptly emits a photon as it transitions back to its ground state. The nuclear excitation of carbon and oxygen in the Galactic Center would produce a discrete photon spectrum in the $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV range that could be detected by gamma-ray telescopes. Using the \texttt{BIGSTICK} large-scale shell-model code, we calculate the excitation energies of carbon and oxygen. We constrain the dark matter-nucleus coupling for current COMPTEL data, and provide projections for future experiments AMEGO-X, e-ASTROGAM, and GRAMS for dark matter masses from $\sim$ 10 to 30 MeV. We find the excitation process to be very sensitive to the dark matter mass and find that the future experiments considered would improve constraints on the dark matter-nucleus coupling within an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Disentangling left and right-handed neutrino effects in $B\rightarrow K^{(*)}\nu\nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first observation of $\mathcal{B}\left(B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu\nu\right)$ by the Belle II experiment lies almost $3\sigma$ away from the Standard Model expectation. In this letter we study this result in the SMEFT, extended by a light right-handed neutrino. We explore the correlations between the measured decay rate and other observables, such as $\mathcal{B}\left(B\rightarrow K^*\nu\nu\right)$ and $F_L\left(B\rightarrow K^*\nu\nu\right)$, showing that they could disentangle among scenarios involving left-handed neutrinos and those with the right-handed ones. Furthermore, we find that the high-$p_T$ tails of Drell-Yan processes studied at LHC provide important constraints that help us exclude some of the scenarios consistent with the Belle II result.</description>

      <title>Quasi particle model vs lattice QCD thermodynamics: extension to $N_f=2+1+1$ flavors and momentum dependent quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade a Quasi-Particle Model ($QPM$) has supplied the basis for the study of HQ production in ultra-relativistic AA collisions, allowing for a phenomenological estimate of the HQ diffusion coefficient $D_s(T)$. Taking advantage of the new lattice QCD results for the Equation of State (EoS) with 2+1+1 dynamical flavors, we extend our $QPM$ approach from $N_f=2+1$ to $N_f=2+1+1$, in which the charm quark is included. Given an effective coupling $g(T)$ fixed by a fit to the lQCD energy density $\epsilon(T)$, we evaluate the impact of different temperature parametrizations of charm quark mass on EoS and susceptibilities $\chi_q(T)$ of light, $\chi_s(T)$ of strange and $\chi_c(T)$ of charm quarks, the last favouring a charm quark mass increasing toward $T_c$. We also explore the extension of the $QPM$ approach to a more realistic approach, that we label $QPM_p$, in which quark and gluon masses explicitly depend on their momentum converging to the current quark mass at high momenta, as expected from asymptotic free dynamics. The $QPM_p$ is seen to allow for a simultaneous quantitative description not only of the EoS but also of the quark susceptibilities ($\chi_q(T)$, $\chi_s(T)$), which instead are underestimated in the simple $QPM$ model. Furthermore, evaluating the spatial diffusion coefficient $2\pi T D_s(T)$ in the $QPM_p$, we find it is also significantly closer than $QPM$ to the recent lQCD data performed including dynamical fermions. Finally, in a 1+1D expanding system, we evaluate the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ in the $QPM$ and $QPM_p$, finding a significant reduction at low momenta for $QPM_p$ which could lead in a realistic scenario to a better agreement to experimental data.</description>

      <title>Nuclear suppression of coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction in heavy-ion UPCs and leading twist nuclear shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the nuclear suppression factor $S_{Pb}(x)$, where $x=M_{J/\psi}^2/W_{\gamma p}^2$ with $M_{J/\psi}$ the $J/\psi$ mass and $W_{\gamma p}$ the photon-nucleon energy, for the cross section of coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction in heavy-ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) by performing the $\chi^2$ fit to all available data on the cross section $d\sigma^{AA \to J/\psi AA}/dy$ as a function of the $J/\psi$ rapidity $y$ and the photoproduction cross section $\sigma^{\gamma A \to J/\psi A}(W_{\gamma p})$ as a function of $W_{\gamma p}$. We find that while the $d\sigma^{AA \to J/\psi AA}/dy$ data alone constrain $S_{Pb}(x)$ for $x \geq 10^{-3}$, the combined $d\sigma^{AA \to J/\psi AA}/dy$ and $\sigma^{\gamma A \to J/\psi A}(W_{\gamma p})$ data allow us to determine $S_{Pb}(x)$ in the wide interval $10^{-5} &lt; x &lt; 0.05$. In particular, the data favor $S_{Pb}(x)$, which decreases with a decrease of $x$ in the $10^{-4} &lt; x &lt; 0.01$ interval, and can be both decreasing or constant for $x&lt; 10^{-4}$. Identifying $S_{Pb}(x)$ with the ratio of the gluon distributions in Pb and the proton $R_g(x,Q_0^2)=g_A(x,Q_0^2)/[A g_p(x,Q_0^2)]$, we demonstrate that the leading twist approximation (LTA) for nuclear shadowing provides a good description of all the data on $d\sigma^{AA \to J/\psi AA}/dy$ and $\sigma^{\gamma A \to J/\psi A}(W_{\gamma p})$ as well as on the experimental values for $S_{Pb}(x)$ derived from $\sigma^{\gamma A \to J/\psi A}(W_{\gamma p})$. We also show that modern nuclear PDFs reasonably reproduce $S_{Pb}(x)$ as well.</description>

      <title>QCD analysis of $xF_3$ structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering: Mellin transform by Gegenbauer polynomial up to N$^3$LO approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a thorough examination of the $xF_3$ structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering through a comprehensive QCD analysis. Our approach harnesses sophisticated mathematical techniques, namely the Mellin transform combined with Gegenbauer polynomials. We have employed the Jacobi polynomials approach for analysis, conducting investigations at three levels of precision: Next-to-Leading Order (NLO), Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (N$^2$LO), and Next-Next-Next-to-Leading Order (N$^3$LO). We have performed a comparison of our sets of valence-quark parton distribution functions with those of recent research groups, specifically CT18 and MSHT20 at NLO and N$^2$LO, and MSTH23 at N$^3$LO, which are concurrent with our current analysis. The combination of Mellin transforms with Gegenbauer polynomials proves to be a powerful tool for investigating the $xF_3$ structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering and the results obtained from our analysis demonstrate a favorable alignment with experimental data.</description>

      <title>"Unification" of BSM Searches and SM Measurements: the case of lepton$+MET$ and $m_W$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the idea that the unprecedented precision in Standard Model (SM) measurements, with further improvement at the HL-LHC, enables new searches for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).As an illustration, we demonstrate that the measured kinematic distributions of the lepton$+MET$ final state not only determine the mass of the $W$ boson, but are also sensitive to light new physics. Such a search for new physics thus requires a simultaneous fit to the BSM and SM parameters, "unifying" searches and measurements at the LHC and Tevatron. In this paper, we complete the program initiated in our earlier work arXiv:2310.13687. In particular, we analyze ($i$) novel decay modes of the $W$ boson with a neutrinophilic invisible scalar or with a heavy neutrino; ($ii$) modified production of $W$ bosons, namely, associated with a hadrophilic invisible $Z^\prime$ gauge boson; and ($iii$) scenarios without an on-shell $W$ boson, such as slepton-sneutrino production in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Here, we complement our previous MSSM analysis in arXiv:2310.13687 by considering a different kinematic region. Our results highlight that new physics can still be directly discovered at the LHC, including light new physics,via SM precision measurements. Furthermore, we illustrate that such BSM signals are subtle, yet potentially large enough to affect the precision measurements of SM parameters themselves, such as the $W$ boson mass.</description>

      <title>The Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our quest to understand the generation of cosmological perturbations, we face two serious obstacles: we do not have direct information about the environment experienced by primordial perturbations during inflation, and our observables are practically limited to correlators of massless fields, heavier fields and derivatives decaying exponentially in the number of e-foldings. The flexible and general framework of open systems has been developed precisely to face similar challenges. Building on previous work, we develop a Schwinger-Keldysh path integral description for an open effective field theory of inflation, describing the possibly dissipative and non-unitary evolution of the Goldstone boson of time translations interacting with an unspecified environment, under the key assumption of locality in space and time. Working in the decoupling limit, we study the linear and interacting theory in de Sitter and derive predictions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that depend on a finite number of effective couplings organised in a derivative expansion. The smoking gun of interactions with the environment is an enhanced but finite bispectrum close to the folded kinematical limit. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by matching our open effective theory to an explicit model. Our construction provides a standard model to simultaneously study phenomenological predictions as well as quantum information aspects of the inflationary dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Possibilities for formation of the charged pion field vortices in a rotating empty vessel (in vacuum) and in the rotating pion gas with a dynamically fixed particle number at zero temperature are studied within the $\lambda|\phi|^4$ model. It is shown that in the former case at a rapid rotation a supervortex of a charged pion field can be formed. Important role played by the electric field is demonstrated. Field configurations in presence and absence of the pion self-interaction are found. Conditions for formation of the vortex lattice at the rotation of the charged pion gas at zero temperature are studied. Observational effects are discussed.</description>

      <title>Searches for Supersymmetry (SUSY) at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of supersymmetry (SUSY) and the ongoing efforts to detect SUSY particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). SUSY proposes corresponding "sparticles" for each Standard Model particle, with the potential to resolve the hierarchy problem, identify dark matter, and unify forces at high energy scales. We explore the key observables central to SUSY searches at the LHC, such as effective mass ($M_{\text{eff}}$), scalar sum of transverse momenta ($H_T$), and stransverse mass ($M_{T2}$)--each of which is instrumental in distinguishing SUSY particles by their mass scales and decay characteristics. The paper also discusses the challenges of differentiating SUSY signals from Standard Model backgrounds, particularly in scenarios without significant missing transverse momentum ($E_T^{\text{miss}}$).
  A critical aspect of these searches is achieving high signal purity while effectively managing background detection. The LHC employs sophisticated detection techniques to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio--crucial for isolating genuine SUSY events from prevalent Standard Model processes such as multijet productions, gauge bosons with jets, and top quark pairs. Through this examination, the paper aims to illuminate the challenges and potential breakthroughs in SUSY searches, assessing their broader implications for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Cosmology-independent Photon Mass Limits from Localized Fast Radio Bursts by using Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hypothetical photon mass, $m_{\gamma}$, can produce a frequency-dependent vacuum dispersion of light, which leads to an additional time delay between photons with different frequencies when they propagate through a fixed distance. The dispersion measure--redshift measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been widely used to constrain the rest mass of the photon. However, all current studies analyzed the effect of the frequency-dependent dispersion for massive photons in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological context. In order to alleviate the circularity problem induced by the presumption of a specific cosmological model based on the fundamental postulate of the masslessness of photons, here we employ a new model-independent smoothing technique, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ function from 34 cosmic-chronometer measurements. By combining observations of 32 well-localized FRBs and the $H(z)$ function reconstructed by ANN, we obtain an upper limit of $m_{\gamma} \le 3.5 \times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma} \le 2.0 \times 10^{-15}\;\rm{eV/c^2}$ ($m_{\gamma} \le 6.5 \times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma} \le 3.6 \times 10^{-15}\;\rm{eV/c^2}$) at the $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) confidence level. This is the first cosmology-independent photon mass limit derived from extragalactic sources.</description>

      <title>Bayesian and Principal Component Analyses of Neutron Star Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Bayesian method is used in this extensive work to generate a large set of minimally constrained equations of state (EOSs) for matters in neutron stars (NS). These EOSs are analyzed for their correlations with key NS properties, such as the tidal deformability, radius, and maximum mass, within the mass range of $1.2-2M_\odot$. The observed connections between the pressure of $\beta$-equilibrated matter and the properties of neutron stars at different densities offer significant insights into the behavior of NS matter in a nearly model-independent manner. The study also examines the influence of various factors on the correlation of symmetry energy parameters, such as slope and curvature parameters at saturation density ($\rho_0=0.16 ~\text{fm}^{-3}$) with the tidal deformability and radius of neutron stars. This study investigates the robustness of the observed correlations by considering the distributions and interdependence of symmetry energy parameters. Furthermore, the utilization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to unveil the complicated relationship between various nuclear matter parameters and properties of neutron stars. This analysis highlights the importance of employing multivariate analysis techniques in order to comprehend the variety in tidal deformability and radius observed across distinct masses of NS. This comprehensive study aims to establish a connection between the parameters of nuclear matter and the properties of neutron stars, providing significant insights into the behavior of NS matter across different circumstances.</description>

      <title>Lens Stochastic Diffraction: A Signature of Compact Structures in Gravitational-Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every signal propagating through the universe is diffracted by the gravitational fields of intervening objects, aka gravitational lenses. Diffraction is most efficient when caused by compact lenses, which invariably produce additional images of a source. The signals associated with additional images are generically faint, but their collective effect may be detectable with coherent sources, such as gravitational waves (GWs), where both amplitude and phase are measured. Here, I describe lens stochastic diffraction (LSD): Poisson-distributed fluctuations after GW events caused by compact lenses. The amplitude and temporal distribution of these signals encode crucial information about the mass and abundance of compact lenses. Through the collective stochastic signal, LSD offers an order-of-magnitude improvement over single lens analysis for objects with mass $\gtrsim 10^3 M_\odot$. This gain can improve limits on compact dark-matter halos and allows next-generation instruments to detect supermassive black holes, given the abundance inferred from quasar luminosity studies.</description>

      <title>Global data-driven determination of baryon transition form factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadronic resonances emerge from strong interactions encoding the dynamics of quarks and gluons. The structure of these resonances can be probed by virtual photons parameterized in transition form factors. In this study, twelve $N^*$ and $\Delta$ transition form factors at the pole are extracted from data with the center-of-mass energy from $\pi N$ threshold to $1.8\,{\rm GeV}$, and the photon virtuality $0\leq Q^2/{\rm GeV}^2\leq 8$. For the first time, these results are determined from a simultaneous analysis of more than one state, i.e., $\sim 10^5$ $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $K\Lambda$ electroproduction data. In addition, about $ 5\cdot 10^4$ data in the hadronic sector as well as photoproduction serve as boundary conditions. For the $\Delta(1232)$ and $N(1440)$ states our results are in qualitative agreement with previous studies, while the transition form factors at the poles of some higher excited states are estimated for the first time. Realistic uncertainties are determined by further exploring the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Decoherence in Neutrino Oscillation at the ESSnuSB Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments provide a unique window in exploring several new physics scenarios beyond the standard three flavour. One such scenario is quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillation which tends to destroy the interference pattern of neutrinos reaching the far detector from the source. In this work, we study the decoherence in neutrino oscillation in the context of the ESSnuSB experiment. We consider the energy-independent decoherence parameter and derive the analytical expressions for P$_{\mu e}$ and P$_{\mu \mu}$ probabilities in vacuum. We have computed the capability of ESSnuSB to put bounds on the decoherence parameters namely, $\Gamma_{21}$ and $\Gamma_{32}$ and found that the constraints on $\Gamma_{21}$ are competitive compared to the DUNE bounds and better than the current T2K and MINOS ones. We have also investigated the impact of decoherence on the ESSnuSB measurement of the Dirac CP phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$ and concluded that it remains robust in the presence of new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the effective field theory (EFT) for nuclear beta decay. The general quark-level EFT describing charged-current interactions between quarks and leptons is matched to the nucleon-level non-relativistic EFT at the O(MeV) momentum scale characteristic for beta transitions. The matching takes into account, for the first time, the effect of all possible beyond-the-Standard-Model interactions at the subleading order in the recoil momentum. We calculate the impact of all the Wilson coefficients of the leading and subleading EFT Lagrangian on the differential decay width in allowed beta transitions. As an example application, we show how the existing experimental data constrain the subleading Wilson coefficients corresponding to pseudoscalar, weak magnetism, and induced tensor interactions. The data display a 3.5 sigma evidence for nucleon weak magnetism, in agreement with the theory prediction based on isospin symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We present the extraction of unpolarized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions functions (TMDPDFs) and Collins-Soper kernel from the fit of Drell-Yan and weak-vector boson production data. The TMDPDF are parameterized, as commonly done, using their (large transverse momentum) asymptotic matching to PDF. The analysis is done at the next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to leading logarithmic accuracy (N$^4$LL) (performed only approximately because PDF evolution is known so far at next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO)). The non-perturbative model used for TMDPDF is flavor dependent to reduce the colllinear PDF bias. The estimation of uncertainties is done with the replica method and, for the first time, it includes the propagation of uncertainties due to the collinear distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictivity of many non-thermal dark matter (DM) models is marred by the gravitational production background. This problem is ameliorated in models with lower reheating temperature $T_R$, which allows for dilution of gravitationally produced relics. We study the freeze-in dark matter production mechanism in the thermal bath with the electroweak scale temperature. The process is Boltzmann-suppressed if the dark matter mass is above $T_R$. In this case, the coupling to the thermal bath has to be significant to account for the observed dark matter relic density. As a result, the direct DM detection experiments already probe such freeze-in models, excluding significant parts of parameter space. The forthcoming experiments will explore this framework further, extending to lower couplings and higher reheating temperatures.</description>

Abstract: A recently published method for solving the neutrino evolution equation with constant matter density is further refined and used to lay out an exact algorithm for computing oscillation probabilities, which is moderately faster than previous methods when looping through neutrinos of different energies. In particular, the three examples of $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ survival, $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_\mu$ survival and $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ appearance probabilities are written in terms of mixing angles, mass differences and matter electron density. A program based on this new method is found to be roughly twice as fast as, and in agreement with, the leading GLoBES package. Furthermore, the behaviour of all relevant effective parameters is sketched out in terms of a range of neutrino energies, or matter electron densities. For instance, the $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ survival probability in constant matter density is found to have no dependence on the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ or the CP-violating phase $\delta_{13}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using unitarity, unlike the approaches available in the literature, we have constructed 9 independent representations of CKM matrix starting with each of the 9 elements of the matrix. The relationship of these independently constructed representations with the already available ones in the literature has been compared and discussed. Further, the implications of these representations have been explored for some of the CKM parameters such as \delta, J and \epsilon_k. Interestingly, we find that the PDG representation which is equivalent to our first representation seems to be most appropriate to describe the hierarchy as well as the related phenomenology of the CKM matrix.</description>

      <title>Charged Higgs decay to $W^{\pm}$ and heavy neutral Higgs decaying into $\tau^+\tau^-$ in Georgi Machacek Model at LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) searched for a charged Higgs boson, in the mass range of 300 to 700 GeV, decaying into a $W^{\pm}$ boson and a heavy neutral Higgs boson of mass $200$ GeV, which successively decays into a pair of tau leptons, in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. In this letter, focusing on the Georgi-Machacek (GM) model, I discuss the parameter space, allowed by the theoretical and experimental constraints, for which the limits on this process obtained by the CMS can be accommodated. The study in this letter also shows that, for the choice of the parameters, the decay of the charged Higgs boson $H_3^{\pm}$ to $W^{\pm}$ and a heavy neutral Higgs boson H is preferred over the decay to any gauge boson and any other neutral or charged Higgs bosons. I also present the values of production cross-section times branching ratio for the decay of H to a pair of b-quarks at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Monojets reveal overlapping excesses for light compressed higgsinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have recently presented results of searches for compressed electroweakinos in final states including soft leptons. These searches are sensitive to mass splittings ranging from quite small values of about 5 GeV to O(10) GeV, which are endemic to scenarios with wino-like and higgsino-like lightest supersymmetric particles (LSPs). While all experimental results exhibit apparently compatible mild excesses, these soft-lepton analyses, taken together with disappearing-track searches targeting much smaller splittings, notably leave unconstrained a sizeable region of parameter space with modest splittings of 1-5 GeV. We point out that this gap can be closed, for scenarios with a higgsino-like LSP, by monojet searches. On the other hand, we find at the same time that current monojet searches show excesses in a region partially overlapping that favoured by the soft-lepton analyses. We provide an up-to-date map of these results and show, among others, a best-fit point with an excess greater than $2\sigma$ that is consistent with a higgsino-like LSP mass around 177 GeV. We finally comment on how such a point can be realised in the MSSM.</description>

      <title>A 95 GeV Higgs Boson in the Georgi-Machacek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CMS and ATLAS have reported small excesses in the search for low-mass Higgs bosons in the di-photon decay channel at exactly the same mass, $95.4~$GeV. These searches rely on improved analysis techniques, enhancing in particular the discrimination against the $Z \to e^+e^-$ background. In models beyond the Standard Model (SM) that extend the Higgs sector with triplets, doubly-charged Higgs bosons are predicted which can contribute substantially to the di-photon decay rate of a light Higgs boson. The Georgi-Machacek (GM) Model is of particular interest in this context, since despite containing Higgs triplets it preserves the electroweak $\rho$-parameter to be$~$1 at the tree level. We show that within the GM model, a Higgs boson with a mass of $\sim 95~$GeV with a di-photon decay rate as observed by CMS and ATLAS can be well described. We discuss the di-photon excess in conjunction with an excess in the $b \bar b$ final state observed at LEP and an excess observed by CMS in the di-tau final state, which have been found at comparable masses with local significances of about $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$, respectively. The presence of a Higgs boson at about $95~$GeV within the GM model would imply good prospects of the searches for additional light Higgs bosons. In particular, the observed excess in the di-photon channel would be expected to be correlated in the GM model with a light doubly-charged Higgs boson in the mass range between $100~$GeV and $200~$GeV, which motivates dedicated searches in upcoming LHC Runs.</description>

      <title>The quark flavor-violating ALPs in light of B mesons and hadron colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion-like particle (ALP) may induce flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) when their Peccei-Quinn charges are not generation universal. The search for flavor-violating ALP couplings with a bottom quark so far focused on FCNC processes of $B$ mesons at low energies. The recent measurements of $B\to K +X$ rare decays place stringent bounds on the quark flavor violations of a light ALP in different decay modes. In this work we propose a novel direct search for bottom flavor-violating interaction of a heavy ALP at the LHC and its upgrades, namely QCD production of an ALP associated with one $b$ jet and one light jet $p~p\to b~j~a$. We consider the decay of the ALP to photons, muons and invisible ALP decays. The Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm is used to analyze the events and we train the BDT classifier by feeding in the kinematic observables of signal and backgrounds. Finally, we show the complementarity between the search prospects of hadron colliders and the low-energy $B$ meson constraints from $B$ meson mixing and $B$ meson decays to a light ALP.</description>

Abstract: We investigate whether inflation in the early universe can be induced by an extra component of a five-dimensional ${\rm U(1)}$ gauge field in the Randall-Sundrum warped spacetime or not. We show that an effective potential obtained by quantum corrections can act as an inflaton potential by finding parameter regions consistent with Planck 2018 results. In our model, fields involved in inflation obey a different type of boundary condition from that of the visible particles, and a surviving Wilson line phase can play a specific role for physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Stau pairs from natural SUSY at high luminosity LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural supersymmetry (SUSY) with light higgsinos is perhaps the most plausible of all weak scale SUSY models while a variety of motivations point to (right) tau sleptons as the lightest of all the sleptons. We examine a SUSY model line with rather light right-staus embedded within natural SUSY. For light stau_1 of a few hundred GeV, then the decays stau_1 -&gt; \tau\tchi_{1,2}^0 and \nu_\tau\tchi_1^- occur at comparable rates where the (higgsino-like) \tchi_1^\pm and \tchi_2^0 release only small visible energy: in this case, the expected \tau^+\tau^- +\eslt signature is diminished from usual expectations due to the presence of the nearly invisible decay mode \ttau_1 -&gt; \nu_\tau\tchi_1^-. However, once m_{\ttau_1}&gt; ~m(bino), then decays to binos such as \ttau_1 -&gt; \tau\tchi_3^0 open up where \tchi_3^0 decays to higgsinos plus W^\pm, Z^0 and h at comparable rates. For these heavier staus, then stau pair production gives rise to diboson+\eslt events which may contain 0, 1 or 2 additional hard \tau leptons. From these considerations, we examine the potential for future discovery of tau-slepton pair production at high-luminosity LHC. While we do not find a 5\sigma HL-LHC discovery reach for 3000 fb^{-1}, we do find a 95\% CL exclusion reach, ranging between m_{\ttau_1}:100-450 GeV for m_{\tchi_1^0}~ 100 GeV. This latter reach disappears for m_{\tchi_1^0}&gt;~ 200 GeV.</description>

      <title>A mechanism relating the fermionic mass hierarchy to the flavor mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering the hierarchical structure of fermionic masses and the fermionic flavor mixing puzzles in the Standard Model, we propose to relate them by the see-saw mechanism, i.e. only the third generation of quarks and charged leptons achieve the masses at the tree level, the first two generations achieves masses through the mixings with the third generation, and the neutrinos achieve tiny Majorana masses by the so-called Type-I see-saw mechanism. This new picture at the fermion sector can explain simultaneously the flavor mixing puzzle and mass hierarchy puzzle in the SM. In addition, a flavor-dependent model (FDM) is proposed to realize the new mechanism, and observing the top quark rare decay processes $t\to ch$, $t\to uh$ and the lepton flavor violation processes $\mu\to3e,\;\tau\to3e,\;\mu\to3\mu$ is effective to test the proposed FDM.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the stability of the Standard Model vacuum with respect to vacuum tunneling to the Komatsu vacuum, which exists when $m_L^2 + m_{H_u}^2&lt;0$, in the cMSSM. Employing the numerical tools SARAH, SPheno and CosmoTransitions, we scan and constrain the parameter space of the cMSSM up to 10 TeV. Regions excluded due to having a vacuum tunneling half-life less than the age of the observable universe are concentrated near the regions where the Standard Model vacuum is tachyonic and are more stringent at smaller $m_0$, larger and negative $A_0$, and larger $\tan\beta$. New excluded regions, which satisfy $m_h \simeq 125 \text{GeV}$, are found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the interpretation of the detected signal by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations as a gravitational wave background (GWB) of cosmological origin. We combine NANOGrav 15-years and EPTA-DR2new data sets and confront them against backgrounds from supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), and cosmological signals from inflation, cosmic (super)strings, first-order phase transitions, Gaussian and non-Gaussian large scalar fluctuations, and audible axions. We find that scalar-induced, and to a lesser extent audible axion and cosmic superstring signals, provide a better fit than SMBHBs. These results depend, however, on modeling assumptions, so further data and analysis are needed to reach robust conclusions. Independently of the signal origin, the data strongly constrain the parameter space of cosmological signals, for example, setting an upper bound on primordial non-Gaussianity at PTA scales as $|f_{nl}| \lesssim 2.34$ at 95% CL.</description>

      <title>Study of non-standard interaction mediated by a scalar field at ESSnuSB experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study non-standard interactions mediated by a scalar field (SNSI) in the context of ESSnuSB experiment. In particular we study the capability of ESSnuSB to put bounds on the SNSI parameters and also study the impact of SNSI in the measurement of the leptonic CP phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$. Existence of SNSI modifies the neutrino mass matrix and this modification can be expressed in terms of three diagonal real parameters ($\eta_{ee}$, $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau\tau}$) and three off-diagonal complex parameters ($\eta_{e \mu}$, $\eta_{e\tau}$ and $\eta_{\mu\tau}$). Our study shows that the upper bounds on the parameters $\eta_{\mu\mu}$, $\eta_{\tau\tau}$ and $\eta_{\mu\tau}$ depend upon how $\Delta m^2_{31}$ is minimized in the theory. However, this is not the case when one tries to measure the impact of SNSI on $\delta_{\rm CP}$. Further, we show that the CP sensitivity of ESSnuSB can be completely lost for certain values of $\eta_{ee}$ and $\eta_{\mu\tau}$ for which the appearance channel probability becomes independent of $\delta_{\rm CP}$.</description>

Abstract: We derive an explicit expression for the Lellouch-L\"uscher (LL) factor in the $K\to 3\pi$ decays at leading order (without derivative couplings). Several important technical details are addressed, like a proper decomposition into the isospin amplitudes, the choice of a minimal set of effective couplings and the renormalization, as well as the algorithm for the solution of the pertinent Faddeev equations in the infinite volume which is based on the contour deformation method. Most importantly, our numerical results demonstrate that the three-body force contributes very little to the LL factor. This result paves the way for the study of the $K\to 3\pi$ decays on the lattice.</description>

      <title>An Effective Theory for Graphene Nanoribbons with Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum electronics. In this scenario, qubits are realised by localised states that can emerge on junctions in hybrid ribbons formed by two armchair nanoribbons of different widths. We derive an effective theory based on a tight-binding ansatz for the description of hybrid nanoribbons and use it to make accurate predictions of the energy gap and nature of the localisation in various hybrid nanoribbon geometries. We use quantum Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that the effective theory remains applicable in the presence of Hubbard interactions. We discover, in addition to the well known localisations on junctions, which we call `Fuji', a new type of `Kilimanjaro' localisation smeared out over a segment of the hybrid ribbon. We show that Fuji localisations in hybrids of width $N$ and $N+2$ armchair nanoribbons occur around symmetric junctions if and only if $N\pmod3=1$, while edge-aligned junctions never support strong localisation. This behaviour cannot be explained relying purely on the topological $Z_2$ invariant, which has been believed the origin of the localisations to date.</description>

Abstract: We study double parton distributions with flavor interference in the nucleon and compare them with previous results for the flavor diagonal case. We investigate both unpolarized and polarized partons. We compare our lattice results with those obtained from the simple description of the proton in terms of an SU(6) symmetric three-quark wave function and find that this description fails for both flavor and polarization dependence. We also derive and test a factorization ansatz for the unpolarized flavor interference distribution in terms of single-parton distributions and find that this ansatz fails to a large extent.</description>

Abstract: We compute the four-gluon vertex from the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order for a collinear configuration. Our results display a good agreement with the first lattice data for this vertex, released very recently (arXiv:2401.12008). A noteworthy novelty of our work is that we can provide analytical expressions for the four-gluon vertex in collinear configurations, together with a renormalization scheme that allows us to perform reliable perturbative computations even in the infrared regime. We observe an infrared suppression in the form factor associated with the tree-level four-gluon tensor with a possible zero-crossing in the deep infrared which demands new lattice investigations to be confirmed. Moreover, we report an infrared divergence in the completely symmetric tensor form factor due to the ghost-loop contributions. These results come as predictions since previous two-point correlations fix all the available parameters of the model, up to an overall constant factor.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Attractor in Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system, employing a hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our results establish the cold atom systems as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.</description>
