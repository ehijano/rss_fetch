      <title>Scaling the glassy dynamics of active particles: Tunable fragility and reentrance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the influence of activity on dense amorphous assemblies is crucial for biological processes such as wound healing, embryogenesis, or cancer progression. Here, we study the effect of self-propulsion forces of amplitude $f_0$ and persistence time $\tau_p$ in dense assemblies of soft repulsive particles, a model system that interpolates between particulate active matter and biological tissues. We identify the fluid and glass phases of the three-dimensional phase diagram obtained by varying $f_0$, $\tau_p$, and the packing fraction $\phi$. The morphology of the phase diagram directly accounts for a non-monotonic evolution of the relaxation time with $\tau_p$, which is a direct consequence of the crossover in the dominant relaxation mechanism, from glassy to jamming. A second major consequence is the evolution of the glassy dynamics from sub-Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius. We show that this tunable glass fragility extends to active systems analogous observations reported for passive particles. This allows us to apply a dynamic scaling analysis proposed for the passive case, in order to account for our results for active systems. Finally, we discuss similarities between our results and recent findings in the context of computational models of biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Binary Mixtures of Intelligent Active Brownian Particles with Visual Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective properties of a binary mixture of A- and B-type self-steering particles endowed with visual perception are studied by computer simulations. Active Brownian particles are employed with an additional steering mechanism, which enables them to adjust their propulsion direction relative to the instantaneous positions of neighboring particles, depending on the species, either steering toward or away from them. Steering can be nonreciprocal between the A- and B-type particles. The underlying dynamical and structural properties of the system are governed by the strength and polarity of the maneuverabilities associated with the vision-induced steering. The model predicts the emergence of a large variety of nonequilibrium behaviors, which we systematically characterize for all nine principal sign combinations of AA, BB, AB and BA maneuverabilites. In particular, we observe the formation of multimers, encapsulated aggregates, honeycomb lattices, and predator-prey pursuit. Notably, for a predator-prey system, the maneuverability and vision angle employed by a predator significantly impacts the spatial distribution of the surrounding prey particles. For systems with electric-charge-like interactions and non-stochiometric composition, we obtain at intermediate activity levels an enhanced diffusion compared to non-steering active Brownian particles.</description>

      <title>Neutral theory of cooperators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutualistic interactions are widespread in nature, from plant communities and microbiomes to human organizations. Along with competition for resources, cooperative interactions shape biodiversity and contribute to the robustness of complex ecosystems. We present a stochastic neutral theory of cooperator species. Our model shares with the classic neutral theory of biodiversity the assumption that all species are equivalent, but crucially differs in requiring cooperation between species for replication. With low migration, our model displays a bimodal species-abundance distribution, with a high-abundance mode associated with a core of cooperating species. This core is responsible for maintaining a diverse pool of long-lived species, which are present even at very small migration rates. We derive analytical expressions of the steady-state species abundance distribution, as well as scaling laws for diversity, number of species, and residence times. With high migration, our model recovers the results of classic neutral theory. We briefly discuss implications of our analysis for research on the microbiome, synthetic biology, and the origin of life.</description>

      <title>Discrete-space and -time analogue of a super-diffusive fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how to construct reliably well "a lattice and an integer time" version of a super-diffusive continuous-space and -time fractional Brownian motion (fBm) -- an experimentally-relevant non-Markovian Gaussian stochastic process with an everlasting power-law memory on the time-evolution of thermal noises extending over the entire past. We propose two algorithms, which are both validated by extensive numerical simulations showing that the ensuing lattice random walks have not only the same power-law covariance function as the standard fBm, but also individual trajectories follow those of the super-diffusive fBm. Finding a lattice and an integer time analogue of a sub-diffusion fBm, which is an anti-persistent process, remains a challenging open problem. Our results also clarify the relevant difference between sub-diffusive and super-diffusive fBm, that are frequently seen as two very analogous realizations of processes with memory. They are indeed substantially different.</description>

      <title>Design principles of transcription factors with intrinsically disordered regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11180v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcription Factors (TFs) are proteins crucial for regulating gene expression. Effective regulation requires the TFs to rapidly bind to their correct target, enabling the cell to respond efficiently to stimuli such as nutrient availability or the presence of toxins. However, the search process is hindered by slow diffusive movement and the presence of `false' targets --DNA segments that are similar to the true target. In eukaryotic cells, most TFs contain an Intrinsically Disordered Region (IDR), which is commonly assumed to behave as a long, flexible polymeric tail composed of hundreds of amino acids. Recent experimental findings indicate that the IDR of certain TFs plays a pivotal role in the search process. However, the principles underlying the IDR's role remain unclear. Here, we reveal key design principles of the IDR related to TF binding affinity and search time. Our results demonstrate that the IDR significantly enhances both of these aspects. Furthermore, our model shows good agreement with experimental results, and we propose further experiments to validate the model's predictions.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter optimal control of F1-ATPase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological molecular machines convert free energy between different forms in cells, often at high efficiency. Optimal control theory provides a framework to elucidate design principles governing energetically efficient driving. Here, we use linear-response theory to design efficient protocols exercising dynamic control of trap center and stiffness in a model of driven F1-ATPase. We find that the key design principles of an efficient protocol can be satisfied either by dynamic control of both parameters or by dynamic control of a single parameter and a good static choice for the second. These results illustrate that accessing a new degree of dynamic control provides varying performance improvements in different systems.</description>

      <title>Learning to crawl: benefits and limits of centralized vs distributed control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model of a crawler consisting of several suction units distributed along a straight line and connected by springs. The suction units are rudimentary proprioceptors-actuators, which sense binary states of compression vs elongation of the springs, and can either adhere or remain idle. Muscular contraction is not controlled by the crawler, but follows an endogenous, stereotyped wave. The crawler is tasked to learn patterns of adhesion that generate thrust in response to the wave of contraction. Using tabular Q-learning we demonstrate that crawling can be learned by trial and error and we ask what are the benefits and limitations of distributed vs centralized learning architectures. We find that by centralizing proprioceptive feedback and control, the crawler leverages long range correlations in the dynamics and ride the endogenous wave smoothly. The ensuing benefits are measured in terms of both speed and robustness to failure, although they come at increased computational cost. At the opposite extreme, purely distributed feedback and control only leverages local information and yield a jerkier and slower crawling, although computationally cheap. Intermediate levels of centralization can negotiate fast and robust crawling while avoiding excessive computational burden, demonstrating the computational benefits of a hierarchical organization of crawling. Our model unveils the trade-offs between crawling speed, robustness to failure, computational cost and information exchange that may shape biological solutions for crawling and could inspire the design of robotic crawlers.</description>
