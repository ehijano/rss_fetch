      <title>Ultraconfined 1-nm water as nature-inspired electrolyte for blue batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial engineering often relies on scarce materials, possessing ecological, social, and political risks. In contrast, nature achieves advanced functionalities using only abundant elements and water. Despite this simple insight, incorporating nature-inspired devices made from readily available resources into industrial applications remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a sustainable 'blue battery'-a water-based energy storage device that mimics natural processes and reduces dependence on scarce materials. This battery harnesses the distinctive electrical properties of water confined within nanometer-scale pores, enabling construction from abundant, non-toxic materials using scalable nanofabrication techniques. It operates without unwanted side reactions, maintains nearly 100% efficiency after 60,000 charge-discharge cycles, and supports a voltage window of up to 1.65 V while achieving competitive power and energy density. The core component, a van der Waals clay nanostructure, uses water as the sole electrolyte with enhanced activity due to interactions with its 2D surface. This water-driven technology offers a sustainable platform for energy systems, with potential applications from small-scale electronics to global energy infrastructure-even in extreme environments like Mars. Our work advances nature-inspired energy solutions, opening new possibilities for the sustainable engineering of blue devices.</description>

      <title>Criticality of the viscous to inertial transition near jamming in non-Brownian suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use a Discrete Element Method (DEM) to explore the viscous to inertial shear thickening transition of dense frictionless non-Brownian suspensions close to jamming. This transition is characterized by a change in the steady state rheology of a suspension with increasing shear rate ($\dot{\gamma}$), from a regime of constant viscosity at low shear rates to a regime where the viscosity varies linearly with the shear rate. Through our numerical simulations, we show that the characteristic shear rate associated with this transition depends sensitively on the volume fraction ($\phi$) of the suspension and that it goes to zero as we approach the jamming volume fraction ($\phi_m$) for the system. By attributing the criticality of this transition to a diverging length scale of the microstructure as $\phi \rightarrow \phi_m$, we use a scaling framework to achieve a collapse of the rheological data associated with the viscous to inertial transition. A series of tests conducted on the system size dependence of the rheological results is used to show the existence of this microstructural length-scale that diverges as the suspension approaches jamming and its role in triggering the viscous to inertial transition.</description>

      <title>Active Screws: Emergent Active Chiral Nematics of Spinning Self-Propelled Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several types of active agents self-propel by spinning around their propulsion axis, thus behaving as active screws. Examples include cytoskeletal filaments in gliding assays, magnetically-driven colloidal helices, and microorganisms like the soil bacterium $\it{M. xanthus}$. Here, we develop a model for spinning self-propelled rods on a substrate, and we coarse-grain it to derive the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. If the rods propel purely along their axis, we obtain equations for a dry active nematic. However, spinning rods can also roll sideways as they move. We find that this transverse motion turns the system into a chiral active nematic. Thus, we identify a mechanism whereby individual chirality can give rise to collective chiral flows. Finally, we analyze experiments on $\it{M. xanthus}$ colonies to show that they exhibit chiral flows around topological defects, with a chiral activity about an order of magnitude weaker than the achiral one. Our work reveals the collective behavior of active screws, which is relevant to colonies of social bacteria and groups of unicellular parasites.</description>

      <title>Convection Speeds Up the Charging of Porous Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the charging of a single electrolyte-filled pore using the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes equations. We find that electroconvection, previously ignored in this context, can substantially speed up the charging dynamics. We derive an analytical model that describes the induced fluid velocity and the electric current arising due to convection. Our findings suggest that convection becomes significant beyond a certain threshold voltage that is an inherent electrolyte property.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian bridge: A physics-driven generative framework for targeted pattern control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patterns arise spontaneously in a range of systems spanning the sciences, and their study typically focuses on mechanisms to understand their evolution in space-time. Increasingly, there has been a transition towards controlling these patterns in various functional settings, with implications for engineering. Here, we combine our knowledge of a general class of dynamical laws for pattern formation in non-equilibrium systems, and the power of stochastic optimal control approaches to present a framework that allows us to control patterns at multiple scales, which we dub the "Hamiltonian bridge". We use a mapping between stochastic many-body Lagrangian physics and deterministic Eulerian pattern forming PDEs to leverage our recent approach utilizing the Feynman-Kac-based adjoint path integral formulation for the control of interacting particles and generalize this to the active control of patterning fields. We demonstrate the applicability of our computational framework via numerical experiments on the control of phase separation with and without a conserved order parameter, self-assembly of fluid droplets, coupled reaction-diffusion equations and finally a phenomenological model for spatio-temporal tissue differentiation. We interpret our numerical experiments in terms of a theoretical understanding of how the underlying physics shapes the geometry of the pattern manifold, altering the transport paths of patterns and the nature of pattern interpolation. We finally conclude by showing how optimal control can be utilized to generate complex patterns via an iterative control protocol over pattern forming pdes which can be casted as gradient flows. All together, our study shows how we can systematically build in physical priors into a generative framework for pattern control in non-equilibrium systems across multiple length and time scales.</description>

      <title>Active nematics in corrugated channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active nematic fluids exhibit complex dynamics in both bulk and in simple confining geometries. However, complex confining geometries could have substantial impact on active spontaneous flows. Using multiparticle collision dynamics simulations adapted for active nematic particles, we study the dynamic behaviour of an active nematic fluid confined in a corrugated channel. The transition from a quiescent state to a spontaneous flow state occurs from a weak swirling flow to a strong coherent flow due to the presence of curved-wall induced active flows. We show that active nematic fluid flows in corrugated channels can be understood in two different ways: (i) as the result of an early or delayed flow transition when compared with that in a flat-walled channel of appropriate width and (ii) boundary-induced active flows in the corrugations providing an effective slip velocity to the coherent flows in the bulk. Thus, our work illustrates the crucial role of corrugations of the confining boundary in dictating the flow transition and flow states of active fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18974v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the granular temperatures in force-free granular gases under exponential resetting. When a resetting event occurs, the granular temperature attains its initial value, whereas it decreases because of the inelastic collisions between the resetting events. We develop a theory and perform computer simulations for granular gas cooling in the presence of Poissonian resetting events. We also investigate the probability density function to quantify the distribution of granular temperatures. Our theory may help understand the behavior of non-periodically driven granular systems.</description>

      <title>Programming evolution of geometry in shape-morphing sheets via spatiotemporal activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shape-programmed sheets morph from one surface into another upon activation by stimuli such as illumination, and have attracted much interest for their potential engineering applications, especially in soft robotics. Complex shape changes can be achieved by patterning a simple local active deformation (e.g. isotropic swelling), to generate differential growth. Usually the material itself is designed $\unicode{x2014}$ for example by patterning a molecular director $\unicode{x2014}$ such that a particular shape change occurs upon exposure to a spatially uniform stimulus. A limitation of this paradigm is that typically only one target geometry can be attained as the stimulus is adjusted. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by patterning the stimulus itself, thereby exercising spatiotemporal control over local deformation magnitudes. Thus a single physical sample can be induced to traverse a continuous family of target geometries, opening the door to precise shape adjustments, new functionalities, and designable non-reciprocal loops in shape space. We illustrate these possibilities with examples including active parabolic reflectors, chiral flow guides, and bending channels. Finding the necessary patterns of activation involves solving families of metric inverse problems; we solve these by reduction to ODEs in an axisymmetric setting, then present a novel numerical scheme to solve them in generality.</description>

      <title>On the build-up of effective hyperuniformity from large globular colloidal aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple three-dimensional model of a fluid whose constituent particles interact via a short range attractive and long range repulsive potential is used to model the aggregation into large spherical-like clusters made up of hundreds of particles. The model can be thought of as a straightforward rendition of colloid flocculation into large spherical aggregates. We illustrate how temperature and particle density influence the cluster size distribution and affect inter- and intra-cluster dynamics. The system is shown to exhibit two well separated length and time scales, which can be tuned by the balance between repulsive and attractive forces. Interestingly, cluster aggregates at moderate/low temperatures approach cluster glassy phases whereas the clusters itself are liquid droplets. These states present a strong suppression of density fluctuations for a significant range of relatively large wavelengths, meeting the criterion of effective disordered hyperuniform materials.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Ionic Complexity: A Modeling Approach for Hierarchical Ionic Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the 1950s, soft ionic devices have evolved from individual components to an expanding library of sensors, actuators, signal transmitters, and processors. However, integrating these components into complex, multi-functional systems remains challenging due to the non-intuitive and non-linear interactions between ionic elements. In this work, we address these fundamental challenges by developing a lumped element model that enables interrogation of the physics that govern ionic circuits, as well as rapid design and optimization. Our model captures features specific to ionic charge carriers, while preserving the hierarchical design flexibility and computational efficiency of traditional circuit modeling. We demonstrate that our model can not only fit individual device behavior but also accurately predict the behavior of larger circuits formed by combining those devices. Additionally, we show how our tool utilizes the intrinsic non-linearities of ionic systems to enable novel functionality, revealing how factors such as ion enrichment, ion leakage, and polymer charge density influence performance. Finally, we present a fully ionic power supply, sensor, control system, and actuator for a soft robot that adapts its motion in response to environmental salt, illustrating the tool's potential to accelerate advancements in chemical sensing, biointerfacing, biomimetic systems, and adaptive materials.</description>

      <title>Flocking in One Dimension: Asters and Reversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional active Ising model in which aligning particles undergo diffusion biased by the signs of their spins. The phase diagram obtained varying the density of particles, their hopping rate and the temperature controlling the alignment shows a homogeneous disordered phase but no homogeneous ordered one, as well as two phases with localized dense structures. In the flocking phase, large ordered aggregates move ballistically and stochastically reverse their direction of motion. In what we termed the "aster" phase, dense immobile aggregates of opposite magnetization face each other, exchanging particles, without any net motion of the aggregates. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field theory, we study the evolution of the shapes of the flocks, the statistics of their reversal times, and their coarsening dynamics. Solving exactly for the zero-temperature dynamics of an aster allows us to understand their coarsening, which shows extremal dynamics, while mean-field equations account for their shape.</description>

      <title>Optimal diffusion of chiral active particles with strategic reorientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the competing effects of simultaneous presence of chirality and generalised tumbles in the dynamics of an active Brownian particle. Chiral active particles perform circular motions that give rise to slow transport at late times. By interrupting these circular trajectories at the right time or by performing a tumble at the correct angle, we show that particles can enhance their diffusion. After deriving exact expressions for the orientational propagator and correlations, we use this to calculate the first two moments of displacement. For the effective diffusion coefficient, we study various optimal tumbling strategies. We show that under optimisation of the tumbling rate, the case of symmetrically distributed tumbles always give rise to enhanced diffusion, with an effective diffusion coefficient taking a universal value. Next, two cases are considered in detail, namely directional reversal and tumbles at an arbitrary but fixed angle. We discuss how asymmetric tumbles can enhance diffusion beyond that of symmetric tumbles. Finally, we discuss a situation where the reorientations are realized dynamically in finite time.</description>
