      <title>On the singularity of Lie-transform perturbation approach to the guiding-center problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel scheme of carrying out the Lie-transform perturbation for the guiding-center motion, with an aim at addressing directly the problem of singularity which exists intrinsically in the determining equation for the generating vector, and which gives rise to the formidable gauge functions in the pure oscillating part of the Lie transformation. Whereas in most applications of Lie-transform perturbation such gauge functions must be approximately solved from some partial differential equations, our scheme, characterized by a staggered determination of the generating vectors, naturally produces the gauge functions through explicit integral over the gyro-angle, leaving no unaccountable error of high order in all the succeeding transformations. Based on such scheme, a formalism of guiding-center transformation has been derived in a unified manner retaining the effects of the strong ExB shearing as well as those of electromagnetic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Inverse Rendering of Fusion Plasmas: Inferring Plasma Composition from Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a differentiable rendering pipeline for visualising plasma emission within tokamaks, and estimating the gradients of the emission and estimating other physical quantities. Unlike prior work, we are able to leverage arbitrary representations of plasma quantities and easily incorporate them into a non-linear optimisation framework. The efficiency of our method enables not only estimation of a physically plausible image of plasma, but also recovery of the neutral Deuterium distribution from imaging and midplane measurements alone. We demonstrate our method with three different levels of complexity showing first that a poloidal neutrals density distribution can be recovered from imaging alone, second that the distributions of neutral Deuterium, electron density and electron temperature can be recovered jointly, and finally, that this can be done in the presence of realistic imaging systems that incorporate sensor cropping and quantisation.</description>

      <title>Universal non-thermal power-law distribution functions from the self-consistent evolution of collisionless electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution functions of collisionless systems are known to show non-thermal power law tails. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail in the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing mystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the self-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We perform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a quasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends on $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like electric field, then $D(v)\sim v^4$ for $\sigma&lt;v&lt;\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$, with $\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\omega_{\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and $k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the quasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\left(d+2\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions ($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$ tail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower than the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v&lt;\sigma$) eventually also heats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.</description>

      <title>Free-Free Gaunt factors for atmospheres of accreting pulsars observable with X-ray space missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-Free Gaunt factors for X-ray absorption by hot plasma in the presence of a strong magnetic field are reported. Modified formulae are used for application to the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions found in accreting pulsar atmospheres. Given upcoming global X-ray polarimetric space missions, these can be used for the construction of an absorption matrix in discrete-ordinate polarised radiative transfer.</description>

      <title>Effects of colliding laser pulses polarization on $ e^{-}e^{+} $ cascade development in extreme focusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The onset and development of electron-positron cascade in a standing wave formed by multiple colliding laser pulses requires tight focusing in order to achieve the maximum laser intensity. There, steep spatio-temporal gradients in the laser intensity expel seed particles from the high-intensity region and thus can prevent the onset of a cascade. We show that radially polarized laser pulses ensure that the seed electrons are present at the focal plane at the moment of the highest amplitude even in the case of extreme focusing. This feature reduces the required laser power for the onset of a cascade 100 times (80 times) compared to circularly (linearly) polarized laser pulses having the same focal spot radius and duration.</description>

      <title>On the importance of slow ions in the kinetic Bohm criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between a plasma and a solid target lies a positively charged sheath of several Debye lengths $\lambda_{\rm D}$ in width, typically much smaller than the characteristic length scale $L$ of the main plasma. This scale separation implies that the asymptotic limit $\epsilon = \lambda_{\rm D} / L \rightarrow 0$ is useful to solve for the plasma-sheath system. In this limit, the Bohm criterion must be satisfied at the sheath entrance. A new derivation of the kinetic criterion, admitting a general ion velocity distribution, is presented. It is proven that for $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ the distribution of the velocity component normal to the target, $v_x$, and its first derivative must vanish for $|v_x| \rightarrow 0$ at the sheath entrance. These two conditions can be subsumed into a third integral one after it is integrated by parts twice. A subsequent interchange of the limits $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ and $|v_x| \rightarrow 0$ is invalid, leading to a divergence which underlies the misconception that the criterion gives undue importance to slow ions.</description>
