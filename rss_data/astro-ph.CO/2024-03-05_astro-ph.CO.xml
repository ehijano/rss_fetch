      <title>Late-Time constraints on Interacting Dark Energy: Analysis independent of $H_0$, $r_d$ and $M_B$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A possible interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy, corresponding to a well-known interacting dark energy model discussed in the literature within the context of resolving the Hubble tension, has been investigated. We put constraints on it in a novel way, by creating new likelihoods with an analytical marginalization over the Hubble parameter $H_0$, the sound horizon $r_d$, and the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$. Our aim is to investigate the impacts on the coupling parameter of the interacting model, $\xi$, and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$. The late-time cosmological probes used in our analysis include the PantheonPlus (calibrated and uncalibrated), Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations samples and the Pantheon for comparison. Through various combinations of these datasets, we demonstrate hints of up to $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <title>A foreground-marginalized 'BK-lite' likelihood for the tensor-to-scalar ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio from the BICEP/Keck Collaboration (with r&lt;0.036 at 95% confidence) puts pressure on early universe models, with less than 10% of the error on r attributed to uncertainty in Galactic foregrounds. We use the BICEP/Keck BK18 public multi-frequency likelihood to test some further assumptions made in the foreground modeling, finding little impact on the estimate for r. We then estimate foreground-marginalized cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization bandpowers. We fit them with a multivariate offset-lognormal distribution and construct a marginalized 'BK-lite' likelihood for the CMB B-mode spectrum with no nuisance parameters, serving as a method demonstration for future analyses of small sky regions, for example from the South Pole Observatory or CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Angular bispectrum and trispectrum of scalar-induced gravitational-waves: all contributions from primordial non-Gaussianity $\fnl$ and $\gnl$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the primordial non-Gaussianity of inflationary perturbations is crucial for testing the inflation paradigm of the early universe. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the presence of local-type primordial non-Gaussianity parameterized by $\fnl$ and $\gnl$, deriving their semi-analytical formulae for the first time. Our findings indicate that it is the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity that leads to a non-Gaussian SIGW background, suggesting that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of SIGWs could serve as probes of the primordial non-Gaussianity. Our numerical results further illustrate that $\fnl$ and $\gnl$ exert significant impacts on the spectral amplitudes, potentially reaching up to $10^{-5}$ for the former and $10^{-8}$ for the latter. In particular, we demonstrate that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum exhibit characteristic dependence on the angular multipoles and frequency bands. They hold potentials to be measured by gravitational-wave detectors that may advance our understanding of the origin of the universe.</description>

      <title>A 'MeerKAT-meets-LOFAR' study of the complex multi-component (mini-)halo in the extreme sloshing cluster Abell 2142</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies are turbulent environments, whether merging systems with a turbulent intracluster medium (ICM) or relaxed systems sloshing within the potential well. In many such clusters, diffuse radio sources associated with the ICM are found: radio haloes and mini-haloes. Abell 2142 is a rich cluster undergoing extreme core sloshing, generating four cold fronts and a complex multi-component radio halo. Recent work revealed three halo components which span 2.4 Mpc. Particle acceleration on such scales is poorly understood, and requires high-quality multi-frequency data to understand. We use new deep MeerKAT L-band (1283 MHz) observations, combined with LOFAR HBA (143 MHz) data and X-ray data from XMM-Newton and Chandra to study the spectrum of the halo and the connection between the thermal and non-thermal components of the ICM. We detect the third halo component for the first time at 1283 MHz and confirm its ultra-steep spectrum nature, recovering $\alpha_{\rm H3, total} = -1.68 \pm 0.10$. All components follow power-law spectra which steepen toward the cluster outskirts. We profile the halo along three directions, finding evidence of asymmetry and spectral steepening perpendicular to the main axis of the cluster. Our thermal/non-thermal investigation shows sub-linear correlations that are steeper at 1283 MHz than 143 MHz, and we find different connections in different components of the halo. We find both a moderate anti-correlation (H1, the core) and positive correlation (H2, the ridge) between radio spectral index and X-ray temperature. Our results are broadly consistent with an interpretation of inhomogeneous turbulent (re-)acceleration. However, the anti-correlation between radio spectral index and X- ray temperature in the cluster core is challenging to explain; the presence of three cold fronts and a generally lower temperature may provide the foundations of an explanation.</description>

      <title>Quijote-PNG: Optimizing the summary statistics to measure Primordial non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a suite of different estimators to the Quijote-PNG halo catalogues to find the best approach to constrain Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) at non-linear cosmological scales, up to $k_{\rm max} = 0.5 \, h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The set of summary statistics considered in our analysis includes the power spectrum, bispectrum, halo mass function, marked power spectrum, and marked modal bispectrum. Marked statistics are used here for the first time in the context of PNG study. We perform a Fisher analysis to estimate their cosmological information content, showing substantial improvements when marked observables are added to the analysis. Starting from these summaries, we train deep neural networks (NN) to perform likelihood-free inference of cosmological and PNG parameters. We assess the performance of different subsets of summary statistics; in the case of $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{equil}$, we find that a combination of the power spectrum and a suitable marked power spectrum outperforms the combination of power spectrum and bispectrum, the baseline statistics usually employed in PNG analysis. A minimal pipeline to analyse the statistics we identified can be implemented either with our ML algorithm or via more traditional estimators, if these are deemed more reliable.</description>

      <title>New probe of non-Gaussianities with primordial black hole induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new probe of primordial non-Gaussianities (NGs) through the observation of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by ultra-light ($M_{\text{PBH}}&lt; 10^{9}\rm{g}$) primordial black holes (PBHs). Interestingly enough, the existence of primordial NG can leave imprints on the clustering properties of PBHs and the spectral shape of induced GW signals. Focusing on a scale-dependent local-type NG, we identify a distinct double-peaked GW energy spectrum that, contingent upon $M_{\text{PBH}}$ and the abundance of PBHs at the time of formation, denoted as $\Omega_\mathrm{PBH,f}$, may fall into the frequency bands of upcoming GW observatories, including LISA, ET, SKA, and BBO. Thus, such a signal can serve as a novel portal for probing primordial NGs. Intriguingly, combining BBN bounds on the GW amplitude, we find for the first time the joint limit on the product of the effective non-linearity parameter for the primordial tri-spectrum, denoted by $\bar{\tau}_\mathrm{NL}$, and the primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\cal R}(k)$, which reads as $\bar{\tau}_\mathrm{NL} \mathcal{P}_{\cal R}(k) &lt; 4\times 10^{-20} \Omega^{-17/9}_\mathrm{PBH,f} \left( \frac{M_{\rm PBH}}{10^4\mathrm{g}} \right)^{-17/9}$.</description>

      <title>Numerical challenges for energy conservation in N-body simulations of collapsing self-interacting dark matter haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) haloes can be subject to gravothermal collapse if DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions. When the scattering can efficiently transfer heat from the centre to the outskirts, the central region of the halo collapses and reaches densities much higher than those for collisionless DM. This phenomenon is potentially observable in studies of strong lensing. Current theoretical efforts are motivated by observations of surprisingly dense substructures. A comparison with them requires accurate predictions. One method to obtain such predictions is to use N-body simulations. The collapsed haloes are extreme systems that pose severe challenges to state-of-the-art codes used to model self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We investigate the root of such problems with a focus on energy non-conservation. We run N-body simulations with and without DM self-interactions of an isolated DM-only halo and change numerical parameters relevant to the accuracy of the simulation. We find that not only the numerical scheme for the DM self-interactions can lead to energy non-conservation but also the modelling of gravitational interaction and the time integration are problematic. The issues we found are: (a) particles changing their time step in a non-time-reversible manner; (b) the asymmetry in the tree-based gravitational force evaluation; (c) SIDM velocity kicks break the symplectic nature and time symmetry. Tuning the parameters of the simulation to achieve a high accuracy allows for conserving energy not only at early stages of the evolution but also at late ones. However, the cost of the simulations becomes prohibitively large. Some problems making the simulations of the gravothermal collapse phase inaccurate, can be overcome by choosing appropriate numerical schemes. However, others remain challenging. Our findings motivate further work on addressing these challenges.</description>

      <title>Investigating Ionization in the Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Intergalactic Medium (IGM) contains $&gt;$50% of the baryonic mass of the Universe, yet the mechanisms responsible for keeping the IGM ionized has not been fully explained. Hence, we investigate ion abundances from the largest blind QSO absorption catalog for clouds that show C IV, N V, and O VI simultaneously. The wavelength range of present UV spectrographs, however, make it possible to probe C IV and O VI over a small range of redshift ($z \approx 0.12 - 0.15$). As a result, we only have five IGM absorbing clouds, yet these provide a powerful and representative tool to probe the IGM ionization state. We found one cloud to be in collisional ionization equilibrium while three of five showed signs of being produced by non-equilibrium processes, specifically conductive interfaces and turbulent mixing layers. None of the models we explore here were able to reproduce the ionization state of the remaining system. Energetic processes, such as galactic feedback from star formation and AGN winds, would be excellent candidates that can cause such widespread ionization.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations and low-energy ionization signatures of relativistic particles in silicon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state detectors with a low energy threshold have several applications, including in direct-detection searches of non-relativistic halo dark-matter particles with sub-GeV masses. Moreover, when searching for relativistic or quasi-relativistic beyond-the-Standard-Model particles (i.e., $v/c\gtrsim 0.01$) that have an enhanced cross section for small energy transfers, a comparatively small detector with a low energy threshold may have better sensitivity than a larger detector with a higher energy threshold. In this paper, we provide accurate calculations of the low-energy ionization spectrum from high-velocity particles scattering in a dielectric material. We focus on silicon, although our results can be easily applied to other materials. We consider the full material response, in particular also the excitation of bulk plasmons. We generalize the energy-loss function to relativistic kinematics, and benchmark existing tools used for halo dark-matter scattering against publicly available electron energy-loss spectroscopy data. Compared to calculations of energy loss that are commonly used in the literature, such as the Photo-Absorption-Ionization model or the free-electron model, the inclusion of collective effects shifts the recoil ionization spectrum towards higher energies, typically peaking around 4--6 electron-hole pairs. We apply our results to the three benchmark examples: millicharged particles produced in a beam, neutrinos with a magnetic dipole moment produced in a reactor, and dark-matter particles that are upscattered by cosmic rays or in the Sun. Our results show that the proper inclusion of collective effects typically enhances a detector's sensitivity to these particles, since detector backgrounds, such as dark counts, peak at lower energies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in a cyclic Universe: resilience through cycles and vacuum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalised calculation for the spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations in a cyclic Universe, making no assumptions about the vacuum state of the theory and accounting for the contribution of tensor modes produced in the dark energy phase of the previous cycle. We show that these modes have minimal impact on the spectrum observed in the current cycle, except for corrections on scales as large as the comoving Hubble radius today. These corrections are due to sub-horizon modes produced towards the end of the dark energy phase, persisting into the ekpyrotic phase of the next cycle as additional quanta. In relation to the vacuum state, we argue that non-Bunch-Davies quanta can easily overwhelm the energy density driving the dark energy phase, potentially compromising the model. Therefore, avoiding backreaction effects sets restrictive constraints on deviations away from the Bunch-Davies vacuum during this phase, limiting the overall freedom to consider alternative vacua in the cyclic Universe.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE-HI: HI galaxy properties in the large scale structure environment at z~0.37 from a stacking experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of HI mass of star-forming galaxies in different large scale structure environments from a blind survey at $z\sim 0.37$. In particular, we carry out a spectral line stacking analysis considering $2875$ spectra of colour-selected star-forming galaxies undetected in HI at $0.23 &lt; z &lt; 0.49$ in the COSMOS field, extracted from the MIGHTEE-HI Early Science datacubes, acquired with the MeerKAT radio telescope. We stack galaxies belonging to different subsamples depending on three different definitions of large scale structure environment: local galaxy overdensity, position inside the host dark matter halo (central, satellite, or isolated), and cosmic web type (field, filament, or knot). We first stack the full star-forming galaxy sample and find a robust HI detection yielding an average galaxy HI mass of $M_{\rm HI}=(8.12\pm 0.75)\times 10^9\, {\rm M}_\odot$ at $\sim 11.8\sigma$. Next, we investigate the different subsamples finding a negligible difference in $M_{\rm HI}$ as a function of the galaxy overdensity. We report an HI excess compared to the full sample in satellite galaxies ($M_{\rm HI}=(11.31\pm1.22)\times 10^9$, at $\sim 10.2 \sigma$) and in filaments ($M_{\rm HI}=(11.62\pm 0.90)\times 10^9$. Conversely, we report non-detections for the central and knot galaxies subsamples, which appear to be HI-deficient. We find the same qualitative results also when stacking in units of HI fraction ($f_{\rm HI}$). We conclude that the HI amount in star-forming galaxies at the studied redshifts correlates with the large scale structure environment.</description>

      <title>Optical modeling of systematic uncertainties in detector polarization angles for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an estimate of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) detector polarization angle systematic uncertainty from optics perturbation analysis using polarization-sensitive ray tracing in CODE V optical design software. Uncertainties in polarization angle calibration in CMB measurements can limit constraints on cosmic birefringence and other cosmological measurements. Our framework estimates the angle calibration systematic uncertainties from possible displacements in lens positions and orientations, and anti-reflection coating (ARC) thicknesses and refractive indices. With millimeter displacements in lens positions and percent-level perturbations in ARC thicknesses and indices from design, we find the total systematic uncertainty for three ACT detector arrays operating between 90--220 GHz to be at the tenth of degree scale. Reduced lens position and orientation uncertainties from physical measurements could lead to a reduction in the systematic uncertainty estimated with the framework presented here. This optical modeling can inform polarization angle systematic uncertainties for current and future microwave polarimeters, such as the CCAT Observatory, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Deep learning insights into cosmological structure formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.10577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of linear initial conditions present in the early universe into extended halos of dark matter at late times can be computed using cosmological simulations. However, a theoretical understanding of this complex process remains elusive; in particular, the role of anisotropic information in the initial conditions in establishing the final mass of dark matter halos remains a long-standing puzzle. Here, we build a deep learning framework to investigate this question. We train a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the mass of dark matter halos from the initial conditions, and quantify in full generality the amounts of information in the isotropic and anisotropic aspects of the initial density field about final halo masses. We find that anisotropies add a small, albeit statistically significant amount of information over that contained within spherical averages of the density field about final halo mass. However, the overall scatter in the final mass predictions does not change qualitatively with this additional information, only decreasing from 0.9 dex to 0.7 dex. Given such a small improvement, our results demonstrate that isotropic aspects of the initial density field essentially saturate the relevant information about final halo mass. Therefore, instead of searching for information directly encoded in initial conditions anisotropies, a more promising route to accurate, fast halo mass predictions is to add approximate dynamical information based e.g. on perturbation theory. More broadly, our results indicate that deep learning frameworks can provide a powerful tool for extracting physical insight into cosmological structure formation.</description>

Abstract: Estimating a reliable covariance matrix for correlation functions of galaxies is a crucial task to obtain accurate cosmological constraints from galaxy surveys. We generate 2,000 independent lightcone mock luminous red galaxy (LRGs) catalogues at $0.3 \leq z \leq 1.25$, designed to cover CAMIRA LRGs observed by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Programme (HSC SSP). We first produce full-sky lightcone halo catalogues using a COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) technique, and then trim them to match the footprints of the HSC SSP S20A Wide layers. The mock LRGs are subsequently populated onto the trimmed halo catalogues according to the halo occupation distribution model constrained by the observed CAMIRA LRGs. The stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) is assigned to each LRG by the subhalo abundance-matching technique using the observed stellar-mass functions of CAMIRA LRGs. We evaluate photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) of mock LRGs by incorporating the photo-$z$ scatter, which is derived from the observed $M_{\star}$--photo-$z$-scatter relations of the CAMIRA LRGs. We validate the constructed full-sky halo and lightcone LRG mock catalogues by comparing their angular clustering statistics (i.e., power spectra and correlation functions) with those measured from the halo catalogues of full $N$-body simulations and the CAMIRA LRG catalogues from the HSC SSP, respectively. We detect clear signatures of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) from our mock LRGs, whose angular scales are well consistent with theoretical predictions. These results demonstrate that our mock LRGs can be used to evaluate covariance matrices at large scales and provide predictions for the BAO detectability and cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>Exploring Modified Gravity: Constraints on the $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ Parametrization with WMAP, ACT, and SPT</title>

Abstract: The cosmic acceleration problem remains one of the most significant challenges in cosmology. One of the proposed solutions to this problem is the modification of gravity on large scales. In this paper, we explore the well-known $\mu$-$\Sigma$ parametrization scenarios and confront them with observational data, including the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), and South Pole Telescope (SPT), as well as large-scale structure data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS: BAO+RSD) and Pantheon Supernovae (SN) catalog. We employ a Bayesian framework to constrain the model parameters and discuss the implications of our results on the viability of modified gravity theories. Our analysis reveals the strengths and limitations of the $\mu$-$\Sigma$ parametrization and provides valuable insights into the nature of gravity on cosmological scales. From the joint analysis of the ACT + WMAP + SDSS + SN, we find $\mu_0 -1 = 0.02 \pm 0.19$ and $\Sigma_0 -1 = 0.021 \pm 0.068$ at 68% CL. In light of the SPT + WMAP + SDSS + SN, we find $\mu_0 -1 = 0.07 \pm 0.18$ and $\Sigma_0 -1 = -0.009^{+0.078}_{-0.11}$ at 68% CL. In all the analyses carried out, we do not find any deviations from the theory of general relativity. Our results represent an observational update on the well-known $\mu$-$\Sigma$ parameterization in view of current CMB data, independent and competitive with the constraints obtained with the Planck data.</description>

      <title>Gauge preheating with full general relativity</title>

Abstract: We study gauge preheating following pseudoscalar-driven inflation in full general relativity. We implement the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) scheme to solve the full nonlinear evolution of the metric alongside the dynamics of the pseudoscalar and gauge fields. The dynamics of the background and emission of gravitational waves are broadly consistent with simulations in a Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. We find large, localized overdensities in the BSSN simulations of order $\delta = \delta\rho/\rho \sim 30$, and the dimensionless power spectrum of $\delta$ peaks above unity. These overdense regions are seeded on length scales only slightly smaller than the horizon, and have a compactness $C \sim 0.1$. The scale of peak compactness is shorter than the Jeans length, which implies that pressure of the matter fields plays an important role in the evolution of these objects.</description>

      <title>Detection of pairwise kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with DESI galaxy groups and Planck in Fourier space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a $\sim5.2\sigma$ detection of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect in Fourier space, by combining the DESI galaxy groups and the Planck data. We use the density-weighted pairwise kSZ power spectrum as the summary statistic, and the detailed procedure of its measurement is presented in this paper. Meanwhile, we analyze the redshift space group density power spectrum to constrain its bias parameters and photo-z uncertainties. These best-fitted parameters are substituted to a nonlinear kSZ model, and we fit the measured kSZ power spectrum with this model to constrain the group optical depth $\bar{\tau}$. Selected by a varying lower mass threshold $M_{\rm th}$, the galaxy group catalogs with different median masses ($\tilde{M}$) are constructed from the DR9 data of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. $\tilde{M}$ spans a wide range of $\sim10^{13}-10^{14}M_\odot/h$ and the heaviest $\tilde{M}\sim10^{14} M_\odot/h$ is larger than those of most other kSZ detections. When the aperture photometric filter radius $\theta_{\rm AP}$ is set to be $4.2$ arcmin, the $\tilde{M}=1.75\times10^{13}M_\odot/h$ group sample at the median redshift $\tilde{z}=0.64$ has the highest kSZ detection ${\rm S/N}=5.2$. By fitting $\bar{\tau}$s from various samples against their $\tilde{M}$s, we obtain a linear $\log\bar{\tau}-\log \tilde{M}$ relation: $\log\bar{\tau} = \gamma(\log \tilde{M}-14)+\log\beta$, in which $\gamma=0.55\pm0.1$. We also vary the aperture photometric filter radius and measure the $\bar{\tau}$ profiles of group samples, whose constraints on the baryon distribution within and around dark matter halos will be discussed in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Is it possible to know cosmological fine-tuning?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning studies whether some physical parameters, or relevant ratios between them, are located within so-called life-permitting intervals of small probability outside of which carbon-based life would not be possible. Recent developments have found estimates of these probabilities that circumvent previous concerns of measurability and selection bias. However, the question remains if fine-tuning can indeed be known. Using a mathematization of the epistemological concepts of learning and knowledge acquisition, we argue that most examples that have been touted as fine-tuned cannot be formally assessed as such. Nevertheless, fine-tuning can be known when the physical parameter is seen as a random variable and it is supported in the nonnegative real line, provided the size of the life-permitting interval is small in relation to the observed value of the parameter.</description>

      <title>Reconnaissance with JWST of the J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch in Distance Ladder Galaxies: From Irregular Luminosity Functions to Approximation of the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stars in the J-regions of the asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) of near-infrared color magnitude diagrams in the maser host NGC 4258 and 4 hosts of 6 Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia): NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 5584, and NGC 5643. These clumps of stars are readily apparent near $1.0&lt;F150W-F277W&lt;1.5$ and $m_{F150W}$=22-25 mag with James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam photometry. Various methods have been proposed to assign an apparent reference magnitude for this recently proposed standard candle, including the mode, median, sigma-clipped mean or a modeled luminosity function parameter. We test the consistency of these by measuring intra-host variations, finding differences of up to $\sim$0.2 mag that significantly exceed statistical uncertainties. Brightness differences appear intrinsic, and are further amplified by the non-uniform shape of the JAGB luminosity function, also apparent in the LMC and SMC. We follow a 'many methods' approach to consistently measure JAGB magnitudes and distances to the SN Ia host sample calibrated by NGC 4258. We find broad agreement with distances measured from Cepheids, tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), and Miras. However, the SN host mean distance estimated via the JAGB method necessary to estimate $H_0$ differs by $\sim$0.19 mag amongst the above definitions, a result of different levels of luminosity function asymmetry. The methods yield a full range of $71-78$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, i.e., a fiducial result of $H_0=74.7\pm2.1$ (stat) $\pm$2.3 (sys) ($\pm$3.1 if combined in quadrature) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, with systematic errors limited by the differences in methods. Future work may seek to further standardize and refine this promising tool, making it more competitive with established distance indicators.</description>

      <title>From Simulations to Reality: Dark Energy Reconstruction with Simulated SNIa data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based reconstruction analysis of the Supernova Ia (SNIa) distance moduli ($\mu(z)$), and hence dark energy, using LSST simulated three-year SNIa data. Our ANN reconstruction architecture can model both the distance moduli and their corresponding error estimates. For this we employ astroANN and incorporate Monte Carlo dropout techniques to quantify uncertainties in our predictions. We tune our hyperparameters through advanced genetic algorithms, including elitism, utilizing the DEAP library. We compared the performance of the ANN based reconstruction with two theoretical descriptions of dark energy models, $\Lambda$CDM and Chevallier-Linder-Polarski (CPL). We perform a Bayesian analysis for these two theoretical models using the LSST simulations and also compare with observations from Pantheon and Pantheon+ SNIa real data. We show that our model-independent reconstruction using ANN is consistent with both of them. We assessed the performance using mean squared error (MSE) and showed that the ANN can produce distance estimates in better agreement with the LSST dataset than either $\Lambda$CDM or CPL, albeit very small. We included an additional residual analysis and a null test with $F$-scores to show that the reconstructed distances from the ANN model, are in excellent agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM or CPL model.</description>

      <title>CHEX-MATE: A LOFAR pilot X-ray$-$radio study on five radio halo clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connection between the thermal and non-thermal properties in galaxy clusters hosting radio halos seems fairly well established. However, a comprehensive analysis of such a connection has been made only for integrated quantities (e.g. $L_X - P_{radio}$ relation). In recent years new-generation radio telescopes have enabled the unprecedented possibility to study the non-thermal properties of galaxy clusters on a spatially resolved basis. Here, we perform a pilot study to investigate the mentioned properties on five targets, by combining X-ray data from the CHEX-MATE project with the second data release from the LOFAR Two meter Sky survey. We find a strong correlation ($r_s \sim 0.7$) with a slope less than unity between the radio and X-ray surface brightness. We also report differences in the spatially resolved properties of the radio emission in clusters which show different levels of dynamical disturbance. In particular, less perturbed clusters (according to X-ray parameters) show peaked radio profiles in the centre, with a flattening in the outer regions, while the three dynamically disturbed clusters have steeper profiles in the outer regions. We fit a model to the radio emission in the context of turbulent re-acceleration with a constant ratio between thermal and non-thermal particles energy density and a magnetic field profile linked to the thermal gas density as $B(r) \propto n_{th}^{0.5}$. We found that this simple model cannot reproduce the behaviour of the observed radio emission.</description>

Abstract: Lyman limit systems (LLSs) are dense hydrogen clouds with high enough HI column densities to absorb Lyman continuum photons emitted from distant quasars. Their high column densities imply an origin in dense environments; however, the statistics and distribution of LLSs at high redshifts still remain uncertain. In this paper, we use self-consistent radiative transfer cosmological simulations from the "Cosmic Reionization On Computers" (CROC) project to study the physical properties of LLSs at the tail end of cosmic reionization at $z\sim6$. We generate 3000 synthetic quasar sightlines to obtain a large number of LLS samples in the simulations. In addition, with the high physical fidelity and resolution of CROC, we are able to quantify the association between these LLS samples and nearby galaxies. Our results show that the fraction LLSs spatially associated with nearby galaxies is increasing with the HI column density. Moreover, we find that LLSs that are not near any galaxy typically reside in filamentary structures connecting neighboring galaxies in the intergalactic medium (IGM). This quantification of the distribution and associations of LLSs to large scale structures informs our understanding of the IGM-galaxy connection during the Epoch of Reionization, and provides a theoretical basis for interpreting future observations.</description>

      <title>Effects of orbital precession on hyperbolic encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hyperbolic encounters of two massive objects are characterized by the emission of a gravitational wave burst, with most of the energy released during the closest approach (near the periastron). The detection of such events, different from the well-known inspiral emission, would be an interesting discovery and provide complementary information to observations of binary mergers of black holes and neutron stars in the observable Universe, shedding light, for instance, on the clustering properties of black holes and providing valuable hints on their formation scenario. Here, we analyze the dynamics of such phenomena in the simplest case where two compact objects follow unbound/hyperbolic orbits. Moreover, we explore the effects of orbital precession on the gravitational wave emission, since the precession encodes certain general relativistic effects between two bodies. We also provide templates for the strain of gravitational waves and the power spectrum for the emission, and analytical expressions for the memory effect associated with such signals.</description>

      <title>Tensor Perturbations from Bounce Inflation Scenario in f(Q) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a bounce inflation cosmological scenario in the framework of the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity, namely f(Q) theory, and investigate the tensor perturbations therein. As is well-known, the tensor perturbations generated in the very early Universe (inflation and pre-inflation regions) can account for the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) that are to be detected by the next generation of GW experiments. We discuss the stability condition of the tensor perturbations in the bounce inflation process and investigate in detail the evolution of the perturbation variable. The general form of the tensor power spectrum is obtained both for large as well as small scale modes. As a result, we show for both kinds of modes (short or long wavelength modes), and the tensor spectrum may get a positive tilt in the parametric range where the tensor perturbation proves to be stable -- this interestingly hints an enhancement of gravitational waves' amplitude in the background of the f(Q) bounce-inflation scenario. Moreover, we study the LQC-like scenario as a specific case of our model, in which, the primordial tensor power spectrum turns out to be nearly scale-invariant on both small and large scales.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: Early-stage feedback in a heavily obscured AGN at $z=4.76$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dust-obscured galaxies are thought to represent an early evolutionary phase of massive galaxies in which the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is still deeply buried in significant amounts of dusty material and its emission is strongly suppressed. The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope enables us for the first time to detect the rest-frame optical emission of heavily obscured AGN and unveil the properties of the hidden accreting super-massive black holes (BHs). In this work, we present the JWST/NIRSpec IFS data of ALESS073.1, a massive, dusty, star-forming galaxy at $z = 4.76$ hosting an AGN at its center. The detection of a very broad $H_\alpha$ emission associated with the Broad Line Region (BLR) confirms the presence of a BH ($\log(M_{BH}/M_\odot)&gt;8.7$) accreting at less than 15\% of its Eddington limit and classifies the target as a Type 1 AGN. The rest-frame optical emission lines also reveal a fast ionized gas outflow marginally resolved in the galaxy center. The high sensitivity of NIRSpec allows us to perform the kinematic analysis of the narrow H$\alpha$ component which indicates that the warm ionized gas velocity field is consistent with disk rotation. We also find that, in the innermost nuclear regions ($&lt; 1.5$ kpc), the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the disk reaches $\sim 150$ km/s, $\sim 2-3$ times higher than the velocity dispersion inferred from the [CII] 158$\mu$m line tracing mostly cold gas. Since, at large radii, the velocity dispersion of the warm and cold gas are comparable, we conclude that the outflows are injecting turbulence in the warm ionized gas in the central region, but they are not sufficiently powerful to disrupt the dense gas and quench star formation. These findings support the scenario that dust-obscured galaxies represent the evolutionary stage preceding the unobscured quasar when all gas and dust are removed from the host.</description>

Abstract: The Jiao Tong University Spectroscopic Telescope (JUST) is a 4.4-meter f/6.0 segmentedmirror telescope dedicated to spectroscopic observations. The JUST primary mirror is composed of 18 hexagonal segments, each with a diameter of 1.1 m. JUST provides two Nasmyth platforms for placing science instruments. One Nasmyth focus fits a field of view of 10 arcmin and the other has an extended field of view of 1.2 deg with correction optics. A tertiary mirror is used to switch between the two Nasmyth foci. JUST will be installed at a site at Lenghu in Qinghai Province, China, and will conduct spectroscopic observations with three types of instruments to explore the dark universe, trace the dynamic universe, and search for exoplanets: (1) a multi-fiber (2000 fibers) medium-resolution spectrometer (R=4000-5000) to spectroscopically map galaxies and large-scale structure; (2) an integral field unit (IFU) array of 500 optical fibers and/or a long-slit spectrograph dedicated to fast follow-ups of transient sources for multimessenger astronomy; (3) a high-resolution spectrometer (R~100000) designed to identify Jupiter analogs and Earth-like planets, with the capability to characterize the atmospheres of hot exoplanets.</description>
