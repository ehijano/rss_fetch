      <title>Follow the money: a startup-based measure of AI exposure across occupations, industries and regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the workplace is advancing rapidly, necessitating robust metrics to evaluate its tangible impact on the labour market. Existing measures of AI occupational exposure largely focus on AI's theoretical potential to substitute or complement human labour on the basis of technical feasibility, providing limited insight into actual adoption and offering inadequate guidance for policymakers. To address this gap, we introduce the AI Startup Exposure (AISE) index-a novel metric based on occupational descriptions from O*NET and AI applications developed by startups funded by the Y Combinator accelerator. Our findings indicate that while high-skilled professions are theoretically highly exposed according to conventional metrics, they are heterogeneously targeted by startups. Roles involving routine organizational tasks-such as data analysis and office management-display significant exposure, while occupations involving tasks that are less amenable to AI automation due to ethical or high-stakes, more than feasibility, considerations -- such as judges or surgeons -- present lower AISE scores. By focusing on venture-backed AI applications, our approach offers a nuanced perspective on how AI is reshaping the labour market. It challenges the conventional assumption that high-skilled jobs uniformly face high AI risks, highlighting instead the role of today's AI players' societal desirability-driven and market-oriented choices as critical determinants of AI exposure. Contrary to fears of widespread job displacement, our findings suggest that AI adoption will be gradual and shaped by social factors as much as by the technical feasibility of AI applications. This framework provides a dynamic, forward-looking tool for policymakers and stakeholders to monitor AI's evolving impact and navigate the changing labour landscape.</description>

      <title>AI and the law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I argue that generative AI will have an uneven effect on the evolution of the law. To do so, I consider generative AI as a labor-augmenting technology that reduces the cost of both writing more complete contracts and litigating in court. The contracting effect reduces the demand for court services by making contracts more complete. The litigation effect, by contrast, increases the demand for court services by a) making contracts less complete and b) reducing litigants' incentive to settle, all else equal. Where contracts are common, as in property and contract law, the change in the quantity of litigation is uncertain due to offsetting contracting and litigation effects. However, in areas where contracts are rare, as in tort law, the amount of litigation is likely to rise. Following Rubin (1977) and Priest (1977) generative AI will accelerate the evolution of tort law toward efficiency.</description>

      <title>Achieving Semantic Consistency Using BERT: Application of Pre-training Semantic Representations Model in Social Sciences Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving consistent word interpretations across different time spans is crucial in social sciences research and text analysis tasks, as stable semantic representations form the foundation for research and task correctness, enhancing understanding of socio-political and cultural analysis. Traditional models like Word2Vec have provided significant insights into long-term semantic changes but often struggle to capture stable meanings in short-term contexts, which may be attributed to fluctuations in embeddings caused by unbalanced training data. Recent advancements, particularly BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), its pre-trained nature and transformer encoder architecture offer contextual embeddings that improve semantic consistency, making it a promising tool for short-term analysis. This study empirically compares the performance of Word2Vec and BERT in maintaining stable word meanings over time in text analysis tasks relevant to social sciences research. Using articles from the People's Daily spanning 20 years (2004-2023), we evaluated the semantic stability of each model across different timeframes. The results indicate that BERT consistently outperforms Word2Vec in maintaining semantic stability, offering greater stability in contextual embeddings. However, the study also acknowledges BERT's limitations in capturing gradual semantic shifts over longer periods due to its inherent stability. The findings suggest that while BERT is advantageous for short-term semantic analysis in social sciences, researchers should consider complementary approaches for long-term studies to fully capture semantic drift. This research underscores the importance of selecting appropriate word embedding models based on the specific temporal context of social science analyses.</description>

      <title>Constructing Uncertainty Sets for Robust Risk Measures: A Composition of $\phi$-Divergences Approach to Combat Tail Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Risk measures, which typically evaluate the impact of extreme losses, are highly sensitive to misspecification in the tails. This paper studies a robust optimization approach to combat tail uncertainty by proposing a unifying framework to construct uncertainty sets for a broad class of risk measures, given a specified nominal model. Our framework is based on a parametrization of robust risk measures using two (or multiple) $\phi$-divergence functions, which enables us to provide uncertainty sets that are tailored to both the sensitivity of each risk measure to tail losses and the tail behavior of the nominal distribution. In addition, our formulation allows for a tractable computation of robust risk measures, and elicitation of $\phi$-divergences that describe a decision maker's risk and ambiguity preferences.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for belief elicitation without ground truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review article examines the challenge of eliciting truthful information from multiple individuals when such information cannot be verified, a problem known as information elicitation without verification (IEWV). This article reviews over 25 mechanisms designed to incentivize truth-telling in such scenarios and their effectiveness in empirical studies. Although many mechanisms theoretically ensure truthfulness as a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, empirical evidence regarding the effects of mechanisms on truth-telling is limited and generally weak. Consequently, more empirical research is needed to validate mechanisms. However, empirical validaton is difficult because most mechanisms are very complex and cannot be easily conveyed to research subjects. This review suggests that simple and intuitive mechanisms may be easier to empirically test and apply.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Algorithm for Finite-Horizon Stochastic Control Problems in Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning algorithm for solving finite-horizon stochastic control problems based on a deep neural network representation of the optimal policy functions. The algorithm has three features: (1) It can solve high-dimensional (e.g., over 100 dimensions) and finite-horizon time-inhomogeneous stochastic control problems. (2) It has a monotonicity of performance improvement in each iteration, leading to good convergence properties. (3) It does not rely on the Bellman equation. To demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, it is applied to solve various finite-horizon time-inhomogeneous problems including recursive utility optimization under a stochastic volatility model, a multi-sector stochastic growth, and optimal control under a dynamic stochastic integration of climate and economy model with eight-dimensional state vectors and 600 time periods.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Global Food Trade: A Net Caloric Content Approach to Food Trade Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the global population and the per capita demand for resource intensive diets continues to grow, the corresponding increase in food demand challenges the global food system, enhancing its reliance on trade. Most previous research typically constructed either unweighted networks or weighted solely by tonnage to represent food trade, and focused on bilateral trade relationships between pairs of countries. This study investigates the properties of global food trade constructed in terms of total food calories associated with all the main food products exchanged along each trade link (edge of the food trade network). Utilizing data from the Food and Agriculture Organization between 1986 and 2022, we construct a directed, weighted network of net caloric flows between countries. This approach highlights the importance of considering nutritional value in discussions of food security and trade policies, offering a more holistic view of global food trade dynamics. Our analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in trade patterns, with certain countries emerging as major exporters or importers of food calories. Moreover, we employ network measures, including network connectivity, network heterogeneity, network modularity, and node correlation similarity, to elucidate the structural dynamics of global net food calorie trade networks that are relevant to the stability and resilience of the global food system. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of global food trade dynamics, emphasizing the need for comprehensive strategies to enhance the resilience and sustainability of food trade networks.</description>
