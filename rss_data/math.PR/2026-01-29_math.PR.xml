      <title>Model Risk Static-Hedging a Constrained Distributionally Robust Optimization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate model risk and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) under marginal and martingale constraints. Building on our previous work, we address the previously open case of static hedging with second-period maturity vanilla options and hedging strategies involving a vanilla payoff. We also extend recent sensitivity results to settings where admissible models must satisfy a martingale coupling constraint. Our approach relies on a weak implicit function theorem argument to construct families of measures satisfying the prescribed constraints. We derive closed-form sensitivity formulas and characterize the corresponding hedging strategies when the underlying process is real-valued.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Chaos for Derivatives of McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an enhanced version of existing results on Kac's propagation of chaos, which describes the convergence of mean-field particle systems to the independent McKean-Vlasov particle system as the number of particles tends to infinity, we prove the convergence at the level of derivatives with respect to the perturbations of initial value and noise, together with explicit convergence rates that can be sharp. As a consequence, the intrinsic derivative for the distribution of a single particle converges to that of an independent McKean-Vlasov SDE.</description>

      <title>On The Cutoff Phenomenon For Dyson-Jacobi Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence to equilibrium of the Dyson-Jacobi process, a system of n interacting particles on the segment [0, 1] arising from Random Matrix Theory. We establish the occurence of a cutoff phenomenon for the intrinsic Wasserstein distance and provide an explicit formula for the associated mixing time.  Our approach relies on the interplay between the Riemannian geometry of the process and a flattened Euclidean representation obtained via a diffeomorphic deformation. This transformation allows us to transfer curvature-dimension inequalities from the Euclidean setting to the original space, thereby yielding sharp quantitative estimates.</description>

      <title>On Portenko's approximation of skew Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of the theory of operator semigroups, we reflect back on the classical theorem of Portenko devoted to approximation of skew Brownian motion. The theorem says that by concentrating the power of drift of a diffusion process around a point one obtains an equivalent of a semi-permeable membrane at this point, described by skew Brownian motion's boundary condition. We prove convergence of the corresponding Feller semigroups and in doing so, generalize Portenko's theorem to the case of the Walsh processes on star graphs. Our analysis leads through singular perturbations of Sturm--Liouville equations, and reveals that as a result of Portenko-type approximation parameters of Walsh processes are transformed in a simple and elegant manner.</description>

      <title>Spectral Diffusion Models on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models provide a principled framework for generative modeling via stochastic differential equations and time-reversed dynamics. Extending spectral diffusion approaches to spherical data, however, raises nontrivial geometric and stochastic issues that are absent in the Euclidean setting.
  In this work, we develop a diffusion modeling framework defined directly on finite-dimensional spherical harmonic representations of real-valued functions on the sphere. We show that the spherical discrete Fourier transform maps spatial Brownian motion to a constrained Gaussian process in the frequency domain with deterministic, generally non-isotropic covariance. This induces modified forward and reverse-time stochastic differential equations in the spectral domain.
  As a consequence, spatial and spectral score matching objectives are no longer equivalent, even in the band-limited setting, and the frequency-domain formulation introduces a geometry-dependent inductive bias. We derive the corresponding diffusion equations and characterize the induced noise covariance.</description>

      <title>Optimal matching under size priority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past studies on the local limit of maximal weight matchings in edge-weighted large random graphs rely fundamentally on the assumption that the weights are atomless, which ensures that the maximal weight matching is unique. This excludes de facto maximal size matchings that correspond to equal edge-weights. In this work, we overcome this difficulty by assigning i.i.d.~atomless weights to edges and choosing the maximal size matching that maximises the weight. We call these doubly constrained matchings \emph{optimal matchings}. The natural generalisation of optimal matchings for infinite unimodular random graphs are unimodular matchings of maximal density at the root that maximise the expected weight at the root when it is matched.
  For unimodular Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson (UBGW) trees and for a broad class of weight distributions, we show existence and uniqueness in law of such matchings. We also prove that if a sequence of finite random weighted graphs converges locally to an UBGW tree with i.i.d.~weights, then there exists a sequence of matchings on the finite graphs that converges locally to the optimal matching on the limiting tree. Finally, we identify a regime, depending only on the offspring distribution of the limiting tree, in which correlations between edge states in the optimal matching decay exponentially with their graph distance. In this regime, we strengthen the previous convergence to the convergence of optimal matchings of the finite graphs. As a by-product, we can explicitly compute the asymptotic densities of edges that belong to all maximal-density matchings, and of edges that belong to none.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Existence of a Unique Solution to Gamma Moment Closure for the Stochastic Ricker Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stochastic Ricker difference equation $X_{n+1} = X_n \exp(r(1-X_n)) \varepsilon_n$, where $X_n$ is a random variable representing the population size and $\{\varepsilon_n\}$ denotes independent random perturbations with $E[\varepsilon_n] = 1$ and $E[\varepsilon_n^2] = v &gt; 1$. We derive a closed system of difference equations for the mean and variance of $X_n$ using the Gamma moment-closure technique and numerically verify the validity of the Gamma moment-closure approximation. By constructing an auxiliary function, we establish the necessary and sufficient condition, $v &lt; (2 - e^{-r})^2$, for the existence of the positive unique feasible equilibrium. We further verify its local stability with numerical analysis. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the validity of the Gamma moment approximation and illustrate how the interplay between the intrinsic growth rate $r$ and noise intensity $v$ determines population persistence. The results provide a unified theoretical framework for analyzing stochastic Gamma dynamics, offering new biological insights into the stabilizing and destabilizing effects of environmental variability.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of invariant measures for stochastic damped anisotropic Navier--Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional Navier--Stokes system with anisotropic viscosity, linear damping term, and an additive noise on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^2$. For this model we prove uniqueness of invariant measures when the damping coefficient is sufficiently large compared to the noise intensity. The argument is based on an asymptotic coupling method and relies on anisotropic energy estimates together with exponential-type estimates for the $H^1$-energy. Since no Poincar\'e inequality is available on $\mathbb{R}^2$, the damping term is essential even for the existence of invariant measures. Our result applies to general additive noise without any non-degeneracy condition and remains valid even in the deterministic case $\sigma\equiv0$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the stochastic heat equation on a compact smooth Riemannian manifold without boundary satisfying \begin{equation*} \partial_tu(t,x)=\frac{1}{2}\Delta_Mu(t,x)+\sigma(t,x,u)\dot{W}(t,x),\quad (t,x)\in\mathbb{R}_+\times M, \end{equation*} where $\dot{W}$ is a centered Gaussian noise that is white in time and colored in space. Assuming that $\sigma$ is Lipschitz in $u$ and uniformly bounded, we estimate small ball probabilities for the solution $u$ when $u(0,x)\equiv 0$.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks as Iterated Function Systems and a Generalization Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks, yet their mathematical analysis remains fragmented: stability and generalization are typically studied in disparate frameworks and on a case-by-case basis. Architecturally, DNNs rely on the recursive application of parametrized functions, a mechanism that can be unstable and difficult to train, making stability a primary concern. Even when training succeeds, there are few rigorous results on how well such models generalize beyond the observed data, especially in the generative setting. In this work, we leverage the theory of stochastic Iterated Function Systems (IFS) and show that two important deep architectures can be viewed as, or canonically associated with, place-dependent IFS. This connection allows us to import results from random dynamical systems to (i) establish the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures under suitable contractivity assumptions, and (ii) derive a Wasserstein generalization bound for generative modeling. The bound naturally leads to a new training objective that directly controls the collage-type approximation error between the data distribution and its image under the learned transfer operator. We illustrate the theory on a controlled 2D example and empirically evaluate the proposed objective on standard image datasets (MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR-10).</description>

      <title>Matching and mixing: Matchability of graphs under Markovian error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of graph matching for a sequence of graphs generated under a time-dependent Markov chain noise model. Our edgelighter error model, a variant of the classical lamplighter random walk, iteratively corrupts the graph $G_0$ with edge-dependent noise, creating a sequence of noisy graph copies $(G_t)$. Much of the graph matching literature is focused on anonymization thresholds in edge-independent noise settings, and we establish novel anonymization thresholds in this edge-dependent noise setting when matching $G_0$ and $G_t$. Moreover, we also compare this anonymization threshold with the mixing properties of the Markov chain noise model. We show that when $G_0$ is drawn from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, the graph matching anonymization threshold and the mixing time of the edgelighter walk are both of order $\Theta(n^2\log n)$. We further demonstrate that for more structured model for $G_0$ (e.g., the Stochastic Block Model), graph matching anonymization can occur in $O(n^\alpha\log n)$ time for some $\alpha&lt;2$, indicating that anonymization can occur before the Markov chain noise model globally mixes. Through extensive simulations, we verify our theoretical bounds in the settings of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs and stochastic block model random graphs, and explore our findings on real-world datasets derived from a Facebook friendship network and a European research institution email communication network.</description>

      <title>On The Fourier Mean Bodies of a Convex Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1998, R. Gardner and G. Zhang introduced the radial $p$th mean bodies $R_p K$ of a convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $p&gt;-1$, which now play an important role in geometric tomography. In this work, we study the Fourier transforms of the radial functions of $R_p K$. We introduce a new family of star-shaped sets $F_p K$, which we call the Fourier $p$th mean bodies of $K$. We are then interested in the convexity and the relevant affine-isoperimetric inequalities for $F_p K$, as well as connections of $F_p K$ with other classical objects in geometric tomography such as centroid bodies, intersection bodies, and mean zonoids. We also show that the bodies $F_p K$ are, for $p\in (0,1]$, close to ellipsoids in the sense of Hensley's theorem.</description>

      <title>Concentration Inequalities for Exchangeable Tensors and Matrix-valued Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study concentration inequalities for structured weighted sums of random data, including (i) tensor inner products and (ii) sequential matrix sums. We are interested in tail bounds and concentration inequalities for those structured weighted sums under exchangeability, extending beyond the classical framework of independent terms.
  We develop Hoeffding and Bernstein bounds provided with structure-dependent exchangeability. Along the way, we recover known results in weighted sum of exchangeable random variables and i.i.d. sums of random matrices to the optimal constants. Notably, we develop a sharper concentration bound for combinatorial sum of matrix arrays than the results previously derived from Chatterjee's method of exchangeable pairs.
  For applications, the richer structures provide us with novel analytical tools for estimating the average effect of multi-factor response models and studying fixed-design sketching methods in federated averaging. We apply our results to these problems, and find that our theoretical predictions are corroborated by numerical evidence.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Dividend Optimization in Partially Observed Regime-Switching Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal dividend problem with a bounded payout rate in a partially observed regime-switching diffusion model, where, in practice, the market regime is unobserved and key model parameters are unknown. To address this partial-information setting, we propose a continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) approach within an exploratory (entropy-regularized) stochastic control framework for discounted dividends under regime switching. The associated exploratory Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system admits semi-analytical characterizations of the value function and the optimal exploratory dividend policy, determined by two unknown functions solving two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) together with positive real roots of the induced quadratic equations. Exploiting this structure, we introduce parametric families for both the value function and the policy, using low-degree polynomial approximations to the ODE solutions. We then develop an actor-critic RL algorithm to learn the optimal exploratory policy through interactions with the market environment: it performs belief-state filtering from observed data and iterates policy evaluation and policy improvement online to refine the policy. Numerical experiments demonstrate strong out-of-sample performance of the learned dividend policies.</description>

      <title>Improved Computational Lower Bound of Estimation for Multi-Frequency Group Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational phase transition in a multi-frequency group synchronization problem, where pairwise relative measurements of group elements are observed across multiple frequency channels and corrupted by Gaussian noise. Using the framework of \emph{low-degree polynomial algorithms}, we analyze the task of estimating the structured signal in such observations. We show that, assuming the low-degree heuristic, in synchronization models over the circle group $\mathsf{SO}(2)$, a simple spectral method is computationally optimal among all polynomial-time estimators when the number of frequencies satisfies $L=n^{o(1)}$. This significantly extends prior work \cite{KBK24+}, which only applied to a fixed constant number of frequencies. Together with known upper bounds on the statistical threshold \cite{PWBM18a}, our results establish the existence of a \emph{statistical-to-computational gap} in this model when the number of frequencies is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Spectral Bayesian Regression on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully intrinsic Bayesian framework for nonparametric regression on the unit sphere based on isotropic Gaussian field priors and the harmonic structure induced by the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Under uniform random design, the regression model admits an exact diagonalization in the spherical harmonic basis, yielding a Gaussian sequence representation with frequency-dependent multiplicities.
  Exploiting this structure, we derive closed-form posterior distributions, optimal spectral truncation schemes, and sharp posterior contraction rates under integrated squared loss. For Gaussian priors with polynomially decaying angular power spectra, including spherical Mat\'ern priors, we establish posterior contraction rates over Sobolev classes, which are minimax-optimal under correct prior calibration.
  We further show that the posterior mean admits an exact variational characterization as a geometrically intrinsic penalized least-squares estimator, equivalent to a Laplace-Beltrami smoothing spline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantization dimension of self-similar measures, particularly when the IFS does not satisfy the separation condition, but the sub-IFS at some level satisfies the separation condition. Further, we study the approximation of the space of Borel probability measures $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^m)$ with respect to the geometric mean error, i.e., the quantization dimension of order zero.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of crossing probabilities in the dilute Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10979v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent paper due to Duminil-Copin and Tassion from $2019$ introduces a novel argument for obtaining estimates on horizontal crossing probabilities of the Random-Cluster model, in which a range of four possible behaviors, through a quadrichotomy, is established. Novel renormalization arguments for crossing probabilities that the authors propose are studied in other models of interest that are not self-dual, specifically for the dilute Potts model. The probability measure of this model, through a suitably defined spin representation, is obtained from the high-temperature expansion of the loop $O(n)$ measure. The dilute Potts model was originally introduced in $1991$ by Nienhuis and is another model whose possible range of behaviors can be analyzed through a quadrichotomy; the range of four possible behaviors of the model can be respectively characterized at subcriticality, or supercriticality, in addition to either being critical discontinuous, or critical continuous. The exponential factor that is inserted into the Loop $O(n)$ model to quantify properties of the high-temperature phase is proportional to the summation over all spins, and the number of monochromatically colored triangles over a finite volume, which is in exact correspondence with the parameter of a Boltzmann weight introduced in Nienhuis' paper detailing extensions of the $q$-state Potts model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11661v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider maximum rooted tree extension counts in random graphs, i.e., we consider M_n = \max_v X_v where X_v counts the number of copies of a given tree in G_{n,p} rooted at vertex v. We determine the asymptotics of M_n when the random graph is not too sparse, specifically when the edge probability p=p(n) satisfies p(1-p)n \gg \log n. The problem is more difficult in the sparser regime 1 \ll pn \ll \log n, where we determine the asymptotics of M_n for specific classes of trees. Interestingly, here our large deviation type optimization arguments reveal that the behavior of M_n changes as we vary p=p(n), due to different mechanisms that can make the maximum large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent paper by Bhatia, Chin, Mani, and Mossel (2026) defined stochastic processes aimed at modeling the game of War for {\em two players} with $n$ cards. That paper showed that these models, assuming uniform random decks, are equivalent to the Gambler's Ruin problem and therefore have an expected termination time of $\Theta(n^2)$. In this paper, we generalize these models to {\em any number of players} $m$. We prove that the game with $m$ players is equivalent to a sticky random walk on an $m$-simplex; therefore, the termination time is the same as the absorption time of the sticky random walk. Interestingly, it seems that this absorption time has not been analyzed before. We show that the absorption time of the walk and the termination time of the game are both $\Theta(n^2)$ for any number of players.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity in one-dimensional Coulomb gases and related ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove log-concavity of the lengths of the top rows of Young diagrams under Poissonized Plancherel measure. This is the first known positive result towards a 2008 conjecture of Chen that the length of the top row of a Young diagram under the Plancherel measure is log-concave. This is done by showing that the ordered elements of several discrete ensembles have log-concave distributions. In particular, we show the log-concavity of passage times in last passage percolation with geometric weights, using their connection to Meixner ensembles.
  In the continuous setting, distributions of the maximal elements of beta ensembles with convex potentials on the real line are shown to be log-concave. As a result, log-concavity of the Tracy-Widom distributions for all parameters $\beta&gt;0$ follows, confirming a folklore conjecture that was partially proved by Deift for $\beta=2$. Furthermore, we also obtain log-concavity and positive association for the joint distribution of the $k$ smallest eigenvalues of the stochastic Airy operator. Our methods also show the log-concavity of the Airy-2 process and the Airy distribution. A log-concave distribution with full-dimensional support must have density, a fact that was apparently not known for some of these examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-energy-based adaptive biasing methods, such as Metadynamics, the Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF) and their variants, are enhanced sampling algorithms widely used in molecular simulations. Although their efficiency has been empirically acknowledged for decades, providing theoretical insights via a quantitative convergence analysis is a difficult problem, in particular for the kinetic Langevin diffusion, which is non-reversible and hypocoercive. We obtain the first exponential convergence result for such a process, in an idealized setting where the dynamics can be associated with a mean-field non-linear flow on the space of probability measures. A key of the analysis is the interpretation of the (idealized) algorithm as the gradient descent of a suitable functional over the space of probability distributions.</description>

      <title>Variational Tail Bounds for Norms of Random Vectors and Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a variational tail bound for norms of random vectors under moment assumptions on their one-dimensional marginals. A simplified version of the bound that parametrizes the ``aggregating distribution'' using a certain pushforward of the Gaussian distribution is also provided. We apply the proposed method to reproduce some of the well-known bounds on norms of Gaussian random vectors, and also obtain dimension-free tail bounds for the Euclidean norm of random vectors with arbitrary moment profiles. Furthermore, we reproduce a dimension-free concentration inequality for sum of independent and identically distributed positive semidefinite matrices with sub-exponential marginals, and obtain a concentration inequality for the sample covariance matrix of sub-exponential random vectors. We also obtain a tail bound for the operator norm of a random matrix series whose random coefficients may have arbitrary moment profiles. Furthermore, we use coupling to formulate an abstraction of the proposed approach that applies more broadly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometric properties of random neural networks by investigating the boundary volumes of their excursion sets for different activation functions, as the depth increases. More specifically, we show that, for activations which are not very regular (e.g., the Heaviside step function), the boundary volumes exhibit fractal behavior, with their Hausdorff dimension monotonically increasing with the depth. On the other hand, for activations which are more regular (e.g., ReLU, logistic and $\tanh$), as the depth increases, the expected boundary volumes can either converge to zero, remain constant or diverge exponentially, depending on a single spectral parameter which can be easily computed. Our theoretical results are confirmed in some numerical experiments based on Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Brownian loop soup clusters in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for an arbitrary intensity $\alpha&gt;0$. We show the existence of a phase transition for the presence of unbounded clusters and study its basic properties. In particular, we show that, when $\alpha$ is sufficiently large, almost surely all the loops are connected into a single cluster. Such a phenomenon is not observed in discrete percolation-type models. In addition, we prove the existence of a one-arm exponent and compare the clusters with the finite-range system obtained by imposing lower and upper bounds on the diameter of the loops.
  Finally, we provide a toolbox concerning the Brownian loop measure in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \ge 3$. In particular, we derive decomposition formulas by rerooting the loops in specific ways and show that the loop measure is conformally invariant, generalising results of [Lup18] in dimension 1 and [LW04] in dimension 2.</description>

      <title>Telegrapher's Generative Model via Kac Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20641v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation. Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its advantages over diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dividend Control with Transaction Costs under Exponential Parisian Ruin for a Refracted Levy Risk Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns an optimal impulse control problem associated with a refracted L\'{e}vy process, involving the reduction of reserves to a predetermined level whenever they exceed a specified threshold. The ruin time is determined by Parisian exponential delays and limited by a lower ultimate bankrupt barrier. We initially obtained the necessary and sufficient conditions for the value function and the optimal impulse control policy. Given a candidate for the optimal strategy, the corresponding expected discounted dividend function is subsequently formulated in terms of the Parisian refracted scale function, which is employed to measure the expected discounted utility of the impulse control. Then, the optimality of the proposed impulse control is verified using the HJB inequalities, and a monotonicity-based criterion is established to identify the admissible region of optimal thresholds, which serves as the basis for the numerical computation of their optimal levels. Finally, we present applications and numerical examples related to Brownian risk process and Cram\'{e}r-Lundberg process with exponential claims, demonstrating the uniqueness of the optimal impulse strategy and exploring its sensitivity to parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic human-rodent compartment model for Mpox transmission that combines diffusion noise with Hawkes self-exciting jumps in the human infection dynamics. Including Hawkes processes allows, for instance, to model the short but significant spikes in transmission happening after crowded events. For the coupled human-rodent system, we prove global existence, uniqueness and positivity of solutions, derive a basic reproduction number R_0 that guarantees almost sure extinction when R_0 &lt; 1, and obtain explicit persistence-in-the-mean conditions for both infected rodents and humans, which define persistence thresholds for the joint dynamics. Numerical experiments show how clustered human transmission events, environmental variability and control measures shift these thresholds and shape the frequency and size of Mpox outbreaks.</description>

Abstract: We solve two long standing open problems, one from probability theory formulated by Malyshev in 1970 and another one from a crossroad of geometry and dynamics, of Darboux from 1879. The Malyshev problem is of finding effective, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions in the closed form to characterize all random walks in the quarter plane with the finite group of random walk of order $2n$, for all $n\ge 2$, where the underlining biquadratic is an elliptic curve. Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$, obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. Explicit examples of random walks with the groups of orders higher than 10 are presented here for the first time, including orders 12, 14, 16. The same method applies to any higher order. We consider cases with singular biquadratics in a systematic manner. We establish a new two-way relationship between diagonal random walks and $4$-bar links. We describe all $n$-periodic Darboux transformations for $4$-bar links for all $n\ge 2$, thus completely solving the Darboux problem: after $n$ iterations, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one of the same orientation, that he solved for $n=2$, which was recently extended to $n=3$. We also study $k$-semi-periodicity as a natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing a new object, the secondary $(2,2)$ correspondence, and the related secondary cubic of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form, while the case $k=2$ was solved recently.</description>

Abstract:   Probabilities is the English translation of the book Probabilit\'es Tome 1 and Tome 2. The mathematic content is authored by Prof. Jean-Yves Ouvrard. The English version has been done by his eldest son Dr. Xavier Ouvrard. In this first version, only the first part is released. Part 1 contains 7 chapters and corresponds to bachelor level. The first part introduces the fundamentals of probability theory, including event algebras, random variables, independence, conditional probabilities, moments of discrete and continuous random variables, generating functions, and limit theorems.
  Disclaimer: The second part is given as such and still needs full review. Corrected versions will be made available as soon as they are available during the coming months of 2026, stay tune!</description>
