      <title>CT25: Progress toward next-generation PDFs for precision phenomenology at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize recent progress toward the next generation of CTEQ-TEA parton distribution functions, CT25, based on a global NNLO analysis that incorporates a significant sample of newly included LHC data. We present a baseline fit within the forthcoming full CT25 fit, which includes new Drell-Yan, top-pair, and inclusive-jet data at 8 and 13 TeV, and exhibits non-trivial pulls on the high-$x$ gluon and the flavor structure of the quark sea. In the context of progress toward CT25, we also summarize several recent and ongoing studies of the interplay between phenomenological PDFs and lattice-QCD calculations, simultaneous extractions of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ within the CT framework, and an expanded program of uncertainty quantification that treats parametrization dependence as an explicit source of epistemic uncertainty, among other issues. We also briefly highlight CT efforts to understand the effects of partial implementations of N$^3$LO corrections into PDF fits, which include benchmark calculations for Higgs and vector-boson processes. We comment on the implications of recent improvements to the CT analysis for precision phenomenology at the LHC and future facilities.</description>

      <title>$N_{\textrm{eff}}$ Constraint on Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the electroweak symmetry breaking, we can write down two types of mass for the Standard Model neutrinos, Dirac or Majorana. It is often said that both types of mass cannot be distinguished in neutrino oscillation phenomena. This is in fact not true if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac (strictly speaking still Majorana) where they mix almost maximally with sterile neutrinos to form pseudo-Dirac pairs. If this is indeed realized in Nature, what we observe experimentally as three mass eigenstates are actually three pairs of mass eigenstates with yet-to-be-measured new mass splitting among each pair. While the new mass squared splitting of the first and second mass eigenstates have stringent constraints from solar neutrino to be $|\delta m_{1,2}^2| \lesssim10^{-11}\,\textrm{eV}^{2}$, the one regarding the third mass eigenstate has a weaker constraint $|\delta m_3^2| \lesssim10^{-5}\,\textrm{eV}^{2}$. By keeping only one nonzero pseudo-Dirac mass squared splitting at a time, we derive an effective 3+1 description for the pseudo-Dirac scenario. Then we use the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraint on neutrino relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\textrm{eff}}$ to derive a new constraint $|\delta m_3^2| &lt; 2 \times 10^{-6}\,{\rm eV}^2$ and show that the future CMB-S4 and CMB-HD can improve this bound by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Shifting the neutrino fog: studying the Isospin-violating Dark Matter case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First observation of solar neutrinos through coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering by dark matter (DM) direct detection (DD) experiments makes the study of the neutrino fog of the most relevance. This irreducible neutrino background depends on the target material as well as other experimental parameters. Recently, it has also been remarked the dependence of the neutrino fog on the DM models under consideration. In this work, we study the case of Isospin-violating dark matter (IVDM) models, discussing specific examples of DM models and making a detailed analysis of the implications of IVDM on the neutrino fog. We also explore the conditions under which this background can be mitigated for specific DM models.</description>

      <title>Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) currently delivers a 1 MW, 3 GeV proton beam to the Materials and Life Science Experimental Facility (MLF). Power is expected to increase to 1.3 MW, driven by the needs of Hyper-Kamiokande. As a result, the MLF presently provides the highest neutron yield of any spallation source, while potentially holding the best current and foreseeable conditions for Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) experimentation. We explore this potential, using as examples detector technologies presently funded for construction and under development. We quantify their sensitivity to a rich variety of particle physics scenarios, finding that very-high-statistics CE$\nu$NS measurements with significant sensitivity to relevant scenarios are feasible at this facility within the next few years.</description>

      <title>Residual Symmetries and Scalar Multiplet Vacuum Alignment in Non-Abelian Flavour Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, upon minimizing a renormalizable, single-scalar potential invariant under a non-Abelian symmetry, special orientations in the associated vacuum alignment of the scalar multiplet correspond to the preservation of a discrete residual flavour symmetry in the broken phase of the theory. Conversely, we show that these special scalar alignments are perturbed when additional Lagrangian operators (e.g. renormalizable, multi-flavon operators and/or effective, higher-dimensional operators) are present that break said residual symmetry, leading to a vacuum reorientation and phenomenological consequences. We therefore construct a one-to-one correspondence principle between broken residual symmetries and vacuum alignment corrections, providing a mechanism to identify (and correct) a subtle but persistent form of phenomenologically relevant fine-tuning embedded in -- but often ignored by -- most successful non-Abelian flavour models. We first establish this correspondence in a set of toy models based on the S4 permutation symmetry, and then apply the lessons learned to the more realistic A4 Altarelli-Feruglio and $\Delta(27)$ Universal Texture Zero models.</description>

      <title>Probing invisible particles with charm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out opportunities to probe invisible particles, left- and right-handed neutrinos, axion-like particles (ALPs) and dark photons $(Z^\prime)$ with rare decays of charm hadrons. We employ and recast existing searches in $D \to (\pi, \omega) X$, $D^ 0 \to X$ and $\Lambda_c \to p X$, where $X$ denotes one of the above invisible final states including dineutrinos. The branching ratios are clean null tests of the standard model, yet, are essentially unconstrained for some parameters of light new physics, limited only by weak lifetime constraints at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. On the other hand, if models are probed, branching ratios still reach up to $10^{-3}$ ($Z^\prime$) and $10^{-4}$ (ALPs). Chirality-preserving operators from heavy new physics in the dimension six standard model effective theory (SMEFT) imply tighter upper limits, up to few $\times 10^{-5}$. Constraints on chirality-flipping heavy new physics, such as lepton number violation from dimension seven SMEFT, or with light sterile neutrinos, are weaker, with branching ratios up to few$\times 10^{-4}$. Sensitivities to different couplings arise with $\Lambda_c \to p X$ and $D \to \pi \pi X$ decays, in particular in relation with the other modes. Processes can be studied at running and future experiments with high charm luminosities, BESIII, Belle II, a super-tau-charm factory (STCF) and $Z$-factories, such as FCC-ee and CEPC.</description>

      <title>Multiple Mellin-Barnes integrals with polygamma functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mellin-Barnes (MB) integrals appear in various branches of physics and mathematics and are, in particular, used as a standard tool for evaluating multi-loop, multi-scale Feynman integrals both analytically and numerically. Recent geometric approaches based on conic hulls and triangulations provide a systematic framework for computing multiple MB integrals in terms of multivariate series. These approaches have so far been limited to MB integrals whose integrands are ratios of products of Euler's gamma functions only. However, in Feynman integral calculus, MB integrals with polygamma functions naturally arise, for instance, after resolving singularities in the dimensional-regularisation parameter $\epsilon$ and expanding the MB integrand in powers of $\epsilon$, as done by the public codes MB.m and MBresolve.m. In this paper, we extend the conic hull and triangulation methods to the computation of MB integrals having polygamma functions in their integrand. We show that the arguments of polygamma functions can be treated in a similar way to the arguments of gamma functions when applying the conic hull and triangulation techniques to identify poles that would contribute to different series solutions. However, since the singularity structure of the polygamma function is different from that of the gamma function, we propose two different ways to compute MB integrals involving polygamma functions, depending on whether the MB integral has straight or non-straight contours. We have implemented these algorithms in an updated version of the Mathematica package MBConicHulls.wl, which can be found at https://github.com/SumitBanikGit/MBConicHulls/, and we illustrate their use with a set of examples from Feynman integral calculus.</description>

      <title>Universal Seesaw Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implications for leptogenesis in a class of left-right symmetric model, where all fermion masses are induced through the Universal Seesaw mechanism. Unlike conventional analyses, we do not use the decays of the neutrino embedded in the right-chiral lepton doublet, but rather those of the gauge-singlet mediators required for neutrino mass generation in the canonical Type-I seesaw. Due to the generalized parity symmetry that doubles the fermionic degrees of freedom in this model, we can generate the required $CP$ violation in the heavy fermion decays with only a single generation of mediators. One of the distinct features of our scenario is that the bounds from thermalization or washout via gauge interactions typically encountered in the canonical left-right symmetric models do not apply here. Moreover, the heavy mediators can decay to both the left and the right-chiral neutrinos, leading to a cancellation in the resulting baryon asymmetry for decays above the left-right symmetry breaking scale. We discuss ways to avoid this cancellation and show that low scale left-right symmetry breaking above the current collider limits is viable. The right chiral neutrinos also obtain their masses from the seesaw mechanism, and the lightest one turns out to have a sub-eV scale mass. We find that its abundance is consistent with standard cosmology, and it acts as potentially observable dark radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new versions of the Mathematica package FeynCalc and the FeynHelpers add-on that represent an important contribution to the collection of public codes for semi-automatic evaluation of multiloop Feynman diagrams. FeynHelpers enables interfacing between FeynCalc and selected programs routinely used in multiloop calculations such as QGRAF, FIRE, KIRA, FIESTA or pySecDec. In addition to that FeynCalc now supports parallelizing the execution of selected routines on multicore CPUs and can handle tensor integrals with zero Gram determinants where the traditional tensor reduction breaks down.</description>

      <title>How to identify the dead cone in the top-quark jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gluon emission from an energetic heavy quark is suppressed in the forward direction below the angle $\Theta\lesssim m_Q/E$ for a quark of mass $m_Q$ and energy $E$ according to perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) (``dead cone"). Another consequence is the suppression of energetic particles in the jet which has been observed already for c- and b-quark jets. The suppression of the forward particles can be explained by an application of the Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA) of perturbative QCD. In this paper we investigate whether this type of analysis can be carried out also for top-quark jets with the much higher heavy quark mass allowing for QCD tests in this new kinematic regime. The new aspect of this analysis is the finite lifetime of the top quark. We consider for simplicity the decay $t\to b\ell\nu$, where the b-quark radiates gluons as well and partially obscures the dead cone. Guided by the decay amplitude in leading order in $\alpha_s$ we propose a method to separate the radiation by the $\widehat{tb}$ dipole in the decay process which is superimposed to the primary radiation from the $\widehat{t \bar t}$ dipole involving the top-quark dead cone effect. The momentum distributions of partons or charged particles are determined for finite decay angles of the b-quark $\Theta_b$ and extrapolated into forward direction $\Theta_b=0$ where the radiation from the decay process is expected to vanish. This method is successfully tested at the parton level and results obtained for hadrons are compatible with the MLLA relation within an accuracy of around 15\%. Our calculations are carried out with the Pythia 8.3 Monte Carlo Event Generator.</description>

      <title>Dynamical color conductivity of a chiral quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical chromoelectric color conductivity of a chiral plasma has been extracted from one loop gluon self energy by using linear response theory at finite temperature and density. It is shown that due to the P and CP violation the conductivity tensor has an anomalous contribution in addition to the longitudinal and transverse components. We identify this anomalous conductivity as chiral chromomagnetic conductivity. The spectral representations of real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal and transverse conductivities show marginal variations in chiral plasma as compared to the non-chiral plasma. The static limit of chiral chromomagnetic conductivity is found to be independent of medium properties reflecting its topological nature.</description>

      <title>Worth the Effort? An Examination on the Effect of Higher Diligence Calculations of the Sound Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave spectrum arising from using the full velocity profile is well known to differ qualitatively from analytic fits to a broken power law. Former studies have shown that unlike the uncertainties arising from thermal field theory, more diligence in the hydrodynamics can sometimes have limited benefit. However, this was shown in the context of broken power law fits. We test the benefits of some recent calculations in modeling the spectrum, including new developments in adjustments of the low frequency tail to be consistent with causality, but we use the full velocity profile. We find the spectral shape information has a heightened sensitivity to the speed of sound which can be demonstrated analytically, however for our benchmark model this still results in a modest difference. The reason for a heightened sensitivity is because the velocity at the boundary is quite sensitive to the speed of sound, which in turn means a small change to the speed of sound can have a large change to the shape of the velocity profile. Furthermore, even modest changes in the product $\alpha \kappa$ can make non-trivial changes to the shape around the peak. Finally, there are many points where adjusting the infrared behavior to be consistent with causality is affecting the spectrum near its peak. All this implies that the spectrum is sensitive to five thermal parameters rather than four which gives hope that an observation of a gravitational wave spectrum from a first order cosmological phase transition could eventually give even more information about the underlying microphysics responsible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the internal structure of near-threshold states is essential for revealing the nature of exotic hadrons. Motivated by this challenge, we discuss the clustering structures of near-threshold $s$-wave eigenstates using the compositeness, which characterizes the clustering nature of the states. We show that shallow bound states usually possess cluster-dominant structures, while near-threshold narrow resonances are non-cluster-dominant. Through this study, we establish a theoretical foundation for the threshold energy rule, which has been known empirically.</description>

      <title>Constraining particle physics models with gravitational waves from the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Ph.D. thesis, we study the methods to constrain particle physics models using the stochastic GW imprints from cosmological phase transitions (PTs). Beginning with the theory and background, we describe how the GW background from first-order PTs (FOPTs) and topological defects such as domain walls (DWs) can constrain the model parameter space at upcoming GW observatories. The first BSM scenario involves a flavon FOPT in two ultraviolet-complete models of the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism. In both models, for the FN symmetry-breaking scale $v_s = 10^{4-7}\,$GeV, the parameter space is constrained by GWs in upcoming observatories such as BBO, DECIGO, CE, and ET. However, the GW spectrum does not discriminate between the two models. Next, we consider FOPT in the doublet left-right symmetric model (DLRSM) during $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking. For the breaking scale $v_R=20,\,30,\,50\,$TeV, the parameter space can be constrained by GW observations at BBO, FP-DECIGO, and Ultimate DECIGO. A large number of points with detectable GW signals can be ruled out from the precise measurement of the trilinear Higgs coupling at future colliders. Finally, we discuss the GW spectrum generated by DWs formed after the spontaneous breaking of the discrete $\mathcal{P}$-symmetry imposed on DLRSM. Using Bayesian analysis, we fit the 15-year NANOGrav dataset to the GW spectrum from DWs in DLRSM and determine the best-fit values of the DW surface tension and the bias potential. The techniques of this thesis can be applied to other BSM scenarios in the future.</description>

      <title>A non-compact QCD axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmology of an axion that is fundamentally non-compact. During inflation, fluctuations of the effectively massless field populate many QCD vacua, thereby evading conventional isocurvature constraints while generating domain walls -- without accompanying cosmic strings. A small non-QCD contribution to the axion potential is required to trigger the timely collapse of domain walls; as a consequence, a residual amount of CP violation in the strong sector must exist, potentially within reach of planned experiments. Non-compact axions can account for the entirety of the dark matter abundance, and the collapse of domain walls sources a stochastic gravitational-wave background at nanohertz frequencies. Such axion dynamics can be embedded in top-down constructions -- such as Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity -- where the tilting of the axion potential arises automatically.</description>

      <title>Novel Light Dark Matter Detection with Quantum Parity Detector Using Qubit Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and the sensitivity reach of the Qubit-based Light Dark Matter detection experiment. We propose the novel two-chip design to reduce signal dissipation, with quantum parity measurement to enhance single-phonon detection sensitivity. We demonstrate the performance of the detector with full phonon and quasiparticle simulations. The experiment is projected to detect $\gtrsim 30$ meV energy deposition with nearly $100\%$ efficiency and high energy resolution. The sensitivity to $m_\chi\gtrsim 0.01$ MeV dark matter scattering cross section is expected to be advanced by orders of magnitude for both light and heavy mediators, and similar improvements will be achieved for axion and dark photon absorption in the $0.04$-$0.2$ eV mass range.</description>

      <title>On Finite Temperature Quantum Field Theory: From Theoretical Foundations To Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang, the universe existed in an extremely hot, dense state in which particle interactions occurred not in a vacuum but within a thermal medium. Under such conditions, the standard framework of quantum field theory (QFT) requires a finite temperature extension, wherein propagators -- and hence the fundamental structure of the theory -- are modified to reflect thermal background effects. These thermal modifications are central to understanding the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) as a high temperature phase transition, potentially leading to qualitatively different vacuum structures for the Higgs field as the universe cooled. Finite temperature corrections naturally regulate ultraviolet divergences in propagators, hinting at a possible route toward ultraviolet completion. However, these same thermal effects exacerbate infrared pathologies and can lead to imaginary contributions to the effective potential, particularly when analysing metastable or multi-vacuum configurations. Additional theoretical challenges, such as gauge dependence and renormalization scale ambiguity, further obscure the precise characterization of the electroweak phase transition even in minimal extensions of the Standard Model (SM). This review presents the theoretical foundations of finite temperature QFT with an emphasis on how different field species respond to thermal effects, identifying the bosonic sector as the primary source of key theoretical subtleties. We focus particularly on the scalar extension of the SM, which offers a compelling framework for realizing first order electroweak phase transitions, electroweak baryogenesis, and accommodating dark matter candidates depending on the underlying $Z_2$ symmetry structure.</description>

      <title>Non linear Regge trajectories of quarkonia from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a holographic model for quarkonia using the WKB approximation with the Langer correction to properly reproduce nonlinear Regge trajectories of the form $m_n^2 = \beta (n + c_0)^{2/3} + c_1$. This form is expected from previous studies involving the solution of Cornell Potential for heavy quark anti-quark interactions using a model based on the quadratic form of the spinless Salpeter-type equation (QSSE). The model fits experimental masses with very good accuracy. As a by product, the corresponding decay constants also show a reasonable agreement with the results obtained from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Dirac Neutrinos and Gauged Lepton Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the first scotogenic neutrino mass model with gauged lepton number $U(1)_L$, which is spontaneously broken by three units $\Delta L=3$ down to a residual discrete gauge symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_6$. The latter guarantees that neutrinos acquire tiny Dirac masses via a one-loop scotogenic mechanism, simultaneously stabilizing the lightest electrically neutral particle with non-trivial charge under the preserved $\mathbb{Z}_6$ symmetry. In our model there is a scalar particle identified as weakly interacting massive particle dark matter (DM) candidate. We analyzed its compatibility with the existing data on direct DM detection experiments and the DM relic abundance. We also address charged lepton flavor violating decays in our model and find that their predicted rates are within the reach of current experimental sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Renormalization-Group Evolution for the Nucleon Distribution Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine for the first time the two-loop renormalization-group (RG) equation for the nucleon light-cone distribution amplitude, which constitutes the last missing ingredient for the complete next-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to the nucleon form factors in the hard-collinear factorization framework. Applying the conformal expansion for this fundamental nucleon distribution amplitude then enables us to construct an analytic solution that captures the desired scale dependence of phenomenologically interesting series coefficients. Importantly, the two-loop RG evolutions of these central hadronic quantities can bring about noticeable impacts on the corresponding leading-logarithmic results for three sample models of the nucleon distribution amplitude.</description>

      <title>Cosmological consequences of spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics and the $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology provide an incomplete description of our Universe. Both models face challenges, including explaining the nature of dark matter, the origin of the Universe's initial conditions, and the fine-tuning of the Higgs boson mass. This thesis investigates the cosmological implications of spontaneous symmetry breaking to address some of these issues, focusing on theories with a non-trivial vacuum structure. We introduce a novel class of elementary scalars called ''accidents'', which emerge as accidentally flat directions in the vacuum manifold: unlike Nambu-Goldstone boson directions, accident directions are not related to any symmetry. Radiative corrections induce a mass for the accidents that is one-loop suppressed with respect to naive expectations, making them naturally light. We propose that accidents can act as viable dark matter candidates, and as the inflaton driving cosmic inflation. We construct a model of hybrid inflation in which the inflaton potential is an accident direction and is naturally flat. In models of accident inflation where the vacuum manifold has a non-trivial topology, cosmic strings and domain walls form after the end of inflation. Such topological defects generate a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Finally, we investigate the cosmological production of dark magnetic monopoles. Focusing on 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles from SO(3)$\rightarrow$SO(2) symmetry breaking, we explore both second-order and first-order phase transitions, and we identify the regions of parameter space where the monopole relic density matches the one of dark matter. This model also features stable massive gauge bosons. We find that the relic density of dark gauge bosons is always far larger than the one of monopoles, concluding that dark monopoles cannot constitute a sizeable fraction of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD at large densities exhibits a moat regime in the scalar-pseudoscalar sector. The resolution of its dynamics is pivotal for the access to the onset of new phases including the potential critical endpoint of QCD. In this work we present the first selfconsistent analysis of this regime with the functional renormalisation group approach to QCD. We map out the moat regime, including a first analysis of potential inhomogeneous instabilities at baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\gtrsim 600$ MeV on the chiral crossover line.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Quantum Field Theory and Axion Electrodynamics in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudoscalar particles introduced initially as a solution to the Strong CP problem in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and they also arise naturally in a broad class of low-energy compactifications of string theory. Astrophysical, cosmological, and laboratory constraints require axions to be extremely weakly coupled to Standard Model particles, making them viable dark matter candidates .This PhD thesis presents original results developed over three years of research, focusing on axion cosmology and axion electrodynamics. These topics address the production of axions and their associated topological defects in the early Universe, as well as the interactions of axions with Standard Model particles. The analysis combines methods from non-equilibrium quantum field theory and quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. After reviewing the foundations of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and cosmology, the thesis introduces the Strong CP problem and the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, including the PQWW axion model and its invisible extensions. Ultraviolet completions of QCD axion theories are discussed in both field-theoretic and extra-dimensional frameworks. A significant part of the thesis is devoted to axion electrodynamics, where a classical axion background modifies Maxwell's equations and electromagnetic observables. The non-equilibrium dynamics of self-interacting axion fields coupled to the Standard Model or to a dark sector are also studied using the two-particle-irreducible effective action, and applied to pre- and post-inflationary cosmological scenarios, yielding new insights and preliminary constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization, we investigate the relativistic corrections to the production of double $B_c$ mesons in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. The study covers center-of-mass energies from the production threshold up to $2m_Z$, considering both the photon and $Z^0$-boson propagated processes. We find that the relativistic corrections are significant, with the corresponding $K$ factors of approximately 0.6. The azimuthal asymmetry, angular distribution, and transverse momentum distribution are also presented.</description>

      <title>Order-$v^4$ corrections to heavy quark fragmentation to S-wave heavy quarkonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) factorization, we compute the $\mathcal{O}(v^{4})$ relativistic corrections to the fragmentation of a heavy quark into the color-singlet $^{1}S_{0}^{[1]}$ and $^{3}S_{1}^{[1]}$ quarkonium states. Using the Collins--Soper definition of the fragmentation function, we reproduce the known $\mathcal{O}(v^{2})$ results. We find that the $\mathcal{O}(v^{4})$ correction gives a positive contribution relative to the leading order result over a wide range of the light-cone momentum fraction $z$, while its magnitude remains much smaller than that of the $\mathcal{O}(v^{2})$ correction. This behavior indicates a good convergence of the NRQCD relativistic expansion in this process. We further extend the calculation to the fragmentation functions in the unequal-mass case at $\mathcal{O}(v^{4})$ and obtain the corresponding analytical expressions.</description>

      <title>A possible solution to the gallium anomaly moving beyond the leptonic wave function factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over thirty years, a $\sim20\%$ deficit, now exceeding $5\sigma$, has persisted between measured and predicted neutrino capture rates on $^{71}$Ga, as observed in radioactive source experiments (namely GALLEX, SAGE, and more recently BEST) using $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar. This long-standing discrepancy, referred to as the gallium anomaly, has posed a significant challenge to our understanding of both experimental methods and theoretical predictions. In this work, we revisit the theoretical calculation of the neutrino capture cross-section by moving beyond the standard treatment of the leptonic wave functions, revealing limitations in the commonly used factorization approach based on the detailed balance principle. Incorporating phenomenologically constrained Gamow-Teller transition densities, able to correctly reproduce the precisely measured half-life of $^{71}{\textrm{Ge}}$, we find that the revised cross-section can be significantly reduced, potentially resolving the gallium anomaly without invoking new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to axions, gravitational waves (GW) can induce oscillating electromagnetic fields inside electromagnetic cavities. We explore their experimental sensitivity to monochromatic and non-monochromatic GW signals, using the total deposited energy as a primary measure. Focusing on cylindrical and spherical cavities, we present the coupling coefficients of GWs to the dominant electromagnetic resonances in transverse-traceless gauge, which is most appropriate in this regime. By considering the superposition of degenerate modes, we further examine their angular sensitivity. In addition, we calculate the response of a spherical cavity to non-monochromatic GWs emitted by primordial black hole mergers. We find that, for transient signals, a high quality factor with $Q \gtrsim 10^5$ does not necessarily enhance experimental sensitivity. In fact, even in the most optimistic scenario, only mergers within the solar system yield an observable energy deposit in the cavity.</description>

      <title>Mass and coupling magnetic field dependence in a scalar theory with charged bosons from an environmentally friendly renormalization group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the running of the mass of a neutral boson and of its self-coupling in a simple model describing the self-interaction of three scalars, one of them neutral and the other two electrically charged, subject to the effects of a magnetic field, as functions of the field strength, at one-loop order. We resort to the Environmentally Friendly Renormalization Group approach, where the flow variable is taken as that describing the environmental conditions, in this case the strength of the magnetic field. We find the magnetic field dependent mass and coupling beta functions and use them to set up the differential equations satisfied by the neutral scalar mass and coupling. We solve the resulting system of coupled equations both numerically, and also analytically in the small-mass approximation. We find that the neutral scalar mass increases, while the coupling decreases with increasing field strength. The study is intended to set up the ideas to later use them in more sophisticated theories such as QED and QCD.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints on the cold equation of state of the strongly interacting matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At present, the only experimental access to the properties of cold, dense strongly interacting matter is provided by astrophysical observations. Neutron stars are the only known systems in the Universe that reach densities several times higher than normal nuclear density at nearly zero temperature, making them unique laboratories for studying dense matter. Since most neutron-star observables are sensitive to the equation of state (EOS), observational data place stringent constraints on the EOS of strongly interacting matter. In this work, we investigate constraints arising from the mass of the heaviest observed neutron star (a black widow pulsar), perturbative QCD calculations at asymptotically high densities, NICER mass-radius measurements, and the tidal deformability inferred from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. We parametrize the EOS and allow its parameters to vary freely, using observational data to constrain the admissible parameter space. We find that neutron-star observations significantly restrict the EOS of dense strongly interacting matter. While NICER has already provided measurements for five pulsars, the associated uncertainties remain relatively large. In contrast, the existence of very massive neutron stars and constraints on the tidal deformability emerge as particularly powerful probes of the EOS.</description>

      <title>Dissipative cosmology with $\Lambda$ from the first law of thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We phenomenologically derive a cosmological model that includes both a cosmological constant term $\Lambda/3$ and a dissipative driving term $\beta (2 H^{2} + \dot{H})$ by applying the first law of thermodynamics to matter creation cosmology. Here $H$, $\dot{H}$, and $\beta$ are the Hubble parameter, the time derivative of $H$, and a non-negative dimensionless coefficient, respectively. The dissipative term is proportional to the Ricci scalar curvature, suggesting that the dynamic creation pressure has the same dependence. We examine the model's background evolution in the late universe and its horizon thermodynamics. The present model supports a transition from a decelerating universe to an accelerating universe when $\beta &lt;0.5$. The second law of thermodynamics is always satisfied on the horizon, and maximization of entropy is satisfied in the final stage. We examine constraints on the present model using observed Hubble parameter data and the transitional and thermodynamic constraints and find that a weakly dissipative universe with $\Lambda$ is likely favored and consistent with our Universe. We also discuss irreversible entropy due to adiabatic particle creation, assuming a holographic-like matter creation cosmology.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of a high intensity, superthermal muonium beam for gravity and laser spectroscopy experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universality of free fall, a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of gravity, has so far only been tested with neutral composite states of first-generation Standard Model (SM) particles, such as atoms or neutrons, and, most recently, antihydrogen. Extending these gravitational measurements to other sectors of the SM requires the formation of neutral bound states using higher-generation, unstable particles. Muonium, the bound state of an antimuon ($\mu^+$) and an electron ($e^-$), offers the possibility to probe gravity with second-generation (anti)leptons, in the absence of the strong interaction. However, the short $\mu^+$ lifetime ($\tau_{\mu}\approx 2.2~\mu$s) and the existing diffuse thermal muonium sources rendered such measurements unfeasible. Here, we report the synthesis of a high-brightness muonium beam, extracted from a thin layer of superfluid helium by exploiting its chemical potential and unique transport properties. The mean longitudinal velocity (${v}\approx 2180~\rm{m/s}$) and narrow distribution (${\Delta v}&lt; 150 ~\rm{m/s}$) of the atoms characterise a superthermal beam, while yields are similar to the highest intensity diffuse sources. This new beam is expected to enable muonium interferometry and a percent-level measurement of its gravitational acceleration, providing the first direct test of the Weak Equivalence Principle with second-generation (anti)matter. Its unprecedented brightness also opens the way to sub-kHz 1S-2S spectroscopy, enabling precise determination of the muon mass and stringent tests of bound-state quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Microlensing Black Hole Shadows-II: Constraining Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter using the photon rings of M87 and Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resolution of photon rings of Sgr~A$^*$ and M87 is the next milestone of upcoming EHT-like interferometries. We extend the formalism developed in our previous work~\cite{Verma:2023hes} to constrain primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter using microlensing-induced distortions of black hole shadows. Building upon the theoretical framework for microlensing of photon rings, we apply this methodology to both Sgr A* and M87, considering multiple PBH populations: (i) PBH dark matter spikes around central supermassive black holes, (ii) NFW halo contributions in the Milky Way and M87 galaxies, and (iii) foreground Milky Way PBH dark matter affecting M87* observations. The microlensing signal manifests as a time-dependent asymmetry and deformation of the photon ring, providing the most sensitive observable for lensing effects. We assess the detectability of these signatures with future EHT-like interferometers. Our analysis reveals that M87* provides the strongest constraints on PBH dark matter. We show that the absence of photon-ring asymmetries in observations with angular resolution of order $0.1\,\mu{\rm as}$ can constrain PBHs in the mass range $10^{-5}\,M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$, with maximal sensitivity near $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{3}\,M_\odot$, for PBH dark matter fractions as small as $f_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Status of the Muon g-2/EDM Experiment at J-PARC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Muon g-2/EDM Experiment at J-PARC will employ a novel way to measure the muon magnetic anomaly, a_mu = (g-2)_mu/2, by using a low-emittance beam of positive muons stored in a compact muon storage magnet. The experimental method includes new technologies such as a three-dimensional spiral injection, an MRI-type storage magnet with superb field uniformity, and a positron tracking detector. The expected systematic uncertainty will be at the same level as that of the Fermilab Muon g-2 experiment, providing an important cross-check of the "storage-ring method" employed at BNL and Fermilab. I will present the current status of the experiment, ongoing tests and design optimizations, and the plans for improvements of the experimental precision.</description>

      <title>Studying nuclear medium modification using the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule is a generic relation that has been used to make significant contributions to research in hadronic physics. It connects the spin-dependent cross-section for photoproduction off a particle to the squared ratio of the particle's anomalous magnetic moment and its mass, $(\kappa/M)^2$. Thus, for a nucleon embedded in a nucleus, the sum rule relates the cross-section to $\kappa/M$ averaged quadratically over the nucleons comprising the nucleus. This quadratic averaging can be used to constrain the mechanism responsible for the medium modification of the nucleon. We also point out that the global properties of the embedded nucleon like its axial charge, mass or magnetic moment are observables measurable through sum rules.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy models in light of the latest observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study several models and parameterizations of dynamical dark energy (DE) that have been studied already in the past, in conjunction with the recently proposed model $w$XCDM, the running vacuum model (RVM) with and without a threshold at $z=1$ and two variants of it, the RRVM and the ``flipped RVM'', and compare them all with the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model and the popular $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization. We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w_0w_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced. Finally, we discuss the ability of the various models to explain the data by performing an analysis of their effective equation-of-state parameters and corresponding evolution of their dark energy densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light scalars that couple to leptons are common figures in beyond the Standard Model endeavors. Considering a scalar that has universal and couplings to leptons only, we compute this leptophilic scalar contribution to the $e^{-}e^{+} \rightarrow \tau^{+}\tau^{-} S $ production cross section with $S \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})$. We later compare the expected signal with recent data from the BELLE collaboration collected near the resonance $\Upsilon(4S)$ with $\mathcal{L}=626 fb^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity to place limits on the couplings-mass plane for the $4$~MeV-$6.5$~GeV mass range. We then extended this analysis to a more general one $e^{-}e^{+} \rightarrow {\ell}^{+}{\ell}^{-} S$ production cross section where $\ell=e,\mu,\tau$ with $S \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})$, showing that BELLE constitutes an excellent laboratory for light scalars, where can be derived constraints stronger than those derived stemming from the g-2 of the electron or muon.</description>

      <title>Parton helicities at arbitrary x and Q2 in double-logarithmic approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Description of spin-dependent hadronic processes at high energies in terms of parton helicities is a both effective and technically convenient means. In the present paper, we obtain explicit expressions for the parton helicities when either Collinear or KT forms of QCD Factorization are used. Starting our studies with calculation of the helicities in the double-logarithmic approximation (DLA) in the region of small x and large Q^2, we generalize the results in order to obtain formulae valid at arbitrary x and Q^2. We argue against using Collinear Factorization, when the parton orbital angular momenta are accounted for, and prove that KT Factorization should be used instead. We also consider in detail the small-x asymptotics of the parton helicities, compare them with the DGLAP-asymptotics in LO,NLO, etc and prove that the DGLAP asymptotics are less singular at small x than the Regge asymptotics</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization and spin correlations in diboson systems serve as powerful tools for precision tests and searches for new physics. Recently, interpreting these observables through the lens of quantum information, for instance by examining whether the diboson systems exhibit entanglement, has introduced a compelling new dimension to these studies. We analyze the angular coefficients in the processes $pp\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ and $h\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$, incorporating higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections. Guided by the fundamental properties of the spin density matrix, we assess the stability of the two-qutrit interpretation under radiative effects. For the $pp \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ process, NLO QCD corrections preserve the two-qutrit structure but weaken entanglement indicators, an effect that can be partially mitigated by jet binning. In contrast, electroweak corrections introduce non-factorizable contributions that modify the quantum properties of the system. While these effects can be largely depleted by selecting events with a double-resonant $ZZ$ structure, such a kinematic handle is not available for Higgs decays. In the $h \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ channel, singly-resonant NLO electroweak corrections substantially distort the angular coefficients, challenging the description of these events as a two-qutrit system.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the recently published analytic results for unpolarized and polarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. These expressions for the hard scattering coefficients contain case distinctions in the kinematic $(x,z)$ plane splitting the analytic result in four regions. By re-expressing the coefficient functions in terms of single-valued polylogarithms we remove these case distinctions and can present a unified result valid in the entire kinematic range of SIDIS. This reduces the length of the overall expressions by 30% to 60%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supercooled phase transitions, as predicted, e.g., in near-conformal and confining extensions of the Standard Model (SM), are established sources of strong stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). In this work, we investigate another facet of such transitions: their significant and largely uncharted impact on gravitational wave spectra originating from independent cosmological sources. Focusing on gravitational waves produced by a metastable cosmic string network, we show that an intervening supercooled phase, initiating thermal inflation, can reshape and suppress the high-frequency part of the spectrum. This mechanism reopens regions of string parameter space previously excluded by LIGO's null results, while remaining compatible with the nanohertz SGWB signal reported by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The resulting total spectrum typically exhibits a dual-component structure, sourced by both string decay and the phase transition itself, rendering the scenario observationally distinctive. We systematically classify the viable parameter space and identify regions accessible to upcoming detectors such as Advanced LIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Constraining color-charge effects of partonic energy loss with jet axis-based inclusive jet substructure measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the color-charge dependence of parton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium and the associated relative modifications of quark and gluon jet fractions compared to vacuum, using jet axis decorrelation observables. Recent CMS jet axis decorrelation measurements in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV are interpreted using Pythia simulations with varied quark/gluon jet compositions and emulated color-charge dependent energy loss. A template-fit procedure is employed to estimate the limits on gluon jet fractions in the published CMS data and average shift in jet momentum due to quenching for quark- and gluon-initiated jets traversing the QGP. The extracted gluon jet fractions and the estimated quark and gluon energy losses based on this study of jet axis decorrelations are found to be consistent with other model calculations based on inclusive observables. This work illustrates the use of jet substructure measurements for providing constraints on the color-charge dependence of parton energy loss and offers valuable insights for jet quenching models.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition, Gravitational Waves and Collider Probes in Multi-Scalar Dark Matter Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study scalar singlet extensions of the Standard Model (SM), focusing on scenarios where dark matter (DM) is stabilized by a \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) symmetry. In the minimal single-scalar extension of the SM, only a narrow region near the Higgs resonance remains viable, requiring small portal couplings in order to simultaneously satisfy the observed relic abundance and comply with the most recent direct detection limits from the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ-2024) and XENON1T experiments. To address this limitation, we extend the dark sector by introducing additional real singlet scalars. In both two- and three-singlet extensions, we demonstrate that the observed dark matter relic density can be accommodated with larger Higgs portal couplings. These couplings significantly impact early-Universe dynamics by enhancing the strength of the electroweak phase transition. Both the two- and three-singlet scalar extensions can induce a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, generating stochastic gravitational waves potentially observable at future space-based detectors such as LISA and DECIGO. Notably, the three-singlet scenario induce an even stronger transition compared to the two-singlet case, enhancing the gravitational wave signal strength. Our results highlight the potential of extended scalar sectors as testable frameworks connecting dark matter and gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Natural Ultralight Dark Matter: The Quadratic Twin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is uniquely accessible to tabletop experiments such as clocks and interferometers, and its search has been the focus of a vast experimental effort. However, the scalar ULDM mass is not protected from radiative corrections, and the entirety of the parameter space within reach of experiments suffers from a severe naturalness problem. In this paper, we propose a new twin mechanism that protects the mass of the scalar ULDM. Our scalar ULDM is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson with quadratic couplings to the Standard Model (SM) and to a twin copy of the SM, with a mirror $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry exchanging each SM particle with its twin. Due to the mirror symmetry, the leading-order mass correction is quadratic in the (tiny) coupling while the linear order is canceled. This opens up vast regions of parameter space for natural quadratically coupled ultralight dark matter, within the sensitivity of existing and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Decay and lifetime of oscillons coupled to an external scalar field: Insights from instability band analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in real scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They are considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage after inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their lifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between the inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic reheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single oscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By numerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the inhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance behavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the oscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across different regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we show that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too limited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our simulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of the external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical energy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not necessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of strong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons can remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential implications for their role in cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>Scalar-glueball-mediated scale-anomaly dominance of the confining pressure of the pion in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the energy density and the stress distribution inside the pion derived from gravitational form factors in top-down holographic QCD. In particular, we show that the dominance of the scale anomaly in the confining pressure, previously observed in the instant form for the nucleon, also holds for the pion in the light-front form. Furthermore, we find that in large-$N_c$ QCD described by this approach, the scalar glueball plays a mediating role in transmitting the confining pressure. These findings support the universal role of the scale anomaly in the stability of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Scale-anomaly-induced binding pressure in hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of the QCD scale anomaly on the internal pressure distribution of hadrons is studied based on the trace-traceless decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor. Using recent model-independent results of gravitational form factors as input, the pressure distributions of both pions and nucleons are analyzed in the instant form and the light-front form. It is found that, in all cases, the scale anomaly dominantly generates the negative binding pressure. This result suggests that the phenomenon is a universal feature, independent of models, types of hadrons, and the choice of form.</description>

      <title>Neutrino magnetic moment in the doublet-singlet Leptoquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition magnetic moment for Majorana neutrinos is studied in a simple extension of the Standard Model. This extension incorporates two scalar Leptoquarks $S_1$ and $\widetilde{R}_2$ with quantum numbers $(\bar{3},1,1/3)$ and $(3,2,1/6)$ respectively. It is found that these Leptoquarks generate a sizable transition magnetic moment, particularly when the quark bottom is running in the loop. For our analysis of the parameter space, we include the latest measurement of the muon magnetic moment and combine it with the experimental constraint on the branching ratio Br$(\tau \to \mu \gamma)$. We found that, despite the recent agreement on the $(g-2)_\mu$ value, large values for Leptoquark Yukawa couplings are allowed due to a degeneracy in the parameters. Additionally, we explore how the Leptoquark model addresses the anomalies observed in the ratios of semileptonic $B$ meson decays, $R_{D^{(*)}}$. We determine that the restrictions derived from our analysis are consistent with the most recent experimental limits reported by the XENONnT and LUX-ZEPLIN collaborations. This conclusion is based on our evaluation of the transition magnetic moment from muon neutrino to tau neutrino, focusing on the allowed region for the Leptoquark Yukawa couplings.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decay and form factors of $\Omega_b^- \rightarrow \Omega_c^0\,e\,\bar{\nu_e}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay $\Omega_b^- \rightarrow \Omega_c^0\,e\,\bar{\nu_e}$ within the framework of the Hypercentral Constituent Quark Model (HCQM). The ground state masses of the involved baryons are evaluated by numerically solving the six-dimensional hyperradial Schr\"{o}dinger equation, incorporating both hyper-Coulomb and linear confinement potentials along with spin-dependent interactions. The Heavy Quark Effective Field Theory (HQET) form factors are computed up to the subleading order, incorporating $1/m_Q$ corrections that account for finite mass effects beyond the heavy quark symmetry limit. These form factors are then employed to analyse the heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay rate via helicity formalism. Our results for the decay width and branching ratio are compared with those from various theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Inert Doublet Model at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze experimental exclusion bounds that have been derived within a specific new physics realization, the two Higgs-doublet model with a pseudoscalar singlet (2HDMa), and their application to a different model, the Inert Doublet Model (IDM), that features the same final state. In this context, we discuss the sensitivity of the ATLAS search for the 2HDMa in final states with leptons and missing energy. We demonstrate that, with cuts optimized for a specific model topology, other new physics scenarios with larger rates might yet escape detection. We also give an update on constraints from vector boson fusion production of the Standard Model-like scalar and subsequent invisible decay from full Run 2 data on the parameter space of the IDM, with a special emphasis on the off-shell region, as well as a search that specifically concentrates on soft lepton final states.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Electroweak Two-Loop Corrections to Drell-Yan and Related Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a complete calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) electroweak fermionic corrections to fermion-pair production processes, where "fermionic" refers to contributions with closed fermion loops. We did this via a semi-numerical technique that used dispersion relations for the fermion sub-loop in two-loop box and vertex diagrams and dispersion relations and Feynman parameters for vertex diagrams with fermionic triangle sub-loops. UV and IR divergences are treated with suitable subtraction terms. We present numerical results for the cross-sections of $e^+e^-\to \mu^+\mu^-/u\bar{u}/d\bar{d}$ and differential distributions at representative center-of-mass energies. The NNLO corrections are found to modify the NLO cross-section on the order of 1%.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Next-to-Leading-Order Corrections to the $B \to \pi $ Form Factors from Light-Cone Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By incorporating the available leading-power results at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ and next-to-leading-power corrections at tree level, we improve the precision of the theoretical predictions for $B\to\pi$ form factors to the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2\beta_0)$ level in the large-recoil region using the light-cone sum rule approach with $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes. We find that the QCD corrections at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2\beta_0)$ contribute approximately $+6.1\%$ compared to the tree-level result. Combining the light-cone sum rule predictions in the large-recoil region, lattice QCD results in the small-recoil region, we perform a combined fit for the $B\to\pi$ form factors across the full kinematic range. Utilizing these form factors, we calculate the branching ratios, lepton-flavor-universality ratio $R_\pi$, forward-backward asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{\rm FB}$, flat term $\mathcal{F}_{\rm H}$ and polarization asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{\rm \lambda_\ell}$ of $B\to\pi\mu\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ and $B\to\pi\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decays. Using the experimentally measured $q^2$-binned differential branching ratios of $B\to\pi\mu\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ decay as input, employing the Bourrely-Caprini-Lellouch parametrization, we extract the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{ub}| = 3.73(14) \times 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Search potential for direct slepton pair production at the CEPC with $\sqrt{s}$ = 360 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03600v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is designed to operate at the key center-of-mass energies: 91.2 GeV as a Z factory for precision Z boson studies,$\approx$ 160 GeV at the threshold for W boson pair production, and 240 GeV as a Higgs factory for copious Higgs boson production. It can be upgraded to 360 GeV (CEPC-360GeV) to enable top quark-antiquark ($t\bar{t}$) pair production. Beyond enabling high-precision measurements of the Standard Model (SM), CEPC-360GeV is uniquely position to perform searches for new physics beyond the SM (BSM) physics, serving as a valuable complement to hadron colliders. This paper presents a sensitivity study on the direct pair production of staus and smuons at CEPC with $\sqrt{s}$ = 360 GeV, conducted via full Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Under the assumptions of integrated luminosity 1.0 ab^{-1} and a flat 5% systematic uncertainty, CEPC-360GeV could potentially discover the combined production of left-handed and right-handed staus up to a mass of 170 GeV (if they exist), or up to 169 GeV for pure left-handed staus and 162 GeV for pure right-handed staus. For direct smuon production, the discovery potential reaches up to 178 GeV under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>A Linear Collider Vision for the Future of Particle Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19983v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we review the physics opportunities at linear $e^+e^-$ colliders with a special focus on high centre-of-mass energies and beam polarisation, take a fresh look at the various accelerator technologies available or under development and, for the first time, discuss how a facility first equipped with a technology mature today could be upgraded with technologies of tomorrow to reach much higher energies and/or luminosities. In addition, we will discuss detectors and alternative collider modes, as well as opportunities for beyond-collider experiments and R\&amp;D facilities as part of a linear collider facility (LCF). The material of this paper will support all plans for $e^+e^-$ linear colliders and additional opportunities they offer, independently of technology choice or proposed site, as well as R\&amp;D for advanced accelerator technologies. This joint perspective on the physics goals, early technologies and upgrade strategies has been developed by the LCVision team based on an initial discussion at LCWS2024 in Tokyo and a follow-up at the LCVision Community Event at CERN in January 2025. It heavily builds on decades of achievements of the global linear collider community, in particular in the context of CLIC and ILC.</description>

      <title>Dark scalar reinterpretation of searches for Higgs boson decays into long-lived particles at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a reinterpretation of selected ATLAS and CMS searches for Higgs boson decays into long-lived particles (LLPs) within the scalar portal framework, where the standard model is extended by a light scalar that mixes with the Higgs boson. Using public HEPData results, we evaluate the sensitivity of several experimental strategies targeting different final states. The analysis shows how published searches probe complementary regions of the model parameter space, and it provides a comparative assessment of their coverage. The study also identifies the existing gaps in phase space coverage and highlights key areas for future improvement in LLP searches, which will be crucial to maximize the discovery potential for exotic decays of the Higgs boson into LLPs. Finally, we extrapolate the constraints to the integrated luminosity of the High-Luminosity LHC under different assumptions and compare them with the projected sensitivities of proposed dedicated LLP experiments at CERN, showing that these experiments will further extend the experimental reach independently of the assumed extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Quarkonia collectivity in large collision systems with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quarkonium production is one of the golden probes to study the quark--gluon plasma (QGP). Among many observables, the measurement of azimuthal anisotropies in quarkonium production sheds light on the collective behavior of heavy-flavor particles in a strongly interacting medium. In particular, the measurements of the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of quarkonia in Pb--Pb collisions at the LHC provide us direct evidence of heavy quark thermalization in the QGP. In these proceedings, new results of inclusive $\mathrm{J/\psi}$ elliptic flow measurement in Pb--Pb collisions carried out by the ALICE collaboration in Run 3 using three methods including event-plane, scalar-product and multi-particle correlation (cumulant) will be presented. The method of cumulant will give access to the $\mathrm{J/\psi}$ flow fluctuations at forward rapidity. Alongside the new flow measurements of $\mathrm{J/\psi}$, new results of $\mathrm{\Upsilon}(1S)$ flow measurement at forward rapidity in ALICE Run 3 will be presented as well with comparison to model calculations.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic Footprints of Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel cosmographic framework to trace the late-time kinematics of the Universe without assuming any underlying dynamics. The method relies on generalized Pad\'e-$(2,1)$ expansions around arbitrary pivot redshifts, which, compared to state-of-the-art calculations, reduce truncation errors by up to two orders of magnitude at high redshift and yield more precise constraints by defining cosmographic parameters exactly where the data lie. This avoids extrapolations, mitigates degeneracies, and enables a clean disentangling of their effects. Using the latest low-redshift datasets, we center the generalized expansion in multiple bins across $z\in[0,1]$ and obtain precise constraints on the redshift evolution of cosmographic parameters. We find that all key parameters deviate from their $\Lambda$CDM predictions in a redshift-dependent way that can be naturally explained within dynamical Dark Energy scenarios. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ follows a redshift evolution consistent with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization, while the generalized $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows deviations of up to $\sim4\sigma$ from the constant $\Lambda$CDM expectation, closely matching the CPL predictions. Taken together, these results point to footprints of dynamical Dark Energy in the kinematics of the Universe at $z\lesssim 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this chapter we introduce the $\theta$-dependence and the topological properties of QCD, features of the strongly interacting sector which give rise to the strong CP problem in the more general context of the Standard Model of particle physics. We discuss the analytical approaches that can be used to obtain qualitative, or in some cases quantitative, information on the $\theta$-dependence of QCD and QCD-like models, discussing their range of validity and comparing their predictions with the numerical results obtained by means of lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Covariance of Scattering Amplitudes from Counting Carefully</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invariance of on-shell scattering amplitudes under field redefinitions is a well known property in field theory that corresponds to covariance of on-shell amputated connected functions. In recent years there have been great efforts to define a formalism in which the covariance is manifest at all stages of calculation, mainly resorting to geometrical interpretations. In this work covariance is analysed using combinatorial methods relying only on the properties of the tree level effective action, without referring to specific formulations of the Lagrangian. We provide an explicit proof of covariance of on-shell connected functions and of the existence of covariant Feynman rules and we derive an explicitly covariant closed formula for tree level on-shell connected functions with any number of external legs.</description>

      <title>Modifications in clusterization procedures for heavy-ion collisions: minimum spanning tree, simulated annealing, coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new open-source cluster finding library ''Common Clusterization Library'' (CCL) is proposed to describe the clusters production when applied to the transport codes. The new library was applied to the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics approach to be comparable with the established and well known MST and SACA implementations on the exactly same set of the events. The presented procedures were tested with rapidity density distributions and complex observables like $\langle M_{imf} \rangle$ and $\langle Z_{\text{max}} \rangle$ vs $Z_{bound}2$ at the energies of ALADiN and NA49 experiments. An improvement to the simulated annealing chain is proposed to reduce the computational time. The new stable clusters tracking algorithm for the ''lost'' cluster recovering is presented. The results of the ''box-like'' coalescence procedure and a mixed method which incorporates the coalescence algorithm steps and the negative binding energy criteria are presented. The difference between the Helium-3 found by the MST-based cluster finding procedure and the coalescence algorithm applied on the exactly same set of events and baryons is shown for the first time.</description>

      <title>Two-point correlators in de Sitter-prepared states with bra-ket wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the finiteness of de Sitter (dS) horizon entropy, we study how "bra-ket wormholes" modify correlation functions in gravitationally prepared states. Euclidean wormhole saddles in gravitational path integrals can generate non-factorizing contributions to correlation functions, as in replica-wormhole explanation of the Page curve and bra-ket-wormhole restoration of strong subadditivity. By defining 'time' variables and computing observables in a flat region attached to the dS boundary, we evaluate bra-ket wormhole contributions to scalar two-point functions and find late-time transitions in the dominant saddle, accompanied by the ramp-and-plateau behavior of correlations and the characteristic timescale comparable to the fast scrambling. Each observable is consistent with `complementarity', in the sense that wormhole effects are distinguishable only at late respective times. Consistencies are based upon the interplay of (i) inflationary horizon exit and re-entry, (ii) enhancement of correlations at small comoving momentum by wormhole contributions, (iii) a competition between mode counting and topological suppression that drives a transition to wormhole dominance, which naturally yields the fast scrambling timescale, and (iv) irreducible errors by cosmic variance in early CMB-like observations. To clearly interpret in terms of entropy and chaotic nature of dS, one needs a more complete mechanism of wormhole stabilization.</description>

      <title>Drell-Yan at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photon is arguably the most universally important particle across all fields of physics. Despite its status as a fundamental particle, at high energies the photon can be seen as a hadronic source of partons. The partonic content of the photon is very poorly constrained compared to that of the proton, with photon PDF uncertainties typically one or two orders of magnitude larger than their proton counterparts, despite the fact that its source, the $\gamma\to q\bar{q}$ splitting, is perturbatively calculable. The high luminosity, excellent particle identification, and far-backward electron tagging capabilities of the Electron-Ion Collider make it an ideal environment for studying photon parton distribution functions. Similar to the $p+p$ or $\pi+p$ systems, photoproduction at the EIC can be thought of as two parton distributions colliding. One of the most powerful processes in such collisions is production of lepton pairs, i.e. $h+p\rightarrow l^+l^-+X$, known as the Drell--Yan process. This process has the ability to access for the first time the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions of the photon. The transversely polarized proton beam of the EIC additionally provides a possible means of accessing the transversity distribution of the proton without relying on fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the spin/anisotropy of the CCOs of Cassiopeia A, Vela Jr. and G347.3-0.5 and a single surviving continuous gravitational wave candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out the deepest and broadest search for continuous gravitational-wave signals with frequencies between 20-1500 Hz, from three neutron stars at the center of the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A, Vela Jr., and G347.3-0.5. This search was made possible by the computing power shared by thousands of Einstein@Home volunteers. After the initial Einstein@Home search, we perform a multi-stage follow-up of the most promising $\approx$ 45 million signal candidates. In the last stages, we use independent data to further investigate the remaining candidates from the previous stages. We set the most stringent constraints to date on the gravitational-wave amplitude, equatorial ellipticity, r-mode saturation amplitude, and -- for the first time -- the neutron-star crustal anisotropy. For spin periods lower than 2 ms we constrain the ellipticity to be smaller than $4\times 10^{-7}$ for all targets. We exclude the crustal anisotropy to be smaller than $5\times 10^{-3}$ for spin periods between 1.3-100 ms. Only one candidate -- from the low frequency G347.3 search -- survives all follow-ups. We illustrate properties of this candidate. Investigations on new data will aid in clarifying its nature. Such ``new" data exists and would be optimal for this purpose, but they are not publicly accessible at the time of writing.</description>
