      <title>Identifying Halos in Cosmological Simulations with Continuous Wavelet Analysis: The 2D Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across spatial and scale domain simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method to identify halos and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin with the generation of four pseudo-2D datasets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. We then calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional Friends-of-Friends (FOF) method shows that our CWT-identified halos, while containing slightly fewer particles, have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. Our identification scheme operates with a linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, suggesting its suitability for analyzing significantly larger datasets in the future.</description>

      <title>The Digitization of Photographic Spectra in the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory Plate Collection with Commercial Scanners: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial flatbed scanners have the potential to deliver a quick and efficient means of capturing the scientific content of spectra recorded on photographic plates. We discuss the digitization of selected spectra in the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (DAO) photographic plate collection with commercial scanners. In this pilot study, emphasis is placed on assessing if the information on the plates can be recovered using Epson V800 and 12000XL scanners; the more complicated issues associated with the shortcomings of photographic materials, such as correcting for nonlinearity, are deferred to a future study. Spectra of Vega that were recorded over ~4 decades with the DAO 1.8 meter telescope are examined. These spectra sample a range of photographic emulsions, plate preparation techniques, calibration information, observing techniques, and spectrograph configuration. A scanning density of 2400 elements per inch recovers information in the spectra. Differences in the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the two scanners are found, with the Epson 12000XL having a superior MTF. Comparisons with a CCD spectrum of Vega confirm that moderately weak features are faithfully recovered in photographic spectra that have been digitized with the 12000XL scanner. The importance of scanning the full plate to cover the light profile of the target and calibration information is emphasized. Lessons learned from these experiments are also presented.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Streamlining Time-Domain and Multi-Messenger Astronomy Follow-Up Infrastructure at Keck Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With active time-domain surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility, the anticipated Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and multi-messenger experiments such as LIGO/VIRGO/KANGRA for gravitational wave detection and IceCube for high-energy neutrino events, there is a new era in both time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy. The Astro2020 decadal survey highlights effectively responding to these astronomical alerts in a timely manner as a priority, and thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a seamless follow-up infrastructure at existing facilities that are capable of following up on detections at the survey depths. At the W. M. Keck Observatory (WMKO), we are actively constructing critical infrastructure, aimed at facilitating the Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) trigger, optimizing observational planning, streamlining data acquisition, and enhancing data product accessibility. In this document, we provide an overview of these developing services and place them in context of existing observatory infrastructure like the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) and Data Services Initiative (DSI).</description>

      <title>Echo-free quality factor of a multilayer axion haloscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a methodology to determine the quality factor ($Q$) in implementations of the so-called dielectric haloscope, a new concept of wavy dark matter detector equipped with a multilayered resonator. An anechoic chamber enables the observation of the resonance frequency and its amplitude for an unlimited series of layers for the first time, which is conveniently filtered. The frequency-normalized power enhancement measured in a Dark-photons \&amp; Axion-Like particles Interferometer (DALI) prototype is a few hundred per layer over a sweep bandwidth of half a hundred MHz. In light of this result, this scaled-down prototype is sensitive to axions saturating the local dark matter density with a coupling to photons between $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim$ few $\times 10^{-14}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at frequencies of several dozens of GHz once cooled down to the different working temperatures of the experiment and immersed in magnetic fields ranging from 1 T to 10 T; while the sensitivity of the full-scale DALI is projected at $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim\mathrm{few}\times10^{-15}$ GeV$^{-1}$ over the entire 25--250 {\mu}eV range since $Q\gtrsim10^4$ is expected.</description>

      <title>The science and technology of liquid argon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid argon detectors are ubiquitous in particle, astroparticle, and applied physics. They reached an unprecedented level of maturity thanks to more than 20 years of R&amp;D and the operation of large-scale facilities at CERN, Fermilab, and the Gran Sasso laboratories. This article reviews such an impressive advance - from the grounding of the experimental technique up to cutting-edge applications. We commence the review by describing the physical and chemical properties of liquid argon as an active and target medium for particle detection, together with advantages and limitations compared with other liquefied noble gases. We examine the opportunities and challenges of liquid argon detectors operated as calorimeters, scintillators, and time projection chambers. We then delve into the core applications of liquid argon detectors at colliders (ATLAS), accelerator neutrino beams (SBN, DUNE), and underground laboratories (DarkSide, DEAP, ICARUS) for the observation of rare events. We complete the review by looking at unconventional developments (pixelization, combined light-charge readout, Xe-doped devices, all-optical readout) and applications in medical and applied physics to extend this technology's scope toward novel research fields.</description>

      <title>Improved source classification and performance analysis using Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Discrete Source Classifier (DSC) provides probabilistic classification of sources in Gaia Data Release 3 using a Bayesian framework and a global prior. The DSC Combmod classifier in GDR3 achieved for the extragalactic classes (quasars and galaxies) a high completeness of 92% but a low purity of 22% due to contamination from the far larger star class. However, these single metrics mask significant variation in performance with magnitude and sky position. Furthermore, a better combination of the individual classifiers is possible. Here we compute two-dimensional representations of the completeness and the purity as function of Galactic latitude and source brightness, and exclude also the Magellanic Clouds where stellar contamination significantly depresses the purity. Reevaluated on a cleaner validation set and without introducing changes to the published GDR3 DSC probabilities themselves, we achieve for Combmod average 2-d completenesses of 92% and 95% and average 2-d purities of 55% and 89% for the quasar and galaxy classes respectively. Since the relative proportions of extragalactic objects to stars in Gaia is expected to vary significantly with brightness and latitude, we introduce a new prior as a continuous function of brightness and latitude, and compute new class probabilities. This variable prior only improves the performance by a few percentage points, mostly at the faint end. Significant improvement, however, is obtained by a new additive combination of Specmod and Allosmod. This classifier, Combmod-$\alpha$, achieves average 2-d completenesses of 82% and 93% and average 2-d purities of 79% and 93% for the quasar and galaxy classes respectively when using the global prior. Thus we achieve a significant improvement in purity for a small loss of completeness. The improvement is most significant for faint quasars where the purity rises from 20% to 62%.</description>

      <title>Cutting corners: Hypersphere sampling as a new standard for cosmological emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological emulators of observables such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectra and matter power spectra commonly use training data sampled from a Latin hypercube. This method often incurs high computational costs by covering less relevant parts of the parameter space, especially in high dimensions where only a small fraction of the parameter space yields a significant likelihood.
  In this paper, we introduce hypersphere sampling, which instead concentrates sample points in regions with higher likelihoods, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of emulators. A novel algorithm for sampling within a high-dimensional hyperellipsoid aligned with axes of correlation in the cosmological parameters is presented. This method focuses the distribution of training data points on areas of the parameter space that are most relevant to the models being tested, thereby avoiding the computational redundancies common in Latin hypercube approaches.
  Comparative analysis using the \textsc{connect} emulation tool demonstrates that hypersphere sampling can achieve similar or improved emulation precision with more than an order of magnitude fewer data points and thus less computational effort than traditional methods. This was tested for both the $\Lambda$CDM model and a 5-parameter extension including Early Dark Energy, massive neutrinos, and additional ultra-relativistic degrees of freedom. Our results suggest that hypersphere sampling holds potential as a more efficient approach for cosmological emulation, particularly suitable for complex, high-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of frequency downconverted arm length stabilization for a future upgraded gravitational wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors consist of complex multiple optical cavity systems. An arm-length stabilization (ALS) system has played an important role in bringing such complex detector into operational state and enhance the duty cycle. The sensitivity of these detectors can be improved if the thermal noise of their test mass mirror coatings is reduced. Crystalline AlGaAs coatings are a promising candidate for this. However, traditional ALS system with frequency-doubled 532 nm light is no longer an option with AlGaAs coatings due to the narrow bandgap of GaAs, thus alternative locking schemes must be developed. In this letter, we describe an experimental demonstration of a novel ALS scheme which is compatible with AlGaAs coatings. This ALS scheme will enable the use of AlGaAs coatings and contribute to improved sensitivity of future detectors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Measurement in the Mid-Band with Atom Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) have been detected in the $\sim$100 Hz and nHz bands, but most of the gravitational spectrum remains unobserved. A variety of detector concepts have been proposed to expand the range of observable frequencies. In this work, we study the capability of GW detectors in the ``mid-band'', the $\sim$30 mHz -- 10 Hz range between LISA and LIGO, to measure the signals from and constrain the properties of ${\sim}$1 -- 100 $M_\odot$ compact binaries. We focus on atom-interferometer-based detectors. We describe a Fisher matrix code, AIMforGW, which we created to evaluate their capabilities, and present numerical results for two benchmarks: terrestrial km-scale detectors, and satellite-borne detectors in medium Earth orbit. Mid-band GW detectors are particularly well-suited to pinpointing the location of GW sources on the sky. We demonstrate that a satellite-borne detector could achieve sub-degree sky localization for any detectable source with chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_c \lesssim 50 M_\odot$. We also compare different detector configurations, including different locations of terrestrial detectors and various choices of the orbit of a satellite-borne detector. As we show, a network of only two terrestrial single-baseline detectors or one single-baseline satellite-borne detector would each provide close-to-uniform sky-coverage, with signal-to-noise ratios varying by less than a factor of two across the entire sky. We hope that this work contributes to the efforts of the GW community to assess the merits of different detector proposals.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Bursts as Distance Indicators by a Statistical Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be probes of the early universe, but currently, only 26% of GRBs observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRBs have known redshifts ($z$) due to observational limitations. To address this, we estimated the GRB redshift (distance) via a supervised statistical learning model that uses optical afterglow observed by Swift and ground-based telescopes. The inferred redshifts are strongly correlated (a Pearson coefficient of 0.93) with the observed redshifts, thus proving the reliability of this method. The inferred and observed redshifts allow us to estimate the number of GRBs occurring at a given redshift (GRB rate) to be 8.47-9 $yr^{-1} Gpc^{-1}$ for $1.9&lt;z&lt;2.3$. Since GRBs come from the collapse of massive stars, we compared this rate with the star formation rate highlighting a discrepancy of a factor of 3 at $z&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Cholla-MHD: An Exascale-Capable Magnetohydrodynamic Extension to the Cholla Astrophysical Simulation Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the massively parallel, GPU native, astrophysical hydrodynamics code Cholla to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Cholla solves the ideal MHD equations in their Eulerian form on a static Cartesian mesh utilizing the Van Leer + Constrained Transport integrator, the HLLD Riemann solver, and reconstruction methods at second and third order. Cholla's MHD module can perform $\approx260$ million cell updates per GPU-second on an NVIDIA A100 while using the HLLD Riemann solver and second order reconstruction. The inherently parallel nature of GPUs combined with increased memory in new hardware allows Cholla's MHD module to perform simulations with resolutions $\sim500^3$ cells on a single high end GPU (e.g. an NVIDIA A100 with 80GB of memory). We employ GPU direct MPI to attain excellent weak scaling on the exascale supercomputer \textit{Frontier}, while using 74,088 GPUs and simulating a total grid size of over 7.2 trillion cells. A suite of test problems highlights the accuracy of Cholla's MHD module and demonstrates that zero magnetic divergence in solutions is maintained to round off error. We also present new testing and continuous integration tools using GoogleTest, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins that have made development more robust and accurate and ensure reliability in the future.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes for Ideal MHD Equations: Locally Divergence-Free and Positivity-Preserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerically simulating magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) poses notable challenges, including the suppression of spurious oscillations near discontinuities (e.g., shocks) and preservation of essential physical structures (e.g., the divergence-free constraint of magnetic field and the positivity of density and pressure). This paper develops structure-preserving oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (OEDG) schemes for ideal MHD. The schemes leverage a locally divergence-free (LDF) oscillation-eliminating (OE) procedure to suppress spurious oscillations while retaining the LDF property of magnetic field and many desirable attributes of original DG schemes, such as conservation, local compactness, and optimal convergence rates. The OE procedure is based on the solution operator of a novel damping equation, a linear system of ordinary differential equations that are exactly solvable without any discretization. The OE procedure is performed after each Runge-Kutta stage and does not impact DG spatial discretization, facilitating its easy integration into existing DG codes as an independent module. Moreover, this paper presents a rigorous positivity-preserving (PP) analysis of the LDF OEDG schemes on Cartesian meshes, utilizing the optimal convex decomposition technique and the geometric quasi-linearization (GQL) approach. Efficient PP LDF OEDG schemes are derived by incorporating appropriate discretization of Godunov-Powell source terms into only the discrete equations of cell averages, under a condition achievable through a simple PP limiter. Several one- and two-dimensional MHD tests verify the accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed structure-preserving OEDG schemes.</description>
