      <title>Cultural evolution in populations of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research in cultural evolution aims at providing causal explanations for the change of culture over time. Over the past decades, this field has generated an important body of knowledge, using experimental, historical, and computational methods. While computational models have been very successful at generating testable hypotheses about the effects of several factors, such as population structure or transmission biases, some phenomena have so far been more complex to capture using agent-based and formal models. This is in particular the case for the effect of the transformations of social information induced by evolved cognitive mechanisms. We here propose that leveraging the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior may be fruitful to address this gap. On top of being an useful approximation of human cultural dynamics, multi-agents models featuring generative agents are also important to study for their own sake. Indeed, as artificial agents are bound to participate more and more to the evolution of culture, it is crucial to better understand the dynamics of machine-generated cultural evolution. We here present a framework for simulating cultural evolution in populations of LLMs, allowing the manipulation of variables known to be important in cultural evolution, such as network structure, personality, and the way social information is aggregated and transformed. The software we developed for conducting these simulations is open-source and features an intuitive user-interface, which we hope will help to build bridges between the fields of cultural evolution and generative artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Emergent time scales of epistasis in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven epistatic model of protein evolution, capable of generating evolutionary trajectories spanning very different time scales reaching from individual mutations to diverged homologs. Our in silico evolution encompasses random nucleotide mutations, insertions and deletions, and models selection using a fitness landscape, which is inferred via a generative probabilistic model for protein families. We show that the proposed framework accurately reproduces the sequence statistics of both short-time (experimental) and long-time (natural) protein evolution, suggesting applicability also to relatively data-poor intermediate evolutionary time scales, which are currently inaccessible to evolution experiments. Our model uncovers a highly collective nature of epistasis, gradually changing the fitness effect of mutations in a diverging sequence context, rather than acting via strong interactions between individual mutations. This collective nature triggers the emergence of a long evolutionary time scale, separating fast mutational processes inside a given sequence context, from the slow evolution of the context itself. The model quantitatively reproduces the extent of contingency and entrenchment, as well as the loss of predictability in protein evolution observed in deep mutational scanning experiments of distant homologs. It thereby deepens our understanding of the interplay between mutation and selection in shaping protein diversity and novel functions, allows to statistically forecast evolution, and challenges the prevailing independent-site models of protein evolution, which are unable to capture the fundamental importance of epistasis.</description>

      <title>Modelling coevolutionary dynamics in heterogeneous SI epidemiological systems across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new structured compartmental model for the coevolutionary dynamics between susceptible and infectious individuals in heterogeneous SI epidemiological systems. In this model, the susceptible compartment is structured by a continuous variable that represents the level of resistance to infection of susceptible individuals, while the infectious compartment is structured by a continuous variable that represents the viral load of infectious individuals. We first formulate an individual-based model wherein the dynamics of single individuals is described through stochastic processes, which permits a fine-grain representation of individual dynamics and captures stochastic variability in evolutionary trajectories amongst individuals. Next we formally derive the mesoscopic counterpart of this model, which consists of a system of coupled integro-differential equations for the population density functions of susceptible and infectious individuals. Then we consider an appropriately rescaled version of this system and we carry out formal asymptotic analysis to derive the corresponding macroscopic model, which comprises a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the proportions of susceptible and infectious individuals, the mean level of resistance to infection of susceptible individuals, and the mean viral load of infectious individuals. Overall, this leads to a coherent mathematical representation of the coevolutionary dynamics between susceptible and infectious individuals across scales. We provide well-posedness results for the mesoscopic and macroscopic models, and we show that there is excellent agreement between analytical results on the long-time behaviour of the components of the solution to the macroscopic model, the results of Monte Carlo simulations of the individual-based model, and numerical solutions of the macroscopic model.</description>
