      <title>Deep Learning and Model Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of evidence in favor of any new physics models means that the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is wide open, with no direction clearly more promising than any other. This marks a turn towards what can be called `model-independent' methods-strategies that reduce the influence of modelling assumptions by performing minimally-biased precision measurements, using effective field theories, or using Deep Learning methods (DL). In this paper, I present the novel and promising uses of DL as a primary tool in high energy physics research, highlighting the use of autoencoder networks and unsupervised learning methods. I advocate for the importance and usefulness of the concept of model independence and propose a definition that recognizes that independence of models is not absolute, but comes in degrees.</description>

      <title>Experiment and the Pursuit of Ugly Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientists do not merely choose to accept fully formed theories, they also have to decide which models to work on before they are fully developed and tested. Since decisive empirical evidence in favour of a model will not yet have been gathered, other criteria must play determining roles. I examine the case of modern high-energy physics where the experimental context that once favoured the pursuit of beautiful, simple, and general theories now favours the pursuit of models that are ad hoc, narrow in scope, and complex; in short, ugly models. The lack of new discoveries since the Higgs boson, together with the lack of a new higher energy collider, has left searches for new physics conceptually and empirically wide open. Physicists must make use of the experiment at hand while also creatively exploring alternatives that have not yet been explored. This encourages the pursuit of models that have at least one of two key features: i) they take radically novel approaches, or ii) are easily testable. I present four cases, neutralino dark matter, the relaxion, repulsive gravity, and models of lepton flavour universality violation, and show that even if they do not exhibit traditional epistemic virtues, they are nonetheless pursuitworthy. I argue that experimental context strongly determines pursuitworthiness and I lay out the conditions under which experiment encourages the pursuit of ugly models.</description>

      <title>Abstraction, Explanation, and Effective Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theories (EFTs) are widely considered by physicists to be explanatory and to be the appropriate frameworks for modelling various phenomena at different scales. At the same time, they are known to be approximate, restricted, and merely effective, and thus, examining them can provide a means of getting traction on philosophical issues such as idealisation, abstraction, and the veridicality of representations in explanation. This paper casts EFTs as \textit{abstract} models of a more fundamental theory that retain all and only the relevant aspects for a given explanandum. I describe abstraction as a process that can preserve explanation top-down from an independently explanatory fundamental theory to an effective theory. Thus the paper aims to show how abstract models, like EFTs, can function as explanatory stand-ins for more fundamental models, something often taken to be unproblematic.</description>

      <title>On the independence problem of Newton's first law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newton's laws of motion pose an apparent problem, sometimes referred to as "the independence problem": the first law seems to be a simple consequence of the second law, hence it is unclear why it is included as a separate law. Many different possible answers to this question appear in the literature. The main contribution of this paper is to offer two additional answers to this problem. One of which we call "the formal explanation," since unlike all previous explanations it relies on mathematical formalism, and the other, "the logical explanation", derives the importance of the first law from the fact it states of a more fundamental natural property. A second contribution is a comprehensive review of previous suggested explanations, which we categorize and discuss as well. We provide arguments why we think our novel explanations are the most plausible.</description>

      <title>Disentangling scientific realism from anti-exceptionalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific realism is, currently, one of the most well-entrenched background assumptions of some relevant versions of anti-exceptionalism about logic. We argue that this is a sort of sociological contingency rather than a metaphilosophical necessity. Drawing parallels with the metaphysics of science (as applied to quantum foundations), we try to bring the realist assumptions of anti-exceptionalism to light, to demotivate the necessary connection between realism and anti-exceptionalism, briefly exploring the possibility of adopting antirealism as the background default view of science instead.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics II: deducing the formalism from experimental observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are the multi-time probability distributions estimated from the results of sequential measurements of quantum observables; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. In the concluding Part II of the paper, we carry out the deduction of the formalism from the phenomenological inputs described in Part I. We show that the resulting formalism exhibits an affinity with Hilbert spaces, and we derive an explicit representation in terms of those mathematical structures. Analogues of the obtained elementary building blocks -- such as projection operators -- are readily identifiable within the standard formalism. However, once these building blocks are assembled according to the blueprint of the deduced bi-trajectory formalism, it becomes evident that the new and the standard formalisms differ substantially at the conceptual level. These differences do not negate the fact that both formalisms are in perfect agreement with respect to empirically testable predictions. Rather, the emergence of a novel, non-standard formulation should be seen as a relatively rare opportunity to reassess, from a fresh perspective, some of the long-standing foundational issues in the theory. The hope is that the new approach may prove more successful in addressing problems that have resisted resolution within the established theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>What is emergence, after all?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics I: phenomenology of quantum observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are obtained through sequential probing of quantum systems; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. We demonstrate that it is indeed possible to derive, on this basis, a complete and fully functional formalism rooted in the structures of Hilbert spaces. However, the resulting formalism--the bi-trajectory formalism--differs significantly from the standard state-focused formulation. In Part I of the paper, we analyze the outcomes of various experiments involving sequential measurements of quantum observables. These outcomes are quantitatively described by phenomenological multi-time probability distributions, estimated from experimental data. Our first conclusion is that the theory describing these experiments must be non-classical: the measured sequences cannot be interpreted as sampling of a uni-trajectory representing the system's observable. The non-classical nature of the investigated systems manifests in a range of observed phenomena, including quantum interference, the quantum Zeno effect, and uncertainty relations between the measured observables.</description>

      <title>Old Quantum Mechanics by Bohr and Sommerfeld from a Modern Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00408v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review Bohr's atomic model and its extension by Sommerfeld from a mathematical perspective of wave mechanics. The derivation of quantization rules and energy levels is revisited using semiclassical methods. Sommerfeld-type integrals are evaluated by elementary techniques, and connections with the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations are established. Historical developments and key transitions from classical to quantum theory are discussed to clarify the structure and significance of the old quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the Lorentz local field expression with impact on the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01993v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 19th century Mossotti and Clausius developed an expression linking the electrical permittivity of a dielectric to the product of molecular polarizability and number density. Lorenz and Lorentz later extended this framework to encompass the refractive index of the dielectric. These classical expressions have proven remarkably successful in describing how permittivity and refractive index vary with number density, under the assumption that molecular polarizability remains relatively constant. While these models have stood the test of time and continue to offer valuable insights, their derivation relies on an approximation of the local electric field within a spherical cavity that simulates the molecular environment, excluding the field generated by the molecule or molecules themselves. For regimes of higher number densities, such as those encountered in densified dielectrics, employing an exact solution for the local field becomes increasingly important. This refinement extends the applicability of the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz equations and leads to more accurate estimates of molecular polarizability in general.</description>
