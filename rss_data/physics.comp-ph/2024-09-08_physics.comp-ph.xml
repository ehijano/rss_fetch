      <title>Quantum Natural Gradient with Geodesic Corrections for Small Shallow Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method enhances optimization in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) by incorporating geometric insights from the quantum state space through the Fubini-Study metric. In this work, we extend QNG by introducing higher-order integrators and geodesic corrections using the Riemannian Euler update rule and geodesic equations, deriving an updated rule for the Quantum Natural Gradient with Geodesic Correction (QNGGC). QNGGC is specifically designed for small, shallow quantum circuits. We also develop an efficient method for computing the Christoffel symbols necessary for these corrections, leveraging the parameter-shift rule to enable direct measurement from quantum circuits. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, we demonstrate that QNGGC significantly improves convergence rates over standard QNG, highlighting the benefits of integrating geodesic corrections into quantum optimization processes. Our approach paves the way for more efficient quantum algorithms, leveraging the advantages of geometric methods.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive reevaluation of acetaldehyde chemistry and the underlying uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the combustion chemistry of acetaldehyde is crucial to developing robust and accurate combustion chemistry models for practical fuels, especially for biofuels. This study aims to reevaluate the important rate and thermodynamic parameters for acetaldehyde combustion chemistry. The rate parameters of 79 key reactions are reevaluated using more than 100,000 direct experiments and quantum chemistry computations from &gt;900 studies, and the thermochemistry ({\Delta}hf(298K), s0(298K) and cp) of 24 key species are reevaluated based on the ATCT database, the NIST Chemistry WebBook, the TMTD database, and 35 published chemistry models. The updated parameters are incorporated into a recent acetaldehyde chemistry model, which is further assessed against available fundamental experiments (123 ignition delay times and 385 species concentrations) and existing chemistry models, with clearly better performance obtained in the high-temperature regime. Sensitivity and flux analyses further highlight the insufficiencies of previous models in representing the key pathways, particularly the branching ratios of acetaldehyde- and formaldehyde-consuming pathways. Temperature-dependent and temperature-independent uncertainties are statistically evaluated for kinetic and thermochemical parameters, respectively, where the large differences between the updated and the original model parameters reveal the necessity of reassessment of kinetic and thermochemical parameters completely based on direct experiments and theoretical calculations for rate and thermodynamic parameters.</description>

      <title>Slip-dominated structural transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may also be interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed a number of important and exciting developments that had been achieved for improving recurrence plot based data analysis and to widen its application potential. We will give a brief overview about important and innovative developments, such as computational improvements, alternative recurrence definitions (event-like, multiscale, heterogeneous, and spatio-temporal recurrences) and ideas for parameter selection, theoretical considerations of recurrence quantification measures, new recurrence quantifiers (e.g., for transition detection and causality detection), and correction schemes. New perspectives have recently been opened by combining recurrence plots with machine learning. We finally show open questions and perspectives for futures directions of methodical research.</description>

      <title>An efficient hp-Variational PINNs framework for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are able to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating the residuals of the PDEs into their loss functions. Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks (VPINNs) and hp-VPINNs use the variational form of the PDE residuals in their loss function. Although hp-VPINNs have shown promise over traditional PINNs, they suffer from higher training times and lack a framework capable of handling complex geometries, which limits their application to more complex PDEs. As such, hp-VPINNs have not been applied in solving the Navier-Stokes equations, amongst other problems in CFD, thus far. FastVPINNs was introduced to address these challenges by incorporating tensor-based loss computations, significantly improving the training efficiency. Moreover, by using the bilinear transformation, the FastVPINNs framework was able to solve PDEs on complex geometries. In the present work, we extend the FastVPINNs framework to vector-valued problems, with a particular focus on solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for two-dimensional forward and inverse problems, including problems such as the lid-driven cavity flow, the Kovasznay flow, and flow past a backward-facing step for Reynolds numbers up to 200. Our results demonstrate a 2x improvement in training time while maintaining the same order of accuracy compared to PINNs algorithms documented in the literature. We further showcase the framework's efficiency in solving inverse problems for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by accurately identifying the Reynolds number of the underlying flow. Additionally, the framework's ability to handle complex geometries highlights its potential for broader applications in computational fluid dynamics. This implementation opens new avenues for research on hp-VPINNs, potentially extending their applicability to more complex problems.</description>

      <title>Connectivity matters: Impact of bath modes ordering and geometry in Open Quantum System simulation with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being able to study the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with several environments is important in many settings ranging from quantum chemistry to quantum thermodynamics, through out-of-equilibrium systems. For such problems tensor network-based methods are state-of-the-art approaches to perform numerically exact simulations. However, to be used efficiently in this multi-environment non-perturbative context, these methods require a clever choice of the topology of the wave-function Ans\"atze. This is often done by analysing cross-correlations between different system and environment degrees of freedom. We show for canonical model Hamiltonians that simple orderings of bosonic environmental modes, which enable to write the joint {System + Environments} state as a matrix product state, reduce considerably the bond dimension required for convergence. These results suggest that complex correlation analyses in order to tweak tensor networks topology (e.g. entanglement renormalization) are usually not necessary and that tree tensor network states are sub-optimal compared to simple matrix product states in several applications.</description>

      <title>Empirically extending 1D Child-Langmuir theory to a finite temperature beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical solutions to the 1D steady-state Vlasov-Poisson system are used to develop a straightforward empirical formula for the electric current density transmitted through a vacuum diode (voltage gap) as a function of gap distance, gap voltage, the injected current density, and the average velocity and temperature of injected particles, as well as their charge and mass. This formula generalizes the 1D cold beam Child-Langmuir law (which predicts the maximum transmitted current for mono-energetic particles in a planar diode as a function of gap voltage and distance) to the case where particles are injected with a finite velocity spread. Though this case is of practical importance, no analytical solution is known. Found by a best-fit to results from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, the empirical formula characterizes the current transmitted across the diode for an injected velocity distribution of a drifting Maxwellian. It is not meant to yield a precise answer, but approximately characterizes the effect of space charge on transmitted current density over a large input space. The formula allows quick quantitative estimation of the effect of space charge in diode-like devices, such as gate-anode gaps in nanoscale vacuum channel transistors.</description>

      <title>A high-order procedure for computing globally optimal Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A standard task in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the computation of localized molecular orbits known as Wannier functions. In this manuscript, we propose a new procedure for computing Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline materials. Our approach proceeds by first performing parallel transport of the Bloch functions using numerical integration. Then, using novel analysis, we show that a simple correction can be analytically computed that yields the optimally localized Wannier function. The resulting scheme is robust and capable of achieving high-order accuracy. We illustrate this in a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Curvature of an Arbitrary Surface for Discrete Gravity and for $d=2$ Pure Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a computation of curvature of arbitrary two-dimensional surfaces of three-dimensional objects, which is a contribution to discrete gravity with potential applications in network geometry. We begin by linking each point of the surface in question to its four closest neighbors, forming quads. We then focus on the simplices of $d=2$, or triangles embedded in these quads, which make up a pure simplicial complex with $d=2$. This allows us to numerically compute the local metric along with zweibeins, which subsequently leads to a derivation of discrete curvature defined at every triangle or face. We provide an efficient algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(N \log{N})$ complexity that first orients two-dimensional surfaces, solves the nonlinear system of equations of the spin-connections resulting from the torsion condition, and returns the value of curvature at each face.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of the magnetite(001)/water interface from molecular dynamics simulations based on a neural network potential</title>

Abstract: The magnetite/water interface is commonly found in nature and plays a crucial role in various technological applications. However, our understanding of its structural and dynamical properties at the molecular scale remains still limited. In this study, we develop an efficient Behler-Parrinello neural network potential (NNP) for the magnetite/water system, paying particular attention to the accurate generation of reference data with density functional theory. Using this NNP, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the magnetite (001) surface across a wide range of water coverages, from the single molecule to bulk water. Our simulations revealed several new ground states of low coverage water on the Subsurface Cation Vacancy (SCV) model and yielded a density profile of water at the surface that exhibits marked layering. By calculating mean square displacements, we obtained quantitative information on the diffusion of water molecules on the SCV for different coverages, revealing significant anisotropy. Additionally, our simulations provided qualitative insights into the dissociation mechanisms of water molecules at the surface.</description>

      <title>Classifying acoustic cavitation with machine learning trained on multiple physical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic cavitation refers to the formation and oscillation of microbubbles in a liquid exposed to acoustic waves. Depending on the properties of the liquid and the parameters of the acoustic waves, bubbles behave differently. The two main regimes of bubble dynamics are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses violently, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations. Predicting these regimes under specific sonication conditions is important in biomedical ultrasound and sonochemistry. For these predictions to be helpful in practical settings, they must be precise and computationally efficient. In this study, we have used machine learning techniques to predict the cavitation regimes of air bubble nuclei in a liquid. The supervised machine learning was trained by solving three differential equations for bubble dynamics, namely the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis, and Gilmore equations. These equations were solved for a range of initial parameters, including temperature, bubble radius, acoustic pressure, and frequency. Four different classifiers were developed to label each simulation as either stable or transient cavitation. Subsequently, four different machine-learning strategies were designed to analyze the likelihood of transient or stable cavitation for a given set of acoustic and material parameters. Cross-validation on held-out test data shows a high accuracy of the machine learning predictions. The results indicate that machine learning models trained on physics-based simulations can reliably predict cavitation behavior across a wide range of conditions relevant to real-world applications. This approach can be employed to optimize device settings and protocols used in imaging, therapeutic ultrasound, and sonochemistry.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nonlinear System with Machine Learning: Chua and Lorenz Circuits Analyzed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear circuits serve as crucial carriers and physical models for investigating nonlinear dynamics and chaotic behavior, particularly in the simulation of biological neurons. In this study, Chua's circuit and Lorenz circuit are systematically explored for the first time through machine learning correlation algorithms. Specifically, the upgraded and optimized SINDy-PI model, which is based on neural network and symbolic regression algorithm, is utilized to learn the numerical results of attractors generated by these two nonlinear circuits. Through error analysis, we examine the effects of the precision of input data and the amount of data on the algorithmic model. The findings reveal that when the input data quantity and data precision fall within a certain range, the algorithm model can effectively recognize and restore the differential equation expressions corresponding to the two circuits. Additionally, we test the anti-interference ability of different circuits and the robustness of the algorithm by introducing noise into the test data. The results indicate that under the same noise disturbance, the Lorenz circuit has better noise resistance than Chua's circuit, providing a starting point for further studying the intrinsic properties and characteristics of different nonlinear circuits. The above results will not only offer a reference for the further study of nonlinear circuits and related systems using deep learning algorithms but also lay a preliminary theoretical foundation for the study of related physical problems and applications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing BIT1, a Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo Code, with OpenMP/OpenACC and GPU Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the path toward developing the first fusion energy devices, plasma simulations have become indispensable tools for supporting the design and development of fusion machines. Among these critical simulation tools, BIT1 is an advanced Particle-in-Cell code with Monte Carlo collisions, specifically designed for modeling plasma-material interaction and, in particular, analyzing the power load distribution on tokamak divertors. The current implementation of BIT1 relies exclusively on MPI for parallel communication and lacks support for GPUs. In this work, we address these limitations by designing and implementing a hybrid, shared-memory version of BIT1 capable of utilizing GPUs. For shared-memory parallelization, we rely on OpenMP and OpenACC, using a task-based approach to mitigate load-imbalance issues in the particle mover. On an HPE Cray EX computing node, we observe an initial performance improvement of approximately 42%, with scalable performance showing an enhancement of about 38% when using 8 MPI ranks. Still relying on OpenMP and OpenACC, we introduce the first version of BIT1 capable of using GPUs. We investigate two different data movement strategies: unified memory and explicit data movement. Overall, we report BIT1 data transfer findings during each PIC cycle. Among BIT1 GPU implementations, we demonstrate performance improvement through concurrent GPU utilization, especially when MPI ranks are assigned to dedicated GPUs. Finally, we analyze the performance of the first BIT1 GPU porting with the NVIDIA Nsight tools to further our understanding of BIT1 computational efficiency for large-scale plasma simulations, capable of exploiting current supercomputer infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description>

      <title>Electronvolt energy resolution with broadband ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ptychography is a scanning coherent diffraction imaging technique successfully applied in the electron, visible and x-ray regimes. One of the distinct features of ptychography with respect to other coherent diffraction techniques is its capability of dealing with partial spatial and temporal coherence via the reconstruction algorithm. Here we focus on the temporal and clarify the constraints which affect the energy resolution limits of the ptychographic algorithms. Based on this, we design and perform simulations for a broadband ptychography in the hard x-ray regime, which enables an energy resolution down to 1 eV. We benchmark the simulations against experimental ptychographic data of an NMC battery cathode material, attaining an energy resolution of 5 eV. We review the results, discuss the limitations, and provide guidelines for future broadband ptychography experiments, its prospective application for single acquisition x-ray absorption near edge structure imaging, magnetic dichroism imaging, and potential impact on achieving diffraction limited resolutions.</description>
