      <title>A Diffusion-Refined Planner with Reinforcement Learning Priors for Confined-Space Parking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for parking has increased the need for automated parking planning methods that can operate reliably in confined spaces. In restricted and complex environments, high-precision maneuvers are required to achieve a high success rate in planning, yet existing approaches often rely on explicit action modeling, which faces challenges when accurately modeling the optimal action distribution. In this paper, we propose DRIP, a diffusion-refined planner anchored in reinforcement learning (RL) prior action distribution, in which an RL-pretrained policy provides prior action distributions to regularize the diffusion training process. During the inference phase the denoising process refines these coarse priors into more precise action distributions. By steering the denoising trajectory through the reinforcement learning prior distribution during training, the diffusion model inherits a well-informed initialization, resulting in more accurate action modeling, a higher planning success rate, and reduced inference steps. We evaluate our approach across parking scenarios with varying degrees of spatial constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves planning performance in confined-space parking environments while maintaining strong generalization in common scenarios.</description>

      <title>Spatially Intelligent Patrol Routes for Concealed Emitter Localization by Robot Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for designing spatially intelligent robot swarm behaviors to localize concealed radio emitters. We use differential evolution to generate geometric patrol routes that localize unknown signals independently of emitter parameters, a key challenge in electromagnetic surveillance. Patrol shape and antenna type are shown to influence information gain, which in turn determines the effective triangulation coverage. We simulate a four-robot swarm across eight configurations, assigning pre-generated patrol routes based on a specified patrol shape and sensing capability (antenna type: omnidirectional or directional). An emitter is placed within the map for each trial, with randomized position, transmission power and frequency. Results show that omnidirectional localization success rates are driven primarily by source location rather than signal properties, with failures occurring most often when sources are placed in peripheral areas of the map. Directional antennas are able to overcome this limitation due to their higher gain and directivity, with an average detection success rate of 98.75% compared to 80.25% for omnidirectional. Average localization errors range from 1.01-1.30 m for directional sensing and 1.67-1.90 m for omnidirectional sensing; while directional sensing also benefits from shorter patrol edges. These results demonstrate that a swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic phenomena is directly dependent on its physical interaction with the environment. Consequently, spatial intelligence, realized here through optimized patrol routes and antenna selection, is a critical design consideration for effective robotic surveillance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Obstacle-Aware Task Assignment and Planning for Heterogeneous Robot Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Task Assignment and Planning (MATP) has attracted growing attention but remains challenging in terms of scalability, spatial reasoning, and adaptability in obstacle-rich environments. To address these challenges, we propose OATH: Adaptive Obstacle-Aware Task Assignment and Planning for Heterogeneous Robot Teaming, which advances MATP by introducing a novel obstacle-aware strategy for task assignment. First, we develop an adaptive Halton sequence map, the first known application of Halton sampling with obstacle-aware adaptation in MATP, which adjusts sampling density based on obstacle distribution. Second, we propose a cluster-auction-selection framework that integrates obstacle-aware clustering with weighted auctions and intra-cluster task selection. These mechanisms jointly enable effective coordination among heterogeneous robots while maintaining scalability and near-optimal allocation performance. In addition, our framework leverages an LLM to interpret human instructions and directly guide the planner in real time. We validate OATH in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, showing substantial improvements in task assignment quality, scalability, adaptability to dynamic changes, and overall execution performance compared to state-of-the-art MATP baselines.

      <title>Optimistic Reinforcement Learning-Based Skill Insertions for Task and Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task and motion planning (TAMP) for robotics manipulation necessitates long-horizon reasoning involving versatile actions and skills. While deterministic actions can be crafted by sampling or optimizing with certain constraints, planning actions with uncertainty, i.e., probabilistic actions, remains a challenge for TAMP. On the contrary, Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels in acquiring versatile, yet short-horizon, manipulation skills that are robust with uncertainties. In this letter, we design a method that integrates RL skills into TAMP pipelines. Besides the policy, a RL skill is defined with data-driven logical components that enable the skill to be deployed by symbolic planning. A plan refinement sub-routine is designed to further tackle the inevitable effect uncertainties. In the experiments, we compare our method with baseline hierarchical planning from both TAMP and RL fields and illustrate the strength of the method. The results show that by embedding RL skills, we extend the capability of TAMP to domains with probabilistic skills, and improve the planning efficiency compared to the previous methods.</description>

      <title>Partial Feedback Linearization Control of a Cable-Suspended Multirotor Platform for Stabilization of an Attached Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel control approach based on partial feedback linearization (PFL) for the stabilization of a suspended aerial platform with an attached load. Such systems are envisioned for various applications in construction sites involving cranes, such as the holding and transportation of heavy objects. Our proposed control approach considers the underactuation of the whole system while utilizing its coupled dynamics for stabilization. We demonstrate using numerical stability analysis that these coupled terms are crucial for the stabilization of the complete system. We also carried out robustness analysis of the proposed approach in the presence of external wind disturbances, sensor noise, and uncertainties in system dynamics. As our envisioned target application involves cranes in outdoor construction sites, our control approaches rely on only onboard sensors, thus making it suitable for such applications. We carried out extensive simulation studies and experimental tests to validate our proposed control approach.</description>

      <title>ViTacGen: Robotic Pushing with Vision-to-Touch Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic pushing is a fundamental manipulation task that requires tactile feedback to capture subtle contact forces and dynamics between the end-effector and the object. However, real tactile sensors often face hardware limitations such as high costs and fragility, and deployment challenges involving calibration and variations between different sensors, while vision-only policies struggle with satisfactory performance. Inspired by humans' ability to infer tactile states from vision, we propose ViTacGen, a novel robot manipulation framework designed for visual robotic pushing with vision-to-touch generation in reinforcement learning to eliminate the reliance on high-resolution real tactile sensors, enabling effective zero-shot deployment on visual-only robotic systems. Specifically, ViTacGen consists of an encoder-decoder vision-to-touch generation network that generates contact depth images, a standardized tactile representation, directly from visual image sequence, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile data with contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile observations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in both simulation and real world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and achieving a success rate of up to 86\%.</description>

      <title>Prescribed Performance Control of Deformable Object Manipulation in Spatial Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating three-dimensional (3D) deformable objects presents significant challenges for robotic systems due to their infinite-dimensional state space and complex deformable dynamics. This paper proposes a novel model-free approach for shape control with constraints imposed on key points. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature dimensionality reduction, the proposed controller leverages the coordinates of key points as the feature vector, which are extracted from the deformable object's point cloud using deep learning methods. This approach not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature space but also retains the spatial information of the object. By extracting key points, the manipulation of deformable objects is simplified into a visual servoing problem, where the shape dynamics are described using a deformation Jacobian matrix. To enhance control accuracy, a prescribed performance control method is developed by integrating barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF) to enforce constraints on the key points. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed and verified using the Lyapunov method. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Learning Human-Humanoid Coordination for Collaborative Object Carrying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness, generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability. Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns (straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23 participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Expertise need not monopolize: Action-Specialized Mixture of Experts for Vision-Language-Action Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are experiencing rapid development and demonstrating promising capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks. However, scaling up VLA models presents several critical challenges: (1) Training new VLA models from scratch demands substantial computational resources and extensive datasets. Given the current scarcity of robot data, it becomes particularly valuable to fully leverage well-pretrained VLA model weights during the scaling process. (2) Real-time control requires carefully balancing model capacity with computational efficiency. To address these challenges, We propose AdaMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that inherits pretrained weights from dense VLA models, and scales up the action expert by substituting the feedforward layers into sparsely activated MoE layers. AdaMoE employs a decoupling technique that decouples expert selection from expert weighting through an independent scale adapter working alongside the traditional router. This enables experts to be selected based on task relevance while contributing with independently controlled weights, allowing collaborative expert utilization rather than winner-takes-all dynamics. Our approach demonstrates that expertise need not monopolize. Instead, through collaborative expert utilization, we can achieve superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency. AdaMoE consistently outperforms the baseline model across key benchmarks, delivering performance gains of 1.8% on LIBERO and 9.3% on RoboTwin. Most importantly, a substantial 21.5% improvement in real-world experiments validates its practical effectiveness for robotic manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Reinforcement Learning with Bandit-Based Adaptation for Quadrupedal Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study risk-aware reinforcement learning for quadrupedal locomotion. Our approach trains a family of risk-conditioned policies using a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constrained policy optimization technique that provides improved stability and sample efficiency. At deployment, we adaptively select the best performing policy from the family of policies using a multi-armed bandit framework that uses only observed episodic returns, without any privileged environment information, and adapts to unknown conditions on the fly. Hence, we train quadrupedal locomotion policies at various levels of robustness using CVaR and adaptively select the desired level of robustness online to ensure performance in unknown environments. We evaluate our method in simulation across eight unseen settings (by changing dynamics, contacts, sensing noise, and terrain) and on a Unitree Go2 robot in previously unseen terrains. Our risk-aware policy attains nearly twice the mean and tail performance in unseen environments compared to other baselines and our bandit-based adaptation selects the best-performing risk-aware policy in unknown terrain within two minutes of operation.</description>

      <title>SUM-AgriVLN: Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agricultural robots are emerging as powerful assistants across a wide range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or fixed rail systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling robots to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. In practical agricultural scenarios, navigation instructions often repeatedly occur, yet AgriVLN treat each instruction as an independent episode, overlooking the potential of past experiences to provide spatial context for subsequent ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation (SUM-AgriVLN), in which the SUM module employs spatial understanding and save spatial memory through 3D reconstruction and representation. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our SUM-AgriVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.54 with slight sacrifice on Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

      <title>RoboANKLE: Design, Development, and Functional Evaluation of a Robotic Ankle with a Motorized Compliant Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a powered transtibial prosthesis with complete push-off assistance, RoboANKLE. The design aims to fulfill specific requirements, such as a sufficient range of motion (RoM) while providing the necessary torque for achieving natural ankle motion in daily activities. Addressing the challenges faced in designing active transtibial prostheses, such as maintaining energetic autonomy and minimizing weight, is vital for the study. With this aim, we try to imitate the human ankle by providing extensive push-off assistance to achieve a natural-like torque profile. Thus, Energy Store and Extended Release mechanism (ESER) is employed with a novel Extra Energy Storage (EES) mechanism. Kinematic and kinetic analyses are carried out to determine the design parameters and assess the design performance. Subsequently, a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model is built and used in comprehensive dynamic and structural analyses. These analyses are used for the design performance evaluation and determine the forces and torques applied to the prosthesis, which aids in optimizing the design for minimal weight via structural analysis and topology optimization. The design of the prototype is then finalized and manufactured for experimental evaluation to validate the design and functionality. The prototype is realized with a mass of 1.92 kg and dimensions of 261x107x420 mm. The Functional evaluations of the RoboANKLE revealed that it is capable of achieving the natural maximum dorsi-flexion angle with 95% accuracy. Also, Thanks to the implemented mechanisms, the results show that RoboANKLE can generate 57% higher than the required torque for natural walking. The result of the power generation capacity of the RoboANKLE is 10% more than the natural power during the gait cycle.</description>

      <title>Towards Adaptable Humanoid Control via Adaptive Motion Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned to adapt demonstrated motions to diverse real-world conditions while accurately preserving motion patterns. Existing motion prior approaches enable well adaptability with a few motions but often sacrifice imitation accuracy, whereas motion-tracking methods achieve accurate imitation yet require many training motions and a test-time target motion to adapt. To combine their strengths, we introduce AdaMimic, a novel motion tracking algorithm that enables adaptable humanoid control from a single reference motion. To reduce data dependence while ensuring adaptability, our method first creates an augmented dataset by sparsifying the single reference motion into keyframes and applying light editing with minimal physical assumptions. A policy is then initialized by tracking these sparse keyframes to generate dense intermediate motions, and adapters are subsequently trained to adjust tracking speed and refine low-level actions based on the adjustment, enabling flexible time warping that further improves imitation accuracy and adaptability. We validate these significant improvements in our approach in both simulation and the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot in multiple tasks across a wide range of adaptation conditions.

      <title>Restoring Noisy Demonstration for Imitation Learning With Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn a policy from expert demonstrations and has been applied to various applications. By learning from the expert policy, IL methods do not require environmental interactions or reward signals. However, most existing imitation learning algorithms assume perfect expert demonstrations, but expert demonstrations often contain imperfections caused by errors from human experts or sensor/control system inaccuracies. To address the above problems, this work proposes a filter-and-restore framework to best leverage expert demonstrations with inherent noise. Our proposed method first filters clean samples from the demonstrations and then learns conditional diffusion models to recover the noisy ones. We evaluate our proposed framework and existing methods in various domains, including robot arm manipulation, dexterous manipulation, and locomotion. The experiment results show that our proposed framework consistently outperforms existing methods across all the tasks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component and demonstrate the framework's robustness to different noise types and levels. These results confirm the practical applicability of our framework to noisy offline demonstration data.</description>

      <title>Stability Criteria and Motor Performance in Delayed Haptic Dyadic Interactions Mediated by Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated human-human (dyadic) interaction systems, focusing on haptic communication under network-induced time delays. Through frequency-domain analysis supported by numerical simulations, we identify both delay-independent and delay-dependent stability criteria. The delay-independent criterion guarantees stability irrespective of the delay, whereas the delay-dependent criterion is characterised by a maximum tolerable delay before instability occurs. The criteria demonstrate dependence on controller and robot dynamic parameters, where increasing stiffness reduces the maximum tolerable delay in a non-linear manner, thereby heightening system vulnerability. The proposed criteria can be generalised to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions and serve as design guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems. Experiments with robots performing human-like movements further illustrate the correlation between stability and motor performance. The findings of this paper suggest the prerequisites for effective delay-compensation strategies.</description>

      <title>QuASH: Using Natural-Language Heuristics to Query Visual-Language Robotic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embeddings from Visual-Language Models are increasingly utilized to represent semantics in robotic maps, offering an open-vocabulary scene understanding that surpasses traditional, limited labels. Embeddings enable on-demand querying by comparing embedded user text prompts to map embeddings via a similarity metric. The key challenge in performing the task indicated in a query is that the robot must determine the parts of the environment relevant to the query.
  This paper proposes a solution to this challenge. We leverage natural-language synonyms and antonyms associated with the query within the embedding space, applying heuristics to estimate the language space relevant to the query, and use that to train a classifier to partition the environment into matches and non-matches. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments, querying both maps and standard image benchmarks. The results demonstrate increased queryability of maps and images. Our querying technique is agnostic to the representation and encoder used, and requires limited training.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Placeability Metric for Model-Free Unified Pick-and-Place Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reliably pick and place unknown objects under real-world sensing noise remains a challenging task, as existing methods rely on strong object priors (e.g., CAD models), or planar-support assumptions, limiting generalization and unified reasoning between grasping and placing. In this work, we introduce a generalized placeability metric that evaluates placement poses directly from noisy point clouds, without any shape priors. The metric jointly scores stability, graspability, and clearance. From raw geometry, we extract the support surfaces of the object to generate diverse candidates for multi-orientation placement and sample contacts that satisfy collision and stability constraints. By conditioning grasp scores on each candidate placement, our proposed method enables model-free unified pick-and-place reasoning and selects grasp-place pairs that lead to stable, collision-free placements. On unseen real objects and non-planar object supports, our metric delivers CAD-comparable accuracy in predicting stability loss and generally produces more physically plausible placements than learning-based predictors.</description>

      <title>Proprioceptive Image: An Image Representation of Proprioceptive Data from Quadruped Robots for Contact Estimation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for representing proprioceptive time-series data from quadruped robots as structured two-dimensional images, enabling the use of convolutional neural networks for learning locomotion-related tasks. The proposed method encodes temporal dynamics from multiple proprioceptive signals, such as joint positions, IMU readings, and foot velocities, while preserving the robot's morphological structure in the spatial arrangement of the image. This transformation captures inter-signal correlations and gait-dependent patterns, providing a richer feature space than direct time-series processing. We apply this concept in the problem of contact estimation, a key capability for stable and adaptive locomotion on diverse terrains. Experimental evaluations on both real-world datasets and simulated environments show that our image-based representation consistently enhances prediction accuracy and generalization over conventional sequence-based models, underscoring the potential of cross-modal encoding strategies for robotic state learning. Our method achieves superior performance on the contact dataset, improving contact state accuracy from 87.7% to 94.5% over the recently proposed MI-HGNN method, using a 15 times shorter window size.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Multi-Modal Motion Planning Using Context-Conditioned Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical methods in robot motion planning, such as sampling-based and optimization-based methods, often struggle with scalability towards higher-dimensional state spaces and complex environments. Diffusion models, known for their capability to learn complex, high-dimensional and multi-modal data distributions, provide a promising alternative when applied to motion planning problems and have already shown interesting results. However, most of the current approaches train their model for a single environment, limiting their generalization to environments not seen during training. The techniques that do train a model for multiple environments rely on a specific camera to provide the model with the necessary environmental information and therefore always require that sensor. To effectively adapt to diverse scenarios without the need for retraining, this research proposes Context-Aware Motion Planning Diffusion (CAMPD). CAMPD leverages a classifier-free denoising probabilistic diffusion model, conditioned on sensor-agnostic contextual information. An attention mechanism, integrated in the well-known U-Net architecture, conditions the model on an arbitrary number of contextual parameters. CAMPD is evaluated on a 7-DoF robot manipulator and benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches on real-world tasks, showing its ability to generalize to unseen environments and generate high-quality, multi-modal trajectories, at a fraction of the time required by existing methods.</description>

      <title>GOPLA: Generalizable Object Placement Learning via Synthetic Augmentation of Human Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots are expected to serve as intelligent assistants, helping humans with everyday household organization. A central challenge in this setting is the task of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic preferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility (e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A multi-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual inputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These plans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by a spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses guided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision avoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data. Extensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning accuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Generative Models From and For Sampling-Based MPC: A Bootstrapped Approach For Adaptive Contact-Rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generative predictive control (GPC) framework that amortizes sampling-based Model Predictive Control (SPC) by bootstrapping it with conditional flow-matching models trained on SPC control sequences collected in simulation. Unlike prior work relying on iterative refinement or gradient-based solvers, we show that meaningful proposal distributions can be learned directly from noisy SPC data, enabling more efficient and informed sampling during online planning. We further demonstrate, for the first time, the application of this approach to real-world contact-rich loco-manipulation with a quadruped robot. Extensive experiments in simulation and on hardware show that our method improves sample efficiency, reduces planning horizon requirements, and generalizes robustly across task variations.</description>

      <title>Spatially anchored Tactile Awareness for Robust Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation requires precise geometric reasoning, yet existing visuo-tactile learning methods struggle with sub-millimeter precision tasks that are routine for traditional model-based approaches. We identify a key limitation: while tactile sensors provide rich contact information, current learning frameworks fail to effectively leverage both the perceptual richness of tactile signals and their spatial relationship with hand kinematics. We believe an ideal tactile representation should explicitly ground contact measurements in a stable reference frame while preserving detailed sensory information, enabling policies to not only detect contact occurrence but also precisely infer object geometry in the hand's coordinate system. We introduce SaTA (Spatially-anchored Tactile Awareness for dexterous manipulation), an end-to-end policy framework that explicitly anchors tactile features to the hand's kinematic frame through forward kinematics, enabling accurate geometric reasoning without requiring object models or explicit pose estimation. Our key insight is that spatially grounded tactile representations allow policies to not only detect contact occurrence but also precisely infer object geometry in the hand's coordinate system. We validate SaTA on challenging dexterous manipulation tasks, including bimanual USB-C mating in free space, a task demanding sub-millimeter alignment precision, as well as light bulb installation requiring precise thread engagement and rotational control, and card sliding that demands delicate force modulation and angular precision. These tasks represent significant challenges for learning-based methods due to their stringent precision requirements. Across multiple benchmarks, SaTA significantly outperforms strong visuo-tactile baselines, improving success rates by up to 30 percentage while reducing task completion times by 27 percentage.</description>

      <title>When Planners Meet Reality: How Learned, Reactive Traffic Agents Shift nuPlan Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planner evaluation in closed-loop simulation often uses rule-based traffic agents, whose simplistic and passive behavior can hide planner deficiencies and bias rankings. Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot react to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction capabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate planners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift when narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and established baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates planning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners interact better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane, interaction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in closed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However, when reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned planners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable basic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a drop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Neural Descriptor Fields for Learning Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world dexterous manipulation often encounters unexpected errors and disturbances, which can lead to catastrophic failures, such as dropping the manipulated object. To address this challenge, we focus on the problem of catching a falling object while it remains within grasping range and, importantly, resetting the system to a configuration favorable for resuming the primary manipulation task. We propose Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery (CADRE), a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Neural Descriptor Field (NDF)-inspired module to extract implicit contact features. Compared to methods that rely solely on object pose or point cloud input, NDFs can directly reason about finger-object correspondence and adapt to different object geometries. Our experiments show that incorporating contact features improves training efficiency, enhances convergence performance for RL training, and ultimately leads to more successful recoveries. Additionally, we demonstrate that CADRE can generalize zero-shot to unseen objects with different geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and high-fidelity demonstration data acquisition is a critical bottleneck for deploying robot Imitation Learning (IL) systems, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous robotic platforms. Existing teleoperation systems often fail to guarantee high-precision data collection across diverse types of teleoperation devices. To address this, we developed Open TeleDex, a unified teleoperation framework engineered for demonstration data collection. Open TeleDex specifically tackles the TripleAny challenge, seamlessly supporting any robotic arm, any dexterous hand, and any external input device. Furthermore, we propose a novel hand pose retargeting algorithm that significantly boosts the interoperability of Open TeleDex, enabling robust and accurate compatibility with an even wider spectrum of heterogeneous master and slave equipment. Open TeleDex establishes a foundational, high-quality, and publicly available platform for accelerating both academic research and industry development in complex robotic manipulation and IL.</description>

      <title>SkyDreamer: Interpretable End-to-End Vision-Based Drone Racing with Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous drone racing (ADR) systems have recently achieved champion-level performance, yet remain highly specific to drone racing. While end-to-end vision-based methods promise broader applicability, no system to date simultaneously achieves full sim-to-real transfer, onboard execution, and champion-level performance. In this work, we present SkyDreamer, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end vision-based ADR policy that maps directly from pixel-level representations to motor commands. SkyDreamer builds on informed Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning approach where the world model decodes to privileged information only available during training. By extending this concept to end-to-end vision-based ADR, the world model effectively functions as an implicit state and parameter estimator, greatly improving interpretability. SkyDreamer runs fully onboard without external aid, resolves visual ambiguities by tracking progress using the state decoded from the world model's hidden state, and requires no extrinsic camera calibration, enabling rapid deployment across different drones without retraining. Real-world experiments show that SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight, executing tight maneuvers such as an inverted loop, a split-S and a ladder, reaching speeds of up to 21 m/s and accelerations of up to 6 g. It further demonstrates a non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer by operating on poor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion by accurately estimating the maximum attainable motor RPM and adjusting its flight path in real-time. These results highlight SkyDreamer's adaptability to important aspects of the reality gap, bringing robustness while still achieving extremely high-speed, agile flight.</description>

      <title>Neural Implicit Flow Fields for Spatio-Temporal Motion Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe and efficient robot operation in complex human environments can benefit from good models of site-specific motion patterns. Maps of Dynamics (MoDs) provide such models by encoding statistical motion patterns in a map, but existing representations use discrete spatial sampling and typically require costly offline construction. We propose a continuous spatio-temporal MoD representation based on implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model. This removes the need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions, enabling smooth generalization across both space and time. Evaluated on a large public dataset with long-term real-world people tracking data, our method achieves better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in sparse regions while still being computationally efficient, compared to available baselines. The proposed approach demonstrates a powerful and efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns.</description>

      <title>RL-100: Performant Robotic Manipulation with Real-World Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability, efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators. We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors. Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement. Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control, such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100 attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900 episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to two hours.</description>

      <title>Multi Agent Switching Mode Controller for Sound Source localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source seeking is an important topic in robotic research, especially considering sound-based sensors since they allow the agents to locate a target even in critical conditions where it is not possible to establish a direct line of sight. In this work, we design a multi- agent switching mode control strategy for acoustic-based target localization. Two scenarios are considered: single source localization, in which the agents are driven maintaining a rigid formation towards the target, and multi-source scenario, in which each agent searches for the targets independently from the others.</description>

      <title>SADCHER: Scheduling using Attention-based Dynamic Coalitions of Heterogeneous Robots in Real-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Sadcher, a real-time task assignment framework for heterogeneous multi-robot teams that incorporates dynamic coalition formation and task precedence constraints. Sadcher is trained through Imitation Learning and combines graph attention and transformers to predict assignment rewards between robots and tasks. Based on the predicted rewards, a relaxed bipartite matching step generates high-quality schedules with feasibility guarantees. We explicitly model robot and task positions, task durations, and robots' remaining processing times, enabling advanced temporal and spatial reasoning and generalization to environments with different spatiotemporal distributions compared to training. Trained on optimally solved small-scale instances, our method can scale to larger task sets and team sizes. Sadcher outperforms other learning-based and heuristic baselines on randomized, unseen problems for small and medium-sized teams with computation times suitable for real-time operation. We also explore sampling-based variants and evaluate scalability across robot and task counts. In addition, we release our dataset of 250,000 optimal schedules: https://autonomousrobots.nl/paper_websites/sadcher_MRTA/</description>

      <title>STITCHER: Constrained Trajectory Planning in Known Environments with Real-Time Motion Primitive Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires real-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible, collision-free, and satisfy state or actuator constraints. Modern trajectory planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise hard to include in optimization-based planners.</description>

      <title>VLA^2: Empowering Vision-Language-Action Models with an Agentic Framework for Unseen Concept Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models, pre-trained on large-scale robotic data, exhibit strong multi-task capabilities and generalize well to variations in visual and language instructions for manipulation. However, their success rate drops significantly when faced with object concepts outside the training data, such as unseen object descriptions and textures in the dataset. To address this, we propose a novel agentic framework, VLA^2, which leverages OpenVLA as the execution backbone and effectively leverages external modules such as web retrieval and object detection to provide visual and textual knowledge about target objects to the VLA. This approach mitigates generalization failure when handling out-of-distribution objects. Based on the LIBERO simulation environment, we introduced novel objects and object descriptions to construct a new evaluation benchmark with three difficulty levels to test the effectiveness of our method. Our framework successfully outperformed the current state-of-the-art models on our designed hard-level generalization benchmark. Compared to the standalone OpenVLA baseline, VLA^2 achieves a 44.2% improvement in the success rate in the hard-level benchmark and an average improvement of 20.2% in all customized environments without any performance degradation on in-domain tasks.

      <title>VT-Refine: Learning Bimanual Assembly with Visuo-Tactile Feedback via Simulation Fine-Tunin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans excel at bimanual assembly tasks by adapting to rich tactile feedback -- a capability that remains difficult to replicate in robots through behavioral cloning alone, due to the suboptimality and limited diversity of human demonstrations. In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations, high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise, contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer, we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning.

      <title>Architecture Is All You Need: Diversity-Enabled Sweet Spots for Robust Humanoid Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders. Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for robust perception-conditioned locomotion.</description>

      <title>From Language to Locomotion: Retargeting-free Humanoid Control via Motion Latent Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable. They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages. Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for vision-language-action humanoid systems.</description>

      <title>CBF-RL: Safety Filtering Reinforcement Learning in Training with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior, the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically, we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards -- enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without a runtime safety filter.</description>

      <title>RDD: Retrieval-Based Demonstration Decomposer for Planner Alignment in Long-Horizon Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action (VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer (RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating robustness across diverse settings.

      <description>arXiv:2509.26255v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating, dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a stochastic cause-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex goals, outperforming a range of baselines.</description>

      <title>Choreographing Trash Cans: On Speculative Futures of Weak Robots in Public Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delivering groceries or cleaning airports, mobile robots exist in public spaces. While these examples showcase robots that execute tasks, this paper explores mobile robots that encourage posthuman collaboration rather than managing environments independently. With feigned fragility, cuteness and incomplete functionalities, the so-called "weak robots" invite passersby to engage not only on a utilitarian level, but also through imaginative and emotional responses. After examining the workings of "weak robots" by queering notions of function and ability, we introduce two speculative design fiction vignettes that describe choreographies of such robots in future urban spaces -- one exploring a utopian weak robot and the other a dystopian weak robot. We introduce these speculations in order to discuss how different values may drive design decisions, and how such decisions may shape and drive different socio-technical futures in which robots and humans share public spaces that incentivise collaboration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for geometric reasoning of scenes. While many RGB-D registration meth- ods rely on geometric and feature-based similarity, we take a different approach. We use cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet and 3DMatch, even outperforming some older supervised methods. We also integrate our components into existing methods, showing their effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework, supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences, followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini, by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the EmbodiedBench benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential 3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder, enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.</description>

Abstract: Building robots is an engaging activity that provides opportunities for hands-on learning. However, traditional robot-building kits are usually costly with limited functionality due to material and technology constraints. To improve the accessibility and flexibility of such kits, we take paper as the building material and extensively explore the versatility of paper-based interactions. Based on an analysis of current robot-building kits and paper-based interaction research, we propose a design space for devising paper robots. We also analyzed our building kit designs using this design space, where these kits demonstrate the potential of paper as a cost-effective material for robot building. As a starting point, our design space and building kit examples provide a guideline that inspires and informs future research and development of novel paper robot-building kits.</description>

      <title>EdgeNavMamba: Mamba Optimized Object Detection for Energy Efficient Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deployment of efficient and accurate Deep Learning models has long been a challenge in autonomous navigation, particularly for real-time applications on resource-constrained edge devices. Edge devices are limited in computing power and memory, making model efficiency and compression essential. In this work, we propose EdgeNavMamba, a reinforcement learning-based framework for goal-directed navigation using an efficient Mamba object detection model. To train and evaluate the detector, we introduce a custom shape detection dataset collected in diverse indoor settings, reflecting visual cues common in real-world navigation. The object detector serves as a pre-processing module, extracting bounding boxes (BBOX) from visual input, which are then passed to an RL policy to control goal-oriented navigation. Experimental results show that the student model achieved a reduction of 67% in size, and up to 73% in energy per inference on edge devices of NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5, while keeping the same performance as the teacher model. EdgeNavMamba also maintains high detection accuracy in MiniWorld and IsaacLab simulators while reducing parameters by 31% compared to the baseline. In the MiniWorld simulator, the navigation policy achieves over 90% success across environments of varying complexity.</description>

      <title>Ponimator: Unfolding Interactive Pose for Versatile Human-human Interaction Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics, drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors, Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Insect-Scale Tailless Robot with Flapping Wings: A Simple Structure and Drive for Yaw Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insect-scale micro-aerial vehicles, especially, lightweight, flapping-wing robots, are becoming increasingly important for safe motion sensing in spatially constrained environments such as living spaces. However, yaw control using flapping wings is fundamentally more difficult than using rotating wings. In this study, an insect-scale, tailless robot with four paired tilted flapping wings (weighing 1.52 g) to enable yaw control was fabricated. It benefits from the simplicity of a directly driven wing actuator with no transmission and a lift control signal; however, it still has an offset in the lift force. Therefore, an adaptive controller was designed to alleviate the offset. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed controller outperforms the linear quadratic integral controller. Finally, in a tethered and controlled demonstration flight, the yaw drift was suppressed by the wing-tilting arrangement and the proposed controller. The simple structure drive system demonstrates the potential for future controlled flights of battery-powered, tailless, flapping-wing robots weighing less than 10 grams.</description>

      <title>EffiTune: Diagnosing and Mitigating Training Inefficiency for Parameter Tuner in Robot Navigation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot navigation systems are critical for various real-world applications such as delivery services, hospital logistics, and warehouse management. Although classical navigation methods provide interpretability, they rely heavily on expert manual tuning, limiting their adaptability. Conversely, purely learning-based methods offer adaptability but often lead to instability and erratic robot behaviors. Recently introduced parameter tuners aim to balance these approaches by integrating data-driven adaptability into classical navigation frameworks. However, the parameter tuning process currently suffers from training inefficiencies and redundant sampling, with critical regions in environment often underrepresented in training data. In this paper, we propose EffiTune, a novel framework designed to diagnose and mitigate training inefficiency for parameter tuners in robot navigation systems. EffiTune first performs robot-behavior-guided diagnostics to pinpoint critical bottlenecks and underrepresented regions. It then employs a targeted up-sampling strategy to enrich the training dataset with critical samples, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing training efficiency. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that EffiTune achieves more than a 13.5% improvement in navigation performance, enhanced robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a 4x improvement in training efficiency within the same computational budget.</description>

      <title>BlueME: Robust Underwater Robot-to-Robot Communication Using Compact Magnetoelectric Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09241v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design, development, and experimental validation of BlueME, a compact magnetoelectric (ME) antenna array system for underwater robot-to-robot communication. BlueME employs ME antennas operating at their natural mechanical resonance frequency to efficiently transmit and receive very-low-frequency (VLF) electromagnetic signals underwater. We outline the design, simulation, fabrication, and integration of the proposed system on low-power embedded platforms, focusing on portable and scalable applications. For performance evaluation, we deployed BlueME on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in open-water field trials. Ocean trials demonstrate that BlueME maintains reliable signal transmission at distances beyond 700 meters while consuming only 10 watts of power. Field trials show that the system operates effectively in challenging underwater conditions such as turbidity, obstacles, and multipath interference -- conditions that generally affect acoustics and optics. Our analysis also examines the impact of complete submersion on system performance and identifies key deployment considerations. This work represents the first practical underwater deployment of ME antennas outside the laboratory and implements the largest VLF ME array system to date. BlueME demonstrates significant potential for marine robotics and automation in multi-robot cooperative systems and remote sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Inferring Foresightedness in Dynamic Noncooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is an increasingly popular tool for modeling multi-agent, e.g. human-robot, interactions. Game-theoretic models presume that each agent wishes to minimize a private cost function that depends on others' actions. These games typically evolve over a fixed time horizon, specifying how far into the future each agent plans. In practical settings, however, decision-makers may vary in foresightedness, or how much they care about their current cost in relation to their past and future costs. We conjecture that quantifying and estimating each agent's foresightedness from online data will enable safer and more efficient interactions with other agents. To this end, we frame this inference problem as an inverse dynamic game. We consider a specific objective function parametrization that smoothly interpolates myopic and farsighted planning. Games of this form are readily transformed into parametric mixed complementarity problems; we exploit the directional differentiability of solutions to these problems with respect to their hidden parameters to solve for agents' foresightedness. We conduct three experiments: one with synthetically generated delivery robot motion, one with real-world data involving people walking, biking, and driving vehicles, and one using high-fidelity simulators. The results of these experiments demonstrate that explicitly inferring agents' foresightedness enables game-theoretic models to make 33% more accurate models for agents' behavior.</description>

      <title>Moto: Latent Motion Token as the Bridging Language for Learning Robot Manipulation from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>STITCHER: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Motion Primitive Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires real-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible, collision-free, and satisfy constraints. Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy constraints can be systematically computed. However, strict requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical situations. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that leverages graph search to generate long-range trajectories by stitching short trajectory segments together in real time. STITCHER is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through its innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Simulation results show safe trajectories through complex environments can be generated in milliseconds that cover tens of meters.</description>

      <title>Never too Prim to Swim: An LLM-Enhanced RL-based Adaptive S-Surface Controller for AUVs under Extreme Sea Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adaptivity and maneuvering capabilities of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have drawn significant attention in oceanic research, due to the unpredictable disturbances and strong coupling among the AUV's degrees of freedom. In this paper, we developed large language model (LLM)-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive S-surface controller for AUVs. Specifically, LLMs are introduced for the joint optimization of controller parameters and reward functions in RL training. Using multi-modal and structured explicit task feedback, LLMs enable joint adjustments, balance multiple objectives, and enhance task-oriented performance and adaptability. In the proposed controller, the RL policy focuses on upper-level tasks, outputting task-oriented high-level commands that the S-surface controller then converts into control signals, ensuring cancellation of nonlinear effects and unpredictable external disturbances in extreme sea conditions. Under extreme sea conditions involving complex terrain, waves, and currents, the proposed controller demonstrates superior performance and adaptability in high-level tasks such as underwater target tracking and data collection, outperforming traditional PID and SMC controllers.</description>

      <title>NAMO-LLM: Efficient Navigation Among Movable Obstacles with Large Language Model Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several planners have been proposed to compute robot paths that reach desired goal regions while avoiding obstacles. However, these methods fail when all pathways to the goal are blocked. In such cases, the robot must reason about how to reconfigure the environment to access task-relevant regions - a problem known as Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO). While various solutions to this problem have been developed, they often struggle to scale to highly cluttered environments. To address this, we propose NAMO-LLM, a sampling-based planner that searches over robot and obstacle configurations to compute feasible plans specifying which obstacles to move, where, and in what order. Its key novelty is a non-uniform sampling strategy guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) biasing the tree construction toward directions more likely to yield a solution. We show that NAMO-LLM is probabilistically complete and demonstrate through experiments that it efficiently scales to cluttered environments, outperforming related works in both runtime and plan quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and task planning capabilities but remain fundamentally limited in physical interaction modeling. Existing approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or adaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to capture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting their real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory Physics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven foresight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to identify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment, providing LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX provides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions, allowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather than static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to assess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning Benchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris, evaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making performance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance, assessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility analysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models, demonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap between language-based intelligence and real-world task execution.

      <title>TACS-Graphs: Traversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs for Ground Robot Localization and Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool for robots, providing a structured representation of spatial and semantic relationships for advanced task planning. Despite their potential, conventional 3D indoor scene graphs face critical limitations, particularly under- and over-segmentation of room layers in structurally complex environments. Under-segmentation misclassifies non-traversable areas as part of a room, often in open spaces, while over-segmentation fragments a single room into overlapping segments in complex environments. These issues stem from naive voxel-based map representations that rely solely on geometric proximity, disregarding the structural constraints of traversable spaces and resulting in inconsistent room layers within scene graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to tackle segmentation inconsistency as a challenge and address it with Traversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs (TACS-Graphs), a novel framework that integrates ground robot traversability with room segmentation. By leveraging traversability as a key factor in defining room boundaries, the proposed method achieves a more semantically meaningful and topologically coherent segmentation, effectively mitigating the inaccuracies of voxel-based scene graph approaches in complex environments. Furthermore, the enhanced segmentation consistency improves loop closure detection efficiency in the proposed Consistent Scene Graph-leveraging Loop Closure Detection (CoSG-LCD) leading to higher pose estimation accuracy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of scene graph consistency and pose graph optimization performance.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of pursuit-evasion, we present a motion planning framework that combines energy-based diffusion models with artificial potential fields for robust real time trajectory generation in complex environments. Our approach processes obstacle information directly from point clouds, enabling efficient planning without requiring complete geometric representations. The framework employs classifier-free guidance training and integrates local potential fields during sampling to enhance obstacle avoidance. In dynamic scenarios, the system generates initial trajectories using the diffusion model and continuously refines them through potential field-based adaptation, demonstrating effective performance in pursuit-evasion scenarios with partial pursuer observability.</description>

Abstract: Inertial odometry (IO) leverages inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals for cost-effective localization. However, high IMU sampling rates introduce substantial redundancy that impedes IO's ability to attend to salient components, thereby creating an information bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose a cross-domain IO framework that fuses information from the frequency and time domains. Specifically, we exploit the global context and energy-compaction properties of frequency-domain representations to capture holistic motion patterns and alleviate the bottleneck. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to incorporate frequency-domain feature processing into IO. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frequency--time-domain fusion strategy.</description>

      <title>CKANIO: Learnable Chebyshev Polynomials for Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inertial odometry (IO) relies exclusively on signals from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for localization and offers a promising avenue for consumer grade positioning. However, accurate modeling of the nonlinear motion patterns present in IMU signals remains the principal limitation on IO accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose CKANIO, an IO framework that integrates Chebyshev based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Chebyshev KAN). Specifically, we design a novel residual architecture that leverages the nonlinear approximation capabilities of Chebyshev polynomials within the KAN framework to more effectively model the complex motion characteristics inherent in IMU signals. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of an interpretable KAN model to IO. Experimental results on five publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CKANIO.</description>

      <title>Opti-Acoustic Scene Reconstruction in Highly Turbid Underwater Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scene reconstruction is an essential capability for underwater robots navigating in close proximity to structures. Monocular vision-based reconstruction methods are unreliable in turbid waters and lack depth scale information. Sonars are robust to turbid water and non-uniform lighting conditions, however, they have low resolution and elevation ambiguity. This work proposes a real-time opti-acoustic scene reconstruction method that is specially optimized to work in turbid water. Our strategy avoids having to identify point features in visual data and instead identifies regions of interest in the data. We then match relevant regions in the image to corresponding sonar data. A reconstruction is obtained by leveraging range data from the sonar and elevation data from the camera image. Experimental comparisons against other vision-based and sonar-based approaches at varying turbidity levels, and field tests conducted in marina environments, validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We have made our code open-source to facilitate reproducibility and encourage community engagement.</description>

      <title>Effect of Performance Feedback Timing on Motor Learning for a Surgical Training Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) has become the gold standard for a variety of surgical procedures, but the optimal method of training surgeons for RMIS is unknown. We hypothesized that real-time, rather than post-task, error feedback would better increase learning speed and reduce errors. Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the ring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the impact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three groups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and (3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on the accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task. Participants who received real-time feedback outperformed other groups in ring orientation. Additionally, participants who received feedback in replay outperformed participants who did not receive any error feedback on ring orientation during long, straight path sections. There were no significant differences between groups for ring position overall, but participants who received real-time feedback outperformed the other groups in positional accuracy on tightly curved path sections. Conclusion: The addition of real-time haptic and visual error feedback improves learning outcomes in a virtual surgical task over error feedback in replay or no error feedback at all. Significance: This work demonstrates that multi-sensory error feedback delivered in real time leads to better training outcomes as compared to the same feedback delivered after task completion. This novel method of training may enable surgical trainees to develop skills with greater speed and accuracy.</description>

      <title>FEWT: Improving Humanoid Robot Perception with Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The embodied intelligence bridges the physical world and information space. As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both cross-spatial and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.</description>

      <title>WoW: Towards a World omniscient World model Through Embodied Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Act to See, See to Act: Diffusion-Driven Perception-Action Interplay for Adaptive Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce Action-Guided Diffusion Policy (DP-AG), a unified representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP-AG encodes latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning between perception and action, we introduce a cycle-consistent contrastive loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent perception-action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP-AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP-AG offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy learning.</description>

      <title>Seeing through Uncertainty: Robust Task-Oriented Optimization in Visual Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization. Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii) it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments. Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>A Faster and More Reliable Middleware for Autonomous Driving Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant (de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering, liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows 95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from 521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h) on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).</description>

      <title>Hoecken-D Hand: A Novel Robotic Hand for Linear Parallel Pinching and Self-Adaptive Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the Hoecken-D Hand, an underactuated robotic gripper that combines a modified Hoecken linkage with a differential spring mechanism to achieve both linear parallel pinching and a mid-stroke transition to adaptive envelope. The original Hoecken linkage is reconfigured by replacing one member with differential links, preserving straight-line guidance while enabling contact-triggered reconfiguration without additional actuators. A double-parallelogram arrangement maintains fingertip parallelism during conventional pinching, whereas the differential mechanism allows one finger to wrap inward upon encountering an obstacle, improving stability on irregular or thin objects. The mechanism can be driven by a single linear actuator, minimizing complexity and cost; in our prototype, each finger is driven by its own linear actuator for simplicity. We perform kinematic modeling and force analysis to characterize grasp performance, including simulated grasping forces and spring-opening behavior under varying geometric parameters. The design was prototyped using PLA-based 3D printing, achieving a linear pinching span of approximately 200 mm. Preliminary tests demonstrate reliable grasping in both modes across a wide range of object geometries, highlighting the Hoecken-D Hand as a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for manipulation in unstructured environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal, language-aided framework for 3D scene graph alignment. Our method addresses the challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++ enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40% on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.</description>

      <title>SIG-Chat: Spatial Intent-Guided Conversational Gesture Generation Involving How, When and Where</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accompanying actions and gestures in dialogue are often closely linked to interactions with the environment, such as looking toward the interlocutor or using gestures to point to the described target at appropriate moments. Speech and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing (WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game and animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack solution. We first established a unique data collection method to simultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent. We then developed a generation model driven by audio, language, and spatial data, alongside dedicated metrics for evaluating interaction timing and spatial accuracy. Finally, we deployed the solution on a humanoid robot, enabling rich, context-aware physical interactions.</description>

      <title>Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state, they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states, expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

      <title>AI-Agents for Culturally Diverse Online Higher Education Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the global reach of online higher education continues to grow, universities are increasingly accommodating students from diverse cultural backgrounds (Tereshko et al., 2024). This can present a number of challenges including linguistic barriers (Ullah et al., 2021), cultural differences in learning style (Omidvar &amp; Tan, 2012), cultural sensitivity in course design (Nguyen, 2022) and perceived isolation when students feel their perspectives or experiences are not reflected or valued in the learning environment (Hansen-Brown et al., 2022). Ensuring active engagement and reasonable learning outcomes in such a environments requires distance educational systems that are not only adaptive but also culturally resonant (Dalle et al., 2024). Both embodied and virtual AI-Agents have great potential in this regard as they can facilitate personalized learning and adapt their interactions and content delivery to align with students' cultural context. In addition, Generative AI (GAI), such as, Large Language Models (LLMs) can amplify the potential for these culturally aware AI agents to address educational challenges due to their advanced capacity for understanding and generating contextually relevant content (Wang et al., 2024). This chapter reviews existing research and suggests the usage of culturally aware AI-Agents, powered by GAI, to foster engagement and improve learning outcomes in culturally diverse online higher education environments.</description>

      <title>SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data. Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40% compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.</description>

Abstract: MimicKit is an open-source framework for training motion controllers using motion imitation and reinforcement learning. The codebase provides implementations of commonly-used motion-imitation techniques and RL algorithms. This framework is intended to support research and applications in computer graphics and robotics by providing a unified training framework, along with standardized environment, agent, and data structures. The codebase is designed to be modular and easily configurable, enabling convenient modification and extension to new characters and tasks. The open-source codebase is available at: https://github.com/xbpeng/MimicKit.</description>
