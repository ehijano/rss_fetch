      <title>"Active Neighbour": A Novel Monitoring Model for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, advancements in technology have enabled Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to monitor sensor networks through various methodologies. However, these developments have concurrently introduced significant security challenges, necessitating robust protective measures. As a result, securing CPS has become a critical area of research. This paper reviews existing CPS monitoring models and introduces an innovative role-based monitoring model designed to meet contemporary security requirements. The proposed model is implemented within the COOJA simulator of the Contiki OS and evaluated under three distinct security configurations. Preliminary results demonstrate promising outcomes, although further comprehensive testing is ongoing.</description>

      <title>Demand Response Optimization MILP Framework for Microgrids with DERs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy sources in microgrids introduces significant operational challenges due to their intermittent nature and the mismatch between generation and demand patterns. Effective demand response (DR) strategies are crucial for maintaining system stability and economic efficiency, particularly in microgrids with high renewable penetration. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework for optimizing DR operations in a microgrid with solar generation and battery storage systems. The framework incorporates load classification, dynamic price thresholding, and multi-period coordination for optimal DR event scheduling. Analysis across seven distinct operational scenarios demonstrates consistent peak load reduction of 10\% while achieving energy cost savings ranging from 13.1\% to 38.0\%. The highest performance was observed in scenarios with high solar generation, where the framework achieved 38.0\% energy cost reduction through optimal coordination of renewable resources and DR actions. The results validate the framework's effectiveness in managing diverse operational challenges while maintaining system stability and economic efficiency.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of different TSO-DSO coordination in the reserve market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in the distribution system has led to the emergence of a new market actor - the aggregator. The aggregator serves as a facilitator, enabling flexibility asset owners to get access to different markets. In which, EVs aggregators are gaining more attention due to their expanding use and potential to provide services in various types of markets, particularly in the reserve market. Currently, TSO indirectly utilizes these resources under the management of the distribution system operators (DSO), which can negatively impact the distribution grid. Conversely, adjustments from DSOs can impact service provision to TSO due to the shortage of TSO usage information. These factors highlight the importance of evaluating the service provision from aggregators under different TSO-DSO coordination schemes. This paper focuses on the provision of flexibility from electric vehicles (EVs) aggregators for balancing service in the TSO-DSO hybrid-managed and compares it with the DSO-managed coordination schemes. The behavior of aggregators reacting to price fluctuations and TSO requests under different coordination schemes and simulation scenarios is thoroughly evaluated. Additionally, their impact on the grid is analyzed through the DSO's congestion management process and validated using data from a real part of the Dutch distribution network. Results find that the hybrid-managed coordination scheme gives more benefit to the aggregator than the DSO-managed scheme and the EVs aggregator will gain more profit in winter than summer due to more upward regulation service is needed.</description>

      <title>Integrated Optimization and Game Theory Framework for Fair Cost Allocation in Community Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fair cost allocation in community microgrids remains a significant challenge due to the complex interactions between multiple participants with varying load profiles, distributed energy resources, and storage systems. Traditional cost allocation methods often fail to adequately address the dynamic nature of participant contributions and benefits, leading to inequitable distribution of costs and reduced participant satisfaction. This paper presents a novel framework integrating multi-objective optimization with cooperative game theory for fair and efficient microgrid operation and cost allocation. The proposed approach combines mixed-integer linear programming for optimal resource dispatch with Shapley value analysis for equitable benefit distribution, ensuring both system efficiency and participant satisfaction. The framework was validated using real-world data across six distinct operational scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both technical and economic performance. Results show peak demand reductions ranging from 7.8% to 62.6%, solar utilization rates reaching 114.8% through effective storage integration, and cooperative gains of up to $1,801.01 per day. The Shapley value-based allocation achieved balanced benefit-cost distributions, with net positions ranging from -16.0% to +14.2% across different load categories, ensuring sustainable participant cooperation.</description>

      <title>Multi-user Visible Light Communications with Probabilistic Constellation Shaping and Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint design of probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) and precoding to enhance the sum-rate performance of multi-user visible light communications (VLC) broadcast channels subject to signal amplitude constraint. In the proposed design, the transmission probabilities of bipolar $M$-pulse amplitude modulation ($M$-PAM) symbols for each user and the transmit precoding matrix are jointly optimized to improve the sum-rate performance. The joint design problem is shown to be a complex multivariate non-convex problem due to the non-convexity of the objective function. To tackle the original non-convex optimization problem, the firefly algorithm (FA), a nature-inspired heuristic optimization approach, is employed to solve a local optima. The FA-based approach, however, suffers from high computational complexity. Thus, using zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we propose a low-complexity design, which is solved using an alternating optimization approach. Additionally, considering the channel uncertainty, a robust design based on the concept of end-to-end learning with autoencoder (AE) is also presented. Simulation results reveal that the proposed joint design with PCS significantly improves the sum-rate performance compared to the conventional design with uniform signaling. For instance, the joint design achieves $\mathbf{17.5\%}$ and $\mathbf{19.2\%}$ higher sum-rate for 8-PAM and 16-PAM, respectively, at 60 dB peak amplitude-to-noise ratio. Some insights into the optimal symbol distributions of the two joint design approaches are also provided. Furthermore, our results show the advantage of the proposed robust design over the non-robust one under uncertain channel conditions.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Fundamental Lemma with Reduced Disturbance Data Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the fundamental lemma by Willems et. al has been extended towards stochastic LTI systems subject to process disturbances. Using this lemma requires previously recorded data of inputs, outputs, and disturbances. In this paper, we exploit causality concepts of stochastic control to propose a variant of the stochastic fundamental lemma that does not require past disturbance data in the Hankel matrices. Our developments rely on polynomial chaos expansions and on the knowledge of the disturbance distribution. Similar to our previous results, the proposed variant of the fundamental lemma allows to predict future input-output trajectories of stochastic LTI systems. We draw upon a numerical example to illustrate the proposed variant in data-driven control context.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization for Capacity Planning of Hybrid Heat Sources in Electric-Heat Coupling Systems of Cold Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional heat-load generation pattern of combined heat and power generators has become a problem leading to renewable energy source (RES) power curtailment in cold regions, motivating the proposal of a planning model for alternative heat sources. The model aims to identify non-dominant capacity allocation schemes for heat pumps, thermal energy storage, electric boilers, and combined storage heaters to construct a Pareto front, considering both economic and sustainable objectives. The integration of various heat sources from both generation and consumption sides enhances flexibility in utilization. The study introduces a novel optimization algorithm, the adaptive multi-objective Bayesian optimization (AMBO). Compared to other widely used multi-objective optimization algorithms, AMBO eliminates predefined parameters that may introduce subjectivity from planners. Beyond the algorithm, the proposed model incorporates a noise term to account for inevitable simulation deviations, enabling the identification of better-performing planning results that meet the unique requirements of cold regions. What's more, the characteristics of electric-thermal coupling scenarios are captured and reflected in the operation simulation model to make sure the simulation is close to reality. Numerical simulation verifies the superiority of the proposed approach in generating a more diverse and evenly distributed Pareto front in a sample-efficient manner, providing comprehensive and objective planning choices.</description>

      <title>Frequency Domain Stability and Convergence Analysis for General Reset Control Systems Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key factor that generates significant interest in reset control systems, especially within industrial contexts, is their potential to be designed using a frequency-domain loop-shaping procedure. On the other hand, formulating and assessing stability analysis for these nonlinear elements often depends on access to parametric models and numerically solving linear matrix inequalities. These specific factors could present challenges to the successful implementation of reset control within industrial settings. Moreover, one of the most effective structures for implementing reset elements is to use them in parallel with a linear element. Therefore, this article presents the development of the frequency domain-based $H_\beta$ stability method from a series to a more general structure of reset control systems. Additionally, it investigates the behavior of different reset elements in terms of the feasibility of stability in the presence of time delay. To illustrate the research findings, two examples are provided, including one from an industrial application.</description>

      <title>Coupled Rendezvous and Docking Maneuver control of satellite using Reinforcement learning-based Adaptive Fixed-Time Sliding Mode Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite dynamics in unknown environments are inherently uncertain due to factors such as varying gravitational fields, atmospheric drag, and unpredictable interactions with space debris or other celestial bodies. Traditional sliding mode controllers with fixed parameters often struggle to maintain optimal performance under these fluctuating conditions. Therefore, an adaptive controller is essential to address these challenges by continuously tuning its gains in real-time. In this paper, we have tuned the slopes of the Fixed-time Sliding surface adaptively using reinforcement learning for coupled rendezvous and docking maneuver of chaser satellite with the target satellite in an unknown space environment. The neural network model is used to determine the optimal gains of reaching law of the fixed-time sliding surface. We have assumed that we don't have an accurate model of the system so we have added noise in the tangent space instead of directly on the manifold to preserve the geometric structure of the system while ensuring mathematically consistent uncertainty propagation. The reinforcement learning is used as an approximator to represent the value function of the agent to estimate the dynamical model of the system using the Actor-Critic method. The proposed control algorithm integrates a neural network and a sliding mode controller in a cascade loop architecture, where the tracking error dynamically tunes the sliding surface gains. Global fixed-time stability of the closed-loop feedback system is proved within the Lyapunov framework. This comprehensive approach of fixed-time sliding mode controller using a Reinforcement Learning based ensures the completion of the mission efficiently while addressing the critical challenges posed by the uncertain environment. The simulation results presented support the claims made.</description>

      <title>Exact Leader Estimation: A New Approach for Distributed Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel strategy aimed at cooperatively differentiating a signal among multiple interacting agents is introduced, where none of the agents needs to know which agent is the leader, i.e. the one producing the signal to be differentiated. Every agent communicates only a scalar variable to its neighbors; except for the leader, all agents execute the same algorithm. The proposed strategy can effectively obtain derivatives up to arbitrary $m$-th order in a finite time under the assumption that the $(m+1)$-th derivative is bounded. The strategy borrows some of its structure from the celebrated homogeneous robust exact differentiator by A. Levant, inheriting its exact differentiation capability and robustness to measurement noise. Hence, the proposed strategy can be said to perform robust exact distributed differentiation. In addition, and for the first time in the distributed leader-observer literature, sampled-data communication and bounded measurement noise are considered, and corresponding steady-state worst-case accuracy bounds are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified numerically for second- and fourth-order systems, i.e., for estimating derivatives of up to first and third order, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacecraft are vital to space exploration and are often equipped with lightweight, flexible appendages to meet strict weight constraints. These appendages pose significant challenges for modeling and control due to their inherent nonlinearity. Data-driven control methods have gained traction to address such challenges. This paper introduces, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first application of the data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) framework to boundary control for flexible spacecraft. Leveraging the fundamental lemma, DeePC constructs a non-parametric model by utilizing recorded past trajectories, eliminating the need for explicit model development. The developed method also incorporates dimension reduction techniques to enhance computational efficiency. Through comprehensive numerical simulations, this study compares the proposed method with Lyapunov-based control, demonstrating superior performance and offering a thorough evaluation of data-driven control for flexible spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Traffic Safety Analysis with Digital Twin Technology: Integrating Vehicle Dynamics and Environmental Factors into Microscopic Traffic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic safety is a critical concern in transportation engineering and urban planning. Traditional traffic safety analysis requires trained observers to collect data in the field, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sometimes inaccurate. In recent years, microscopic traffic simulation, which simulates individual vehicles' movements within a transportation network, have been utilized to study traffic safety. However, microscopic traffic simulation only focuses on traffic-related factors, such as traffic volume, traffic signals, and lane configurations, neglecting vehicle dynamics and environment-related factors like weather and lighting conditions, which can significantly impact traffic safety. In light of this, this paper explores the application of digital twin technology in traffic safety analysis, integrating vehicle simulators, which consider vehicle dynamics and environmental factors, and microscopic traffic simulators, which simulate the operations of traffic flow, for enhanced safety evaluations. Various scenarios, including different weather conditions and visibility levels, are simulated using a digital twin of a road segment in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The simulations employ Surrogate Safety Measures (SSMs) like Time to Collision (TTC) and Deceleration Rate to Avoid a Crash (DRAC) to assess safety under varying conditions. The results demonstrate that traffic digital twin can identify potential safety issues that traditional microscopic simulation cannot, providing insights for improving traffic control strategies and transportation infrastructure to enhance traffic safety.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Method for Microgrid System Identification: Physically Consistent Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microgrids (MGs) play a crucial role in utilizing distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar and wind power, enhancing the sustainability and flexibility of modern power systems. However, the inherent variability in MG topology, power flow, and DER operating modes poses significant challenges to the accurate system identification of MGs, which is crucial for designing robust control strategies and ensuring MG stability. This paper proposes a Physically Consistent Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (PC-SINDy) method for accurate MG system identification. By leveraging an analytically derived library of candidate functions, PC-SINDy extracts accurate dynamic models using only phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. Simulations on a 4-bus system demonstrate that PC-SINDy can reliably and accurately predict frequency trajectories under large disturbances, including scenarios not encountered during the identification/training phase, even when using noisy, low-sampled PMU data.</description>

      <title>Towards model based control of the Vertical Gradient Freeze crystal growth process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.02519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution tracking control designs using output feedback are presented for a two-phase Stefan problem arising in the modeling of the Vertical Gradient Freeze process. The two-phase Stefan problem, consisting of two coupled free boundary problems, is a vital part of many crystal growth processes due to the temporally varying extent of the solid and liquid domains during growth. After discussing the special needs of the process, collocated as well as flatness-based state feedback designs are carried out. To render the setup complete, an observer design is performed, using a flatness-based approximation of the original distributed parameter system. The quality of the provided approximations as well as the performance of the open and closed loop control setups is analysed in several simulations.</description>

      <title>Control of the Vertical Gradient Freeze crystal growth process via backstepping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.11447v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution presents a backstepping-based state feedback design for the tracking control of a two-phase Stefan problem which is encountered in the Vertical Gradient Freeze crystal growth process. A two-phase Stefan problem consists of two coupled free boundary problems and is a vital part of many crystal growth processes due to the time-varying extent of crystal and melt during growth. In addition, a different approach for the numerical approximation of the backstepping transformations kernel is presented.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose LIR-LIVO, a lightweight and robust LiDAR-inertial-visual odometry system designed for challenging illumination and degraded environments. The proposed method leverages deep learning-based illumination-resilient features and LiDAR-Inertial-Visual Odometry (LIVO). By incorporating advanced techniques such as uniform depth distribution of features enabled by depth association with LiDAR point clouds and adaptive feature matching utilizing Superpoint and LightGlue, LIR-LIVO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and robustness with low computational cost. Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, including NTU-VIRAL, Hilti'22, and R3LIVE-Dataset. The corresponding results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other SOTA methods on both standard and challenging datasets. Particularly, the proposed method demonstrates robust pose estimation under poor ambient lighting conditions in the Hilti'22 dataset. The code of this work is publicly accessible on GitHub to facilitate advancements in the robotics community.</description>

      <title>Policy Selection and Schedules for Exclusive Bus Lane and High Occupancy Vehicle Lane in a Bi-modal Transportation Corridor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient management of transportation corridors is critical for sustaining urban mobility, directly influencing transportation efficiency. Two prominent strategies for enhancing public transit services and alleviating congestion, Exclusive Bus Lane (EBL) and High Occupancy Vehicle Lane (HOVL), are gaining increasing attention. EBLs prioritize bus transit by providing dedicated lanes for faster travel times, while HOVLs encourage carpooling by reserving lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. However, static implementations of these policies may underutilize road resources and disrupt general-purpose lanes. Dynamic control of these policies, based on real-time demand, can potentially maximize road efficiency and minimize negative impacts. This study develops cost functions for Mixed Traffic Policy (MTP), Exclusive Bus Lane Policy (EBLP), and High Occupancy Vehicle Lane Policy (HOVLP), incorporating optimized bus frequency and demand split under equilibrium condition. Switching thresholds for policy selection are derived to identify optimal periods for implementing each policy based on dynamic demand simulated using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process. Results reveal significant reductions in total system costs with the proposed dynamic policy integration. Compared to static implementations, the combined policy achieves cost reductions of 12.0%, 5.3% and 42.5% relative to MTP-only, EBLP-only, and HOVLP-only scenarios, respectively. Additionally, in two real case studies of existing EBL and HOVL operations, the proposed dynamic policy reduces total costs by 32.2% and 27.9%, respectively. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and transit planners, offering a robust framework for dynamically scheduling and integrating EBL and HOVL policies to optimize urban corridor efficiency and reduce overall system costs.</description>

      <title>Equity-aware Design and Timing of Fare-free Transit Zoning under Demand Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first analytical stochastic model for optimizing the configuration and implementation policies of fare-free transit. The model focuses on a transportation corridor with two transportation modes: automobiles and buses. The corridor is divided into two sections, an inner one with fare-free transit service and an outer one with fare-based transit service. Under the static version of the model, the optimized length and frequency of the fare-free transit zone can be determined by maximizing total social welfare. The findings indicate that implementing fare-free transit can increase transit ridership and reduce automobile use within the fare-free zone while social equity among the demand groups can be enhanced by lengthening the fare-free zone. Notably, the optimal zone length increases when both social welfare and equity are considered jointly, compared to only prioritizing social welfare. The dynamic model, framed within a market entry and exit real options approach, solves the fare policy switching problem, establishing optimal timing policies for activating or terminating fare-free service. The results from dynamic models reveal earlier implementation and extended durations of fare-free transit in the social welfare-aware regime, driven by lower thresholds compared to the social equity-aware regime.</description>

      <title>Delay Analysis of 5G HARQ in the Presence of Decoding and Feedback Latencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees in 5G networks requires accurate characterisation of delay performance, often measured using Delay Violation Probability (DVP) for a given target delay. Widely used retransmission schemes like Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) improve QoS through effective feedback, incremental redundancy (IR), and parallel retransmission processes. However, existing works to quantify the DVP under these retransmission schemes overlook practical aspects such as decoding complexity, feedback delays, and the resulting need for multiple parallel ARQ/HARQ processes that enable packet transmissions without waiting for previous feedback, thus exploiting valuable transmission opportunities. This work proposes a comprehensive multi-server delay model for ARQ/HARQ that incorporates these aspects. Using a finite blocklength error model, we derive closed-form expressions and algorithms for accurate DVP evaluation under realistic 5G configurations aligned with 3GPP standards. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate notable improvements in DVP accuracy over the state-of-the-art, highlight the impact of parameter tuning and resource allocation, and reveal how DVP affects system throughput.</description>

      <title>A Bundle-based Augmented Lagrangian Framework: Algorithm, Convergence, and Primal-dual Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new bundle-based augmented Lagrangian framework for solving constrained convex problems. Unlike the classical (inexact) augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) that has a nested double-loop structure, our framework features a $\textit{single-loop}$ process. Motivated by the proximal bundle method (PBM), we use a $\textit{bundle}$ of past iterates to approximate the subproblem in ALM to get a computationally efficient update at each iteration. We establish sub-linear convergences for primal feasibility, primal cost values, and dual iterates under mild assumptions. With further regularity conditions, such as quadratic growth, our algorithm enjoys $\textit{linear}$ convergences. Importantly, this linear convergence can happen for a class of conic optimization problems, including semidefinite programs. Our proof techniques leverage deep connections with inexact ALM and primal-dual principles with PBM.</description>

      <title>Array-Fed RIS: Validation of Friis-Based Modeling Using Full-Wave Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-fed large antenna arrays offer superior efficiency, simplicity, and reductions in size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) compared to constrained-feed systems. Historically, horn antennas have been used for space feeding, but they suffer from limitations such as bulky designs, low aperture efficiency ($\approx 50\%$), and restricted degrees of freedom at the continuous aperture. In contrast, planar patch arrays achieve significantly higher aperture efficiency ($&gt;90\%$) due to their more uniform aperture distribution, reduced weight, and increased degrees of freedom from the discretized aperture. Building on these advantages, we proposed an array-fed Reflective Intelligent Surface (RIS) system, where an active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) optimizes power transfer by aligning with the principal eigenmode of the AMAF-RIS propagation matrix $\mathbf{T}$. While our previous studies relied on the Friis transmission formula for system modeling, we now validate this approach through full-wave simulations in CST Microwave Studio. By comparing the Friis-based matrix, $\mathbf{T}_{\rm Friis}$, with the full-wave solution, $\mathbf{T}_{\rm full.wave}$, we validate the relevance of the Friis-based modeling for top-level system design. Our findings confirm the feasibility of the proposed AMAF-RIS architecture for next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Rolling Horizon Optimization for Network-Constrained V2X Value Stacking of Electric Vehicles Under Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) coordination can provide significant benefits through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) by interacting with the grid, buildings, and other EVs. This work aims to develop a V2X value-stacking framework, including vehicle-to-building (V2B), vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and energy trading, to maximize economic benefits for residential communities while maintaining distribution voltage. This work also seeks to quantify the impact of prediction errors related to building load, renewable energy, and EV arrivals. A dynamic rolling-horizon optimization (RHO) method is employed to leverage multiple revenue streams and maximize the potential of EV coordination. To address energy uncertainties, including hourly local building load, local photovoltaic (PV) generation, and EV arrivals, this work develops a Transformer-based forecasting model named Gated Recurrent Units-Encoder-Temporal Fusion Decoder (GRU-EN-TFD). The simulation results, using real data from Australia's National Electricity Market, and the Independent System Operators in New England and New York in the US, reveal that V2X value stacking can significantly reduce energy costs. The proposed GRU-EN-TFD model outperforms the benchmark forecast model. Uncertainties in EV arrivals have a more substantial impact on value-stacking performance, highlighting the significance of its accurate forecast. This work provides new insights into the dynamic interactions among residential communities, unlocking the full potential of EV batteries.</description>

      <title>Global Stabilization of Chemostats with Nonzero Mortality and Substrate Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In "chemostat"-type population models that incorporate substrate (nutrient) dynamics, the dependence of the birth (or growth) rate on the substrate concentration introduces nonlinear coupling that creates a challenge for stabilization that is global, namely, for all positive concentrations of the biomass and nutrients. This challenge for global stabilization has been overcome in the literature using relatively simple feedback when natural mortality of the biomass is absent. However, under natural mortality, it takes fortified, more complex feedback, outside of the existing nonlinear control design toolbox, to avoid biomass extinction from nutrient-depleted initial conditions. Such fortified feedback, the associated control Laypunov function design, and Lyapunov analysis of global stability are provided in this paper. We achieve global stabilization for two different chemostat models: (i) a lumped model, with two state variables, and (ii) a three-state model derived from an age-structured infinite-dimensional model. The proposed feedback stabilizers are explicit, applicable to both the lumped and the age-structured models, and coincide with simple feedback laws proposed in the literature when the mortality rate is zero. Global stabilization means subject to constraints: all positive biomass and nutrient concentrations are within the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium, and, additionally, this is achieved with a dilution input that is guaranteed to remain positive. For the lumped case with Haldane kinetics, we show that the reproduction rate dominating the mortality (excluding the reproduction and mortality being in balance) is not only sufficient but also necessary for global stabilization. The obtained results are illustrated with simple examples.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design with Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient method for the automation of inverse design in science and engineering. Based on simple least-square regression, the underlying dynamic mode decomposition algorithm can be used to construct a low-rank subspace spanning multiple experiments in parameter space. The proposed inverse design dynamic mode composition (ID-DMD) algorithm leverages the computed low-dimensional subspace to enable fast digital design and optimization on laptop-level computing, including the potential to prescribe the dynamics themselves. Moreover, the method is robust to noise, physically interpretable, and can provide uncertainty quantification metrics. The architecture can also efficiently scale to large-scale design problems using randomized algorithms in the ID-DMD. The simplicity of the method and its implementation are highly attractive in practice, and the ID-DMD has been demonstrated to be an order of magnitude more accurate than competing methods while simultaneously being 3-5 orders faster on challenging engineering design problems ranging from structural vibrations to fluid dynamics. Due to its speed, robustness, interpretability, and ease-of-use, ID-DMD in comparison with other leading machine learning methods represents a significant advancement in data-driven methods for inverse design and optimization, promising a paradigm shift in how to approach inverse design in practice.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Fast Marching Tree for Mobile Robot Motion Planning in Dynamic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes the Real-Time Fast Marching Tree (RT-FMT), a real-time planning algorithm that features local and global path generation, multiple-query planning, and dynamic obstacle avoidance. During the search, RT-FMT quickly looks for the global solution and, in the meantime, generates local paths that can be used by the robot to start execution faster. In addition, our algorithm constantly rewires the tree to keep branches from forming inside the dynamic obstacles and to maintain the tree root near the robot, which allows the tree to be reused multiple times for different goals. Our algorithm is based on the planners Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) and Real-time Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RT-RRT*). We show via simulations that RT-FMT outperforms RT- RRT* in both execution cost and arrival time, in most cases. Moreover, we also demonstrate via simulation that it is worthwhile taking the local path before the global path is available in order to reduce arrival time, even though there is a small possibility of taking an inferior path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a computationally lightweight algorithm is introduced for hybrid PV/Battery/Load systems that is price responsive, responds fast, does not require powerful hardware, and considers the operational limitations of the system. The method is applied to two buildings equipped with PV and battery. Simulation results show that the method can give results that are up to 3.9% more expensive than the Model predictive control (MPC) approach while the runtime of the program is up to 1000 times less than the MPC. Also, while the runtime of the proposed method is in the range of the self-consumption maximization (SCM) approach as the fastest method, its electricity cost is about 3.2% cheaper than the SCM method. Simulation results also show that in case of providing grid services by the battery the difference between electricity cost of the proposed approach and MPC can reduce which makes the method good for such applications.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Dionysos.jl, a modular package for solving optimal control problems for complex dynamical systems using state-of-the-art and experimental techniques from symbolic control, optimization, and learning. More often than not with Cyber-Physical systems, the only sensible way of developing a controller is by discretizing the different variables, thus transforming the control task into a purely combinatorial problem on a finite-state mathematical object, called an abstraction of this system. Although this approach offers a safety-critical framework, the available techniques suffer important scalability issues. In order to render these techniques practical, it is necessary to construct smarter abstractions that differ from classical techniques by partitioning the state-space in a non trivial way.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Combined Sewer Systems for Urban Sustainability: An Empirical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate change poses complex challenges, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly frequent and difficult to model. Examples include the dynamics of Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overburdened CSS during heavy rainfall will overflow untreated wastewater into surface water bodies. Classical approaches to modeling the impact of extreme rainfall events rely on physical simulations, which are particularly challenging to create for large urban infrastructures. Deep Learning (DL) models offer a cost-effective alternative for modeling the complex dynamics of sewer systems. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of several state-of-the-art DL time series models for predicting sewer system dynamics in a large urban infrastructure, utilizing three years of measurement data. We especially investigate the potential of DL models to maintain predictive precision during network outages by comparing global models, which have access to all variables within the sewer system, and local models, which are limited to data from a restricted set of local sensors. Our findings demonstrate that DL models can accurately predict the dynamics of sewer system load, even under network outage conditions. These results suggest that DL models can effectively aid in balancing the load redistribution in CSS, thereby enhancing the sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Integration of Prior Knowledge into Direct Learning for Safe Control of Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper integrates prior knowledge into direct learning of safe controllers for linear uncertain systems under disturbances. To this end, we characterize the set of all closed-loop systems that can be explained by available prior knowledge of the system model and the disturbances. We leverage matrix zonotopes for data-based characterization of closed-loop systems and show that the explainability of closed-loop systems by prior knowledge can be formalized by adding an equality conformity constraint to the matrix zonotope. We then leverage the resulting constraint matrix zonotope and design safe controllers that conform with both data and prior knowledge. This is achieved by ensuring the inclusion of a constrained zonotope of all possible next states in a {\lambda}-scaled level set of the safe set. We consider both polytope and zonotope safe sets and provide set inclusion conditions using linear programming.</description>

      <title>Toward A Dynamic Comfort Model for Human-Building Interaction in Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings: Supported by Field Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling building electric loads could alleviate the increasing grid strain caused by the adoption of renewables and electrification. However, current approaches that automatically setback thermostats on the hottest day compromise their efficacy by neglecting human-building interaction (HBI). This study aims to define challenges and opportunities for developing engineering models of HBI to be used in the design of controls for grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs). Building system and measured and just-in-time surveyed psychophysiological data were collected from 41 participants in 20 homes from April-September. ASHRAE Standard 55 thermal comfort models for building design were evaluated with these data. Increased error bias was observed with increasing spatiotemporal temperature variations. Unsurprising, considering these models neglect such variance, but questioning their suitability for GEBs controlling thermostat setpoints, and given the observed 4{\deg}F intra-home spatial temperature variation. The results highlight opportunities for reducing these biases in GEBs through a paradigm shift to modeling discomfort instead of comfort, increasing use of low-cost sensors, and models that account for the observed dynamic occupant behavior: of the thermostat setpoint overrides made with 140-minutes of a previous setpoint change, 95% of small changes ( 2{\deg}F) were made with 120-minutes, while 95% of larger changes ( 10{\deg}F) were made within only 70-minutes.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial Chaos Approach to Stochastic LQ Optimal Control: Error Bounds and Infinite-Horizon Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic linear--quadratic regulator problem subject to Gaussian disturbances is well known and usually addressed via a moment-based reformulation. Here, we leverage polynomial chaos expansions, which model random variables via series expansions in a suitable $\mathcal{L}^2$ probability space, to tackle the non-Gaussian case. We present the optimal solutions for finite and infinite horizons and we analyze the infinite-horizon asymptotics. We show that the limit of the optimal state-input trajectory is the unique solution to a corresponding stochastic stationary optimization problem in the sense of probability measures. Moreover, we provide a constructive error analysis for finite-dimensional polynomial chaos approximations of the optimal solutions and of the optimal stationary pair in non-Gaussian settings. A numerical example illustrates our findings.</description>

      <title>LEO Satellite and RIS: Two Keys to Seamless Indoor and Outdoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The contemporary landscape of wireless technology underscores the critical role of precise localization services. Traditional global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-based solutions, however, fall short when it comes to indoor environments, and existing indoor localization techniques such as electromagnetic fingerprinting methods face challenges of additional implementation costs and limited coverage. This article explores an innovative solution that blends low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), unlocking its potential for realizing seamless indoor and outdoor localization (SIOL) with global coverage. After a comprehensive review of the distinctive characteristics of LEO satellites and RISs, we showcase their potential for SIOL applications through two case studies on position error bound evaluation. Finally, we discuss system architectures and highlight open challenges in such systems.</description>

      <title>Port-Hamiltonian Architectural Bias for Long-Range Propagation in Deep Graph Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of information diffusion within graphs is a critical open issue that heavily influences graph representation learning, especially when considering long-range propagation. This calls for principled approaches that control and regulate the degree of propagation and dissipation of information throughout the neural flow. Motivated by this, we introduce (port-)Hamiltonian Deep Graph Networks, a novel framework that models neural information flow in graphs by building on the laws of conservation of Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We reconcile under a single theoretical and practical framework both non-dissipative long-range propagation and non-conservative behaviors, introducing tools from mechanical systems to gauge the equilibrium between the two components. Our approach can be applied to general message-passing architectures, and it provides theoretical guarantees on information conservation in time. Empirical results prove the effectiveness of our port-Hamiltonian scheme in pushing simple graph convolutional architectures to state-of-the-art performance in long-range benchmarks.</description>

      <title>FH-DRL: Exponential-Hyperbolic Frontier Heuristics with DRL for accelerated Exploration in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robot exploration in large-scale or cluttered environments remains a central challenge in intelligent vehicle applications, where partial or absent prior maps constrain reliable navigation. This paper introduces FH-DRL, a novel framework that integrates a customizable heuristic function for frontier detection with a Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) agent for continuous, high-speed local navigation. The proposed heuristic relies on an exponential-hyperbolic distance score, which balances immediate proximity against long-range exploration gains, and an occupancy-based stochastic measure, accounting for environmental openness and obstacle densities in real time. By ranking frontiers using these adaptive metrics, FH-DRL targets highly informative yet tractable waypoints, thereby minimizing redundant paths and total exploration time. We thoroughly evaluate FH-DRL across multiple simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrating clear improvements in travel distance and completion time over frontier-only or purely DRL-based exploration. In structured corridor layouts and maze-like topologies, our architecture consistently outperforms standard methods such as Nearest Frontier, Cognet Frontier Exploration, and Goal Driven Autonomous Exploration. Real-world tests with a Turtlebot3 platform further confirm robust adaptation to previously unseen or cluttered indoor spaces. The results highlight FH-DRL as an efficient and generalizable approach for frontier-based exploration in large or partially known environments, offering a promising direction for various autonomous driving, industrial, and service robotics tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a proof of an extension of the Hartman-Grobman theorem to nonhyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria of vector fields. Moreover, the linearizing topological conjugacy is (i) defined on the entire basin of attraction if the vector field is complete, and (ii) a $C^{k\geq 1}$ diffeomorphism on the complement of the equilibrium if the vector field is $C^k$ and the underlying space is not $5$-dimensional. We also show that the $C^k$ statement in the $5$-dimensional case is equivalent to the $4$-dimensional smooth Poincar\'{e} conjecture.</description>
