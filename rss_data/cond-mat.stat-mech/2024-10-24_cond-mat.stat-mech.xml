      <title>Stochasticity induced transition from homeostasis to catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What are the signatures of the onset of catastrophe? Here we present the rich system physics characterizing the stochasticity driven transition from homeostasis to breakdown in an experimentally motivated and analytically tractable minimal model. Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. These transitions occur as a single parameter is tuned; we predict the precise values of the parameter which mark the characteristic progression of the transition. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails and the reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution further characterize the transition to catastrophe.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Force-Flow Relations in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this and a companion paper [arXiv:2410.09277], we give a general and comprehensive theory for nonequilibrium (NEQ) network forces and flows (Caliber Force Theory, CFT). It follows the "Two Laws" structure of Equilibrium Thermodynamics, where a First Law asserts conservation constraints and a Second Law is a variational predictor of a system's status, that, when taken together, give a rich set of prediction tools. The novel results for network flows here are that: (1) CFT defines forces, in this case for the three independent dynamic quantities: node distribution, edge traffic, and cycle flux, allowing for treating complex nets with conflicting constraints, actions, costs and benefits. (2) CFT is not limited to approximations and assumptions about nearness to equilibria, Local Detailed Balance or heat baths. (3) CFT shows that Kirchhoff current and voltage laws are an incomplete set; we find that a third such law applies when fluctuations are important.</description>

      <title>Critical transitions in pancreatic islets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calcium signals in pancreatic beta-cells collectives show a sharp transition from uncorrelated to correlated state resembling a phase transition as the slowly increasing glucose concentration crosses the tipping point. However, the exact nature or the order of this phase transition is not well understood. Using confocal microscopy to record the collective calcium activation of beta-cells in an intact islet under changing glucose concentration in increasing and then decreasing way, we first show that in addition to the sharp transition, the coordinated calcium response exhibits a hysteresis indicating a critical, first order transition. A network model of beta-cells combining link selection and coordination mechanisms capture the observed hysteresis loop and the critical nature of the transition. Our results point towards the understanding the role of islets as tipping elements in the pancreas that interconnected by perfusion, diffusion and innervation cause the tipping dynamics and abrupt insulin release.</description>

      <title>Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

      <title>Kendall Correlation Coefficients for Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markowitz's optimal portfolio relies on the accurate estimation of correlations between asset returns, a difficult problem when the number of observations is not much larger than the number of assets. Using powerful results from random matrix theory, several schemes have been developed to "clean" the eigenvalues of empirical correlation matrices. By contrast, the (in practice equally important) problem of correctly estimating the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix has received comparatively little attention. Here we discuss a class of correlation estimators generalizing Kendall's rank correlation coefficient which improve the estimation of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors in data-poor regimes. Using both synthetic and real financial data, we show that these generalized correlation coefficients yield Markowitz portfolios with lower out-of-sample risk than those obtained with rotationally invariant estimators. Central to these results is a property shared by all Kendall-like estimators but not with classical correlation coefficients: zero eigenvalues only appear when the number of assets becomes proportional to the square of the number of data points.</description>

      <title>Can Constrained Quantum Annealing Be Effective in Noisy Quantum Annealers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of penalty-based quantum annealing (PQA) and constrained quantum annealing (CQA) in solving the graph partitioning problem under various noise models, including depolarizing, bit-flip, and phase-flip noise. We found that even in the absence of noise, the relative superiority of PQA or CQA is highly problem-dependent. PQA generally demonstrates relatively stable success probabilities, while CQA's performance varies significantly across problem instances. Notably, CQA experiences leakage from the constraint-satisfying subspace under most noise models, with the exception of phase-flip noise, where no leakage occurs exactly. The dependence of success probability on noise strength reveals that PQA consistently outperforms CQA in the weak noise regime, whereas CQA achieves higher success probabilities under strong phase-flip noise. However, even in this case, the overall success probability remains low, suggesting that CQA is not yet practical for noisy quantum annealers without the development of error-corrected quantum annealing and autonomous error correction techniques to address leakage from the constraint-satisfying subspace. To confine the system within the constraint subspace in CQA, error correction methods and cat code encoding will likely be required, both of which can suppress bit-flip errors.</description>

      <title>Scale-free flocking and giant fluctuations in epithelial active solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective motion of epithelial cells is a fundamental biological process which plays a significant role in embryogenesis, wound healing and tumor metastasis. While it has been broadly investigated for over a decade both in vivo and in vitro, large scale coherent flocking phases remain underexplored and have so far been mostly described as fluid. In this work, we report a mode of large-scale collective motion for different epithelial cell types in vitro with distinctive new features. By tracking individual cells, we show that cells move over long time scales coherently not as a fluid, but as a polar elastic solid with negligible cell rearrangements. Our analysis reveals that this solid flocking phase exhibits signatures of long-range polar order, unprecedented in cellular systems, such as scale-free correlations, anomalously large density fluctuations, and shear waves. Based on a general theory of active polar solids, we argue that these features result from massless Goldstone modes, which, in contrast to polar fluids where they are generic, require the decoupling of global rotations of the polarity and in-plane elastic deformations in polar solids. We theoretically show and consistently observe in experiments that the fluctuations of elastic deformations diverge for large system size in such polar active solid phases, leading eventually to rupture and thus potentially loss of tissue integrity at large scales.</description>

      <title>Fragile spin liquid in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent appearance of the trillium lattice in the search for materials hosting spin liquids, we study the ground state of the classical Heisenberg model on its linegraph, the trilline lattice. We find that this network realises the recently proposed notion of a fragile spin liquid in three dimensions. Additionally, we analyze the Ising case and argue for a possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase in the corresponding quantum dimer model. Like the well-known $U(1)$ spin liquids, the classical phase hosts moment fractionalisation evidenced in the diluted lattice, but unlike these, it exhibits exponential decay both in spin correlations and interactions between fractionalised moments. This provides the first instance of a purely short-range correlated classical Heisenberg spin liquid in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Evolution Speed as Indicator of Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In studying the time evolution of isolated many-body quantum systems, a key focus is determining whether the system undergoes relaxation and reaches a steady state at a given point in time. Traditional approaches often rely on specific local operators or a detailed understanding of the stationary state. In this letter, we introduce an alternative method that assesses relaxation directly from the time-dependent state by focusing on the evolution speed of the subsystem. The proposed indicator evaluates the rate of change in the reduced density matrix of the subsystem over time. We demonstrate that in systems reaching relaxation, as the overall system size increases, the evolution speed of sufficiently small yet still finite-sized subsystems notably diminishes. This leads to small fluctuations in the expectation values of operators, which is also consistent with the predictions made by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We apply this approach across various models, including the chaotic Ising chain, XXZ chains with and without many-body localization, and the transverse field Ising chain. Our results confirm the robustness and accuracy of subsystem evolution speed as a reliable indicator for relaxation.</description>

Abstract: We derive a systematic perturbative expansion for the finite-volume energy spectrum of the non-linear $O(N)$ $\sigma$-model in the $\delta$-regime. The violation of the power-counting rules that emerges after the separation of the fast and slow modes is dealt with to all orders by use of the threshold expansion. The known result for the rest-frame energy spectrum up-to-and-including next-to-next-to-leading order is reproduced.</description>

      <title>Triplets of local minima in a high-dimensional random landscape: correlations, clustering, and memoryless activated jumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the distribution of triplets of stationary points in the energy landscape of the spherical p-spin model, by evaluating the quenched three-point complexity by means of the Kac-Rice formalism. We show the occurrence of transitions in the organization of stationary points in the landscape, identifying regions where local minima and saddles accumulate and cluster around other stationary points, thus displaying the presence of correlations in the landscape. We discuss the implications of these findings for the dynamical exploration of the energy landscape in the activated regime, specifying conditions under which transitions between local minima are expected to exhibit correlated rates and when, conversely, activated jumps are likely to be memoryless.</description>

      <title>Selective excitation of work-generating cycles in nonreciprocal living solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent nonreciprocity in active matter drives the formation of self-organized states that transcend the behaviors of equilibrium systems. Integrating experiments, theory and simulations, we demonstrate that active solids composed of living starfish embryos spontaneously transition between stable fluctuating and oscillatory steady states. The nonequilibrium steady states arise from two distinct chiral symmetry breaking mechanisms at the microscopic scale: the spinning of individual embryos resulting in a macroscopic odd elastic response, and the precession of their rotation axis, leading to active gyroelasticity. In the oscillatory state, we observe long-wavelength optical vibrational modes that can be excited through mechanical perturbations. Strikingly, these excitable nonreciprocal solids exhibit nonequilibrium work generation without cycling protocols, due to coupled vibrational modes. Our work introduces a novel class of tunable nonequilibrium processes, offering a framework for designing and controlling soft robotic swarms and adaptive active materials, while opening new possibilities for harnessing nonreciprocal interactions in engineered systems.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of perturbed (3, 10) minimal model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study RG flows between non-unitary minimal models and massive quantum theories using Truncated Conformal Space Approach (TCSA). We consider the integrable non-unitary Yang-Lee model perturbed by $i\phi$ and the $D$-series version of $M(3,10)$ which is a product of two Yang-Lee models, perturbing the latter by relevant operators $\phi_{1,3}$ and $i\phi^+_{1,5}$. Utilizing the quasi-primary fields we find, TCSA is performed up to the level $N=15$ for $M(2,5)+i\phi$. The conjecture about the $M(3,10)$ perturbed by $\phi_{1,3}$ is stated: this theory flows to a massive phase; its spectrum contains a kink and two breathers, whose masses we find. Our TCSA results support the conjecture.</description>

Abstract: The covariant form of the multivariable diffusion-drift process is described by the covariant Fokker--Planck equation using the standard toolbox of Riemann geometry. The covariant form of the equivalent Langevin stochastic differential equation is long sought after in both physics and mathematics. We show that the simplest covariant Stratonovich stochastic differential equation depending on the local orthogonal frame (cf. vielbein) becomes the desired covariant Langevin equation provided we impose an additional covariant constraint: the vectors of the frame must be divergence-free.</description>

      <title>Autoencoder-assisted study of directed percolation with spatial long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial L{\'{e}}vy-like flights are introduced as a way in the absorbing phase transitions to produce non-local interactions. We utilize the autoencoder, an unsupervised learning method, to predict the critical points for $(1+1)$-d directed percolation with such spatial long-range interactions. After making a global coverage of the reaction-diffusion distance and taking a series of different values for the parameter ${\beta}$ in the distribution $P(r){\sim}1/r^{\beta}$, the critical points $P_c$ that can be continuously varied are obtained. And the dynamic decay of the particle density under the critical points was counted as a way to determine the critical exponent ${\delta}$ of the survival rate. We also investigate the active behavior of the system's particles under the critical point with increasing time steps, which allows us to determine the characteristic time $t_f$ of the finite-scale systems. And the dynamic exponents $z$ are obtained using the scaling relation $t_f{\sim}L^{z}$. We find that the autoencoder can identify this characteristic evolutionary behavior of particles. Finally, we discuss the compliance of the scaling form $1/{\delta}-({\beta}-2)/{\delta}z=2$ in different ${\beta}$ intervals as well as a method to introduce a global scaling mechanism by generating a random walking step using the L{\'{e}}vy distribution.</description>

      <title>Harmonic chain driven by active Rubin bath: transport properties and steady-state correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing the properties of an extended system driven by active reservoirs is a question of increasing importance. Here we address this question in two steps. We start by investigating the dynamics of a probe particle connected to an `active Rubin bath' -- a linear chain of overdamped run-and-tumble particles. We derive exact analytical expressions for the effective noise and dissipation kernels, acting on the probe, and show that the active nature of the bath leads to a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation. In the next step, we study the properties of an activity-driven system, modeled by a chain of harmonic oscillators connected to two such active reservoirs at the two ends. We show that the system reaches a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS), remarkably different from that generated due to a thermal gradient. We characterize this NESS by computing the kinetic temperature profile, spatial and temporal velocity correlations of the oscillators, and the average energy current flowing through the system. It turns out that, the activity drive leads to the emergence of two characteristic length scales, proportional to the activities of the reservoirs. Strong signatures of activity are also manifest in the anomalous short-time decay of the velocity autocorrelations. Finally, we find that the energy current shows a non-monotonic dependence on the activity drive and reversal in direction, corroborating previous findings.</description>

      <title>The statistical mechanics and machine learning of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the statistical physics of the classical Ising model in the so-called $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble, a finite-temperature thermal state approximation that minimizes a modified free energy based on the $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy. We begin by characterizing its critical behavior in mean-field theory in different regimes of the R\'enyi index $\alpha$. Next, we re-introduce correlations and consider the model in one and two dimensions, presenting analytical arguments for the former and devising a Monte Carlo approach to the study of the latter. Remarkably, we find that while mean-field predicts a continuous phase transition below a threshold index value of $\alpha \sim 1.303$ and a first-order transition above it, the Monte Carlo results in two dimensions point to a continuous transition at all $\alpha$. We conclude by performing a variational minimization of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi free energy using a recurrent neural network (RNN) ansatz where we find that the RNN performs well in two dimensions when compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Our work highlights the potential opportunities and limitations associated with the use of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble formalism in probing the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of classical and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Self-organized transport in noisy dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of multi-commodity transport in a noisy, nonlinear network. The nonlinearity determines the dynamics of the edge capacities, which can be amplified or suppressed depending on the local current flowing across an edge. We consider network self-organization for three different nonlinear functions: For all three we identify parameter regimes where noise leads to self-organization into more robust topologies, that are not found by the sole noiseless dynamics. Moreover, the interplay between noise and specific functional behavior of the nonlinearity gives rise to different features, such as (i) continuous or discontinuous responses to the demand strength and (ii) either single or multi-stable solutions. Our study shows the crucial role of the activation function on noise-assisted phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantized two terminal conductance, edge states and current patterns in an open geometry 2-dimensional Chern insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantization of the two terminal conductance in 2D topological systems is justified by the Landauer-Buttiker (LB) theory that assumes perfect point contacts between single channel leads and the sample. We examine this assumption in a microscopic model of a Chern insulator connected to leads, using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. We find that the currents are localized both in the leads and in the insulator and enter and exit the insulator only near the corners. The contact details do not matter and a single channel with perfect contact is emergent, thus justifying the LB theory. The quantized two-terminal conductance shows interesting finite-size effects and dependence on system-reservoir coupling.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving for Periodically Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02728v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have emerged as a useful technique to engineer the properties of quantum systems, and are in the process of being developed into a standard toolbox for quantum simulation. An outstanding challenge that leaves this toolbox incomplete is the manipulation of the states dressed by strong periodic drives. The state-of-the-art in Floquet control is the adiabatic change of parameters. Yet, this requires long protocols conflicting with the limited coherence times in experiments. To achieve fast control of nonequilibrium quantum matter, we generalize the notion of variational counterdiabatic driving away from equilibrium focusing on Floquet systems. We derive a nonperturbative variational principle to find local approximations to the adiabatic gauge potential for the effective Floquet Hamiltonian. It enables transitionless driving of Floquet eigenstates far away from the adiabatic regime. We discuss applications to two-level, Floquet band, and interacting periodically driven models. The developed technique allows us to capture nonperturbative photon resonances and obtain high-fidelity protocols that respect experimental limitations like the locality of the accessible control terms.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Fredrickson-Andersen Model on the Bethe Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statics of the Fredrickson-Andersen model (FAM) of the liquid-glass transition is solved on the Bethe lattice (BL). The kinetic constraints of the FAM imply on the BL an ergodicity-breaking transition to a (glassy) phase where a fraction of spins of the system is permanently blocked, and the remaining "free" spins become non-trivially correlated. We compute several observables of the ergodicity-broken phase, such as the self-overlap, the configurational entropy and the spin-glass susceptibility, and we compare the analytical predictions with numerical experiments. The cavity equations that we obtain allow to define algorithms for fast equilibration and accelerated dynamics. We find that at variance with spin-glass models, the correlations inside a state do not exhibit a critical behavior.</description>

      <title>From Chaos to Integrability in Double Scaled SYK via a Chord Path Integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic phase transitions between integrable and chaotic dynamics. We do so by analyzing models that interpolate between the chaotic double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and the integrable $p$-spin systems, in a limit where they are described by chord diagrams. We develop a path integral formalism by coarse graining over the diagrams, which we use to argue that the system has two distinct phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic system, and the other to the integrable. They are separated by a line of first order transition that ends at some finite temperature.</description>

      <title>A Path Integral for Chord Diagrams and Chaotic-Integrable Transitions in Double Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transitions from chaotic to integrable Hamiltonians in the double scaled SYK and $p$-spin systems. The dynamics of our models is described by chord diagrams with two species. We begin by developing a path integral formalism of coarse graining chord diagrams with a single species of chords, which has the same equations of motion as the bi-local ($G\Sigma$) Liouville action, yet appears otherwise to be different and in particular well defined. We then develop a similar formalism for two types of chords, allowing us to study different types of deformations of double scaled SYK and in particular a deformation by an integrable Hamiltonian. The system has two distinct thermodynamic phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic SYK Hamiltonian, the other is continuously connected to the integrable Hamiltonian, separated at low temperature by a first order phase transition. We also analyze the phase diagram for generic deformations, which in some cases includes a zero-temperature phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature-learning deep nets progressively collapse data to a regular low-dimensional geometry. How this phenomenon emerges from collective action of nonlinearity, noise, learning rate, and other choices that shape the dynamics, has eluded first-principles theories built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. We exhibit a noise-nonlinearity phase diagram that identifies regimes where shallow or deep layers learn more effectively. We then propose a macroscopic mechanical theory that reproduces the diagram, explaining why some DNNs are lazy and some active, and linking feature learning across layers to generalization.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras and solvable unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars as remnants of stable many-body periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a weak ergodicity-breaking phenomenon that defies the common scenario of thermalization in closed quantum systems. They are often regarded as a many-body analog of quantum scars (QS) -- a single-particle phenomenon in quantum chaos -- due to their superficial similarities. However, unlike QS, a clear connection between QMBS and classical chaos has remained elusive. It has nevertheless been speculated that in an appropriate semiclassical limit, QMBS should have a correspondence to weakly unstable periodic orbits. In this paper, I present a counterexample to this conjecture by studying a bosonic model with a large number of flavors. The dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) suggest that QMBS do not display chaotic behavior in the semiclassical limit. In contrast, chaotic dynamics are expected for initial states not associated with QMBS. Interestingly, the anomalous OTOC dynamics persist even under weak perturbations that eliminate the scarred eigenstates, suggesting a certain robustness in the phenomenon.</description>
