      <title>Projected Entangled Pair States for Lattice Gauge Theories with Dynamical Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theory is an important framework for studying gauge theories that arise in the Standard Model and condensed matter physics. Yet many systems (or regimes of those systems) are difficult to study using conventional techniques, such as action-based Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of gauged Gaussian projected entangled pair states as an ansatz for a lattice gauge theory involving dynamical physical matter. We study a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory on a two dimensional lattice with a single flavor of fermionic matter on each lattice site. Our results show agreement with results computed by exactly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the approach is computationally feasible for larger system sizes where exact results are unavailable. This is a further step on the road to studying higher dimensions and other gauge groups with manageable computational costs while avoiding the sign problem.</description>

      <title>A tensor network formulation of Lattice Gauge Theories based only on symmetric tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lattice Gauge Theory Hilbert space is divided into gauge-invariant sectors selected by the background charges. Such a projector can be directly embedded in a tensor network ansatz for gauge-invariant states as originally discussed in [Phys. Rev. B 83, 115127 (2011)] and in [Phys. Rev. X 4, 041024 (2014)] in the context of PEPS. The original ansatz is based on sparse tensors, though parts of them are not explicitly symmetric, and thus their actual implementation in numerical simulations has been hindered by the complexity of developing ad hoc libraries. Here we provide a new PEPS tensor network formulation of gauge-invariant theories purely based on symmetric elementary tensors. The new formulation can be implemented in numerical simulation using available state-of-the-art tensor network libraries but also holds interest from a purely theoretical perspective since it requires embedding the original gauge theory with gauge symmetry G into an enlarged globally symmetric theory with symmetry GxG. By revisiting the original ansatz in the modern landscape of i) duality transformations between gauge and spin systems, ii) finite depth quantum circuits followed by measurements that allow generating topologically ordered states, and iii) Clifford enhanced tensor networks, we show that such a new formulation provides a novel duality transformation between lattice gauge theories and specific sectors of globally invariant systems.</description>

      <title>The Role of Integration Cycles in Complex Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex Langevin simulations are an attempt to solve the sign (or complex-action) problem encountered in various physical systems of interest. The method is based on a complexification of the underlying degrees of freedom and an evolution in an auxiliary time dimension. The complexification, however, does not come without drawbacks, the most severe of which is the infamous 'wrong convergence' problem, stating that complex Langevin simulations sometimes fail to produce correct answers despite their apparent convergence. It has long been realized that wrong convergence may - in principle - be fixed by the introduction of a suitable kernel into the complex Langevin equation, such that the conventional correctness criteria are met. However, as we discuss in this work, complex Langevin results may - especially in the presence of a kernel - still be affected by unwanted so-called integration cycles of the theory spoiling them. Indeed, we confirm numerically that in the absence of boundary terms the complex Langevin results are given by a linear combination of such integration cycles, as put forward by Salcedo &amp; Seiler. In particular, we shed light on the way different choices of kernel affect which integration cycles are being sampled in a simulation and how this knowledge can be used to ensure correct convergence in simple toy models.</description>

      <title>Form factors for semileptonic B(s) -&gt; D*(s) l nu_l decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semileptonic $B_{(s)}$ decays are of great phenomenological interest because they allow to extract CKM matrix elements or test lepton flavour universality. Taking advantage of existing data, we explore extracting form factors for vector final states using the narrow width approximation. Based on RBC/UKQCD's set of 2+1 flavour gauge field ensembles with Shamir domain-wall fermion and Iwasaki gauge field action, we study semileptonic $B_{(s)}$ decays using domain-wall fermions for light, strange and charm quarks, whereas bottom quarks are simulated with the relativistic heavy quark (RHQ) action. Exploratory results for $B_s \to D_s^* \ell \nu_\ell$ are presented.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis for nucleon-pion and nucleon-pion-pion states in both parity sectors using distillation with domain-wall fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study using the distillation method to analyze the spectra of nucleon, nucleon-pion, and nucleon-pion-pion states in the positive-parity sector, as well as nucleon and nucleon-pion states in the negative-parity sector. The study uses seven domain-wall fermion ensembles with varying pion masses ($m_\pi = 139 - 279~\text{MeV}$), lattice spacings ($a^{-1} = 1.730~\text{GeV}$ and $a^{-1}=2.359~\text{GeV}$) and volumes ($m_\pi L = 3.8 - 7.5$). To address the large number of contractions in this project, we implemented an algorithm to automate the contraction of nucleon-pion correlation functions that contain an arbitrary number of pions. In the positive parity sector, we extrapolate the nucleon mass to the physical point. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the distillation method for baryonic quantities with a focus on multi-hadronic states and establishes a foundation for future work.</description>

      <title>Finite Temperature Quarkonia Spectral Functions in the Pseudoscalar Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quarkonia, the bound states of heavy quark-antiquark pairs, are important tools for studying the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In this study, we examine the behavior of in-medium quarkonium bound states in the QGP by analyzing their spectral functions at two temperatures, $T = 220\,\textrm{MeV}$ and $T = 293\,\textrm{MeV}$. We use physics-motivated information to reconstruct the spectral function from the Euclidean lattice correlator. Near the threshold, the spectral function is estimated through a complex potential, determined non-perturbatively from Wilson line correlators. Our results show that the real part of the potential undergoes color screening above $T_{pc}$, while the imaginary part grows rapidly with increasing distance and temperature. For the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectral function, we use the perturbative vacuum spectral function, as the temperature effects are suppressed in this region. In the absence of a transport peak in the pseudoscalar channel, we find that this combination effectively describes the pseudoscalar correlator on the lattice, calculated using relativistic quark fields. Our results show that pseudoscalar charmonium ($\eta_c$) experiences significant thermal effects, as indicated by the broadening of the $\eta_c(1S)$ state. In contrast, the $\eta_b(1S)$ state remains intact, with a sharp bound state peak.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for hadronic light-by-light scattering: $\eta$ and $\eta'$ poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering are determined by the respective transition form factors (TFFs) into two virtual photons. These TFFs constitute complicated functions of the photon virtualities that, in turn, can be reconstructed in a dispersive approach from their discontinuities. In this work, we present such an analysis for the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ TFFs, implementing a number of constraints from both experiment and theory: normalizations from the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay widths, unitarity constraints from the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to2(\pi^+\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, singly-virtual data from $e^+e^-\to e^+e^-\eta^{(\prime)}$, and the asymptotic behavior predicted by the light-cone expansion. In particular, we account for the leading left-hand-cut singularity by including effects from the $a_2$ resonance, necessitating the solution of an inhomogeneous Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es problem via a carefully chosen path deformation. The resulting TFFs allow us to evaluate the $\eta^{(\prime)}$-pole contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\times 10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta'\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\times 10^{-11}$, completing a dedicated program for the lowest-lying pseudoscalar intermediate states in a dispersive approach to hadronic light-by-light scattering, $a_\mu^{\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Local symmetries and extensive ground-state degeneracy of a 1D supersymmetric fermionic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a $1$D supersymmetric (SUSY) hard-core fermion model first proposed by Fendley, Schoutens, and de Boer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 120402 (2003)]. We focus on the full Hilbert space instead of a restricted subspace. Exact diagonalization shows the degeneracy of zero-energy states scales exponentially with size of the system, with a recurrence relation between different system sizes. We solve the degeneracy problem by showing the ground states can be systematically constructed by inserting immobile walls of fermions into the chain. Mapping the counting problem to a combinatorial one and obtaining the exact generating function, we prove the recurrence relation on both open and periodic chains. We also provide an explicit mapping between ground states, giving a combinatorial explanation of the recurrence relation.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Quantization: numerical results for the Feynman propagator on a 1+1 lattice and the theoretical relation with Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present here the first lattice simulation of symplectic quantization, a new functional approach to quantum field theory which allows to define an algorithm to numerically sample the quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Minkowski space-time, at variance with all other present approaches. Symplectic quantization is characterized by a Hamiltonian deterministic dynamics evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$ analogous to the fictious time of Parisi-Wu stochastic quantization. In this work we present the numerical study of a real scalar field theory on a $d$=1+1 space-time lattice with a $\lambda \phi^4$ interaction. We find that for $\lambda \ll 1$ the two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively well the shape of the free Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the dynamics in $\tau$, in force of a natural ergodic hypothesis connecting Hamiltonian dynamics with a generalized microcanonical ensemble. Analytically, we prove that this "microcanonical" ensemble, in the continuum limit, is equivalent to a "canonical-like" one where the probability density of field configurations is $P[\phi] \propto \exp(zS[\phi]/\hbar)$. The results from our simulations correspond to the value $z=1$ of the parameter in the canonical weight, which in this case is a well-defined probability density for field configurations in causal space-time, provided that a lower bounded interaction potential is considered. The form proposed for $P[\phi]$ suggests that our theory can be connected to ordinary quantum field theory by analytic continuation in the complex-$z$ plane.</description>

      <title>Hadron-quark hybrid model, modular transformation and Roberge-Weiss transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11598v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of modular transformations, we reformulate the recently proposed hadron-quark hybrid model when the imaginary baryonic chemical potential is introduced. As a result, we can consider the torus, which is characterized by the complex number densities of baryons (antibaryons) and quarks (antiquarks). We apply this model to analyze the Roberge-Weiss transition. It is shown that the torus vanishes at the baryonic chemical potential where the Roberge-Weiss transition appears because the number density of baryons (antibaryons) is not linearly independent of the number density of quarks (antiquarks). When the temperature T is lower than the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW, the torus shrinks smoothly to the one-dimensional object at the Roberge-Weiss transition point, but the discontinuity does not appear. On the other hand, the discontinuity of the geometrical object appears when T&gt;TRW. We also calculate the modulus of the torus and transform it into the fundamental region. The transformed moduli are symmetric below TRW, but the symmetry is broken above TRW.</description>

      <title>Screening masses of positive- and negative-parity hadron ground-states, including those with strangeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction (SCI) at nonzero temperature, we compute the screening masses of flavour-SU(3) ground-state $J^P=0^\pm$, $1^\pm$ mesons, and $J^P=1/2^\pm$, $3/2^\pm$ baryons. We find that all correlation channels allowed at $T=0$ persist when the temperature increases, even above the QCD phase transition. The results for mesons qualitatively agree with those obtained from the contemporary lattice-regularised quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) simulations. One of the most remarkable features is that each parity-partner-pair degenerates when $T&gt;T_c$, with $T_c$ being the critical temperature. For each pair, the screening mass of the negative parity meson increases monotonously with temperature. In contrast, the screening mass of the meson with positive parity is almost invariant on the domain $T\lesssim T_c/2$; when $T$ gets close to $T_c$, it decreases but soon increases again and finally degenerates with its parity partner, which signals the restoration of chiral symmetry. We also find that the $T$-dependent behaviours of baryon screening masses are quite similar to those of the mesons. For baryons, the dynamical, nonpointlike diquark correlations play a crucial role in the screening mass evolution. We further calculate the evolution of the fraction of each kind of diquark within baryons respective to temperature. We observe that, at high temperatures, only $J=0$ scalar and pseudoscalar diquark correlations can survive within $J^P=1/2^\pm$ baryons.</description>
