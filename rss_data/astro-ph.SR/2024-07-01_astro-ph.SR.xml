      <title>Cataclysmic variables from Sloan Digital Sky Survey -- V (2020-2023) identified using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SDSS-V is carrying out a dedicated survey for white dwarfs, single and in binaries, and we report the analysis of the spectroscopy of 505 cataclysmic variables (CVs) and CV candidates obtained during the first 34 months of observations of SDSS-V. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to aid with the identification of CV candidates among the over 2 million SDSS-V spectra obtained with the BOSS spectrograph. The CNN reduced the number of spectra that required visual inspection to $\simeq2$ per cent of the total. We identified 779 CV spectra among the CNN-selected candidates, plus an additional 37 CV spectra that the CNN misclassified, but that were found serendipitously by human inspection of the data. Analysing the SDSS-V spectroscopy and ancillary data of the 505 CVs in our sample, we report 62 new CVs, spectroscopically confirm 243 and refute 13 published CV candidates, and we report 68 new or improved orbital periods. We discuss the completeness and possible selection biases of the machine learning methodology, as well as the effectiveness of targeting CV candidates within SDSS-V. Finally, we re-assess the space density of CVs, and find $1.3\times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{pc^{-3}}$.</description>

      <title>Propagating Kink Waves in an Open Coronal Magnetic Flux Tube with Gravitational Stratification: Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation and Forward Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. In the coronal open-field regions, such as coronal holes, there are many transverse waves propagating along magnetic flux tubes, generally interpreted as kink waves. Previous studies have highlighted their potential in coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, and seismological diagnostics of various physical parameters. Aims. This study aims to investigate propagating kink waves, considering both vertical and horizontal density inhomogeneity, using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Methods. We establish a 3D MHD model of a gravitationally stratified open flux tube, incorporating a velocity driver at the lower boundary to excite propagating kink waves. Forward modelling is conducted to synthesise observational signatures of the Fe ix 17.1 nm line. Results. It is found that resonant absorption and density stratification both affect the wave amplitude. When diagnosing the relative density profile with velocity amplitude, resonant damping needs to be properly considered to avoid possible underestimation. In addition, unlike standing modes, propagating waves are believed to be Kelvin-Helmholtz stable. In the presence of vertical stratification, however, phase mixing of transverse motions around the tube boundary can still induce small scales, partially dissipating wave energy and leading to a temperature increase, especially at higher altitudes. Moreover, forward modeling is conducted to synthesise observational signatures, revealing the promising potential of future coronal imaging spectrometers such as MUSE in resolving these wave-induced signatures. Also, the synthesised intensity signals exhibit apparent periodic variations, offering a potential method to indirectly observe propagating kink waves with current EUV imagers.</description>

      <title>SPYGLASS. V. Spatially and Temporally Structured Star-Forming Environments in the Cepheus-Hercules Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young associations record complete histories of star forming events through their demographics and dynamics, and Gaia has greatly expanded our knowledge of these associations. We present the first structural and dynamical overview study of the Cep-Her Complex, which has recently emerged as the largest stellar population within 500 pc that still lacks substantial follow-up. We reveal that Cep-Her is not a singular association, but rather an amalgam of four, consisting of the older ($\tau &gt; 100$ Myr) open cluster Roslund 6, in addition to three dynamically coherent and highly substructured young associations that we focus on: Orpheus (25-40 Myr), Cinyras (28-43 Myr), and Cupavo (54-80 Myr). With $9552 \pm 960$ stars in Orpheus, $3872 \pm 455$ stars in Cinyras, and $8794 \pm 1827$ stars in Cupavo, all three are among the largest young associations within 500 pc, rivalling major associations like Sco-Cen. Our novel view of the ages and dynamics of these associations reveals evidence for sequential star formation in Cinyras, in addition to a multi-origin pattern of stellar dispersal in Orpheus that may hint to the presence of multiple clouds at formation. Dynamical simulations indicate that while some embedded open clusters and central components of these associations are converging, they likely lack the mass necessary to capture one another and undergo hierarchical cluster assembly. Our results provide our first view of the complex star-forming environments that gave rise to the associations of Cep-Her, which will serve as important laboratories for future studies of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Phase Shift and Travel Time of Acoustic Waves in the Lower Solar Atmosphere Using Multi-Height Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report and discuss phase-shift and phase travel time of low-frequency ({\nu} &lt; 5.0 mHz) acoustic waves estimated within the photosphere and photosphere-chromosphere interface regions, utilizing multi-height velocities in the quiet Sun. The bisector method has been employed to estimate seven height velocities in the photosphere within the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line scan, while nine height velocities are estimated from the chromospheric Ca II 8542 {\AA} line scan observations obtained from the Narrow Band Imager instrument installed with the Multi-Application Solar Telescope operational at the Udaipur Solar Observatory, India. Utilizing fast Fourier transform at each pixel over the full field-of-view, phase shift and coherence have been estimated. The frequency and height-dependent phase shift integrated over the regions having an absolute line-of-sight magnetic field of less than 10 G indicates the non-evanescent nature of low-frequency acoustic waves within the photosphere and photosphere-chromosphere interface regions. Phase travel time estimated within the photosphere shows non-zero values, aligning with previous simulations and observations. Further, we report that the non-evanescent nature persists beyond the photosphere, encompassing the photospheric-chromospheric height range. We discuss possible factors contributing to the non-evanescent nature of low-frequency acoustic waves. Additionally, our observations reveal a downward propagation of high-frequency acoustic waves, indicating the refraction from higher layers in the solar atmosphere. This study contributes valuable insights into the understanding of the complex dynamics of acoustic waves within different lower solar atmospheric layers, shedding light on the non-evanescent nature and downward propagation of the acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>A fast-filament eruption observed in the H$\alpha$ spectral line. I. Imaging spectroscopy diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Solar filament eruptions usually appear to occur in association with the sudden explosive release of magnetic energy accumulated in long-lived arched magnetic structures. It is the released energy that occasionally drives fast-filament eruptions that can be source regions of coronal mass ejections. Aim. The goal of this paper is to investigate the dynamic processes of a fast-filament eruption by using unprecedented high-resolution full-disk H$\alpha$ imaging spectroscopy observations. Methods. The whole process of the eruption was captured in a wide spectral window of the H$\alpha$ line ($\pm9.0$ A). Applying the "cloud model" and obtaining two dimensional optical thickness spectra we derive the Doppler velocity, the true eruption profiles (height, velocity, and acceleration), and the trajectory of the filament eruption in 3D space. Results. The Doppler velocity maps show that the filament was predominantly blue-shifted. During the main and final process of the eruption, strongly blue-shifted materials are manifested traveling with velocities exceeding $250~km/s$. The spectral analysis further revealed that the erupting filament is made of multiple components, some of which were Doppler-shifted approximately to $-300 ~km/s$. It is found that the filament eruption attains a maximum true velocity and acceleration of about $600~km/s$ and $2.5~km/s^2$, respectively, and its propagation direction deviates from the radial direction. On the other hand, downflows manifested as red-shifted plasma close to the footpoints of the erupting filament move with velocities $45-125~ km/s$. We interpret these red-shifted signatures as draining material, and therefore mass loss of the filament that has implications for the dynamic and the acceleration process of the eruption. Furthermore, we have estimated the total mass of the H$\alpha$ filament resulting in $\sim$$5.4\times10^{15}g$.</description>

      <title>The Mean Longitudinal Magnetic Field and its Uses in Radial-Velocity Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the analysis of the mean longitudinal magnetic field as a stellar activity tracer in the context of small exoplanet detection and characterisation in radial-velocity (RV) surveys. We use SDO/HMI filtergrams to derive Sun-as-a-star magnetic field measurements, and show that the mean longitudinal magnetic field is an excellent rotational period detector and a useful tracer of the solar magnetic cycle. To put these results into context, we compare the mean longitudinal magnetic field to three common activity proxies derived from HARPS-N Sun-as-a-star data: the full-width at half-maximum, the bisector span and the S-index. The mean longitudinal magnetic field does not correlate with the RVs and therefore cannot be used as a one-to-one proxy. However, with high cadence and a long baseline, the mean longitudinal magnetic field outperforms all other considered proxies as a solar rotational period detector, and can be used to inform our understanding of the physical processes happening on the surface of the Sun. We also test the mean longitudinal magnetic field as a "stellar proxy" on a reduced solar dataset to simulate stellar-like observational sampling. With a Gaussian Process regression analysis, we confirm that the solar mean longitudinal magnetic field is the most effective of the considered indicators, and is the most efficient rotational period indicator over different levels of stellar activity. This work highlights the need for polarimetric time series observations of stars.</description>

      <title>In LIGO's Sight? Vigorous Coherent Gravitational Waves from Cooled Collapsar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first numerical study of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsar disks, using state-of-the-art 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars. These simulations incorporate a fixed Kerr metric for the central black hole (BH) and employ simplified prescriptions for disk cooling. We find that cooled disks with an expected scale height ratio of $H/R\gtrsim0.1$ at $\sim10$ gravitational radii induce Rossby instability in compact, high-density rings. The trapped Rossby vortices generate vigorous coherent emission regardless of disk magnetization and BH spin. For BH mass of $\sim10\,M_\odot$, the GW spectrum peaks at $\sim100\,{\rm Hz}$ with some breadth due to various non-axisymmetric modes. The spectrum shifts toward lower frequencies as the disk viscously spreads and the circularization radius of the infalling gas increases. Weaker-cooled disks with $H/R\gtrsim0.3$ form a low-density extended structure of spiral arms, resulting in a broader, lower-amplitude spectrum. Assuming an optimistic detection threshold with a matched-filter SNR of 20 and a rate similar to supernovae Ib/c, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) could detect $\lesssim1$ event annually, suggesting that GW events may already be hidden in observed data. Third-generation GW detectors could detect dozens to hundreds of collapsar disks annually, depending on the cooling strength and the disk formation rate. The GW amplitudes from collapsar disks are $\gtrsim100$ times higher with a substantially greater event rate than those from core-collapse supernovae, making them potentially the most promising burst-type GW class for LVK and Cosmic Explorer. This highlights the importance of further exploration and modeling of disk-powered GWs, promising insights into collapsing star physics.</description>

      <title>Fast and Slow Crystallization-driven Convection in White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate crystallization-driven convection in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. We present a version of the mixing length theory (MLT) that self-consistently includes the effects of thermal diffusion and composition gradients, and provides solutions for the convective parameters based on the local heat and composition fluxes. Our formulation smoothly transitions between the regimes of fast adiabatic convection at large Peclet number and slow thermohaline convection at low Peclet number. It also allows for both thermally-driven and compositionally-driven convection, including correctly accounting for the direction of heat transport for compositionally-driven convection in a thermally-stable background. We use the MESA stellar evolution code to calculate the composition and heat fluxes during crystallization in different models of cooling white dwarfs, and determine the regime of convection and the convective velocity. We find that convection occurs in the regime of slow thermohaline convection during most of the cooling history of the star. However, at the onset of crystallization, the composition flux is large enough to drive fast overturning convection for a short time ($\sim 10\ \mathrm{Myr}$). We estimate the convective velocities in both of these phases and discuss the implications for explaining observed white dwarf magnetic fields with crystallization-driven dynamos.</description>

      <title>Shaping the nebula around the symbiotic system R Aquarii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of high-dispersion spectroscopic observations of the symbiotic system R Aquarii (R Aqr) obtained with the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph (MES) at the 2.1 m telescope of the San Pedro M\'artir Observatory (Mexico). An interpretation of these data is presented by means of the shape software to disclose the morpho-kinematics of the nebulosities associated with R Aqr. The best model that reproduces narrow-band images and position-velocity diagrams is composed by three structures: an outer (large) hourglass structure surrounding an inner bipolar with a spiral-like filament entwined around the later. Different expansion velocity patterns are predefined for each structure, which predict kinematic ages of $\tau_{1}$=450$\pm$25 yr (outer hourglass), $\tau_{2}$=240$\pm$20 yr (inner bipolar) and $\tau_{3}$=215$\pm$20 yr (spiral-like filament). We suggest that the spiral-like filament is tracing the regions of interaction of the precessing jet with the circumstellar material, which simultaneously carves the inner bipolar structure. If a similar process created the large hourglass structure, it means that the action of the jet ceased for about 230 yr. We discuss the implication for other unresolved symbiotic systems detected in X-rays.</description>

      <title>Calibrating and standardizing the Tip of the Red Giant Branch in the Small Magellanic Cloud using small-amplitude red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the absolute calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) classified by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We show that all stars near the SMC's TRGB are SARGs. Distinguishing older and younger RGs near the Tip according to two period-luminosity sequences labeled A and B, we show many similarities among SARG populations of the LMC and the SMC, along with notable differences. Specifically, SMC SARGs have shorter periods due to lower metallicity and lower amplitudes due to younger ages than LMC SARGs. We discover two period-color relations near the TRGB that span all A-sequence and B-sequence stars in the OGLE-III footprints of the SMC and LMC, and we investigate using periods instead of color for TRGB standardization. Using variability derived information only, we trace the SMC's age and metallicity gradients and show the core to be populated by younger, more metal rich RGs. B-sequence SARGs yield both the most precise and the brightest tip magnitude, and they are best suited for distance determination and Hubble constant measurements because they correspond to the oldest stars near TRGB. Assuming the geometric distance measured by detached eclipsing binaries, the B-sequence yields the SMC's most accurate TRGB calibration to date: M_{F814W,syn} = -4.057 \pm 0.019(stat.) \pm 0.029(syst.) mag (1.5% in distance). Further study of SARGs will unravel the impact of population diversity on TRGB distances and further improve TRGB standardization.</description>

      <title>The size of the Milky Way galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The size of a galaxy is one of the fundamental parameters that reflects its growth and assembly history. Traditionally, the size of the Milky Way has been characterized by the scale length of the disk, based on the assumption of an exponential density profile. Earlier scale length measurements suggest the Milky Way is an overly compact galaxy, compared to similar galaxies of its mass. These size measurements, however, ignore the presence of the bulge, and the assumption of a single-exponential disk profile faces growing challenges from the recent observations. The half-light radius is an alternative size measurement that is independent of the galaxy density profile and has been widely used to quantify the size of external galaxies. Here we report the half-light radius of the Milky Way, derived from a new measurement of the age-resolved Galactic surface brightness profile in an unprecedentedly wide radial range from ${\rm R=0}$ to 17~kpc. We find a broken surface brightness profile with a nearly flat distribution between 3.5 and 7.5 kpc, which results in a half-light radius of 5.75$\pm$0.38 kpc, significantly larger than the scale-length inferred from the canonical single-exponential disk profile but in good consistency with local disk galaxies of similar mass. Because our density profile can be decomposed by stellar age and extrapolated backwards in time, we can also confirm that the size history of the Milky Way is broadly consistent with high-redshift galaxies but with systematically smaller size at each look back time. Our results suggest that the Milky Way is a typical disk galaxy regarding its size and has likely experienced inefficient secular size growth.</description>
