      <title>Region of Attraction Estimation for Free-Floating Systems under Time-Varying LQR Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future Active Debris Removal (ADR) and On Orbit Servicing (OOS) missions demand for elaborate closed loop controllers. Feasible control architectures should take into consideration the inherent coupling of the free floating dynamics and the kinematics of the system. Recently, Time-Varying Linear Quadratic Regulators (TVLQR) have been used to stabilize underactuated systems that exhibit a similar kinodynamic coupling. Furthermore, this control approach integrates synergistically with Lyapunov based region of attraction (ROA) estimation, which, in the context of ADR and OOS, allows for reasoning about composability of different sub-maneuvers. In this paper, TVLQR was used to stabilize an ADR detumbling maneuver in simulation. Moreover, the ROA of the closed loop dynamics was estimated using a probabilistic method. In order to demonstrate the real-world applicability for free floating robots, further experiments were conducted onboard a free floating testbed.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Optimization of Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers Considering Usage-Based Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a techno-economic optimization model for evaluating the design and operation of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, crucial for hydrogen production powered by variable renewable electricity. This model integrates a 0-D physics representation of the electrolyzer stack, complete mass and energy balances, operational constraints, and empirical data on use-dependent degradation. Utilizing a decomposition approach, the model predicts optimal electrolyzer size, operation, and necessary hydrogen storage to satisfy baseload demands across various technology and electricity price scenarios. Analysis for 2022 shows that including degradation effects raises the levelized cost of hydrogen from \$4.56/kg to \$6.60/kg and decreases stack life to two years. However, projections for 2030 anticipate a significant reduction in costs to approximately \$2.50/kg due to lower capital expenses, leading to larger stacks, extended lifetimes, and less hydrogen storage. This approach is adaptable to other electrochemical systems relevant for decarbonization.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Reinforcement Learning and Run Time Assurance for Spacecraft Inspection Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-orbit spacecraft inspection is an important capability for enabling servicing and manufacturing missions and extending the life of spacecraft. However, as space operations become increasingly more common and complex, autonomous control methods are needed to reduce the burden on operators to individually monitor each mission. In order for autonomous control methods to be used in space, they must exhibit safe behavior that demonstrates robustness to real world disturbances and uncertainty. In this paper, neural network controllers (NNCs) trained with reinforcement learning are used to solve an inspection task, which is a foundational capability for servicing missions. Run time assurance (RTA) is used to assure safety of the NNC in real time, enforcing several different constraints on position and velocity. The NNC and RTA are tested in the real world using unmanned aerial vehicles designed to emulate spacecraft dynamics. The results show this emulation is a useful demonstration of the capability of the NNC and RTA, and the algorithms demonstrate robustness to real world disturbances.</description>

      <title>Space Processor Computation Time Analysis for Reinforcement Learning and Run Time Assurance Control Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of spacecraft on orbit continues to grow, it is challenging for human operators to constantly monitor and plan for all missions. Autonomous control methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) have the power to solve complex tasks while reducing the need for constant operator intervention. By combining RL solutions with run time assurance (RTA), safety of these systems can be assured in real time. However, in order to use these algorithms on board a spacecraft, they must be able to run in real time on space grade processors, which are typically outdated and less capable than state-of-the-art equipment. In this paper, multiple RL-trained neural network controllers (NNCs) and RTA algorithms were tested on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and radiation tolerant processors. The results show that all NNCs and most RTA algorithms can compute optimal and safe actions in well under 1 second with room for further optimization before deploying in the real world.</description>

      <title>Site-dependent Solutions of Wave Energy Converter Farms with Surrogate Models, Control Co-design, and Layout Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design of wave energy converter farms entails multiple domains that are coupled, and thus, their concurrent representation and consideration in early-stage design optimization has the potential to offer new insights and promising solutions with improved performance. Concurrent optimization of physical attributes (e.g., plant) and the control system design is often known as control co-design or CCD. To further improve performance, the layout of the farm must be carefully optimized in order to ensure that constructive effects from hydrodynamic interactions are leveraged, while destructive effects are avoided. The variations in the joint probability distribution of waves, stemming from distinct site locations, affect the farm's performance and can potentially influence decisions regarding optimal plant selection, control strategies, and layout configurations. Therefore, this paper undertakes a concurrent exploration of control co-design and layout optimization for a farm comprising five devices, modeled as heaving cylinders in the frequency domain, situated across four distinct site locations: Alaskan Coasts, East Coast, Pacific Islands, and West Coast. The challenge of efficiently and accurately estimating hydrodynamic coefficients within the optimization loop was mitigated through the application of surrogate modeling and many-body expansion principles. Results indicate the optimized solutions exhibit variations in plant, control, and layout for each candidate site, signifying the importance of system-level design with environmental considerations from the early stages of the design process.</description>

      <title>Coherent Design of Wind Turbine Controllers Considering Transitions between Operating Regions using Fuzzy Membership Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a coherent design of wind turbine controllers with explicit consideration of transitions between operating regions by fuzzy membership functions. In improving the design process of wind turbines, the transitions between partial-load operation by torque control and full-load operation by pitch control need to be systematically considered. From the first view, fuzzy methods for blending separately designed control laws are an obvious choice. However, valid design rules must be developed to ensure stability and performance during the transition. A model-based control design procedure in the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy framework using the sector nonlinearity method is proposed to achieve the above control design objectives. In addition to a detailed mathematical analysis of the design, the method's applicability is verified by simulation studies using a high-fidelity reference wind turbine model.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Power System Dynamic Simulations using a Deep Equilibrium Layer and Neural ODE Surrogate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm for power system dynamic simulation is to build system-level simulations by combining physics-based models of individual components. The sheer size of the system along with the rapid integration of inverter-based resources exacerbates the computational burden of running time domain simulations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven surrogate model based on implicit machine learning -- specifically deep equilibrium layers and neural ordinary differential equations -- to learn a reduced order model of a portion of the full underlying system. The data-driven surrogate achieves similar accuracy and reduction in simulation time compared to a physics-based surrogate, without the constraint of requiring detailed knowledge of the underlying dynamic models. This work also establishes key requirements needed to integrate the surrogate into existing simulation workflows; the proposed surrogate is initialized to a steady state operating point that matches the power flow solution by design.</description>

      <title>Model Reference Control for Wind Turbine Systems in Full Load Region based on Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Model Reference Control (MRC) approach for wind turbine (WT) systems in the full load region employing a fuzzy Parallel Distribution Compensation Controller (PDC-C) derived using a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy System approach. Through first-order Taylor series expansion, local linear submodels are generated and combined via triangular membership functions to develop a TS descriptor model. From here, the MRC PDC-C is synthesized by a constrained LMI optimization procedure, including damping characteristics of the elastic drive train, to track the desired rotor speed and generator torque based on the reference model dynamics. The controller is tested on the nonlinear WT model in simulation studies under various wind conditions, such as turbulent wind, wind gusts, and a Fault Ride Through (FRT) scenario where the generator torque is set to 0 p.u. for 150 ms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of controlling the temporal dynamics of complex nonlinear network-coupled dynamical systems, specifically in terms of neurodynamics. Based on the Lyapunov direct method, we derive a control strategy with theoretical guarantees of controllability. To verify the performance of the derived control strategy, we perform numerical experiments on two nonlinear network-coupled dynamical systems that emulate phase synchronization and neural population dynamics. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our control strategy.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-aided Edge Learning in Distribution System State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution system state estimation (DSSE) plays a crucial role in the real-time monitoring, control, and operation of distribution networks. Besides intensive computational requirements, conventional DSSE methods need high-quality measurements to obtain accurate states, whereas missing values often occur due to sensor failures or communication delays. To address these challenging issues, a forecast-then-estimate framework of edge learning is proposed for DSSE, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to forecast missing measurements and provide pseudo-measurements. Firstly, natural language-based prompts and measurement sequences are integrated by the proposed LLM to learn patterns from historical data and provide accurate forecasting results. Secondly, a convolutional layer-based neural network model is introduced to improve the robustness of state estimation under missing measurement. Thirdly, to alleviate the overfitting of the deep learning-based DSSE, it is reformulated as a multi-task learning framework containing shared and task-specific layers. The uncertainty weighting algorithm is applied to find the optimal weights to balance different tasks. The numerical simulation on the Simbench case is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed forecast-then-estimate framework.</description>

      <title>Robust Online Convex Optimization for Disturbance Rejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online convex optimization (OCO) is a powerful tool for learning sequential data, making it ideal for high precision control applications where the disturbances are arbitrary and unknown in advance. However, the ability of OCO-based controllers to accurately learn the disturbance while maintaining closed-loop stability relies on having an accurate model of the plant. This paper studies the performance of OCO-based controllers for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to disturbance and model uncertainty. The model uncertainty can cause the closed-loop to become unstable. We provide a sufficient condition for robust stability based on the small gain theorem. This condition is easily incorporated as an on-line constraint in the OCO controller. Finally, we verify via numerical simulations that imposing the robust stability condition on the OCO controller ensures closed-loop stability.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Simulation of a Resilient Control Center for Inverter-Based Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of installed remote terminal units (RTU) is on the rise, increasing the observability and control of the power system. RTUs enable sending data to and receiving data from a control center in the power system. A distribution grid control center runs distribution management system (DMS) algorithms, where the DMS takes control actions during transients and outages, such as tripping a circuit breaker and disconnecting a controllable load to increase the resiliency of the grid. Relying on communication-based devices makes the control center vulnerable to cyberattacks, and attackers can send falsified data to the control center to cause disturbances or power outages. Previous work has conducted research on developing ways to detect a cyberattack and ways to mitigate the adverse effects of the attack. This work studies false data injection (FDI) attacks on the DMS algorithm of a fully inverter-based microgrid in real time. The fully inverter-based microgrid is simulated using an RTDS, an amplifier, an electronic load, a server, a network switch, and a router. The DMS is integrated into the server codes and exchanges data with RTDS through TCP/IP protocols. Moreover, a recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm is used to detect and mitigate the cyberattack. The effectiveness of the detection and mitigation algorithm is tested under various scenarios using the real-time testbed.</description>

      <title>Memory-Based Set Point Modulation for Improved Transient Response of Distributed Energy Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the composition of the power grid evolves to integrate more renewable generation, its reliance on distributed energy resources (DER) is increasing. Existing DERs are often controlled with proportional integral (PI) controllers that, if not properly tuned or if system parameters change, exhibit sluggish performance or large overshoot. The use of set point automatic adjustment with correction-enabled (SPAACE) with a linear predictor improves the transient response of these DERs without the need to access the PI controller parameters. The limitation of the existing SPAACE method is the high sampling rate needed for improved performance, which is not always practical. This paper proposes the addition of a memory term to the SPAACE with a linear predictor. This memory term is the integral of the errors of previous samples, which adds another layer to the prediction to improve the response at lower sampling rates and further reduces the overshoot and settling time compared to the existing SPAACE method. Time-domain simulation studies are performed in PSCAD/EMTDC to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Guided Flexible Origami Robot toward Long-Term Phototherapy of H. pylori in the Stomach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helicobacter pylori, a pervasive bacterial infection associated with gastrointestinal disorders such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer, impacts approximately 50% of the global population. The efficacy of standard clinical eradication therapies is diminishing due to the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains, necessitating alternative treatment strategies. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) emerges as a promising prospect in this context. This study presents the development and implementation of a magnetically-guided origami robot, incorporating flexible printed circuit units for sustained and stable phototherapy of Helicobacter pylori. Each integrated unit is equipped with wireless charging capabilities, producing an optimal power output that can concurrently illuminate up to 15 LEDs at their maximum intensity. Crucially, these units can be remotely manipulated via a magnetic field, facilitating both translational and rotational movements. We propose an open-loop manual control sequence that allows the formation of a stable, compliant triangular structure through the interaction of internal magnets. This adaptable configuration is uniquely designed to withstand the dynamic squeezing environment prevalent in real-world gastric applications. The research herein represents a significant stride in leveraging technology for innovative medical solutions, particularly in the management of antibiotic-resistant Helicobacter pylori infections.</description>

      <title>Timely Offloading in Mobile Edge Cloud Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future real-time applications like smart cities will use complex Machine Learning (ML) models for a variety of tasks. Timely status information is required for these applications to be reliable. Offloading computation to a mobile edge cloud (MEC) can reduce the completion time of these tasks. However, using the MEC may come at a cost such as related to use of a cloud service or privacy. In this paper, we consider a source that generates time-stamped status updates for delivery to a monitor after processing by the mobile device or MEC. We study how a scheduler must forward these updates to achieve timely updates at the monitor but also limit MEC usage. We measure timeliness at the monitor using the age of information (AoI) metric. We formulate this problem as an infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with an average cost criterion. We prove that an optimal scheduling policy has an age-threshold structure that depends on how long an update has been in service.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Protection and Fault Identification of 100% Inverter-Based Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 100% inverter-based renewable units are becoming more prevalent, introducing new challenges in the protection of microgrids that incorporate these resources. This is particularly due to low fault currents and bidirectional flows. Previous work has studied the protection of microgrids with high penetration of inverter-interfaced distributed generators; however, very few have studied the protection of a 100% inverter-based microgrid. This work proposes machine learning (ML)-based protection solutions using local electrical measurements that consider implementation challenges and effectively combine short-circuit fault detection and type identification. A decision tree method is used to analyze a wide range of fault scenarios. PSCAD/EMTDC simulation environment is used to create a dataset for training and testing the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is examined under seven distinct fault types, each featuring varying fault resistance, in a 100% inverter-based microgrid consisting of four inverters.</description>

The internal state variable of the two terminal devices is estimated using a delay system that uses a few electrical components related to a suggested equivalent circuit of the device. Finally, we tested the proposed model against measured data from devices fabricated by Western Digital Research.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Control-Koopman Operator Learning: Flexible and Scalable Models for Prediction and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearity of Koopman operators and simplicity of their estimators coupled with model-reduction capabilities has lead to their great popularity in applications for learning dynamical systems. While nonparametric Koopman operator learning in infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is well understood for autonomous systems, its control system analogues are largely unexplored. Addressing systems with control inputs in a principled manner is crucial for fully data-driven learning of controllers, especially since existing approaches commonly resort to representational heuristics or parametric models of limited expressiveness and scalability. We address the aforementioned challenge by proposing a universal framework via control-affine reproducing kernels that enables direct estimation of a single operator even for control systems. The proposed approach, called control-Koopman operator regression (cKOR), is thus completely analogous to Koopman operator regression of the autonomous case. First in the literature, we present a nonparametric framework for learning Koopman operator representations of nonlinear control-affine systems that does not suffer from the curse of control input dimensionality. This allows for reformulating the infinite-dimensional learning problem in a finite-dimensional space based solely on data without apriori loss of precision due to a restriction to a finite span of functions or inputs as in other approaches. For enabling applications to large-scale control systems, we also enhance the scalability of control-Koopman operator estimators by leveraging random projections (sketching). The efficacy of our novel cKOR approach is demonstrated on both forecasting and control tasks.</description>

      <title>Graph neural networks for power grid operational risk assessment under evolving grid topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to identify risky conditions in a power grid over the subsequent few hours, without explicit, high-resolution information regarding future generator on/off status (grid topology) or power dispatch decisions. The GNNs are trained using supervised learning, to predict the power grid's aggregated bus-level (either zonal or system-level) or individual branch-level state under different power supply and demand conditions. The variability of the stochastic grid variables (wind/solar generation and load demand), and their statistical correlations, are rigorously considered while generating the inputs for the training data. The outputs in the training data, obtained by solving numerous mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimal power flow problems, correspond to system-level, zonal and transmission line-level quantities of interest (QoIs). The QoIs predicted by the GNNs are used to conduct hours-ahead, sampling-based reliability and risk assessment w.r.t. zonal and system-level (load shedding) as well as branch-level (overloading) failure events. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for three synthetic grids with sizes ranging from 118 to 2848 buses. Our results demonstrate that GNNs are capable of providing fast and accurate prediction of QoIs and can be good proxies for computationally expensive MILP algorithms. The excellent accuracy of GNN-based reliability and risk assessment suggests that GNN models can substantially improve situational awareness by quickly providing rigorous reliability and risk estimates.</description>

      <title>Advocating Feedback Control for Human-Earth System Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a feedback control perspective for Human-Earth Systems (HESs) which essentially are complex systems that capture the interactions between humans and nature. Recent attention in HES research has been directed towards devising strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation, aimed at achieving environmental and societal objectives. However, existing approaches heavily rely on HES models, which inherently suffer from inaccuracies due to the complexity of the system. Moreover, overly detailed models often prove impractical for optimization tasks. We propose a framework inheriting from feedback control strategies the robustness against model errors, because inaccuracies are mitigated using measurements retrieved from the field. The framework comprises two nested control loops. The outer loop computes the optimal inputs to the HES, which are then implemented by actuators controlled in the inner loop. Potential fields of applications are also identified.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Variance Recursive State Estimation for 2-D Systems: When Asynchronous Multi-Channel Delays meet Energy Harvesting Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the state estimation problem for two-dimensional systems with asynchronous multichannel delays and energy harvesting constraints. In the system, each smart sensor has a certain probability of harvesting energy from the external environment, the authorized transmission between the sensor and the remote filter is contingent upon the current energy level of the sensor, which results in intermittent transmission of observation information. Addressing the issue of incomplete observation information due to asynchronous multi-channel delays, a novel approach for observation partition reconstruction is proposed to convert the delayed activated observation sequences into equivalent delay-free activated observation sequences. Through generating spatial equivalency validation, it is found that the reconstructed delay-free activated observation sequences contain the same information as the original delayed activated observation sequences. Based on the reconstructed activated observation sequence and activated probability, a novel unbiased h+1-step recursive estimator is constructed. Then, the evolution of the probability distribution of the energy level is discussed. The estimation gains are obtained by minimizing the filtering error covariance. Subsequently, through parameter assumptions, a uniform lower bound and a recursive upper bound for the filtering error covariance are presented. And the monotonicity analysis of activated probability on estimation performance is given. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed estimation scheme is verified through a numerical simulation example.</description>

      <title>Coded Event-triggered Control for Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a Coded Event-triggered Control (CEC) for a class of nonlinear systems under any initial condition. To reduce communication burden, the CEC is designed from the encoding-decoding viewpoint by which only $m$-length string is transmitted for each communication between CEC and actuator. If a more general Entry Capture Problem is encountered, such control design will be rather complicated yet challenging where the performance constraints are satisfied some time after (rather than from the beginning of) system operation, rendering normally employed prescribed performance control invalid because they may be not defined in the initial interval. By introducing auxiliary functions, we develop a Self-adjustable Prescribed Performance (SPP) mechanism which can flexibly adjust the symmetric or asymmetric performance boundaries to accommodate different initial conditions, providing an effective solution for the underlying tracking problem. In this way, the resulted CEC can not only consume less communication resources but also regulate the tracking error under any initial condition into an allowable set before a given time in a bounded and customizable manner. Simulation results verify and clarify the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Model Order Reduction for Nonlinear DAE Models of Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the joint reduction of dynamic states (internal states of generator, solar, and loads, etc) and algebraic variables (states of the network e.g., voltage and phase angles) of a nonlinear differential-algebraic equation (NDAE) model of power networks. Traditionally, in the current literature of power systemmodel order reduction (MOR), the algebraic constraints are usually neglected and the power network is commonly modeled via a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) instead of NDAEs. Thus, reduction is usually carried out for the dynamic states only and the algebraic variables are kept intact. This leaves a significant part of the system's size and complexity unreduced. This paper addresses this aforementioned limitation, by jointly reducing both dynamic and algebraic variables. As compared to the literature the proposedMOR techniques herein are endowed with the following features: (i) no system linearization is required, (ii) requires no transformation to an equivalent or approximate ODE representation, (iii) guarantee that the reduced order model to be NDAE and thus preserves the differential-algebraic structure of original power system model, and (iv) can seamlessly reduce both dynamic and algebraic variables while maintaining high accuracy. Case studies performed on a 2000-bus power system reveal that the proposedMOR techniques are able to reduce system order while maintaining accuracy</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Access Control Models in Edge Computing: Challenges, Solutions, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many contemporary applications, including smart homes and autonomous vehicles, rely on the Internet of Things technology. While cloud computing provides a multitude of valuable services for these applications, it generally imposes constraints on latency-sensitive applications due to the significant propagation delays. As a complementary technique to cloud computing, edge computing situates computing resources closer to the data sources, which reduces the latency and simultaneously alleviates the bandwidth pressure for the cloud and enhances data security. While edge computing offers significant advantages, it also presents significant challenges in access control -- a critical component for safeguarding data. For instance, it is crucial to implement access control mechanisms that are both effective and efficient on resource-constrained devices, ensuring high security without compromising the inherent low latency benefits of edge computing. These challenges drive the development of innovative access control solutions tailored to meet the unique requirements of edge computing environments. We classify related references from the perspectives of multiple data lifecycles (including data collection, storage, and usage), which thoroughly investigates the access control techniques and helps readers understand them systematically. Finally, we reflect on the classification and envisage future research directions.</description>

      <title>Contract-Based Design for Hybrid Dynamical Systems and Invariance Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes fundamental principles for verifying contract for interconnected hybrid systems. When system's hybrid arcs conform to the contract for a certain duration but subsequently violate it, the composition of hybrid dynamical systems becomes challenging. The objective of this work is to analyze the temporal satisfaction of the contract, allowing us to reason about the compositions that do not violate the contract up to a certain point in a hybrid time. Notions of weak and strong satisfaction of an assume-guarantee contract are introduced. These semantics permits the compositional reasoning on hybrid systems of varying complexity depending on the interconnection's type, feedback or cascade. The results show that both semantics are compatible with cascade composition, while strong semantic is required for feedback composition. Moreover, we have shown how one can go from weak to strong contract satisfaction. Finally, we have studied a particular class of hybrid systems and we have shown that the concept of forward (pre-)invariant relative to a contract makes it possible to deal with feedback compositions. These results are demonstrated throughout the paper with simple numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Second-Order Audio VCO-ADC with 103-dB-A Dynamic Range and Binary-Weighted Internal Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the limitations of conventional VCO-ADCs is the restriction to first-order noise shaping. True-VCO architectures have been proposed to increase the noise-shaping order by cascading several VCO integrators, but without requiring analog feedback loops. A high noise shaping order allows to reduce the input VCO frequency compared to a conventional VCO-ADC with similar dynamic range, which improves power consumption. Prior-art True-VCO architectures represent state variables either with a thermometer code or with a single-bit. Thermometer encoding is a natural choice when ring oscillators are selected as loop filter integrators. However, chip area restrictions force thermometer-encoded state variables to have few levels. A reduced number of levels in the state variables limits the dynamic range of True VCO-ADCs. In this paper, we show experimentally a second-order audio VCO-based ADC which uses ring oscillators as integrators but employs Gray and binary encoding for state variables. As a consequence, the complexity and area of the True-VCO architecture is reduced, breaking the barrier that limits the dynamic range of prior designs. The implemented chip shows a dynamic range of 103~dB achieving a peak SNDR of 76.5 dB-A with a power of 250 $\mu$W occupying 0.095 $\text{mm}^2$ in 130 nm CMOS.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Circular Motion Within Nonconcentric Circular Boundary: A Mobius Transformation-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonuniform motion constraints are ubiquitous in robotic applications. Geofencing control is one such paradigm where the motion of a robot must be constrained within a predefined boundary. This paper addresses the problem of stabilizing a unicycle robot around a desired circular orbit while confining its motion within a nonconcentric external circular boundary. Our solution approach relies on the concept of the so-called Mobius transformation that, under certain practical conditions, maps two nonconcentric circles to a pair of concentric circles, and hence, results in uniform spatial motion constraints. The choice of such a Mobius transformation is governed by the roots of a quadratic equation in the post-design analysis that decides how the regions enclosed by the two circles are mapped onto the two planes. We show that the problem can be formulated either as a trajectory-constraining problem or an obstacle-avoidance problem in the transformed plane, depending on these roots. Exploiting the idea of the barrier Lyapunov function, we propose a unique control law that solves both these contrasting problems in the transformed plane and renders a solution to the original problem in the actual plane. By relating parameters of two planes under Mobius transformation and its inverse map, we further establish a connection between the control laws in two planes and determine the control law to be applied in the actual plane. Simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the key theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Chained Flexible Capsule Endoscope: Unraveling the Conundrum of Size Limitations and Functional Integration for Gastrointestinal Transitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capsule endoscopes, predominantly serving diagnostic functions, provide lucid internal imagery but are devoid of surgical or therapeutic capabilities. Consequently, despite lesion detection, physicians frequently resort to traditional endoscopic or open surgical procedures for treatment, resulting in more complex, potentially risky interventions. To surmount these limitations, this study introduces a chained flexible capsule endoscope (FCE) design concept, specifically conceived to navigate the inherent volume constraints of capsule endoscopes whilst augmenting their therapeutic functionalities. The FCE's distinctive flexibility originates from a conventional rotating joint design and the incision pattern in the flexible material. In vitro experiments validated the passive navigation ability of the FCE in rugged intestinal tracts. Further, the FCE demonstrates consistent reptile-like peristalsis under the influence of an external magnetic field, and possesses the capability for film expansion and disintegration under high-frequency electromagnetic stimulation. These findings illuminate a promising path toward amplifying the therapeutic capacities of capsule endoscopes without necessitating a size compromise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving era of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the emphasis has moved from mere data collection to strategically obtaining timely and relevant data within the Internet of Drones (IoDs) ecosystem. However, the unpredictable conditions in dynamic IoDs pose safety challenges for drones. Addressing this, our approach introduces a multi-UAV framework using spatial-temporal clustering and the Frechet distance for enhancing reliability. Seamlessly coupled with Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), it enhances the precision and agility of UAV networks. Our Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism ensures UAVs adapt strategies through ongoing environmental interactions and enhancing intelligent sensing. This focus ensures operational safety and efficiency, considering data capture and transmission viability. By evaluating the relevance of the sensed information, we can communicate only the most crucial data variations beyond a set threshold and optimize bandwidth usage. Our methodology transforms the UAV domain, transitioning drones from data gatherers to adept information orchestrators, establishing a benchmark for efficiency and adaptability in modern aerial systems.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for distributed time delay identification based on a mixed Erlang kernel approximation and the linear chain trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delays are ubiquitous in industry and nature, and they significantly affect both transient dynamics and stability properties. Consequently, it is often necessary to identify and account for the delays when, e.g., designing a model-based control strategy. However, identifying delays in differential equations is not straightforward and requires specialized methods. Therefore, we propose an algorithm for identifying distributed delays in delay differential equations (DDEs) that only involves simulation of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, we 1) approximate the kernel in the DDEs (also called the memory function) by the probability density function of a mixed Erlang distribution and 2) use the linear chain trick (LCT) to transform the resulting DDEs into ODEs. Finally, the parameters in the kernel approximation are estimated as the solution to a dynamical least-squares problem, and we use a single-shooting approach to approximate this solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm using numerical examples that involve the logistic equation and a point reactor kinetics model of a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.</description>

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of Non-Conventional Internet of Things (NC IoT), which is focused on the usefulness of information as opposed to the notion of high volume data collection and transmission, will be an important and dominant part of human life in the near future. This paper proposes a novel semantic-based approach for addressing the unique challenges posed by underwater NC IoT. We present an intelligent sensing strategy for exploring the semantics of the underwater environment by judiciously selecting the data to transmit, thereby minimizing redundancy for utmost relevant data transmission. We introduce an evolutionary function for the selection of the semantic-empowered messages relevant to the specific task within a minimum Age of Information (AoI), a freshness metric of the collected information, and for monitoring the underwater environment for performance optimization. A DNN-empowered Bayesian integrated with an adaptive surrogate model optimization will determine the optimal placement strategy of the sensors and the uncertainty level of the underwater landscape. An Adaptive Expected Improvement (AEI) mechanism is introduced to predict the optimal arrival rate for enabling a synchronized data sensing and transmission ecosystem, ensuring efficiency and timeliness. Simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Structured Reinforcement Learning for Incentivized Stochastic Covert Optimization</title>

Abstract: This paper studies how a stochastic gradient algorithm (SG) can be controlled to hide the estimate of the local stationary point from an eavesdropper. Such problems are of significant interest in distributed optimization settings like federated learning and inventory management. A learner queries a stochastic oracle and incentivizes the oracle to obtain noisy gradient measurements and perform SG. The oracle probabilistically returns either a noisy gradient of the function} or a non-informative measurement, depending on the oracle state and incentive. The learner's query and incentive are visible to an eavesdropper who wishes to estimate the stationary point. This paper formulates the problem of the learner performing covert optimization by dynamically incentivizing the stochastic oracle and obfuscating the eavesdropper as a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP). Using conditions for interval-dominance on the cost and transition probability structure, we show that the optimal policy for the MDP has a monotone threshold structure. We propose searching for the optimal stationary policy with the threshold structure using a stochastic approximation algorithm and a multi-armed bandit approach. The effectiveness of our methods is numerically demonstrated on a covert federated learning hate-speech classification task.</description>

      <title>Compressed Online Learning of Conditional Mean Embedding</title>

Abstract: The conditional mean embedding (CME) encodes Markovian stochastic kernels through their actions on probability distributions embedded within the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The CME plays a key role in several well-known machine learning tasks such as reinforcement learning, analysis of dynamical systems, etc. We present an algorithm to learn the CME incrementally from data via an operator-valued stochastic gradient descent. As is well-known, function learning in RKHS suffers from scalability challenges from large data. We utilize a compression mechanism to counter the scalability challenge. The core contribution of this paper is a finite-sample performance guarantee on the last iterate of the online compressed operator learning algorithm with fast-mixing Markovian samples, when the target CME may not be contained in the hypothesis space. We illustrate the efficacy of our algorithm by applying it to the analysis of an example dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Deception in Differential Games: Information Limiting Strategy to Induce Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can deception exist in differential games? We provide a case study for a Turret-Attacker differential game, where two Attackers seek to score points by reaching a target region while a Turret tries to minimize the score by aligning itself with the Attackers before they reach the target. In contrast to the original problem solved with complete information, we assume that the Turret only has partial information about the maximum speed of the Attackers. We investigate whether there is any incentive for the Attackers to move slower than their maximum speed in order to ``deceive'' the Turret into taking suboptimal actions. We first describe the existence of a dilemma that the Turret may face. Then we derive a set of initial conditions from which the Attackers can force the Turret into a situation where it must take a guess.</description>

      <title>A Class of Convex Optimization-Based Recursive Algorithms for Identification of Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Focusing on identification, this paper develops a class of convex optimization-based criteria and correspondingly the recursive algorithms to estimate the parameter vector $\theta^{*}$ of a stochastic dynamic system. Not only do the criteria include the classical least-squares estimator but also the $L_l=|\cdot|^l, l\geq 1$, the Huber, the Log-cosh, and the Quantile costs as special cases. First, we prove that the minimizers of the convex optimization-based criteria converge to $\theta^{*}$ with probability one. Second, the recursive algorithms are proposed to find the estimates, which minimize the convex optimization-based criteria, and it is shown that these estimates also converge to the true parameter vector with probability one. Numerical examples are given, justifying the performance of the proposed algorithms including the strong consistency of the estimates, the robustness against outliers in the observations, and higher efficiency in online computation compared with the kernel-based regularization method due to the recursive nature.</description>

      <title>Multi-AUV Kinematic Task Assignment based on Self-organizing Map Neural Network and Dubins Path Generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To deal with the task assignment problem of multi-AUV systems under kinematic constraints, which means steering capability constraints for underactuated AUVs or other vehicles likely, an improved task assignment algorithm is proposed combining the Dubins Path algorithm with improved SOM neural network algorithm. At first, the aimed tasks are assigned to the AUVs by improved SOM neural network method based on workload balance and neighborhood function. When there exists kinematic constraints or obstacles which may cause failure of trajectory planning, task re-assignment will be implemented by change the weights of SOM neurals, until the AUVs can have paths to reach all the targets. Then, the Dubins paths are generated in several limited cases. AUV's yaw angle is limited, which result in new assignments to the targets. Computation flow is designed so that the algorithm in MATLAB and Python can realizes the path planning to multiple targets. Finally, simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm can effectively accomplish the task assignment task for multi-AUV system.</description>

      <title>Koopman Analysis of the Singularly-Perturbed van der Pol Oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator framework holds promise for spectral analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems based on linear operators. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator, so-called Koopman eigenvalues and Koopman eigenfunctions, respectively, mirror global properties of the system's flow. In this paper we perform the Koopman analysis of the singularly-perturbed van der Pol system. First, we show the spectral signature depending on singular perturbation: how two Koopman principle eigenvalues are ordered and what distinct shapes emerge in their associated Koopman eigenfunctions. Second, we discuss the singular limit of the Koopman operator, which is derived through the concatenation of Koopman operators for the fast and slow subsystems. From the spectral properties of the Koopman operator for the singularl-perturbed system and the singular limit, we suggest that the Koopman eigenfunctions inherit geometric properties of the singularly-perturbed system. These results are applicable to general planar singularly-perturbed systems with stable limit cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive conditions for the identifiability of nonlinear networks characterized by additive dynamics at the level of the edges when all the nodes are excited. In contrast to linear systems, we show that the measurement of all sinks is necessary and sufficient for the identifiability of directed acyclic graphs, under the assumption that dynamics are described by analytic functions without constant terms (i.e., $f(0)=0$). But if constant terms are present, then the identifiability is impossible as soon as one node has more than one in-neighbor. In the case of general digraphs where cycles can exist, we consider additively separable functions for the analysis of the identifiability, and we show that the measurement of one node of all the sinks of the condensation digraph is necessary and sufficient. Several examples are added to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Quality of Experience Optimization for Real-time XR Video Transmission with Energy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) is an important service in the 5G network and in future 6G networks. In contrast to traditional video on demand services, real-time XR video is transmitted frame-by-frame, requiring low latency and being highly sensitive to network fluctuations. In this paper, we model the quality of experience (QoE) for real-time XR video transmission on a frame-by-frame basis. Based on the proposed QoE model, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes QoE with constraints on wireless resources and long-term energy consumption. We utilize Lyapunov optimization to transform the original problem into a single-frame optimization problem and then allocate wireless subchannels. We propose an adaptive XR video bitrate algorithm that employs a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm for video bitrate selection. Through numerical results, we show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms, with the average QoE improvements of 0.04 to 0.46. Specifically, compared to baseline algorithms, the proposed algorithm reduces average video quality variations by 29% to 50% and improves the frame transmission success rate by 5% to 48%.</description>

      <title>A Decentralized and Self-Adaptive Approach for Monitoring Volatile Edge Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge computing provides resources for IoT workloads at the network edge. Monitoring systems are vital for efficiently managing resources and application workloads by collecting, storing, and providing relevant information about the state of the resources. However, traditional monitoring systems have a centralized architecture for both data plane and control plane, which increases latency, creates a failure bottleneck, and faces challenges in providing quick and trustworthy data in volatile edge environments, especially where infrastructures are often built upon failure-prone, unsophisticated computing and network resources. Thus, we propose DEMon, a decentralized, self-adaptive monitoring system for edge. DEMon leverages the stochastic gossip communication protocol at its core. It develops efficient protocols for information dissemination, communication, and retrieval, avoiding a single point of failure and ensuring fast and trustworthy data access. Its decentralized control enables self-adaptive management of monitoring parameters, addressing the trade-offs between the quality of service of monitoring and resource consumption. We implement the proposed system as a lightweight and portable container-based system and evaluate it through experiments. We also present a use case demonstrating its feasibility. The results show that DEMon efficiently disseminates and retrieves the monitoring information, addressing the challenges of edge monitoring.</description>

      <title>KG-Planner: Knowledge-Informed Graph Neural Planning for Collaborative Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel knowledge-informed graph neural planner (KG-Planner) to address the challenge of efficiently planning collision-free motions for robots in high-dimensional spaces, considering both static and dynamic environments involving humans. Unlike traditional motion planners that struggle with finding a balance between efficiency and optimality, the KG-Planner takes a different approach. Instead of relying solely on a neural network or imitating the motions of an oracle planner, our KG-Planner integrates explicit physical knowledge from the workspace. The integration of knowledge has two key aspects: (1) we present an approach to design a graph that can comprehensively model the workspace's compositional structure. The designed graph explicitly incorporates critical elements such as robot joints, obstacles, and their interconnections. This representation allows us to capture the intricate relationships between these elements. (2) We train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that excels at generating nearly optimal robot motions. In particular, the GNN employs a layer-wise propagation rule to facilitate the exchange and update of information among workspace elements based on their connections. This propagation emphasizes the influence of these elements throughout the planning process. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of our KG-Planner, we conduct extensive experiments in both static and dynamic environments. These experiments include scenarios with and without human workers. The results of our approach are compared against existing methods, showcasing the superior performance of the KG-Planner. A short video introduction of this work is available (video link provided in the paper).</description>

      <title>Diagnosing and Predicting Autonomous Vehicle Operational Safety Using Multiple Simulation Modalities and a Virtual Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even as technology and performance gains are made in the sphere of automated driving, safety concerns remain. Vehicle simulation has long been seen as a tool to overcome the cost associated with a massive amount of on-road testing for development and discovery of safety critical "edge-cases". However, purely software-based vehicle models may leave a large realism gap between their real-world counterparts in terms of dynamic response, and highly realistic vehicle-in-the-loop (VIL) simulations that encapsulate a virtual world around a physical vehicle may still be quite expensive to produce and similarly time intensive as on-road testing. In this work, we demonstrate an AV simulation test bed that combines the realism of vehicle-in-the-loop (VIL) simulation with the ease of implementation of model-in-the-loop (MIL) simulation. The setup demonstrated in this work allows for response diagnosis for the VIL simulations. By observing causal links between virtual weather and lighting conditions that surround the virtual depiction of our vehicle, the vision-based perception model and controller of Openpilot, and the dynamic response of our physical vehicle under test, we can draw conclusions regarding how the perceived environment contributed to vehicle response. Conversely, we also demonstrate response prediction for the MIL setup, where the need for a physical vehicle is not required to draw richer conclusions around the impact of environmental conditions on AV performance than could be obtained with VIL simulation alone. These combine for a simulation setup with accurate real-world implications for edge-case discovery that is both cost effective and time efficient to implement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there has been remarkable progress recently in the fields of manipulation and locomotion, mobile manipulation remains a long-standing challenge. Compared to locomotion or static manipulation, a mobile system must make a diverse range of long-horizon tasks feasible in unstructured and dynamic environments. While the applications are broad and interesting, there are a plethora of challenges in developing these systems such as coordination between the base and arm, reliance on onboard perception for perceiving and interacting with the environment, and most importantly, simultaneously integrating all these parts together. Prior works approach the problem using disentangled modular skills for mobility and manipulation that are trivially tied together. This causes several limitations such as compounding errors, delays in decision-making, and no whole-body coordination. In this work, we present a reactive mobile manipulation framework that uses an active visual system to consciously perceive and react to its environment. Similar to how humans leverage whole-body and hand-eye coordination, we develop a mobile manipulator that exploits its ability to move and see, more specifically -- to move in order to see and to see in order to move. This allows it to not only move around and interact with its environment but also, choose "when" to perceive "what" using an active visual system. We observe that such an agent learns to navigate around complex cluttered scenarios while displaying agile whole-body coordination using only ego-vision without needing to create environment maps.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel path-following control strategy inspired by the famous two-body problem, aiming to stabilize any Keplerian orbit. Utilizing insights from the mathematical structure of the two-body problem, we derive a robust path-following law adopting sliding mode control theory to achieve asymptotic convergence to bounded disturbances. The resulting control law is demonstrated to be asymptotically stable. Illustrative examples showcase its applicability, including orbiting an accelerated moving point, patching Keplerian trajectories for complex patterns, and orbital maintenance around the asteroid Itokawa. The proposed control law offers a significant advantage for the orbital station-keeping problem, as its sliding surface is formulated based on variables commonly used to define orbital dynamics. This inherent alignment facilitates easy application to orbital station-keeping scenarios.</description>

      <title>Encrypted Dynamic Control exploiting Limited Number of Multiplications and a Method using Ring-LWE based Cryptosystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to encrypt dynamic controllers that can be implemented through most homomorphic encryption schemes, including somewhat, leveled fully, and fully homomorphic encryption. To this end, we represent the output of the given controller as a linear combination of a fixed number of previous inputs and outputs. As a result, the encrypted controller involves only a limited number of homomorphic multiplications on every encrypted data, assuming that the output is re-encrypted and transmitted back from the actuator. A guidance for parameter choice is also provided, ensuring that the encrypted controller achieves predefined performance for an infinite time horizon. Furthermore, we propose a customization of the method for Ring-Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) based cryptosystems, where a vector of messages can be encrypted into a single ciphertext and operated simultaneously, thus reducing computation and communication loads. Unlike previous results, the proposed customization does not require extra algorithms such as rotation, other than basic addition and multiplication. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents extensions of control barrier function (CBF) theory to systems with disturbances wherein a controller only receives measurements infrequently and operates open-loop between measurements, while still satisfying state constraints. The paper considers both impulsive and continuous actuators, and models the actuators, measurements, disturbances, and timing constraints as a hybrid dynamical system. We then design an open-loop observer that bounds the worst-case uncertainty between measurements. We develop definitions of CBFs for both actuation cases, and corresponding conditions on the control input to guarantee satisfaction of the state constraints. We apply these conditions to simulations of a satellite rendezvous in an elliptical orbit and autonomous orbit stationkeeping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by empirical research on bias and opinion formation, we formulate a multidimensional nonlinear opinion-dynamical model where agents have individual biases, which are fixed, as well as opinions, which evolve. The dimensions represent competing options, of which each agent has a relative opinion, and are coupled through normalization of the opinion vector. This can capture, for example, an individual's relative trust in different media. In special cases including where biases are uniform across agents our model achieves consensus, but in general, behaviors are richer and capture multipolar opinion distributions. We examine general fixed points of the system, as well as special cases such as zero biases toward certain options or partitioned decision sets. Lastly, we demonstrate that our model exhibits polarization when biases are spatially correlated across the network, while, as empirical research suggests, a mixed community can mediate biases.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as chatbots have drawn remarkable attention thanks to their versatile capability in natural language processing as well as in a wide range of tasks. While there has been great enthusiasm towards adopting such foundational model-based artificial intelligence tools in all sectors possible, the capabilities and limitations of such LLMs in improving the operation of the electric energy sector need to be explored, and this article identifies fruitful directions in this regard. Key future research directions include data collection systems for fine-tuning LLMs, embedding power system-specific tools in the LLMs, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-based knowledge pool to improve the quality of LLM responses and LLMs in safety-critical use cases.</description>

      <title>Non-overshooting sliding mode for UAV control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a class of uncertain systems, a non-overshooting sliding mode control is presented to make them globally exponentially stable and without overshoot. Even when the unknown stochastic disturbance exists, and the time-variant reference trajectory is required, the strict non-overshooting stabilization is still achieved. The control law design is based on a desired second-order sliding mode (2-sliding mode), which successively includes two bounded-gain subsystems. Non-overshooting stability requires that the system gains depend on the initial values of system variables. In order to obtain the global non-overshooting stability, the first subsystem with non-overshooting reachability compresses the initial values of the second subsystem to a given bounded range. By partitioning these initial values, the bounded system gains are determined to satisfy the robust non-overshooting stability. In order to reject the chattering in the controller output, a tanh-function-based sliding mode is developed for the design of smoothed non-overshooting controller. The proposed method is applied to a UAV trajectory tracking when the disturbances and uncertainties exist. The control laws are designed to implement the non-overshooting stabilization in position and attitude. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the flying tests.</description>

      <title>On the constrained feedback linearization control based on the MILP representation of a ReLU-ANN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the efficacy of rectified linear unit artificial neural networks in addressing the intricate challenges of convoluted constraints arising from feedback linearization mapping. Our approach involves a comprehensive procedure, encompassing the approximation of constraints through a regression process. Subsequently, we transform these constraints into an equivalent representation of mixed-integer linear constraints, seamlessly integrating them into other stabilizing control architectures. The advantage resides in the compatibility with the linear control design and the constraint satisfaction in the model predictive control setup, even for forecasted trajectories. Simulations are provided to validate the proposed constraint reformulation.</description>

      <title>Playing Games with your PET: Extending the Partial Exploration Tool to Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present version 2.0 of the Partial Exploration Tool (PET), a tool for verification of probabilistic systems. We extend the previous version by adding support for stochastic games, based on a recent unified framework for sound value iteration algorithms. Thereby, PET2 is the first tool implementing a sound and efficient approach for solving stochastic games with objectives of the type reachability/safety and mean payoff. We complement this approach by developing and implementing a partial-exploration based variant for all three objectives. Our experimental evaluation shows that PET2 offers the most efficient partial-exploration based algorithm and is the most viable tool on SGs, even outperforming unsound tools.</description>

      <title>Stability and Performance Analysis of Discrete-Time ReLU Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents sufficient conditions for the stability and $\ell_2$-gain performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with ReLU activation functions. These conditions are derived by combining Lyapunov/dissipativity theory with Quadratic Constraints (QCs) satisfied by repeated ReLUs. We write a general class of QCs for repeated RELUs using known properties for the scalar ReLU. Our stability and performance condition uses these QCs along with a "lifted" representation for the ReLU RNN. We show that the positive homogeneity property satisfied by a scalar ReLU does not expand the class of QCs for the repeated ReLU. We present examples to demonstrate the stability / performance condition and study the effect of the lifting horizon.</description>

      <title>Deep neural network approximations for the stable manifolds of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.15350v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an infinite-horizon control problem, the optimal control can be represented by the stable manifold of the characteristic Hamiltonian system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in a semiglobal domain. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that if an approximation is sufficiently close to the exact stable manifold of the HJB equation in a certain sense, then the control derived from this approximation stabilizes the system and is nearly optimal. Then, based on the theoretical result, we propose a deep learning algorithm to approximate the stable manifold and compute optimal feedback control numerically. The algorithm relies on adaptive data generation through finding trajectories randomly within the stable manifold. Such kind of algorithm is grid-free basically, making it potentially applicable to a wide range of high-dimensional nonlinear systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through two examples: stabilizing the Reaction Wheel Pendulums and controlling the parabolic Allen-Cahn equation.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for engineering design: A unified approach of systems engineering and component-based deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13836v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven models created by machine learning, gain in importance in all fields of design and engineering. They, have high potential to assist decision-makers in creating novel, artefacts with better performance and sustainability. However,, limited generalization and the black-box nature of these models, lead to limited explainability and reusability. To overcome this, situation, we propose a component-based approach to create, partial component models by machine learning (ML). This, component-based approach aligns deep learning with systems, engineering (SE). The key contribution of the component-based, method is that activations at interfaces between the components, are interpretable engineering quantities. In this way, the, hierarchical component system forms a deep neural network, (DNN) that a priori integrates information for engineering, explainability. The, approach adapts the model structure to engineering methods of, systems engineering and to domain knowledge. We examine the, performance of the approach by the field of energy-efficient, building design: First, we observed better generalization of the, component-based method by analyzing prediction accuracy, outside the training data. Especially for representative designs, different in structure, we observe a much higher accuracy, (R2 = 0.94) compared to conventional monolithic methods, (R2 = 0.71). Second, we illustrate explainability by exemplary, demonstrating how sensitivity information from SE and rules, from low-depth decision trees serve engineering. Third, we, evaluate explainability by qualitative and quantitative methods, demonstrating the matching of preliminary knowledge and data-driven, derived strategies and show correctness of activations at, component interfaces compared to white-box simulation results, (envelope components: R2 = 0.92..0.99; zones: R2 = 0.78..0.93).</description>

      <title>Differentiable Bilevel Programming for Stackelberg Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a Stackelberg congestion game (SCG), a leader aims to maximize their own gain by anticipating and manipulating the equilibrium state at which the followers settle by playing a congestion game. Often formulated as bilevel programs, large-scale SCGs are well known for their intractability and complexity. Here, we attempt to tackle this computational challenge by marrying traditional methodologies with the latest differentiable programming techniques in machine learning. The core idea centers on replacing the lower-level equilibrium problem with a smooth evolution trajectory defined by the imitative logit dynamic (ILD), which we prove converges to the equilibrium of the congestion game under mild conditions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose two new local search algorithms for SCGs. The first is a gradient descent algorithm that obtains the derivatives by unrolling ILD via differentiable programming. Thanks to the smoothness of ILD, the algorithm promises both efficiency and scalability. The second algorithm adds a heuristic twist by cutting short the followers' evolution trajectory. Behaviorally, this means that, instead of anticipating the followers' best response at equilibrium, the leader seeks to approximate that response by only looking ahead a limited number of steps. Our numerical experiments are carried out over various instances of classic SCG applications, ranging from toy benchmarks to large-scale real-world examples. The results show the proposed algorithms are reliable and scalable local solvers that deliver high-quality solutions with greater regularity and significantly less computational effort compared to the many incumbents included in our study.</description>

      <title>On the convergence analysis of the decentralized projected gradient descent method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we are concerned with the decentralized optimization problem: \begin{equation*} \min_{x \in \Omega}~f(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f_i (x), \end{equation*} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a convex domain and each $f_i : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a local cost function only known to agent $i$. A fundamental algorithm is the decentralized projected gradient method (DPG) given by \begin{equation*}
  x_i(t+1)=\mathcal{P}_\Omega\Big[\sum^n_{j=1}w_{ij} x_j(t) -\alpha(t)\nabla f_i(x_i(t))\Big] \end{equation*} where $\mathcal{P}_{\Omega}$ is the projection operator to $\Omega$ and $ \{w_{ij}\}_{1\leq i,j \leq n}$ are communication weight among the agents. While this method has been widely used in the literature, its convergence property has not been established so far, except for the special case $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^n$. This work establishes new convergence estimates of DPG when the aggregate cost $f$ is strongly convex and each function $f_i$ is smooth. If the stepsize is given by constant $\alpha (t) \equiv\alpha &gt;0$ and suitably small, we prove that each $x_i (t)$ converges to an $O(\sqrt{\alpha})$-neighborhood of the optimal point. In addition, we further improve the convergence result by showing that the point $x_i (t)$ converges to an $O(\alpha)$-neighborhood of the optimal point if the domain is given the half-space $\mathbb{R}^{d-1}\times \mathbb{R}_{+}$ for any dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$. Also, we obtain new convergence results for decreasing stepsizes. Numerical experiments are provided to support the convergence results.</description>

      <title>FogROS2-Config: Optimizing Latency and Cost for Multi-Cloud Robot Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cloud service providers provide over 50,000 distinct and dynamically changing set of cloud server options. To help roboticists make cost-effective decisions, we present FogROS2-Config, an open toolkit that takes ROS2 nodes as input and automatically runs relevant benchmarks to quickly return a menu of cloud compute services that tradeoff latency and cost. Because it is infeasible to try every hardware configuration, FogROS2-Config quickly samples tests a small set of edge case servers. We evaluate FogROS2-Config on three robotics application tasks: visual SLAM, grasp planning. and motion planning. FogROS2-Config can reduce the cost by up to 20x. By comparing with a Pareto frontier for cost and latency by running the application task on feasible server configurations, we evaluate cost and latency models and confirm that FogROS2-Config selects efficient hardware configurations to balance cost and latency.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimization for unit commitment applied to the security of supply: extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transmission system operators employ reserves to deal with unexpected variations of demand and generation to guarantee the security of supply. The French transmission system operator RTE dynamically sizes the required margins using a probabilistic approach relying on continuous forecasts of the main drivers of the uncertainties of the system imbalance and a 1 % risk threshold. However, this criterion does not specify which means to activate upward/downward and when to face a deficit of available margins versus the required margins. Thus, this work presents a strategy using a probabilistic unit commitment with a stochastic optimization-based approach, including the fixed and variable costs of units and the costs of lost load and production. The abstract problem is formulated with a multi-stage stochastic program and approximated with a heuristic called two-stage stochastic model predictive control. It solves a sequence of two-stage stochastic programs to conduct the central dispatch. An implementation is conducted by solving an approximated version with a single two-stage stochastic program. This method is tested on a real case study comprising nuclear and fossil-based units with French electrical consumption and renewable production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation to reality (sim2real) transfer from a dynamics and controls perspective usually involves re-tuning or adapting the designed algorithms to suit real-world operating conditions, which often violates the performance guarantees established originally. This work presents a generalizable framework for achieving reliable sim2real transfer of autonomy-oriented control systems using multi-model multi-objective robust optimal control synthesis, which lends well to uncertainty handling and disturbance rejection with theoretical guarantees. Particularly, this work is centered around a novel actuation-redundant scaled autonomous vehicle called Nigel, with independent all-wheel drive and independent all-wheel steering architecture, whose enhanced configuration space bodes well for robust control applications. To this end, we present the mechatronic design, dynamics modeling, parameter identification, and robust stabilizing as well as tracking control of Nigel using the proposed framework, with exhaustive experimentation and benchmarking in simulation as well as real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Intrusion Tolerance for Networked Systems through Two-Level Feedback Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01741v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate intrusion tolerance for a system with service replicas as a two-level optimal control problem. On the local level node controllers perform intrusion recovery, and on the global level a system controller manages the replication factor. The local and global control problems can be formulated as classical problems in operations research, namely, the machine replacement problem and the inventory replenishment problem. Based on this formulation, we design TOLERANCE, a novel control architecture for intrusion-tolerant systems. We prove that the optimal control strategies on both levels have threshold structure and design efficient algorithms for computing them. We implement and evaluate TOLERANCE in an emulation environment where we run 10 types of network intrusions. The results show that TOLERANCE can improve service availability and reduce operational cost compared with state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of Energy-Efficient Wireless Tire Sensing System with Delay Analysis for Intelligent Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has led to a rise in the popularity of intelligent vehicles that incorporate a range of sensors to monitor various aspects, such as driving speed, fuel usage, distance proximity and tire anomalies. Nowadays, real-time tire sensing systems play important roles for intelligent vehicles in increasing mileage, reducing fuel consumption, improving driving safety, and reducing the potential for traffic accidents. However, the current tire sensing system drains a significant vehicle' energy and lacks effective collection of sensing data, which may not guarantee the immediacy of driving safety. Thus, this paper designs an energy-efficient wireless tire sensing system (WTSS), which leverages energy-saving techniques to significantly reduce power consumption while ensuring data retrieval delays during real-time monitoring. Additionally, we mathematically analyze the worst-case transmission delay and sensor reception ratio of the system to ensure the immediacy based on the collision probabilities of sensor transmissions. This system has been implemented and verified by the simulation and field train experiments. These results show that the proposed scheme provides enhanced performance in energy efficiency up to 76.5% in average and identifies the worst transmission delay accurately.</description>
