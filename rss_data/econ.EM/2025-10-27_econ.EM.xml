      <title>SLIM: Stochastic Learning and Inference in Overidentified Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SLIM (Stochastic Learning and Inference in overidentified Models), a scalable stochastic approximation framework for nonlinear GMM. SLIM forms iterative updates from independent mini-batches of moments and their derivatives, producing unbiased directions that ensure almost-sure convergence. It requires neither a consistent initial estimator nor global convexity and accommodates both fixed-sample and random-sampling asymptotics. We further develop an optional second-order refinement and inference procedures based on random scaling and plug-in methods, including plug-in, debiased plug-in, and online versions of the Sargan--Hansen $J$-test tailored to stochastic learning. In Monte Carlo experiments based on a nonlinear EASI demand system with 576 moment conditions, 380 parameters, and $n = 10^5$, SLIM solves the model in under 1.4 hours, whereas full-sample GMM in Stata on a powerful laptop converges only after 18 hours. The debiased plug-in $J$-test delivers satisfactory finite-sample inference, and SLIM scales smoothly to $n = 10^6$.</description>

      <title>Instance-Adaptive Hypothesis Tests with Heterogeneous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study hypothesis testing over a heterogeneous population of strategic agents with private information. Any single test applied uniformly across the population yields statistical error that is sub-optimal relative to the performance of an oracle given access to the private information. We show how it is possible to design menus of statistical contracts that pair type-optimal tests with payoff structures, inducing agents to self-select according to their private information. This separating menu elicits agent types and enables the principal to match the oracle performance even without a priori knowledge of the agent type. Our main result fully characterizes the collection of all separating menus that are instance-adaptive, matching oracle performance for an arbitrary population of heterogeneous agents. We identify designs where information elicitation is essentially costless, requiring negligible additional expense relative to a single-test benchmark, while improving statistical performance. Our work establishes a connection between proper scoring rules and menu design, showing how the structure of the hypothesis test constrains the elicitable information. Numerical examples illustrate the geometry of separating menus and the improvements they deliver in error trade-offs. Overall, our results connect statistical decision theory with mechanism design, demonstrating how heterogeneity and strategic participation can be harnessed to improve efficiency in hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Maximal Inequalities for Empirical Processes under General Mixing Conditions with an Application to Strong Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a bound for the supremum of sample averages over a class of functions for a general class of mixing stochastic processes with arbitrary mixing rates. Regardless of the speed of mixing, the bound is comprised of a concentration rate and a novel measure of complexity. The speed of mixing, however, affects the former quantity implying a phase transition. Fast mixing leads to the standard root-n concentration rate, while slow mixing leads to a slower concentration rate, its speed depends on the mixing structure. Our findings are applied to obtain new Glivenko-Cantelli type results and to derive strong approximation results for a general class of mixing processes with arbitrary mixing rates.</description>

      <title>Testing Most Influential Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small subsets of data with disproportionate influence on model outcomes can have dramatic impacts on conclusions, with a few data points sometimes overturning key findings. While recent work has developed methods to identify these most influential sets, no formal theory exists to determine when their influence reflects genuine problems rather than natural sampling variation. We address this gap by developing a principled framework for assessing the statistical significance of most influential sets. Our theoretical results characterize the extreme value distributions of maximal influence and enable rigorous hypothesis tests for excessive influence, replacing current ad-hoc sensitivity checks. We demonstrate the practical value of our approach through applications across economics, biology, and machine learning benchmarks.</description>
