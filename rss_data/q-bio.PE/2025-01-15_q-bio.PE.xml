      <title>Annealed mean-field epidemiological model on scale-free networks with a mitigating factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An annealed version of the quenched mean-field model for epidemic spread is introduced and investigated analytically and assisted by numerical calculations. The interaction between individuals follows a prescription that is used to generate a scale-free network, and we have adjusted the number of connections to produce a sparse network. Specifically, the model's behavior near the infection threshold is examined, as well as the behavior of the stationary prevalence and the probability that a connection between individuals encounters an infected one. We found that these functions display a monotonically increasing dependence on the infection rate. Subsequently, a modification that mimics the mitigation in the probability of encountering an infected individual is introduced, following an old idea rooted in the Malthus-Verhulst model. We found that this modification drastically changes the probability that a connection meets an infected individual. However, despite this change, it does not alter the monotonically increasing behavior of the stationary prevalence.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Microscopic Model of Sympatric Speciation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using as a narrative theme the example of Darwin's finches, a microscopic agent-based model is introduces to study sympatric speciation as a result of competition for resources in the same ecological niche. Varying competition among individuals and resource distribution, the model exhibits some of the main features of evolutionary branching processing. The model can be extended to include spatial effects, different genetic loci, sexual mating and recombination, etc.</description>

      <title>Mixing time for a noisy SIS model on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of the noisy SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model on graphs. The noisy SIS model is a variant of the standard SIS model, which allows individuals to become infected not just due to contacts with infected individuals but also due to external noise. We show that, under strong external noise, the mixing time is of order $O(n \log n)$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the mixing time on random graphs, namely Erd\"os--R\'enyi graphs, regular multigraphs, and Galton--Watson trees, is also of order $O(n \log n)$ with high probability.</description>

      <title>The Superstatistics of confined ants: From serenity to panic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.03236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium systems with strong parameter fluctuations are challenging to describe with standard Statistical Mechanics techniques. Superstatistics -- that can be seen as statistics of an underlying family of statistical distributions -- has emerged as a tool able to describe these complex systems. This has been successfully applied, for example, to hydrodynamic turbulence, internal convection, and even DNA architecture, but not to macroscopic biological systems. Here we document the occurrence of Superstatistics in the animal world, and reveal the emergence of Log-normal Superstatistics in a living system, when ants in a confined space are exposed to a threat. We use a data-driven superstatistical model to explain both normal and "panic" dynamics, identifying non-Gaussian velocity distributions, time scale separation, and the Log-normal statistics of a stochastic diffusion coefficient. We also reveal distinct behavioral regimes in the ants' collective panic response and how it relates with the individual ant memory and cluster formation. Furthermore, our findings indicate that optical signals or simple antennation are not significant mechanisms for panic transmission. These discoveries provide a foundation for the understanding of the biological origin of Log-normal type diffusion in confined environments.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Continuous traits evolution of a group of taxa that are correlated through a phylogenetic tree is commonly modelled using parametric stochastic differential equations to represent deterministic change of trait through time, while incorporating noises that represent different unobservable evolutionary pressures. Often times, a heterogeneous Gaussian process that consists of multiple parametric sub-processes is often used when the observed data come from a very diverse set of taxa. In the maximum likelihood setting, challenges can be found when exploring the involved likelihood surface and when interpreting the uncertainty around the parameters.
  Results: We extend the methods to tackle inference problems for mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models (MGPMs) by implementing a Bayesian scheme that can take into account biologically relevant priors. The posterior inference method is based on the Population Monte Carlo (PMC) algorithm that are easily parallelized, and using an efficient algorithm to calculate the likelihood of phylogenetically correlated observations. A model evaluation method that is based on the proximity of the posterior predictive distribution to the observed data is also implemented. Simulation study is done to test the inference and evaluation capability of the method. Finally, we test our method on a real-world dataset.
  Conclusion: We implement the method in the R package bgphy, available at github.com/bayubeta/bgphy. Simulation study demonstrates that the method is able to infer parameters and evaluate models properly, while its implementation on the real-world dataset indicates that a carefully selected model of evolution based on naturally occurring classifications results in a better fit to the observed data.</description>

      <title>Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity: a Bayesian mean-field framework for epidemic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity (SCDC) method, a novel generalized mean-field approximation for epidemic inference and risk assessment within a fully Bayesian framework. SCDC accounts for non-causal effects of observations and uses a graphical model representation of epidemic processes to derive self-consistent equations for edge probability marginals. A small-coupling expansion yields time-dependent cavity messages capturing individual infection probabilities and observational conditioning. With linear computational cost per iteration in the epidemic duration, SCDC is particularly efficient and valid even for recurrent epidemic processes, where standard methods are exponentially complex. Tested on synthetic networks, it matches Belief Propagation in accuracy and outperforms individual-based mean-field methods. Notably, despite being derived as a small-infectiousness expansion, SCDC maintains good accuracy even for relatively large infection probabilities. While convergence issues may arise on graphs with long-range correlations, SCDC reliably estimates risk. Future extensions include non-Markovian models and higher-order terms in the dynamic cavity framework.</description>

      <title>Multiple Local and Global Bifurcations and Their Role in Quorum Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quorum sensing governs bacterial communication, playing a crucial role in regulating population behaviour. We propose a mathematical model that uncovers chaotic dynamics within quorum sensing networks, highlighting challenges to predictability. The model explores interactions between autoinducers and two bacterial subtypes, revealing oscillatory dynamics in both a constant autoinducer sub-model and the full three-component model. In the latter case, we find that the complicated dynamics can be explained by the presence of homoclinic Shilnikov bifurcations. We employed a combination of normal form analysis and numerical continuation methods to analyse the system.</description>
