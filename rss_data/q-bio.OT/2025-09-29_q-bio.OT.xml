      <title>Desiderata for a biomedical knowledge network: opportunities, challenges and future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs, collectively as a knowledge network, have become critical tools for knowledge discovery in computable and explainable knowledge systems. Due to the semantic and structural complexities of biomedical data, these knowledge graphs need to enable dynamic reasoning over large evolving graphs and support fit-for-purpose abstraction, while establishing standards, preserving provenance and enforcing policy constraints for actionable discovery. A recent meeting of leading scientists discussed the opportunities, challenges and future directions of a biomedical knowledge network. Here we present six desiderata inspired by the meeting: (1) inference and reasoning in biomedical knowledge graphs need domain-centric approaches; (2) harmonized and accessible standards are required for knowledge graph representation and metadata; (3) robust validation of biomedical knowledge graphs needs multi-layered, context-aware approaches that are both rigorous and scalable; (4) the evolving and synergistic relationship between knowledge graphs and large language models is essential in empowering AI-driven biomedical discovery; (5) integrated development environments, public repositories, and governance frameworks are essential for secure and reproducible knowledge graph sharing; and (6) robust validation, provenance, and ethical governance are critical for trustworthy biomedical knowledge graphs. Addressing these key issues will be essential to realize the promises of a biomedical knowledge network in advancing biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Interpretable structural-semantic decoding reveals language-like organisation of regulatory information in DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding how linear DNA encodes regulatory information remains a central challenge. Existing decoding approaches lack interpretability and struggle to reveal the underlying coding principles. Here, we present the interpretability-first, structural artificial intelligence (AI) framework for DNA (ISAF4DNA), which uses state-aware symbolic encoding and couples structural unit discovery with semantic validation to form a closed-loop structural-semantic decoder. When applied to N6-methyladenine (6mA) datasets from 63 species, ISAF4DNA reveals a language-like organization of regulatory information: (i) a conserved motif-derivation pathway AT -&gt; GAT/ATC -&gt; GATC; (ii) two forms of redundant syntax: anchor-type structures with a conserved core and selective flanks, and fuzzy-type clusters composed of distributed units with positional tolerance; and (iii) differential deployment trends between prokaryotes and multicellular eukaryotes. Together, these observations motivate the development of a testable framework, EpigenoLinguistics, that treats motifs as lexical units, redundancy as syntax, and deployment as pragmatics. This framework advances the ``DNA as language'' concept from a metaphor to a falsifiable framework with supporting evidence, thereby bridging biology and computational linguistics. ISAF4DNA advances the application of AI techniques in biology from black-box predictions to mechanism-level signals, augments database annotations, and guides regulatory-element design, with principles extensible to other modifications.</description>
