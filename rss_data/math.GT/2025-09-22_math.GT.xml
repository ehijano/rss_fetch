      <title>Knot Floer Homology, the Burau Representation, and Quantum $\mathfrak{gl}(1 \vert 1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Burau representation of braid groups and knot Floer homology share a link to the Fox calculus. We make this connection explicit, with the following outcome: if $B$ is the full Burau matrix of any braid, and $A$ is any square submatrix of $B - \lambda I$, we define a Heegaard Floer homology theory that categorifies $\det(A)$ and is an invariant of the braid. We also describe an analogous construction for the Gassner representation. Then, we leverage the relationship between the Burau representation and quantum $\mathfrak{gl}(1 \vert 1)$ to exhibit connections between the latter and Heegaard Floer homology. We associate a bordered sutured Heegaard Floer homology group to any tangle, and give a simple, geometric proof that our invariant recovers the $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(1 \vert 1))$ braid representation.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Anosov Flows: A Plane Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this text we (re)-tell the theory of pseudo-Anosov flows on 3-manifolds with the orbit space as the central character; via a streamlined framework called {\em Anosov-like group actions}. This brings a simplified and unified perspective, and allows for the import of tools from 1- and 2-dimensional topological dynamics. In so doing, we are able to give a relatively efficient presentation (or re-presentation) of foundational results in the field which appeared over several decades and many papers.
  We hope that the reader, whether a beginning or more advanced topologist or dynamicist, finds this a welcoming invitation to the rich theory of pseudo-Anosov flows.</description>

      <title>Real spectrum and oriented Gromov equivariant compactifications of character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The character variety $\Xi$ of a finitely generated group $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ has many compactifications. We construct a continuous surjection from the real spectrum compactification $\Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$ to the oriented Gromov equivariant compactification. Our construction is based on a geometric interpretation of the elements of $\partial \Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$ as $\Gamma$-actions by isometries on $\mathbb{R}$-trees. We endow these $\mathbb{R}$-trees with an orientation induced by the standard orientation on the circle, which we characterize by a semialgebraic equation. Moreover, we describe the $\Gamma$-actions by orientation preserving isometries on oriented $\mathbb{R}$-trees, which arise in both compactifications, as limits of $\Gamma$-actions on the oriented hyperbolic plane, via asymptotic cones endowed with an ultralimit orientation.</description>

      <title>BNSR-Invariants of Surface Houghton Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface Houghton groups $\mathcal{H}_{n}$ are a family of groups generalizing Houghton groups $H_n$, which are constructed as asymptotically rigid mapping class groups. We give a complete computation of the BNSR-invariants $\Sigma^{m}(P\mathcal{H}_{n})$ of their intersection with the pure mapping class group. To do so, we prove that the associated Stein--Farley cube complex is CAT(0), and we adapt Zaremsky's method for computing the BNSR-invariants of the Houghton groups. As a consequence, we give a criterion for when subgroups of $H_n$ and $P\mathcal{H}_{n}$ having the same finiteness length as their parent group are finite index. We also discuss the failure of some of these groups to be co-Hopfian.</description>

      <title>Locally homogeneous Axiom A flows II: geometric structures for Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a non-compact semisimple real Lie group $G$ and an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$, we utilize the correspondence between $\mathbb R$-valued additive characters on Levi subgroups $L$ of $G$ and $\mathbb R$-affine homogeneous line bundles over $G/L$ to systematically construct families of non-empty domains of proper discontinuity for the $\Gamma$-action. If $\Gamma$ is torsion-free, the analytic dynamical systems on the quotients are Axiom A, and assemble into a single partially hyperbolic multiflow. Each Axiom A system admits global analytic stable/unstable foliations with non-wandering set a single basic set on which the flow is conjugate to Sambarino's refraction flow, establishing that all refraction flows arise in this fashion. Furthermore, the $\mathbb R$-valued additive character is regular if and only if the associated Axiom A system admits a compatible pseudo-Riemannian metric and contact structure, which we relate to the Poisson structure on the dual of the Lie algebra of $G$.</description>

      <title>Quantum equations for knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper contains linear systems of equations which can distinguish knots without knot invariants.
  Let $M_n$ be the topological moduli space of all n-component string links and such that a fixed projection into the plane is an immersion. If a string link is the product of some string link diagram $T$ and the parallel n-cable of a framed long knot diagram $D$, then there is a canonical arc $push$ in $M_n$, defined by pushing $T$ through the n-cable of $D$. In this paper we apply the combinatorial 1-cocycles from the HOMFLYPT and Kauffman polynomials in $M_n$ with values in the corresponding skein modules to this canonical arc in $M_n$. Some of the 1-cocycles lead to linear systems of equations in the skein modules, for each couple of diagrams $D$ and $D'$. If the system has no solution in the Laurent polynomials then $D$ and $D'$ represent different knots. We give first examples where we distinguish knots without any knot invariants. In particular, we distinguish the knot $9_{42}$ from its mirror image with equations coming from the HOMFLYPT polynomial. Notice that the knot $9_{42}$ and its mirror image share the same HOMFLYPT polynomial.
  On the other hand, each solution of the system gives rather fine information about any regular isotopy which connects $D$ with $D'$.</description>

      <title>Properties of leveled spatial graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the property of a spatial graph of having a leveled embedding and characterize the abstract graphs with this property. We show that all leveled embeddings are free and we compare leveled and paneled (also known as flat) embeddings. Two new graph invariants are introduced: the level number, an invariant for graphs that admit a leveled embedding, and the Hamiltonian level number, an invariant for Hamiltonian graphs. These invariants provide a measure on how far a graph is from being planar. We study the relation between the (Hamiltonian) level number and other graph invariants that minimize the decomposition of a graph in planar subgraphs, namely the thickness and the book thickness of a graph. We characterize graphs with low level number and determine both the level number and the Hamiltonian level number of complete graphs and of complete bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Formal Manifold Structures on Positive Characteristic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his 1970 ICM report, Sullivan proposes the program of l-adic formalization of the concept of manifolds. In this program, he claims that smooth positive characteristic varieties should carry l-adic formal manifold structures. He also claims the existence of an abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures. This paper carries out this program, establishes the claims for certain varieties, and relates the abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures to the Galois symmetry of varieties. Meanwhile, we prove that a simply-connected variety is l-adic homotopic equivalent to a simply-connected finite CW complex if and only if the l-profinite completion of its etale homotopy type admits an l-local lifting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the $(2n-1)$-form Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density, i.e. the $n^{\text{th}}$ Chern character, in arbitrary even dimensions $D=2 n \geq 2$. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general, and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Chern characters and hence Pontryagin densities. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density in an arbitrary even dimension.</description>

      <title>A model for the assembly map of bordism-invariant functors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study oplax colimits of stable categories, of hermitian categories and of Poincar\'e categories in nice cases. This allows us to produce a categorical model of the assembly map of a bordism-invariant functor of Poincar\'e categories which is also a Verdier projection, whose kernel we explicitly describe. As a direct application, we generalize the Shaneson splitting for bordism-invariant functors of Poincar\'e categories proved by Calm\`es-Dotto-Harpaz-Hebestreit-Land-Moi-Nardin-Nikolaus-Steimle to allow for twists. We also show our methods can tackle their general twisted Shaneson splitting of Poincar\'e-Verdier localizing invariants which specifies to a twisted Bass-Heller-Swan decomposition for the underlying stable categories, generalizing part of recent work of Kirstein-Kremer.</description>

      <title>On Singer's conjecture for the fourth algebraic transfer in certain generic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the finite field $k := \mathbb Z_2$ and $G(q)$ be the general linear group of rank $q$ over $k.$ A well-known open problem in algebraic topology is the explicit determination of the cohomology groups of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k),$ for all homological degrees $q \geq 0.$ The Singer algebraic transfer of rank $q,$ formulated by William Singer in 1989, serves as a valuable method for the description of such Ext groups. This transfer maps from the coinvariants of a certain representation of $G(q)$ to ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k).$ Singer predicted that the algebraic transfer is always injective, but this has gone unanswered for all $q\geq 4.$ This paper establishes Singer's conjecture for rank four in the generic degrees $n = 2^{s+t+1} +2^{s+1} - 3$ whenever $t\neq 3$ and $s\geq 1,$ and $n = 2^{s+t} + 2^{s} - 2$ whenever $t\neq 2,\, 3,\, 4$ and $s\geq 1.$ In conjunction with our previous results, this completes the proof of the Singer conjecture for rank four. All the obtained results can be verified directly by using the program suite of our novel algorithms presented in [17, 18, 19, 20]. We note that although Singer's conjecture still holds for the case of rank 4, it no longer holds for rank 6, as announced in our most recent work [20].</description>

      <title>$c_{\rm eff}$ from Resurgence at the Stokes Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent papers [1,2], a new method to cross the natural boundary has been proposed, and applied to Mordell-Borel integrals arising in the study of Chern-Simons theory, based on decompositions into {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}. Resurgent analysis on the Stokes line leads to a unique transseries decomposition in terms of unary false theta functions, which can be continued across the natural boundary to produce dual $q$-series whose integer-valued coefficients enumerate BPS states. This constitutes a deeper new manifestation of resurgence in quantum field theoretic path integrals. In this paper we show that the algebraic structure of the {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}, combined with just the leading term of the $q$-series, completely determines the large order rate of growth of the dual $q$-series coefficients. The essential exponent of this asymptotic growth has a Cardy-like interpretation [10] of an effective central charge in a 3 dimensional quantum field theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry related to the Chern-Simons theory through the $3d$-$3d$ correspondence.</description>
