      <title>Multi-Point Hermite Methods for the N-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical integration methods are central to the study of self-gravitating systems, particularly those comprised of many bodies or otherwise beyond the reach of analytical methods. Predictor-corrector schemes, both multi-step methods and those based on 2-point Hermite interpolation, have found great success in the simulation of star clusters and other collisional systems. Higher-order methods, such as those based on Gaussian quadratures and Richardson extrapolation, have also proven popular for high-accuracy integrations of few-body systems, particularly those that may undergo close encounters. This work presents a family of high-order schemes based on multi-point Hermite interpolation. When applied as a multi-step multi-derivative schemes, these can be seen as generalizing both Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods and 2-point Hermite methods; I present results for the 6th-, 9th-, and 12th-order 3-point schemes applied in this manner using variable time steps. In a cluster-like test problem, the 3-point 6th-order predictor-corrector scheme matches or outperforms the standard 2-point 4th-order Hermite scheme at negligible O(N) cost. I also present a number of high-order time-symmetric schemes up to 18th order, which have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of long-duration simulations.</description>

      <title>Design of the tertiary optical system for the Large Latin American Millimeter Array radio telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern radio telescopes employ an observational strategy that involves maximizing the use of their available spaces (cabins), outfitting them with various receivers at different frequencies to detect incoming signals from the sky simultaneously or individually. The Large Latin American Millimeter Array (LLAMA), is a joint venture between Argentina and Brazil consisting of the installation and operation of a 12-meter aperture Cassegrain telescope. It features three available cabins for instrumentation and plans to install six single-pixel heterodyne receivers, covering different bandwidths in the 30 to 950 GHz window of the electromagnetic spectrum, in its two lateral Nasmyth cabins at different phases of the project. Therefore, it is crucial not only to design a tertiary optical system that couples the antenna beam to those receivers, but also to do it in a scalable way. The primary goal for the design is to simultaneously maximize the antenna efficiency while minimizing optical aberrations for all receivers, both fundamental aspects for the optimal functioning of cutting-edge astronomical instruments. In this paper, we present the entire design process, starting from the quasi-optical approach based on the propagation of a fundamental Gaussian beam mode, continuing with the validation of the design based on physical optics simulations, and ending with a tolerance analysis of the system. As a result of this process, a frequency independent tertiary optical system has been achieved for almost all the receivers, which is expected to provide high optical performance for the radio telescope.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge, phase II: Comparison of algorithms in terms of characterization capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this communication, we report on the results of the second phase of the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge started in 2019. This second phase focuses on the characterization of point sources (exoplanet signals) within multispectral high-contrast images from ground-based telescopes. We collected eight data sets from two high-contrast integral field spectrographs (namely Gemini-S/GPI and VLT/SPHERE-IFS) that we calibrated homogeneously, and in which we injected a handful of synthetic planetary signals (ground truth) to be characterized by the data challenge participants. The tasks of the participants consist of (1) extracting the precise astrometry of each injected planetary signals, and (2) extracting the precise spectro-photometry of each injected planetary signal. Additionally, the participants may provide the 1-sigma uncertainties on their estimation for further analyses. When available, the participants can also provide the posterior distribution used to estimate the position/spectrum and uncertainties. The data are permanently available on a Zenodo repository and the participants can submit their results through the EvalAI platform. The EvalAI submission platform opened on April 2022 and closed on the 31st of May 2024. In total, we received 4 valid submissions for the astrometry estimation and 4 valid submissions for the spectrophotometry (each submission, corresponding to one pipeline, has been submitted by a unique participant). In this communication, we present an analysis and interpretation of the results.</description>

      <title>Ground calibration and network of the first CATCH pathfinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (CATCH) space mission is focused on exploring the dynamic universe via X-ray follow-up observations of various transients. The first pathfinder of the CATCH mission, CATCH-1, was launched on June 22, 2024, alongside the Space-based multiband astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) mission. CATCH-1 is equipped with narrow-field optimized Micro Pore Optics (MPOs) featuring a large effective area and incorporates four Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) in its focal plane. This paper presents the system calibration results conducted before the satellite integration. Utilizing the data on the performance of the mirror and detectors obtained through the system calibration, combined with simulated data, the ground calibration database can be established. Measuring the relative positions of the mirror and detector system, which were adjusted during system calibration, allows for accurate installation of the entire satellite. Furthermore, the paper outlines the operational workflow of the ground network post-satellite launch.</description>

      <title>Coronagraph-based wavefront sensors for the high Strehl regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial component of the high-contrast instrumental chain in astronomy is the wavefront sensor (WFS). A key property of this component is its sensitivities, which reflect its ability to efficiently use incoming photons to encode the phase aberrations. This paper introduces a new class of highly sensitive wavefront sensors that approach the fundamental sensitivity limits dictated by physics. Assuming a high Strehl regime, we define what linear operator is describing the ideal WFS that would achieve maximum sensitivity. We then show that there is a substantial similarity between this ideal WFS and the second-order ideal coronagraph. Leveraging the exhibited link between ideal wavefront sensing and coronagraphy, we propose a novel WFS concept based on high-performance coronagraphic architecture : the bivortex WFS. This sensor employs charge-2 vortex masks. Simulations for an ideal system demonstrate that this sensor achieves unprecedented sensitivity, even surpassing the highly sensitive Zernike WFS class (especially for low spatial frequencies), while paving the way for new high-contrast architectures integrating simultaneous sensing and coronagraphy.</description>

      <title>Testing screened scalar-tensor theories of gravity with atomic clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In any scalar-tensor theory of gravity exhibiting a screening mechanism, the fifth force mediated by the scalar field is dynamically suppressed at sub-Solar system scales, allowing it to pass existing tests of gravity. As a result, a major research effort has been carried out over the past decades to 'outsmart' screened scalars in this game of hide-and-seek. While most of such tests rely on fifth force effects, one should keep in mind that the latter are by no means the only physical feature of scalar-tensor gravity. In particular, this article investigates the possibility of testing screened scalar-tensor models by means of gravitational redshift measurements performed with atomic clocks. Upon deriving the expression for the redshift in this framework, we propose a thought experiment for testing the chameleon model by clock comparisons, which guides us towards more realistic experimental setups, in the laboratory and in space. We find that the current level of precision exhibited by leading-edge technology is still too low to yield competitive constraints on the chameleon model.</description>

      <title>Impact of relativistic waveforms in LISA's science objectives with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. The scientific potential of these sources can only be fully realized with fast and accurate waveform models. In this work, we extend the \textsc{FastEMRIWaveform} (\texttt{FEW}) framework by providing fully relativistic waveforms at adiabatic order for circular, equatorial orbits in Kerr spacetime, for mass ratios up to $10^{-3}$. We study the importance of including relativistic corrections in the waveform for both vacuum and non-vacuum environments. For EMRIs in vacuum, we find that non-relativistic waveforms can result in $\sim 35\%$ error in the predicted source's horizon redshift. By developing relativistic non-vacuum EMRI waveforms, we demonstrate significant improvements in detecting environmental effects. Our analysis shows that incorporating relativistic corrections enhances constraints on accretion disks, modeled through power-law torques, and improves the constraints on disk parameters (error $\sim6\%$), representing a significant improvement from previous estimates. We also estimated the evidence for models in a scenario where ignoring the accretion disk causes bias in parameter estimation (PE) and report a $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of $1.1$ in favor of the accretion disk model. Additionally, in a fully relativistic setup, we estimate the parameters of superradiant scalar clouds with high accuracy, achieving errors below $5\%$ for the scalar cloud's mass and below $0.5\%$ for the ultralight field's mass. These results demonstrate that incorporating relativistic effects greatly enhances the accuracy and reliability of waveform predictions, essential for PE and model selection.</description>

      <title>Blast: a Web Application for Characterizing the Host Galaxies of Astrophysical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the host galaxies of astrophysical transients is important to many areas of astrophysics, including constraining the progenitor systems of core-collapse supernovae, correcting Type Ia supernova distances, and probabilistically classifying transients without photometric or spectroscopic data. Given the increasing transient discovery rate in the coming years, there is substantial utility in providing public, transparent, reproducible, and automatic characterization for large samples of transient host galaxies. Here we present Blast, a web application that ingests live streams of transient alerts, matches transients to their host galaxies, and performs photometry on coincident archival imaging data of the host galaxy. The photometry is then used to infer both global host-galaxy properties and galaxy properties within 2 kpc of the transient location by using the Prospector Bayesian inference framework, with an acceleration in evaluation speed achieved via simulation-based inference. Blast provides host-galaxy properties to users via a web browser or an application program interface. The software can be extended to support alternative photometric or SED-fitting algorithms, and can be scaled via an asynchronous worker queue across multiple compute nodes to handle the processing of large volumes of transient alerts for upcoming transient surveys. Blast has been ingesting newly discovered transients from the Transient Name Server since mid-2024, and has currently measured SED parameters for more than 6000 transients. The service is publicly available at https://blast.scimma.org/.</description>

      <title>CAMO-S: A meteor-tracking spectrograph at the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) mirror tracking system has been in operation since 2009 and has, to date, produced more than 20,000 two-station meteor observations at meter-level spatial and 10 ms temporal resolution. In 2020, a spectral tracking camera was added in parallel at one of the CAMO stations. To date, it has recorded the spectra of hundreds of faint meteors. Engineering testing from 2020-2023 resulted in the selection of a 150 lpmm grating and an EMCCD camera to achieve a spectral resolution of about 1 nm/pixel in the final configuration. The CAMO spectral system can resolve spectra from individual meteoroid fragments, record spectra for meteors of +2 peak magnitude to as faint as +4 in parts of the lightcurve and produce relative abundance estimates for Mg, Fe and Na. Our preliminary results also show identification of the H and K lines of CA(II). Meteors with strong iron lines were found to have unusual fragmentation behaviour, involving gross fragmentation rather than continuously shedding small particles. The spectra of individual fragments can be resolved in some cases, showing that these Fe-rich objects do not differ in composition among fragments. Our calibration procedure and hardware configuration are discussed together with preliminary results.</description>

      <title>Rare Event Classification with Weighted Logistic Regression for Identifying Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important task in the study of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains the automatic classification of repeating and non-repeating sources based on their morphological properties. We propose a statistical model that considers a modified logistic regression to classify FRB sources. The classical logistic regression model is modified to accommodate the small proportion of repeaters in the data, a feature that is likely due to the sampling procedure and duration and is not a characteristic of the population of FRB sources. The weighted logistic regression hinges on the choice of a tuning parameter that represents the true proportion $\tau$ of repeating FRB sources in the entire population. The proposed method has a sound statistical foundation, direct interpretability, and operates with only 5 parameters, enabling quicker retraining with added data. Using the CHIME/FRB Collaboration sample of repeating and non-repeating FRBs and numerical experiments, we achieve a classification accuracy for repeaters of nearly 75\% or higher when $\tau$ is set in the range of $50$ to $60$\%. This implies a tentative high proportion of repeaters, which is surprising, but is also in agreement with recent estimates of $\tau$ that are obtained using other methods.</description>

      <title>Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters for Deep Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the development of Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters (AF-MPDTs) present themselves to be an increasingly promising propulsion technology for deep space exploration missions. Various entities, ranging from state-sponsored institutions to privately-owned startups, have developed AF-MPDTs across a wide range of power levels. Current developments in superconducting technologies, namely High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) coils such as REBCO, have enabled research into the integration of HTS coils into the applied-field module to generate MPD thrust. Developments in space cryocoolers have opened the doors for HTS use within a spaceflight design of an AF-MPDT, where the applied-field module is at 40 K. A TRL of 4-5 has been reached by some AF-MPDT prototypes; venturing beyond this will require higher cooling power space cryocoolers to be developed in parallel and appropriately integrated into the thruster. Moreover, bespoke thermal control is required to maintain the thruster's extreme temperature gradient where the cryocooled HTS are in close proximity to the thruster cathode. More effective space power supply units with higher power generation is a further limitation to reaching TRL 9. This review examines the underlying principles behind AF-MPDT propulsion and the recent global developments in AF-MPDT technology, with an in-depth analysis and critical discussion on the spaceflight components necessary to permit AF-MPDTs to become a widely-adopted spaceflight-ready propulsion technology.</description>

      <title>Experimental Pathways for Detecting Double Superionicity in Planetary Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune are assumed to contain large amounts of planetary ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The properties of mixtures of such ices at the extreme pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors are not yet well understood. Ab initio computer simulations predicted that a number of ices exhibit a hydrogen superionic state and a doubly superionic state [DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-42958-0]. Since the latter state has not yet been generated with experiments, we outline here two possible pathways for reaching and detecting such a state with dynamic compression experiments. We suggest X-ray diffraction as the principal tool for detecting when the material becomes doubly superionic and the sublattice of one of the heavy nuclei melts. That would require a temperature of $\sim$3500 K and pressures greater than $\sim$200 GPa for H$_3$NO$_4$, which we use as an example material here. Such conditions can be reached with experiments that employ an initial shock that is followed by a ramp compression wave. Alternatively, one may use triple-shock compression because a single shock does not yield sufficiently high densities.</description>

Abstract: In this work we introduce ProGeny, a new stellar population library (SPL) software package written in R. This release encapsulates the core software to generate simple/single stellar populations (SSPs); the various data inputs required (in particular isochrones and stellar atmospheres); example scripts to generate the SSPs; and a number of pre-generated static SSP available for immediate use. The most novel feature of ProGeny is its ability to produce SSPs with evolving initial mass functions (IMFs), allowing functional dependencies on stellar age or metallicity. We perform both internal comparisons (within the ProGeny SPL) and external comparisons (with other public SSPs) and tests. The main conclusion is that the choice of isochrone has significantly more impact on the predicted spectra than the choice of stellar atmospheres and/or IMF (comparing Chabrier and Kroupa variants). A number of limiting uncertainties and corrections for star formation rates and stellar masses are also presented.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Deep Learning for Time Series Extrinsic Regression in predicting photometric metallicity of Fundamental-mode RR Lyrae Stars</title>

Abstract: Astronomy is entering an unprecedented era of Big Data science, driven by missions like the ESA's Gaia telescope, which aims to map the Milky Way in three dimensions. Gaia's vast dataset presents a monumental challenge for traditional analysis methods. The sheer scale of this data exceeds the capabilities of manual exploration, necessitating the utilization of advanced computational techniques. In response to this challenge, we developed a novel approach leveraging deep learning to estimate the metallicity of fundamental mode (ab-type) RR Lyrae stars from their light curves in the Gaia optical G-band. Our study explores applying deep learning techniques, particularly advanced neural network architectures, in predicting photometric metallicity from time-series data. Our deep learning models demonstrated notable predictive performance, with a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0565, the root mean square error (RMSE) achieved is 0.0765 and a high $R^2$ regression performance of 0.9401 measured by cross-validation. The weighted mean absolute error (wMAE) is 0.0563, while the weighted root mean square error (wRMSE) is 0.0763. These results showcase the effectiveness of our approach in accurately estimating metallicity values. Our work underscores the importance of deep learning in astronomical research, particularly with large datasets from missions like Gaia. By harnessing the power of deep learning methods, we can provide precision in analyzing vast datasets, contributing to more precise and comprehensive insights into complex astronomical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Assessing and Mitigating the Impact of Glitches on Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation: a Model Agnostic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09159</link>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the impact of transient noise artifacts, or {\it glitches}, on gravitational-wave inference from ground-based interferometer data, and test how modeling and subtracting these glitches affects the inferred parameters. Due to their time-frequency morphology, broadband glitches cause moderate to significant biasing of posterior distributions away from true values. In contrast, narrowband glitches induce negligible biasing effects, due to distinct signal and glitch morphologies. We inject simulated binary black hole signals into data containing three occurring glitch types from past LIGO-Virgo observing runs, and reconstruct both signal and glitch waveforms using \bw{}, a wavelet-based Bayesian analysis. We apply the standard LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA deglitching procedure to the detector data, which consists of subtracting from calibrated LIGO data the glitch waveform estimated by the joint \bw{} inference. {We produce posterior distributions on the parameters of the injected signal before and after subtracting the glitch,} and we {show that removing the transient noise} effectively mitigates bias from broadband glitches. This study provides a baseline validation of existing techniques, while demonstrating waveform reconstruction improvements to the Bayesian algorithm for robust astrophysical characterization in glitch-prone detector data.</description>

      <title>Pursuing Truth: Improving Retrievals on Mid-Infrared Exo-Earth Spectra with Physically Motivated Water Abundance Profiles and Cloud Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09129</link>

Abstract: Atmospheric retrievals are widely used to constrain exoplanet properties from observed spectra. We investigate how the common nonphysical retrieval assumptions of vertically constant molecule abundances and cloud-free atmospheres affect our characterization of an exo-Earth (an Earth-twin orbiting a Sun-like star). Specifically, we use a state-of-the-art retrieval framework to explore how assumptions for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ profile and clouds affect retrievals. In a first step, we validate different retrieval models on a low-noise simulated 1D mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of Earth. Thereafter, we study how these assumptions affect the characterization of Earth with the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We run retrievals on LIFE mock observations based on real disk-integrated MIR Earth spectra. The performance of different retrieval models is benchmarked against ground truths derived from remote sensing data. We show that assumptions for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ abundance and clouds directly affect our characterization. Overall, retrievals that use physically motivated models for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ profile and clouds perform better on the empirical Earth data. For observations of Earth with LIFE, they yield accurate estimates for the radius, pressure-temperature structure, and the abundances of $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{H_2O}$, and $\mathrm{O_3}$. Further, at $R=100$, a reliable and bias-free detection of the biosignature $\mathrm{CH_4}$ becomes feasible. We conclude that the community must use a diverse range of models for temperate exoplanet atmospheres to build an understanding of how different retrieval assumptions can affect the interpretation of exoplanet spectra. This will enable the characterization of distant habitable worlds and the search for life with future space-based instruments.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the nanohertz gravitational wave background using a $t$-process power spectral density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), which induce correlated changes in millisecond pulsars' timing residuals. PTA collaborations around the world have recently announced evidence of a nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), which may be produced by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The GWB is often modeled as following a power-law power spectral density (PSD); however, a GWB produced by a cosmological population of SMBHBs is expected to have a more complex power spectrum due to the discrete nature of the sources. In this paper, we investigate using a $t$-process PSD to model the GWB, which allows us to fit for both the underlying power-law amplitude and spectral index as well as deviations from that power law, which may be produced by individual nearby binaries. We create simulated data sets based on the properties of the NANOGrav 15-year data set, and we demonstrate that the $t$-process PSD can accurately recover the PSD when deviations from a power-law are present. With longer timed datasets and more pulsars, we expect the sensitivity of our PTAs to improve, which will allow us to precisely measure the PSD of the GWB and study the sources producing it.</description>

      <title>Characterizing seismic isolation using convolutional neural networks and Wiener filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate seismic motion propagation through a passively isolated mechanical system, using Wiener filters and convolutional neural networks with time-dilation layers. The goal of this study was to explore the capabilities of neural networks and Wiener filters in characterizing a mechanical system from the measurements. The mechanical system used is a testbed facility for technology development for current and future gravitational wave detectors, "VATIGrav", currently being commissioned at University of Hamburg. It consists of a large vacuum chamber mounted on four active vibration isolators with an optical table inside, mounted on four passive vibration isolators. In this paper we have used seismic data recorded on the ground and on the optical table inside the chamber. The data were divided in 6 hours for training and another 6 hours for validation, focusing on inferring 150-second stretches of time series of table motion from the ground motion in the frequency range from $0.1~\mathrm{Hz}$ to about $50~\mathrm{Hz}$. We compare the performance of a neural network with FTT-based loss function and with Huber loss function to single-input, single-output (SISO) and multiple-input, single-output (MISO) Wiener filters. To be able to compute very large MISO Wiener filters (with 15,000 taps) we have optimized the calculations exploiting block-Toeplitz structure of the matrix in Wiener-Hopf equations. We find that for the given task SISO Wiener filters outperform MISO Wiener filters, mostly due to low coherence between different motion axes. Neural network trained with Huber loss performs slightly worse than Wiener filters. Neural network with FFT-based loss outperforms Wiener filters in some frequency regions, particularly with low amplitudes and reduced coherence, while it tends to slightly underestimate the peaks, where Wiener filters perform better.</description>
