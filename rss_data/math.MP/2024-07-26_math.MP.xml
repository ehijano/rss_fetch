      <title>Vector tomography for reconstructing electric fields with non-zero divergence in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vector tomography (VT), the aim is to reconstruct an unknown multi-dimensional vector field using line integral data. In the case of a 2-dimensional VT, two types of line integral data are usually required. These data correspond to integration of the parallel and perpendicular projection of the vector field along integration lines. VT methods are non-invasive, non-intrusive and offer more information on the field than classical point measurements; they are typically used to reconstruct divergence-free (or source-free) velocity and flow fields. In this paper, we show that VT can also be used for the reconstruction of fields with non-zero divergence. In particular, we study electric fields generated by dipole sources in bounded domains which arise, for example, in electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging. To the best of our knowledge, VT has not previously been used to reconstruct such fields. We explain in detail the theoretical background, the derivation of the electric field inverse problem and the numerical approximation of the line integrals. We show that fields with non-zero divergence can be reconstructed from the longitudinal measurements with the help of two sparsity constraints that are constructed from the transverse measurements and the vector Laplace operator. As a comparison to EEG source imaging, we note that VT does not require mathematical modelling of the sources. By numerical simulations, we show that the pattern of the electric field can be correctly estimated using VT and the location of the source activity can be determined accurately from the reconstructed magnitudes of the field.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Phase Transitions for Phonons in Complex Network Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of networked atoms or molecules oscillating around their equilibrium positions. The model assumes the harmonic approximation of the interactions. We provide bounds for the total number of phonons, and for the specific heat, in terms of the average Wiener capacity, or resistance, of the network. Thanks to such bounds, we can distinguish qualitatively different behaviours in terms of the network structure alone.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian structure of the eigenvector overlap for the symplectic Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the integrable structure and scaling limits of the conditioned eigenvector overlap of the symplectic Ginibre ensemble of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices with independent quaternion elements. The average of the overlap matrix elements constructed from left and right eigenvectors, conditioned to $x$, are derived in terms of a Pfaffian determinant. Regarded as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas with the Neumann boundary condition along the real axis, it contains a kernel of skew-orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2(1+|z-x|^2)e^{-2|z|^2}$, including a non-trivial insertion of a point charge. The mean off-diagonal overlap is related to the diagonal (self-)overlap by a transposition, in analogy to the complex Ginibre ensemble. For $x$ conditioned to the real line, extending previous results at $x=0$, we determine the skew-orthogonal polynomials and their skew-kernel with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$. This is done in two steps and involves a Christoffel perturbation of the weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, by computing first the corresponding quantities for the unperturbed weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$. Its kernel is shown to satisfy a differential equation at finite matrix size $N$. This allows us to take different large-$N$ limits, where we distinguish bulk and edge regime along the real axis. The limiting mean diagonal overlaps and corresponding eigenvalue correlation functions of the point processes with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$ are determined. We also examine the effect on the planar orthogonal polynomials when changing the variance in $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, as this appears in the eigenvector statistics of the complex Ginibre ensemble.</description>

      <title>Osterwalder-Schrader axioms for unitary full vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full Vertex Operator Algebras (full VOA) are extensions of two commuting Vertex Operator Algebras, introduced to formulate compact two-dimensional conformal field theory. We define unitarity, polynomial energy bounds and polynomial spectral density for full VOA. Under these conditions and local $C_1$-cofiniteness of the simple full VOA, we show that the correlation functions of quasi-primary fields define tempered distributions and satisfy a conformal version of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, including the linear growth condition.
  As an example, we show that a family of full extensions of the Heisenberg VOA satisfies all these assumptions.</description>

      <title>Bi-Hamiltonian structures of WDVV-type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of nonlinear PDEs that admit the same bi-Hamiltonian structure as WDVV equations: a Ferapontov-type first-order Hamiltonian operator and a homogeneous third-order Hamiltonian operator in a canonical Doyle--Potemin form, which are compatible. Using various equivalence groups, we classify such equations in two-component and three-component cases. In a four-component case, we add further evidence to the conjecture that there exists only one integrable system of the above type. Finally, we give an example of the six-component system with required bi-Hamiltonian structure. To streamline the symbolic computation we develop an algorithm to find the aforementioned Hamiltonian operators, which includes putting forward a conjecture on the structure of the metric parameterising the first-order Hamiltonian operator.</description>

      <title>Free Energy Difference Fluctuations in Short-Range Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed (but not yet proved) that Ising spin glasses with nearest-neighbor interactions have a phase transition in three and higher dimensions to a low-temperature spin glass phase, but the nature of this phase remains controversial, especially whether it is characterized by multiple incongruent Gibbs states. Of particular relevance to this question is the behavior of the typical free energy difference restricted to a finite volume between two such putative Gibbs states, as well as the nature of the fluctuations of their free energy difference as the couplings within the volume vary. In this paper we investigate these free energy difference fluctuations by introducing a new kind of metastate which classifies Gibbs states through their edge overlap values with a reference Gibbs state randomly chosen from the support of the periodic boundary condition (PBC) metastate. We find that the free energy difference between any two incongruent pure states, regardless of the details of how they're organized into mixed states within the PBC metastate, converges to a Gaussian (or Gaussian-like) distribution whose variance scales with the volume, proving a decades-old conjecture of Fisher and Huse. The same conclusion applies, though with some additional restrictions, to both mixed Gibbs states and ground states. We discuss some implications of these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of the ten-dimensional heterotic string theories appropriate for implementing the stringy replica method for the calculation of quantum entanglement entropy. A novel feature for the heterotic string is that the gauge symmetry must be broken by a Wilson line to ensure modular invariance. We completely classify the patterns of symmetry breaking. We show that the tachyonic contributions in all cases can be analytically continued, with a finite answer in the domain $0&lt;N \leq 1$, relevant for calculating entanglement entropy across the Rindler horizon. We discuss the physical implications of our results.</description>

      <title>Spatial curvature in coincident gauge $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmologies with arbitrary spatial curvature for the symmetric teleparallel theories of gravity, giving the first presentation of their coincident gauge form. Our approach explicitly starts with the cosmological Killing vectors and constructs the coincident gauge coordinates adapted to these Killing vectors. We then obtain three distinct spatially flat branches and a single spatially curved branch. Contrary to some previous claims, we show that all branches of connection in the covariant approach can be studied in this gauge-fixed formalism, which offers certain conceptual advantages. Interestingly, we find that the flat and negative spatially curved solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity can be seen as equivalent to the metric teleparallel $f(T)$ theories, demonstrating a deeper connection between these theories. This is accomplished by studying the connection equation of motion, which can be interpreted as a consistency condition in the gauge-fixed approach. Finally, we discuss the role of diffeomorphism invariance and local Lorentz invariance in these geometric modifications of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the direct resonance problem for Rayleigh seismic surface waves and obtain a constraint on the location of resonances and establish a forbidden domain as the main result. In order to obtain the main result we make a Pekeris-Markushevich transformation of the Rayleigh system with free surface boundary condition such that we get a matrix Schr\"odinger-type form of it. We obtain parity and analytical properties of its fundamental solutions, which are needed to prove the main theorem. We construct a function made up by Rayleigh determinants factors, which is proven to be entire, of exponential type and in the Cartwright class and leads to the constraint on the location of resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the disassortative stochastic block model with three communities, a well-studied model of graph partitioning and Bayesian inference for which detailed predictions based on the cavity method exist [Decelle et al. (2011)]. We provide strong evidence that for a part of the phase where efficient algorithms exist that approximately reconstruct the communities, inference based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) fails. In other words, we show that there exist modes of the posterior distribution that have a vanishing agreement with the ground truth. The proof is based on the analysis of a graph colouring algorithm from [Achlioptas and Moore (2003)].</description>

      <title>Differential Forms vs Geometric Algebra: The quest for the best geometric language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential forms is a highly geometric formalism for physics used from field theories to General Relativity (GR) which has been a great upgrade over vector calculus with the advantages of being coordinate-free and carrying a high degree of geometrical content.
  In recent years, Geometric Algebra appeared claiming to be a unifying language for physics and mathematics with a high level of geometrical content. Its strength is based on the unification of the inner and outer product into a single geometric operation, and its easy interpretation.
  Given their similarities, in this article we compare both formalisms side-by-side to narrow the gap between them in literature. We present a direct translation including differential identities, integration theorems and various algebraic identities.
  As an illustrative example, we present the case of classical electrodynamics in both formalism and finish with their description of GR.</description>

      <title>A general thermodynamically consistent phase-field-micromechanics model of sintering with coupled diffusion and grain motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sintering is a pivotal technology for processing ceramic and metallic powders into solid objects. A profound understanding of microstructure evolution during sintering is essential for manufacturing products with tailored properties. While various phase-field models have been proposed to simulate microstructure evolution in solid-state sintering, correctly incorporating the crucial densification mechanism, particularly grain motion, remains a challenge. The fundamental obstacle lies in the ad hoc treatment of the micromechanics of grain motion, where the thermodynamical driving force cannot be derived from the system's free energy. This work presents a novel phase-field-micromechanics model for sintering (PFMMS) that addresses this challenge. We define a unified energy law, under which the governing equations for microstructure evolution in sintering are derived using variational principles. Our approach ensures thermodynamic consistency, with the driving force for grain motion derived from the system's free energy. Consequently, the proposed PFMMS guarantees the evolution of microstructure in a direction that reduces the system's energy and eliminates non-densifying phenomena. We rigorously validate PFMMS against recent benchmarks of theoretical and numerical analysis. It is found that PFMMS captures intrinsic stress distribution along and beyond grain boundaries, exhibits system-size-independent shrinkage strain, and maintains thermodynamic equilibrium states. These features are fundamental requirements for a physically consistent sintering model.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Dimensional Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on $S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Irreducible decompositions of tensors via the Brauer algebra and applications to metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this thesis, we make use of representation theory of groups and algebras to perform an irreducible decomposition of tensors in the context of metric-affine gravity. In particular, we consider the action of the orthogonal group O(1, d$-1$) on the Riemann tensor associated with an affine connection defined on a d-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold. This connection, with torsion and non-metricity, is the characteristic ingredient of metric-affine theories of gravity.
  In the second part of this thesis, we construct the projection operators used for the aforementioned decomposition. They are realized in terms of the symmetric group algebra $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{S}_n$ and of the Brauer algebra B$_n$(d) which are related respectively to the action of GL(d,$\mathbb{C}$) (and its real form GL(d,$\mathbb{R}$)) and to the action of O(d,$\mathbb{C}$) (and its real form O(1 , d$-1$)) on tensors via the Schur-Weyl duality. First of all, we give an alternative approach to the known formulas for the central idempotents of $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{S}_n$. These elements provide a unique reducible decomposition, known as the isotypic decomposition. For our purposes, this decomposition is remarkably handy to arrive at the sought after irreducible decomposition with respect to GL(d,$\mathbb{R}$). Then, we construct the elements in B$_n$(d) which realize the isotypic decomposition of a tensor under the action of O(d,$\mathbb{C}$). This decomposition is irreducible under O(d,$\mathbb{C}$) when applied to an irreducible GL(d,$\mathbb{C}$) tensor of order $5$ or less. As a by product of the construction, we give a solution to the problem of decomposing an arbitrary tensor into its traceless part, doubly traceless part and so on. These results led to the development of several Mathematica packages linked to the \textit{xAct} bundle for tensor calculus in field theory.</description>

      <title>Travel time and energy dissipation minima in heterogeneous subsurface flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a number of results concerning conditions for minimum energy dissipation and advective travel time in porous and fractured media. First, we establish a pair of converse results concerning fluid motion along a streamline between two points of fixed head: the minimal advective time is achieved under conditions of constant energy dissipation, and minimal energy dissipation is achieved under conditions of constant velocity along the streamline (implying homogeneous conductivity in the vicinity of the streamline). We also show directly by means of variational methods that minimum advection time along a streamline with a given average conductivity is achieved when the conductivity is constant. Finally, we turn our attention to minimum advection time and energy dissipation in parallel and sequential fracture systems governed by the cubic law: for which fracture cross-section and conductivity are intimately linked. We show that, as in porous domains, flow partitioning between different pathways always acts to minimize system energy dissipation. Finally, we consider minimum advection time as a function of aperture distribution in a sequence of fracture segments. We show that, for a fixed average aperture, a uniform-aperture system displays the shortest advection time. However, we also show that any sufficiently small small perturbations in aperture away from uniformity always act to reduce advection time.</description>

      <title>Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Time evolution and thermality via path integral functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$ perceives the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal state at temperature $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$, as a result of being constrained to a double-coned-shaped region known as a causal diamond. In this paper, we explore the emergence of thermality in causal diamonds due to the role played by the symmetries of conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) as a (0+1)-dimensional conformal field theory, within the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model and generalizations. In this context, the hyperbolic operator $S$ of the SO(2,1) symmetry of CQM is the generator of the time evolution of a diamond observer, and its dynamical behavior leads to the predicted thermal nature. Our approach is based on a comprehensive framework of path-integral representations of the CQM generators in canonical and microcanonical forms, supplemented by semiclassical arguments. The properties of the operator $S$ are studied with emphasis on an operator duality with the corresponding elliptic operator $R$, using a representation in terms of an effective scale-invariant inverse square potential combined with inverted and ordinary harmonic oscillator potentials.</description>

      <title>Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Quantum instability and semiclassical approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal diamonds are known to have thermal behavior that can be probed by finite-lifetime observers equipped with energy-scaled detectors. This thermality can be attributed to the time evolution of observers within the causal diamond, governed by one of the conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) symmetry generators: the noncompact hyperbolic operator $S$. In this paper, we show that the unbounded nature of $S$ endows it with a quantum instability, which is a generalization of a similar property exhibited by the inverted harmonic oscillator potential. Our analysis is semiclassical, including a detailed phase-space study of the classical dynamics of $S$ and its dual operator $R$, and a general semiclassical framework yielding basic instability and thermality properties that play a crucial role in the quantum behavior of the theory. For an observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$, the detected temperature
  $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$ is associated with a Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L = \pi T_D/\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the information scrambling rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the introduction of locally constant prefactorization algebras at a fixed scale, we show a mathematical incarnation of the fact that observables at a given scale of a topological field theory propagate to every scale over euclidean spaces. The key is that these prefactorization algebras over $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equivalent to algebras over the little $n$-disc operad. For topological field theories with defects, we get analogous results by replacing $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the spaces modelling corners $\mathbb{R}^p\times\mathbb{R}^{q}_{\geq 0}$. As a toy example in $1d$, we quantize, once more, constant Poisson structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated assemblies where building blocks misfit have been shown to generate intriguing phenomena from self-limited growth, fiber formation, to structural complexity. We introduce a graph theory formulation of geometrically frustrated assemblies, capturing frustrated interactions through the concept of incompatible flows, providing a direct link between structural connectivity and frustration. This theory offers a minimal yet comprehensive framework for the fundamental statistical mechanics of frustrated assemblies. Through numerical simulations, the theory reveals new characteristics of frustrated assemblies, including two distinct percolation transitions for structure and stress, a crossover between cumulative and non-cumulative frustration controlled by disorder, and a divergent length scale in their response.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the decay in particle intensities for a translation invariant two species system of diffusing and reacting particles on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d \geq 3$. The intensities are shown to approximately solve modified rate equations, from which their polynomial decay can be deduced. The system illustrates that the underlying diffusion and reaction rates can influence the exact polynomial decay rates, despite the system evolving in a supercritical dimension.</description>

Abstract: By twisting the spectral triple of a riemannian spin manifold, we show how to generate an orthogonal and geodesic preserving torsion from a torsionless Dirac operator. We identify the group of twisted unitaries as the generator of torsion with co-exact three form. Through the fermionic action, the torsion term identifies with a Lorentzian energy-momentum 4-vector. The Lorentz group turns out to be a normal subgroup of the twisted unitaries. We also investigate the spectral action related to this model.</description>

      <title>Non-unique Hamiltonians for Discrete Symplectic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An outstanding property of any Hamiltonian system is the symplecticity of its flow, namely, the continuous trajectory preserves volume in phase space. Given a symplectic but discrete trajectory generated by a transition matrix applied at a fixed time-increment ($\tau &gt; 0$), it was generally believed that there exists a unique Hamiltonian producing a continuous trajectory that coincides at all discrete times ($t = n\tau$ with $n$ integers) as long as $\tau$ is small enough. However, it is now exactly demonstrated that, for any given discrete symplectic dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, there exist an infinite number of real-valued Hamiltonians for any small value of $\tau$ and an infinite number of complex-valued Hamiltonians for any large value of $\tau$. In addition, when the transition matrix is similar to a Jordan normal form with the supradiagonal element of $1$ and the two identical diagonal elements of either $1$ or $-1$, only one solution to the Hamiltonian is found for the case with the diagonal elements of $1$, but no solution can be found for the other case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.05412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear algebraic equation system of two variables is numerically solved, which is derived from a nonlinear algebraic equation system of four variables, that corresponds to a mathematical model related to investment under conditions of uncertainty. The theory of investment under uncertainty scenarios proposes a model to determine when a producer must expand or close, depending on his income. The system mentioned above is solved using a fractional iterative method, valid for one and several variables, that uses the properties of fractional calculus, in particular the fact that the fractional derivatives of constants are not always zero, to find solutions of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>A phase-field approach to model evaporation from porous media: Modeling and upscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a phase-field model for evaporation from a porous medium by explicitly considering a vapor component together with the liquid and gas phases in the system. The phase-field model consists of the conservation of mass (for phases and vapor component), momentum, and energy. In addition, the evolution of the phase field is described by the Allen-Cahn equation. In the limit of vanishing interface width, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that the phase-field model reduces to the sharp-interface model with all the relevant transmission conditions on the moving interface. An energy estimate is derived, which suggests that for the diffusion-dominated regime, energy always decreases with time. However, this is not trivial in the case of other regimes. Through numerical examples, we analyze the efficiency of the developed phase-field formulation in modeling the evaporation process. We observe that our formulation is able to capture shrinking liquid droplet, in other words evaporation. Further, the phase-field model is upscaled to the Darcy scale using periodic homogenization for the diffusion-dominated regime. The effective parameters at the Darcy scale are connected to the pore scale through corresponding cell problems.</description>

Abstract: The familiar second derivative test for convexity, combined with resolvent calculus, is shown to yield a useful tool for the study of convex matrix-valued functions. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on a number of theorems in this field. These include convexity principles which play an essential role in the Lieb-Ruskai proof of the strong subadditivity of quantum entropy.</description>

Abstract: The Cauchy-Problem for 2D and 3D nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-vanishing conditions at infinity is investigated. Local well-posedness in the energy space for energy-subcritical nonlinearities merely satisfying Kato-type assumptions is proven. Our result provides the analogue of the well-established local $H^1$-theory for solutions vanishing at infinity, no further regularity assumptions on the nonlinearity are given. Global well-posedness is shown for defocusing nonlinearities provided that the nonlinear potential is non-negative. In addition, we also introduce global well-posedness in 3D for a class of nonlinearities for which the Hamiltonian energy fails to be sign-definite such as e.g. competing focusing-defocusing nonlinearities.</description>

Abstract: We argued in the paper "Geometry from Donaldson-Thomas invariants" that, when a certain sub-exponential growth property holds, the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated category should define a geometric structure on its space of stability conditions. In this paper we show how to associate a generating function to these geometric structures which we call the tau function. In the case of the derived category of the resolved conifold, this function reproduces the non-perturbative topological string partition function introduced in the paper "Riemann-Hilbert problems for the resolved conifold". In the case of the A2 quiver it is the Painleve I tau function. The definition of the tau-function depends on certain choices of additional data which we discuss in the paper. There is still much to understand!</description>

      <title>The analysis of vertex feedback stabilisability of a star-shaped network of fluid-conveying pipes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an outstanding problem whether a pipe-flow system on a star-shaped network is stabilisable by a feedback control on the common vertex. In the present paper we deal with this problem. In particular, we study the equation governing the small vibrations of a stretched elastic pipe conveying fluid in a star-shaped network and examine the question of vertex feedback stabilisability of such a system via control moments. Finding an answer to the question is not straightforward, for the system operator associated with the corresponding closed-loop system is unbounded and nonselfadjoint. An approach to the study of the stabilisation problem for the closed-loop system is presented based on the spectral approach previously introduced by the authors for star graphs of stretched elastic beams. When the tension in the pipes is greater than the square of the fluid-flow velocity, we establish a positive result that in fact gives the strong property of uniform exponential stability of the closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>Convergence Acceleration of Favre-Averaged Non-Linear Harmonic Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a numerical procedure to accelerate the convergence of the Favre-averaged Non-Linear Harmonic (FNLH) method. The scheme provides a unified mathematical framework for solving the sparse linear systems formed by the mean flow and the time-linearized harmonic flows of FNLH in an explicit or implicit fashion. The approach explores the similarity of the sparse linear systems of FNLH and leads to a memory efficient procedure, so that its memory consumption does not depend on the number of harmonics to compute. The proposed method has been implemented in the industrial CFD solver HYDRA. Two test cases are used to conduct a comparative study of explicit and implicit schemes in terms of convergence, computational efficiency, and memory consumption. Comparisons show that the implicit scheme yields better convergence than the explicit scheme and is also roughly 7 to 10 times more computationally efficient than the explicit scheme with 4 levels of multigrid. Furthermore, the implicit scheme consumes only approximately $50\%$ of the explicit scheme with four levels of multigrid. Compared with the full annulus unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations, the implicit scheme produces comparable results to URANS with computational time and memory consumption that are two orders of magnitude smaller.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the classical Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. We find the formulas for the highest weight vectors in coset decomposition and calculate their norms. We also derive formulas for matrix elements of natural vertex operators between these vectors. This leads to relations on conformal blocks. Due to the AGT correspondence, these relations are equivalent to blowup relations on Nekrasov partition functions with the presence of the surface defect. These relations can be used to prove Kyiv formulas for the Painlev\'e tau-functions (following Nekrasov's method).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate time-dependent Kantowski-Sachs spherically symmetric teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity in vacuum and in a perfect isotropic fluid. We begin by finding the field equations and solve for new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. With a power-law ansatz for the coframe functions, we find new non-trivial teleparallel $F(T)$ vacuum solutions. We then proceed to find new non-trivial teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions in a perfect isotropic fluid with both linear and non-linear equation of state. We find a great number of new exact and approximated teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. These classes of new solutions are relevant for future cosmological applications.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems using 2-qubit Yang-Baxter gates offer a benchmark for quantum hardware. This can be extended to the higher dimensional case with $n$-qubit generalisations of Yang-Baxter gates called $n$-simplex operators. Such multi-qubit gates potentially lead to shallower and more efficient quantum circuits as well. Finding them amounts to identifying unitary solutions of the $n$-simplex equations, the building blocks of higher dimensional integrable systems. These are a set of highly non-linear and over determined system of equations making it notoriously hard to solve even when the local Hilbert spaces are spanned by qubits. We systematically overcome this for higher simplex operators constructed using two methods: from Clifford algebras and by lifting Yang-Baxter operators. The $n=3$ or the tetrahedron case is analyzed in detail. For the qubit case our methods produce 13 inequivalent families of unitary tetrahedron operators. 12 of these families are obtained by appending the 5 unitary families of 4 by 4 constant Yang-Baxter operators of Dye-Hietarinta, with a single qubit operator. As applications, universal sets of single, two and three qubit gates are realized using such unitary tetrahedron operators. The ideas presented in this work can be naturally extended to the higher simplex cases.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic tachyons: a new representation of the Galilei group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An algebraic characterization of the contractions of the Poincar\'e group permits a proper construction of a non-relativistic limit of its tachyonic representation. We arrive at a consistent, nonstandard representation of the Galilei group which was disregarded long ago by supposedly unphysical properties. The corresponding quantum (and classical) theory shares with the relativistic one their fundamentals, and serves as a toy model to better comprehend the unusual behavior of the tachyonic representation. For instance, we see that evolution takes place in a spatial coordinate rather than time, as for relativistic tachyons, but the modulus of the three-momentum is the same for all Galilean observers, leading to a new dispersion relation for a Galilean system. Furthermore, the tachyonic objects described by the new representation cannot be regarded as localizable in the standard sense.</description>

      <title>The Ground State of the S=1 Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Chain is Topologically Nontrivial if Gapped</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under the widely accepted but unproven assumption that the one-dimensional $S=1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model has a unique gapped ground state, we prove that the model belongs to a nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. In other words, we rigorously rule out the possibility that the model has a unique gapped ground state that is topologically trivial. To be precise, we assume that the models on open finite chains with boundary magnetic field have unique ground states with a uniform gap and prove that the ground state of the infinite chain has a nontrivial topological index.</description>
