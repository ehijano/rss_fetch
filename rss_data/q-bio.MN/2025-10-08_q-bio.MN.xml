      <title>Mathematical Analysis for a Class of Stochastic Copolymerization Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic model of a copolymerization process that has been extensively investigated in the physics literature. The main questions of interest include: (i) what are the criteria for transience, null recurrence, and positive recurrence in terms of the system parameters; (ii) in the transient regime, what are the limiting fractions of the different monomer types; and (iii) in the transient regime, what is the speed of growth of the polymer? Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these questions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical arguments to derive the results from the physics literature. Moreover, the techniques developed allow us to generalize to the copolymerization process with finitely many monomer types. We expect that the mathematical methods used and developed in this work will also enable the study of even more complex models in the future.</description>

      <title>Fast decisions with biophysically constrained gene promoter architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cells integrate signals and make decisions about their future state in short amounts of time. A lot of theoretical effort has gone into asking how to best design gene regulatory circuits that fulfill a given function, yet little is known about the constraints that performing that function in a small amount of time imposes on circuit architectures. Using an optimization framework, we explore the properties of a class of promoter architectures that distinguish small differences in transcription factor concentrations under time constraints. We show that the full temporal trajectory of gene activity allows for faster decisions than its integrated activity represented by the total number of transcribed mRNA. The topology of promoter architectures that allow for rapidly distinguishing low transcription factor concentrations result in a low, shallow, and non cooperative response, while at high concentrations, the response is high and cooperative. In the presence of non-cognate ligands, networks with fast and accurate decision times need not be optimally selective, especially if discrimination is difficult. While optimal networks are generically out of equilibrium, the energy associated with that irreversibility is only modest, and negligible at small concentrations. Instead, our results highlight the crucial role of rate-limiting steps imposed by biophysical constraints.</description>
