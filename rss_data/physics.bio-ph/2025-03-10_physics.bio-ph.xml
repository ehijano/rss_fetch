      <title>Ion mobility and segregation in seed surfaces subjected to cold plasma treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma treatment of seeds is an efficient procedure to accelerate germination, to improve initial stages of plant growth and for protection against pathogens infection. Most studies relate these beneficial effects with biochemical modifications affecting the metabolism and genetical growth factors of seeds and young plants. Using barley seeds, in this work we investigate the redistribution of ions in the seed surface upon their treatment with cold air plasmas. In addition, we investigate the effect of plasma in the lixiviation of ions through the seeds hull when they are immersed in water. Ions re-distribution in the outer layers of air plasma treated seeds has been experimentally determined through X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis in combination with chemical in-depth profiling with gas cluster ion beams. The results show that in the shallowest layers of the seed hull (at least up to a depth of 100 nm) there is an enrichment of K+ and Ca2+ ions, in addition to changes in the O/C and N/C atomic ratios. These data have been confirmed with the electron microscopy/fluorescence analysis of seed cuts. Observations have been accounted for by a Monte Carlo model simulating the electrostatic interactions that develop between the negative charge accumulated at the seed surface due to the interaction with the plasma sheath and the positive ions existing in the interior of seeds. Furthermore, it is shown that upon water immersion of plasma treated seeds mobilized ions tend to lixiviate more efficiently than in pristine seeds. The detection of a significant concentration of NO3- anions in the water has been attributed to a secondary reaction of nitrogen species incorporated into the seeds during plasma exposure with reactive oxygen species formed on their surface during this treatment. The implications of these findings for the improvement of germination capacity of seeds are discussed.</description>

      <title>Using Label-Free Raman Spectroscopy Integrated with Microfluidic Chips to Probe Ferroptosis Networks in Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death driven by oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a pivotal research focus with implications across various cellular contexts. In this study, we employed a multifaceted approach, integrating label-free Raman spectroscopy and microfluidics to study the mechanisms underpinning ferroptosis. Our investigations included the ferroptosis initiation based on the changes in the lipid Raman band at 1436 cm-1 under different cellular states, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, DNA damage/repair, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, our work highlighted the dynamic role of vital cellular components, such as NADPH, ferredoxin clusters, and key genes like GPX-4, VDAC2, and NRF2, as they collectively influenced cellular responses to redox imbalance and oxidative stress. Quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular docking simulations (MD) provided further evidence of interactions between the ferredoxin (containing 4Fe-4S clusters), NADPH and ROS which led to the production of reactive Fe species in the cells. As such, our approach offered a real-time, multidimensional perspective on ferroptosis, surpassing traditional biological methods, and providing valuable insights for therapeutic interventions in diverse biomedical contexts.</description>

      <title>Multi-phase-field Models of Biological Tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of complex multicellular organisms from a single parent cell is a highly orchestrated process that cells conduct collectively without central guidance, creating intricate dynamic patterns essential for development and regeneration. Despite significant advances in imaging spatiotemporal dynamics of cell collectives and mechanical characterization techniques, the role of physical forces in biological functions remains poorly understood. Physics-based models are crucial in complementing experiments, providing high-resolution spatiotemporal fields in three dimensions. This review focuses on dense, soft multicellular systems, such as tissues, where mechanical deformation of one cell necessitates the re-organization of neighboring cells. The multi-phase-field model offers a rich physics-based framework to advance our understanding of biological systems and provides a robust playground for non-equilibrium physics of active matter. We discuss the foundational aspects of the multi-phase-field model and their applications in understanding physics of active matter. We also explore the integration of biological physics with experimental data, covering cell migration, heterogeneous cell populations, and confined systems. Finally, we highlight current trends, the importance of multi-phase-field models in biological and physics research, and future challenges.</description>

      <title>Selective Photothermal Eradication of Glioblastoma Cells Coexisting with Astrocytes by anti-EGFR Coated Raman Tags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and fatal tumor. The infiltrative spread of GBM cells hinders the gross total resection. The residual GBM cells are significantly associated with survival and recurrence. Therefore, a theranostic method that can enhance the contrast between residual GBM and normal astrocyte (AS) cells as well as selectively eradicate GBM cells is highly desired. In this report, GBM and normal astrocyte cells are both cultured in the same microplate well to imitate a coexistence environment and treated with Raman tags functionalized by anti-EGFR. Compared to AS cells, GBM cells show 25% higher Raman emission, and their cell death rate increases by a factor of 2. These results demonstrate potential for selective eradication of the residual GBM cells guided by robust Raman signals after the primary GBM surgery.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the dual chemotaxis strategy of bacteria in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemotaxis of bacterial swimmers that move in a run-and-turn pattern is well studied in uniform bulk fluid. It is primarily based on modulating the run time in dependence on the swimming direction with respect to the source of chemoattractant (run time bias). Here, we provide evidence that the lophotrichously flagellated soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida may also perform chemotaxis in porous media where the free path length is severely restricted. Besides the classical run time bias, we identify a second chemotactic strategy: the change in swimming direction upon a turn event is adjusted, so that the direction of the next run phase is biased towards the source of chemoattractant (turn angle bias). Agent based simulations, based on the experimentally observed statistical properties of the swimming pattern, indicate that turn angle bias is the predominant chemotaxis strategy of bacteria in porous environments.</description>

      <title>An electrical molecular motor driven by angular momentum transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of unidirectional motion has been a long-standing challenge in engineering of molecular motors and, more generally, machines. A molecular motor is characterized by a set of low energy states that differ in their configuration, i.e. position or rotation. In biology and Feringa-type motors, unidirectional motion is driven by excitation of the molecule into a high-energy transitional state followed by a directional relaxation back to a low-energy state. Directionality is created by a steric hindrance for movement along one of the directions on the path from the excited state back to a low energy state. Here, we showcase a principle mechanism for the generation of unidirectional rotation of a molecule without the need of steric hindrance and transitional excited states. The chemical design of the molecule consisting of a platform, upright axle and chiral rotor moiety enables a rotation mechanism that relies on the transfer of orbital angular momentum from the driving current to the rotor. The transfer is mediated via orbital currents that are carried by helical orbitals in the axle.</description>

      <title>First-passage-time statistics of active Brownian particles: A perturbative approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the first-passage-time (FPT) properties of active Brownian particles to reach an absorbing wall in two dimensions. Employing a perturbation approach we obtain exact analytical predictions for the survival and FPT distributions for small P\'eclet numbers, measuring the importance of self-propulsion relative to diffusion. While randomly oriented active agents reach the wall faster than their passive counterpart, their initial orientation plays a crucial role in the FPT statistics. Using the median as a metric, we quantify this anisotropy and find that it becomes more pronounced at distances where persistent active motion starts to dominate diffusion.</description>

      <title>Global graph features unveiled by unsupervised geometric deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability makes analysis and classification challenging. To address this, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework that captures both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers, linked through skip connections to preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. By mapping different realizations of a system - generated from the same underlying parameters - into a continuous, structured latent space, GAUDI disentangles invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate its power across multiple applications, including modeling small-world networks, characterizing protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analyzing collective motion in the Vicsek model, and capturing age-related changes in brain connectivity. This approach not only improves the analysis of complex graphs but also provides new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>A Workflow to Create a High-Quality Protein-Ligand Binding Dataset for Training, Validation, and Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Development of scoring functions (SFs) used to predict protein-ligand binding energies requires high-quality 3D structures and binding assay data for training and testing their parameters. In this work, we show that one of the widely-used datasets, PDBbind, suffers from several common structural artifacts of both proteins and ligands, which may compromise the accuracy, reliability, and generalizability of the resulting SFs. Therefore, we have developed a series of algorithms organized in a semi-automated workflow, HiQBind-WF, that curates non-covalent protein-ligand datasets to fix these problems. We also used this workflow to create an independent data set, HiQBind, by matching binding free energies from various sources including BioLiP, Binding MOAD and BindingDB with co-crystalized ligand-protein complexes from the PDB. The resulting HiQBind workflow and dataset are designed to ensure reproducibility and to minimize human intervention, while also being open-source to foster transparency in the improvements made to this important resource for the biology and drug discovery communities.</description>

      <title>Holistic structure of neural pathways underlies brain perceptual rivalry: Physical mechanism of auditory stream segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain perceptual rivalry, exemplified by auditory stream segregation of competing tones (A_, B__, ABA_), serves as a core mechanism of brain perception formation. While increasingly recognized as determining by neural connections rather than specific neural groups, the mechanism of brain perception remains uncertain. We demonstrate that auditory stream segregation arises from the topological structure of holistic neural pathways. By constructing a holistic pathway model using existing neurophysiological data, combining nonlinear neural dynamics and nonequilibrium physics, we uncover the biophysical mechanism of perceptual phase transitions from integrated (ABA_) to segregated streams (A_ or B_), as well as the mechanism of temporal dynamics, perceptual switching path, and attention regulation underlying these transitions. Further, we demonstrate how our framework reveals energy consumption of the auditory system and combines it with neuroelectrophysiology. Two psycho-acoustic experiments validate our predictions of perception alternation and attention modulation. Our framework provides a transformative perspective on how brain networks generate complex perceptual experiences, emphasizing the significance of neural pathway structure in the process of brain function realization.</description>
