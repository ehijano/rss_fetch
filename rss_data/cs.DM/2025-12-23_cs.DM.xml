      <title>Results on cubic bent and weakly regular bent $p$-ary functions leading to a class of cubic ternary non-weakly regular bent functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much work has been devoted to bent functions in odd characteristic, but a gap remains between our knowledge of binary and nonbinary bent functions. In the first part of this paper, we attempt to partially bridge this gap by generalizing to any characteristic important properties known in characteristic 2 concerning the Walsh transform of derivatives of bent functions. Some of these properties generalize to all bent functions, while others appear to apply only to weakly regular bent functions. We deduce a method to obtain a bent function by adding a quadratic function to a weakly regular bent function. We also identify a particular class of bent functions possessing the property that every first-order derivative in a nonzero direction has a derivative (which is then a second-order derivative of the function) equal to a nonzero constant. We show that this property implies bentness and is shared in particular by all cubic bent functions. It generalizes the notion of cubic-like bent function, that was introduced and studied for binary functions by Irene Villa and the first author.
  In the second part of the paper, we provide (for the first time) a primary construction leading to an infinite class of cubic bent functions that are not weakly regular. We show the bentness of the functions by two approaches: by calculating the Walsh transform directly and by considering the second-order derivatives (and applying the results from the first part of the paper).</description>

      <title>Finding Cliques in Geometric Intersection Graphs with Grounded or Stabbed Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A geometric intersection graph is constructed over a set of geometric objects, where each vertex represents a distinct object and an edge connects two vertices if and only if the corresponding objects intersect. We examine the problem of finding a maximum clique in the intersection graphs of segments and disks under grounded and stabbed constraints. In the grounded setting, all objects lie above a common horizontal line and touch that line. In the stabbed setting, all objects can be stabbed with a common line.
  - We prove that finding a maximum clique is NP-hard for the intersection graphs of upward rays. This strengthens the previously known NP-hardness for ray graphs and settles the open question for the grounded segment graphs. The hardness result holds in the stabbed setting.
  - We show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable for intersection graphs of grounded unit-length segments, but NP-hard for stabbed unit-length segments.
  - We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the case of grounded disks. If the grounded constraint is relaxed, then we give an $O(n^3 f(n))$-time $3/2$-approximation for disk intersection graphs with radii in the interval $[1,3]$, where $n$ is the number of disks and $f(n)$ is the time to compute a maximum clique in an $n$-vertex cobipartite graph. This is faster than previously known randomized EPTAS, QPTAS, or 2-approximation algorithms for arbitrary disks. We obtain our result by proving that pairwise intersecting disks with radii in $[1,3]$ are 3-pierceable, which extends the 3-pierceable property from the long known unit disk case to a broader class.</description>

      <title>Laplacian Network Optimization via Information Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing networks to optimize robustness and other performance metrics is a well-established problem with applications ranging from electrical engineering to communication networks. Many such performance measures rely on the Laplacian spectrum; notable examples include total effective resistance, the number of spanning trees, and algebraic connectivity. This paper advances the study of Laplacian-based network optimization by drawing on ideas from experimental design in statistics. We present a theoretical framework for analyzing performance measures by introducing the notion of information functions, which captures a set of their desirable properties. Then, we formulate a new parametric family of information functions, Kiefer's measures, which encompasses the three most common spectral objectives. We provide a regular reformulation of the Laplacian optimization problem, and we use this reformulation to compute directional derivatives of Kiefer's measures. The directional derivatives provide a unified treatment of quantities recurring in Laplacian optimization, such as gradients and subgradients, and we show that they are connected to Laplacian-based measures of node distance, which we call node dissimilarities. We apply the node dissimilarities to derive efficient rank-one update formulas for Kiefer's criteria, and to devise a new edge-exchange method for network optimization. These update formulas enable greedy and exchange algorithms with reduced asymptotic time complexity.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Unrelated-Machines Scheduling: Handling Variable Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has been effectively applied to many discrete optimization problems. However, learning-based scheduling on unrelated parallel machines remains particularly difficult to design. Not only do the numbers of jobs and machines vary, but each job-machine pair has a unique processing time, dynamically altering feature dimensions. We propose a novel approach with a neural network tailored for offline deterministic scheduling of arbitrary sizes on unrelated machines. The goal is to minimize a complex objective function that includes the makespan and the weighted tardiness of jobs and machines. Unlike existing online approaches, which process jobs sequentially, our method generates a complete schedule considering the entire input at once. The key contribution of this work lies in the sophisticated architecture of our model. By leveraging various NLP-inspired architectures, it effectively processes any number of jobs and machines with varying feature dimensions imposed by unrelated processing times. Our approach enables supervised training on small problem instances while demonstrating strong generalization to much larger scheduling environments. Trained and tested on instances with 8 jobs and 4 machines, costs were only 2.51% above optimal. Across all tested configurations of up to 100 jobs and 10 machines, our network consistently outperformed an advanced dispatching rule, which incurred 22.22% higher costs on average. As our method allows fast retraining with simulated data and adaptation to various scheduling conditions, we believe it has the potential to become a standard approach for learning-based scheduling on unrelated machines and similar problem environments.</description>

      <title>Stable Matching: Dealing with Changes in Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stable matchings that are robust to preference changes in the two-sided stable matching setting of Gale and Shapley[GS62]. Given two instances $A$ and $B$ on the same set of agents, a matching is said to be robust if it is stable under both instances. While prior work has considered the case where a single agent changes preferences between $A$ and $B$, we allow multiple agents on both sides to update their preferences and ask whether three central properties of stable matchings extend to robust stable matchings: (i) Can a robust stable matching be found in polynomial time? (ii) Does the set of robust stable matchings form a lattice? (iii) Is the fractional robust stable matching polytope integral?
  We show that all three properties hold when any number of agents on one side change preferences, as long as at most one agent on the other side does. For the case where two or more agents on both sides change preferences, we construct examples showing that both the lattice structure and polyhedral integrality fail-identifying this setting as a sharp threshold. We also present an XP-time algorithm for the general case, which implies a polynomial-time algorithm when the number of agents with changing preferences is constant. While these results establish the tractability of these regimes, closing the complexity gap in the fully general setting remains an interesting open question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The author has recently introduced an abstract algebraic framework of analogical proportions within the general setting of universal algebra. The purpose of this paper is to lift that framework from universal algebra to the strictly more expressive setting of full first-order logic. We show that the so-obtained logic-based framework preserves all desired properties and we prove novel results in that extended setting.</description>

      <title>Feature-Guided Metaheuristic with Diversity Management for Solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a feature-based guidance mechanism to enhance metaheuristic algorithms for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This mechanism leverages an Explainable AI (XAI) model to identify features that correlate with high-quality solutions. These insights are used to guide the search process by promoting solution diversity and avoiding premature convergence. The guidance mechanism is first integrated into a custom metaheuristic algorithm, which combines neighborhood search with a novel hybrid of the split algorithm and path relinking. Experiments on benchmark instances with up to $30,000$ customer nodes demonstrate that the guidance significantly improves the performance of this baseline algorithm. Furthermore, we validate the generalizability of the guidance approach by integrating it into a state-of-the-art metaheuristic, where it again yields statistically significant performance gains. These results confirm that the proposed mechanism is both scalable and transferable across algorithmic frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simple continued fractions for the Golden &amp; Silver means are well-known. It is astonishing that, as far as we know, no one has published half-iterates (let alone quarter-iterates) for the corresponding algorithms. We also examine the cosine and logistic maps (with parameter $2 &lt; \lambda &lt; 3$).</description>

      <title>Toward P vs NP: An Observer-Theoretic Separation via SPDP Rank and a ZFC-Equivalent Foundation within the N-Frame Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained separation framework for P vs NP developed entirely within ZFC. The approach consists of: (i) a deterministic, radius-1 compilation from uniform polynomial-time Turing computation to local sum-of-squares (SoS) polynomials with polylogarithmic contextual entanglement width (CEW); (ii) a formal Width-to-Rank upper bound for the resulting SPDP matrices at matching parameters; (iii) an NP-side identity-minor lower bound in the same encoding; and (iv) a rank-monotone, instance-uniform extraction map from the compiled P-side polynomials to the NP family. Together these yield a contradiction under the assumption P = NP, establishing a separation.
  We develop a correspondence between CEW, viewed as a quantitative measure of computational contextuality, and SPDP rank, yielding a unified criterion for complexity separation. We prove that bounded-CEW observers correspond to polynomial-rank computations (the class P), while unbounded CEW characterizes the class NP. This implies that exponential SPDP rank for #3SAT and related hard families forces P != NP within the standard framework of complexity theory.
  Key technical components include: (1) constructive lower bounds on SPDP rank via Ramanujan-Tseitin expander families; (2) a non-circular reduction from Turing-machine computation to low-rank polynomial evaluation; (3) a codimension-collapse lemma ensuring that rank amplification cannot occur within polynomial resources; and (4) proofs of barrier immunity against relativization, natural proofs, and algebrization. The result is a complete ZFC proof architecture whose primitives and compositions are fully derived, with community verification and machine-checked formalization left as future work.</description>
