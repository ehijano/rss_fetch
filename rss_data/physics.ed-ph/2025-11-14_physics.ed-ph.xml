      <title>On the design of a profession-oriented course on Theoretical Mechanics for physics education students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a profession-oriented course we offered at the University of Vienna, aimed at physics education teacher students. The course on Theoretical Classical Mechanics has been conceived and designed from its outset with the explicit goal of bridging the gap between the abstract, mathematical notions employed in Theoretical Physics with the concrete future needs of prospective teachers in their profession. We aimed at countering both the negative attitudes of students towards Theoretical Physics and the interrelated skepticism of professors regarding the students mathematical proficiency. Our main findings are that these goals can indeed be achieved through a careful selection of course material and the associated mathematical tools, by closely interwoven lecture topics and exercises, and thorough planning according to principles for high-school teaching known from science education research. Establishing close connections between the material taught in the course and the students future occupation as high-school teachers has proven to be of utmost importance. This is possible without any sacrifice of mathematical rigor or of the quality of Physics presented.</description>

      <title>LOCA-R: Near-Perfect Performance on the Chinese Physics Olympiad 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Olympiad-level physics problem-solving presents a significant challenge for both humans and artificial intelligence (AI), as it requires a sophisticated integration of precise calculation, abstract reasoning, and a fundamental grasp of physical principles. The Chinese Physics Olympiad (CPhO), renowned for its complexity and depth, serves as an ideal and rigorous testbed for these advanced capabilities. In this paper, we introduce LOCA-R (LOgical Chain Augmentation for Reasoning), an improved version of the LOCA framework adapted for complex reasoning, and apply it to the CPhO 2025 theory examination. LOCA-R achieves a near-perfect score of 313 out of 320 points, solidly surpassing the highest-scoring human competitor and significantly outperforming all baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Effective Note-taking and its Impact on Learning Undergraduate Introductory Physics Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taking notes during lectures is one of the required skills, among many others, that students need (i) to master the topic covered in the lecture, (ii) to actively engage in the learning process with minimal to no distractions, (iii) to retain learned knowledge and skills for a longer time, and (iv) in securing better grade. To learn the role of note-taking in learning undergraduate-level introductory algebra-based physics courses, we present a comparative study of students' achievement in two minority-serving universities, namely, Fayetteville State University and The University of North Carolina at Pembroke (i) when students were taught effective note-taking strategies, motivated them to prepare notes and let them use their self-prepared notes in timed assignments and exams versus (ii) no note-taking scheme was implemented, keeping all other conditions the same. The no-note-taking scheme was used in the first introductory algebra-based physics course, while the note-taking scheme was used in the second introductory algebra-based physics course. Students' scores on the final exam and aggregated grade, accounting for all grading components, are taken as measurement tools. Analysis shows that effective note-taking helps students secure better letter grades.</description>
