      <title>Leonessa: An Extremely Metal-poor Galaxy Undergoing Secular Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies are systems with gas-phase oxygen abundances below $\sim$5% Solar metallicity (12+log(O/H)$\le$7.35). These galaxies populate the metal-poor end of the mass-metallicity and luminosity-metallicity relations (MZR and LZR, respectively). Recent studies have found XMP galaxies in the nearby Universe to be outliers on the LZR, where they show enhanced luminosities relative to other galaxies of similar gas-phase oxygen abundance. Here, we present a study of the recently discovered XMP galaxy Leonessa and characterize the system's properties using new imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope and spectra from the Green Bank Telescope and Hobby-Eberly Telescope. We use these observations to measure a tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distance (15.86$\pm$0.78 Mpc) to Leonessa, the HI gas mass, the gas-phase oxygen abundance, and N/O ratio. We find Leonessa is an isolated, gas rich (gas fraction $\mu$=0.69), low-mass (log(M$_\star$/M$_\odot$)=6.12$\pm$0.08), XMP (12+log(O/H)=7.32$\pm$0.04), star-forming galaxy at a distance of 15.86$\pm$0.78 Mpc. Our measurements show that Leonessa agrees with the MZR, but disagrees with the LZR; we conclude the LZR offset is due to recent star formation enhancing the system's luminosity. To investigate possible chemical evolution pathways for nearby XMP galaxies we also compile a comparison sample of 150 dwarf galaxies (53 XMP systems) taken from the literature with gas-phase metallicity measurements based on the direct method. We find evidence for an anti-correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and HI gas-to-stellar mass ratios. We posit Leonessa is undergoing a chemical evolution pathway typical of field dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Interstellar Medium in IZw18 seen with JWST/MIRI: I. Highly Ionized Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI spectra from the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer of IZw18, a nearby dwarf galaxy with a metallicity of $\sim$3% Solar. Its proximity enables a detailed study of highly ionized gas that can be interpreted in the context of newly discovered high-redshift dwarf galaxies. We derive aperture spectra centered on eleven regions of interest; the spectra show very low extinction, A_V $\lesssim 0.1$, consistent with optical determinations. The gas is highly ionized; we have detected 10 fine-structure lines, including [OIV] 25.9 micron with an ionization potential (IP) of $\sim$ 55 eV, and [NeV] 14.3 micron with an IP of $\sim$ 97 eV. The ionization state of IZw18 falls at the extreme upper end of all of the line ratios we analyzed, but not coincident with galaxies containing an accreting massive black hole (active galactic nucleus). Comparison of the line ratios with state-of-the-art photoionization and shock models suggests that the high ionization state in IZw18 is not due to shocks. Rather it can be attributed to metal-poor stellar populations with a self-consistent contribution of X-ray binaries or ultra-luminous X-ray sources. It could also be partially due to a small number of hot low-metallicity Wolf-Rayet stars ionizing the gas; a small fraction (a few percent) of the ionization could come from an intermediate-mass black hole. Our spectroscopy also revealed four 14 micron continuum sources, $\gtrsim 30-100$ pc in diameter, three of which were not previously identified. Their properties are consistent with HII regions ionized by young star clusters.</description>

      <title>A Promise for the JWST era: Massive black holes directly collapsed from wave dark matter haloes, and Star formation in and around their accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several puzzling phenomena from recent JWST observations, which seem to push the standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology over the edge. All those puzzles can be understood in a coherent way if we assume that first massive black holes (MBHs, the "heavy eggs") formed by directly collapsing from wave CDM haloes, which can be even earlier than the formation of first galaxies (the "chickens"). We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to prevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely "maximum stable mass" and "bosenova") and point out that general-relativistic instabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in spinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs formed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic of a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of synchronized periodic variability of methanol maser features in G26.598-0.024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We report the discovery of periodic maser variability of an unusual pattern in the high-mass young stellar object G26.598-0.024. Methods. A ten-year monitoring of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser was carried out with the Torun 32 m radio telescope. The archival data collected so far were also used to characterize the target with high angular resolution and examine its infrared variability. Results. We found anticorrelated flux variations of the opposite blueshifted and redshifted emission features with a period of 70.1 (2.2) d and the relative amplitude of 1.3 and 0.6, respectively. The light curves are best fit with a sinusoidal function modulated by mild changes in the average flux density on 3-5 yr timescales. The emission of the middle parts of the spectrum shows only long-term variability. High-angular-resolution data indicate that the maser is associated with one of the two 1.3 mm dust emission cores, while the periodic comes from two extended regions ~1500 au apart. We discuss several possible causes of the peculiar variability.</description>

      <title>Balmer series fluxes from Pop. III Stars: A-SLOTH Predictions for JWST Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting Population III (Pop. III) stars remains a major observational challenge. Their Balmer series recombination line emission, redshifted into the infrared at $z \sim 5-11$, is a potential tracer. JWST/NIRSpec offers the first opportunity to detect such lines, provided fluxes exceed instrumental sensitivity. This study aims to model the expected luminosities of the first four Balmer series transitions from Pop. III star-forming halos and assess their detectability with JWST/NIRSpec across $5 \leq z \leq 11$. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH with merger trees constructed from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism and cosmological N-body simulations targeting Milky Way-like halos and the halo population in a 8~Mpc$/h$ box. Predicted fluxes are compared to JWST detection limits derived from the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) assuming a 10,000 s NIRSpec exposure at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For our default model parameters, Pop. III H$\alpha$ fluxes peak at $\sim10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, 2-3 orders of magnitude below the JWST detection threshold ($\sim6 \times 10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). The fluxes in the other Balmer series lines are weaker than H$\alpha$ and hence are also not detectable. Among the model parameters that we explore, the ionizing photon escape fraction $f_{\mathrm{esc,III}}$ has the strongest effect on Pop. III Balmer series fluxes when changed: reducing $f_\mathrm{esc,III}$ from 0.9 to 0.1 increases the fluxes by $\gtrsim$1 order of magnitude. However, even in this case, the lines remain undetectable.
  Balmer series lines powered by emission from Pop. III stars will be undetectable by JWST without strong lensing ($\mu \gtrsim 10$). A-SLOTH provides a useful tool to predict emission strengths and assess the detectability of Pop. III stars across cosmic history.</description>

      <title>A Galactic Interloper: A Study of the Cam OB1 Association's Clusters and its Visitor from the Perseus Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the molecular clouds of the Camelopardis OB1 association exists a region previously noted as one subgroup. However, bulk clustering from Gaia astrometry has recently shown three distinctive kinematically coherent groups, all found in a similar location in the sky ($137 \lessapprox l\lessapprox145$ and $-2\lessapprox b \lessapprox5$) and at a similar distance ($\sim$1kpc). In this work, we derive from first principles the three proposed clusters in this region, refine the membership list and cluster ages, and, for the first time, examine the 3D structure, motion, and origin of the clusters. Using clustering of Gaia data in 3D position + 2D velocity space, supplemented by available SDSS-V radial velocities, we find the clusters of ages 10, 15.8, and 20 Myr with members numbering 140, 469, and 184, respectively. All three clusters overlap currently in 3D space. Tracing their previous location, based on present-day motions, shows that each cluster originated in its own distinct region and exhibited no influence on each other's formation. Two of the clusters trace their origin to different areas within the Cam OB1 association, with the oldest cluster tracing its origins to the near edge of the Perseus arm, in the direction of the Per OB1 or Cas 0B6 associations. Overall, this work illustrates how different stellar groups, even those originating in a different spiral arm, can visit and pass through each other as they travel through the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Stingrays in the radio sky: Two unusual diffuse radio relic sources in the direction of the Magellanic Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of two extended, low surface brightness radio continuum sources, each consisting of a near-circular body and an extended tail of emission, nicknamed Stingray 1 (ASKAP J0129-5350) and Stingray 2 (ASKAP J0245-5642). Both are found in the direction of the Magellanic Stream (MS) and were discovered in the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey at 944 MHz. We combine the ASKAP data with low-frequency radio observations from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey (GLEAM) to conduct a radio continuum analysis. We explore both Galactic/near Galactic scenarios, including runaway or circumgalactic supernova remnants (SNRs) and parentless pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe), and extragalactic scenarios including radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs), dying radio galaxies, galaxy clusters, galaxy pairs or groups, head-tail radio galaxies, and Odd Radio Circles (ORCs), as well as the possibility that the morphology is due to a chance alignment. The Stingrays exhibit non-thermal emission with spectral indices of $\alpha$ = -0.89 $\pm$ 0.09 for Stingray 1 and $\alpha$ = -1.77 $\pm$ 0.06 for Stingray 2. We find that none of the proposed scenarios can explain all of the observed properties, however we determine it most likely that their shape is caused by some kind of complex environmental interaction. The most likely scenario from the available data is that of a head-tail radio galaxy, but more data is required for a definitive classification.</description>

      <title>Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect in the circumgalactic medium -- II: dependence on star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) Effect in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of $\approx$2.5 million $\rm M_{200}$=$\rm 10^{12-14}\,M_\odot$ WISE$\times$DESI galaxies out to $z$=1.2. We split the sample into quiescent (0.7 million) and star-forming (1.8 million) galaxies, exploring the relation between the thermal pressure of the CGM and star formation for the first time. We develop and implement a novel probabilistic approach to cross-correlate the galaxy catalog with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope+Planck data by taking into account the uncertainties in redshift, mass, and star formation rate. The S/N of the stacked Compton-$y$ value in the CGM varies from 4.9 to 18.5, depending on the sample size and the CGM signal strength within the relevant mass bin. We detect the CGM signal down to $\rm M_{200}=10^{12.3}\,M_\odot$, and provide stringent upper limit at $\rm M_{200}&lt;10^{12.3}\,M_\odot$. The data fit well with the standard GNFW profile of thermal pressure and do not require a flatter or steeper profile. This suggests a significant impact of cooling and the absence of dominant feedback. In galaxies with $\rm M_{200}\approx10^{12.3-12.8}\,M_\odot$ halos, the volume filling CGM is likely the largest contributor to the $galactic$ baryons at their virial temperatures of $\sim$10$^{6-6.4}\rm\,K$. For $\rm M_{200}&gt;10^{12.8}\,M_\odot$ halos, the most massive phase of the CGM is likely at a sub-virial temperature of $\rm\gtrsim 10^6\,K$. The thermal energy of the CGM of quiescent galaxies follows the self-similar relation with mass, but the star-forming galaxies deviate from this relation. This indicates that the impact of non-gravitational factors varies among halos of different degrees of star-forming activity.</description>

      <title>RAD@home citizen science discovery of two spiral galaxies where the 30-220 kpc radio lobes are possibly shaped by ram pressure stripping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the RAD@home citizen science discovery of two rare spiral-host radio galaxies (NGC 3898 and WISEA J221656.57-132042434.1 or RAD-"Thumbs up" galaxy), both exhibiting asymmetric radio lobes extending over 30 to 220 kiloparsec scales. We present a multi-wavelength image analysis of these two sources using radio, optical, and ultraviolet data. Both host galaxies are young, star-forming systems with asymmetric or distorted stellar disks. These disks show similarities to those in galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping, and the radio morphologies resemble those of asymmetric or bent FR-II and wide-angle-tailed radio galaxies. We suggest that non-uniform gas density in the environment surrounding the ram pressure-stripped disks may contribute to the observed asymmetry in the size, shape, and brightness of the bipolar radio lobes. Such environmental effects, when properly accounted for, could help explain many of the non-standard radio morphologies observed in Seyfert galaxies and in recently identified populations of galaxies with galaxy-scale radio jets, now being revealed through deep and sensitive radio surveys with uGMRT, MeerKAT, LOFAR, and, in the future, the SKAO. These findings also underscore the potential of citizen science to complement professional research and data-driven approaches involving machine learning and artificial intelligence in the analysis of complex radio sources.</description>

      <title>A dual AGN at z = 5.4 associated with a Lyman-alpha Nebula in the Center of a Cosmic Filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictions from current theories and simulations suggest that dual AGN systems are exceedingly rare at high redshifts. The intense radiation and powerful outflows from AGNs regulate star formation, heat the interstellar medium, and drive massive gas outflows that shape the host galaxy and its surroundings. One manifestation of AGN feedback is the creation of extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. However, identifying these systems at high-$z$ is challenging. Here, we report a remarkable dual AGN candidate at $z \sim 5.4$ using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec, with a separation of $\sim1.7$ arcseconds ($\sim10.4$ pkpc). This is one of the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift dual AGNs discovered. Photometric SED fitting shows excellent agreement with AGN templates, strongly suggesting a rare dual AGN system. BPT diagrams and high ionisation lines further support the presence of AGNs. VLT/MUSE observations reveal strong extended Ly$\alpha$ emission, extending to $&gt;22$ kpc, making it one of the most extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae at $z \sim 6$. This provides observational evidence of anisotropic AGN-driven photoionization or shocks. The high Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction also indicates an AGN outflow. This dual AGN candidate is also associated with a well-defined overdensity, potentially at the center of a $z \sim 5.4$ protocluster or filamentary structure node. Further analysis indicates the fraction of dual AGNs is significantly higher than theoretically expected at high redshifts. This discovery provides a new opportunity to study dual AGN interactions and their impact on the circumgalactic medium and cosmic structure evolution.</description>

      <title>Powerful Radio Sources as Probes of Black Hole Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful jetted radio sources for which the luminosity in directed kinetic energy has been empirically determined, independent of assumptions, are considered. The total outflow lifetime of each source determined in the context of detailed cosmological studies was found to depend only upon the luminosity in directed kinetic energy ($L$). The distributions of $L$, total outflow lifetime, and total outflow energy each have a broad range of values, as do the supermassive black hole masses. The total outflow energy relative to the black hole mass is a small number with a small dispersion. Three explanations of these remarkable results are considered. This could indicate (1) the efficiencies with which black hole irreducible mass is increased and spin mass energy is extracted during the outflow event, (2) that the merger of two supermassive black holes occurs over a timescale commensurate with the independently determined outflow lifetime and that these mergers lead to the production of the low-frequency gravitational wave background, or (3) that feedback shuts off black hole accretion due to energy injected into the ambient medium.</description>

Abstract: Context. Cold molecular gas tracers, such as CI and CO lines, have been widely used to infer specific characteristics of the ISM and to derive star-formation relations among galaxies. Aims. However, there is still a lack of systematic studies of the star-formation scaling relation of CO and [CI] lines across cosmic time on multiple physical scales. Methods. We used observations of the ground state transitions of [CI], CO, and [CII], for 885 sources collected from the literature, to infer possible correlations between line luminosities of $\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}, \rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and $\rm L^{'}_{[CII]}$ with star formation rates (SFR). With linear regression, we fit the relations between SFR and molecular mass derived from CO, CI, and CII lines. Results. The relation between [CI] and CO-based total molecular masses is weakly superlinear. Nevertheless, they can be calibrated against each other. For $\rm \alpha_{CO} = 0.8$ and $4.0\ \rm {M}_{\odot}\,({K}\,{km}\,{s}^{-1}\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ we derive $\alpha_{\rm [CI]} = 3.9$ and $\sim$$17\ \rm {M}_{\odot}\,({K}\,{km}\,{s}^{-1}\,{pc}^2)^{-1}$ , respectively. Using the \emph{lmfit} package, we derived relation slopes of SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}$, SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and SFR--$\rm L^{'}_{[CII](1-0)}$ to be $\rm \beta$ = 1.06 $\pm$ 0.02, 1.24 $\pm$ 0.02, and 0.74 $\pm$ 0.02, respectively. With a Bayesian-inference \emph{linmix} method, we find consistent results. Conclusions. Our relations for [CI](1-0) and CO(1-0) indicate that they trace similar molecular gas contents, across different redshifts and different types of galaxies. This suggests that these correlations do not have strong evolution with cosmic time.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: The bulge Cluster APOgee Survey VIII. Final ASPCAP results for all clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulge globular clusters(BGCs) are exceptional tracers of the formation and chemodynamical evolution of this oldest Galactic component.However, until now, observational difficulties have prevented us from taking full advantage of these powerful Galactic archeological tools. CAPOS, the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey, addresses this key topic by observing a large number of BGCs, most of which have been poorly studied. We aim to obtain accurate mean values for metallicity,[alpha/Fe],and radial velocity, as well as abundances for 11 other elements. We present final parameters based on ASPCAP for all 18 CAPOS BGCs. We carry out a stringent membership selection, finding 303 with SNR&gt;70 and 125 with lower SNR. We reinforced the finding that stars with high [N/Fe] abundances show higher [Fe/H] than their lower [N/Fe] counterparts. Mg,Ca and global alpha abundances show similar trends, while Si is well-behaved. The [Fe/H] value of these 2nd population stars is corrected to derive the mean metallicity. Mean metallicities are determined to a precision of 0.05 dex,[alpha/Fe] to 0.06 dex, and radial velocity to 3.4 km/s. No clusters show strong evidence for internal metallicity variation, including M22. Abundances for 11 other elements using only 1st population stars are calculated and are generally in good agreement with the literature. We develope a new chemodynamical GC classification scheme, synthesizing several recent studies. We also compile up-to-date metallicities. The BGC metallicity distribution is bimodal, with peaks at [Fe/H]=-0.45 and -1.1, with the metal-poor peak strongly dominant, while exsitu GCs are unimodal, with a peak at -1.6. Surprisingly, we find only a small, statistically insignificant difference in the mean [Si/Fe] of in and exsitu GCs. The 4 GCs with the lowest [Si/Fe] values are all exsitu, relatively young, and 3 belong to Sagittarius, but no other correlations are evident.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 10,059 new three-dimensional periodic orbits of general three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A very few three-dimensional (3D) periodic orbits of general three-body problem (with three finite masses) have been discovered since Newton mentioned it in 1680s. Using a high-accuracy numerical strategy we discovered 10,059 three-dimensional periodic orbits of the three-body problem in the cases of $m_{1}=m_{2}=1$ and $m_{3}=0.1n$ where $1\leq n\leq 20$ is an integer, among which 1,996 (about 20\%) are linearly stable. Note that our approach is valid for arbitrary mass $m_{3}$ so that in theory we can gain an arbitrarily large amount of 3D periodic orbits of the three-body problem. In the case of three equal masses, we discovered twenty-one 3D ``choerographical'' periodic orbits whose three bodies move periodically in a single closed orbit. It is very interesting that, in the case of two equal masses, we discovered 273 three-dimensional periodic orbits with the two bodies ($m_{1}=m_{2}=1$) moving along a single closed orbit and the third ($m_{3}\neq 1$) along a different one: we name them ``piano-trio'' orbits, like a trio for two violins and one piano. To the best of our knowledge, all of these 3D periodic orbits have never been reported, indicating the novelty of this work. The large amount of these new 3D periodic orbits are helpful for us to have better understandings about chaotic properties of the famous three-body problem, which ``are, so to say, the only opening through which we can try to penetrate in a place which, up to now, was supposed to be inaccessible'', as pointed out by Poincar\'e, the founder of chaos theory.</description>

      <title>The Loeb Scale: Astronomical Classification of Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to increase interstellar object (ISO) detections from a few over the past decade to potentially one per few months, demanding a systematic classification scheme. We present the Loeb Scale, formally the Interstellar Object Significance Scale (IOSS), a 0-10 classification system extending the proven Torino Scale framework, to address ISOs' unique anomalies, including potential technosignatures. The scale provides quantitative thresholds for natural phenomena (Levels 0-3) and graduated protocols for increasingly anomalous characteristics (Levels 4-7), with Levels 8-10 reserved for confirmed artificial origin. Each level specifies observable criteria and response protocols. We demonstrate the scale's application using 1I/'Oumuamua (Level 4), 2I/Borisov (Level 0), and 3I/ATLAS (Level 4) as test cases. The Loeb Scale provides the astronomical community with a standardized framework for consistent, evidence-based and dynamic evaluation while maintaining scientific rigor across the full spectrum of possibilities as we enter an era of routine ISO encounters.</description>

      <title>Numerical modelling of the lobes of radio galaxies VI. Polarimetric simulations of universal pressure profile cluster atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a polarization study based upon relativistic magnetohydrodynamic modelling of jets running into hydrostatic, spherically symmetric cluster atmospheres. For the first time in a numerical simulation, we derive Faraday rotation measure maps (RM maps) from model cluster atmospheres based upon the universal pressure profile (UPP), incorporating a temperature profile for a 'typical' self-similar atmosphere described by only one parameter: M500. We compare our simulated polarization products with current observational data from Very Large Array (VLA) and LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR), as well as continuing investigations from our previous work, such as the detectability of the Laing Garrington effect. We also studied the variation of mean fractional polarization with cluster mass and jet power. We produce simulated Stokes Q and U channel images and using the Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis technique we create RM maps. These data provide insight into what we should expect of current and future high-resolution polarimetric studies of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows as we were able to probe the limitations of the RM synthesis technique by comparing it with the RM map direct from our simulations. Highlights of our study include clear reproduction of polarization enhancements towards the edges of radio lobes for suitable conditions and a demonstration that complex lobe morphologies with multiple emission and Faraday active regions interspersed as might be expected in some pole-on or perhaps precessing sources should be distinguishable in observations with current technology. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster atmosphere, these numerical simulations, and the polarimetric properties derived from them, represent the most realistic yet for spherically symmetric atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Optical polarization properties of the closest tidal disruption event AT 2023clx indicate origin from tidal stream shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization observations of tidal disruption events offer unique insights into the accretion processes around supermassive black holes. Here, we present optical polarization observations of the nearby event AT 2023clx, obtained using the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our observations reveal a rise and subsequent decay in the polarization degree, temporally offset from the peak of the optical light curve, reaching maximum intrinsic polarization degree of $\sim$5 per cent. In addition, the polarization angle shifts by $\sim60^\circ-100^\circ$ between 6 to 20 days after the optical peak, remaining stable thereafter. Remarkably, the observed polarization variability closely resembles that of AT 2020mot, strongly suggesting a common mechanism for accretion disk formation in these events. The variability in both polarization degree and angle supports models in which tidal stream shocks drive the optical outburst during the accretion disk formation.</description>

      <title>Classifying Cool Dwarfs: Comprehensive Spectral Typing of Field and Peculiar Dwarfs Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- spectral types (SpTs) M0 and later -- play a significant role in studying stellar and substellar processes and demographics, reaching down to planetary-mass objects. Currently, the classification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of spectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow-/wide-band spectral indices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated approaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as large spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets containing millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in spectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\sim$ 120) near-infrared spectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and metallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as input features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed the relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and metallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN) classifies 95.5 $\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface gravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\pm$ 0.9% accuracy. We test the dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources with SNR $\gtrsim$ 60 have $\gtrsim$ 95% accuracy. We also find that zy-band plays the most prominent role in the RF model, with FeH and TiO having the highest feature importance.</description>

      <title>Linking planet formation to exoplanet characteristics: C/O as a diagnostic of planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas-giant exoplanets are test cases for theories of planet formation as their atmospheres are proposed to carry signatures of their formation within the protoplanetary disk. The metallicity and C/O are key diagnostics, allowing to distinguish formation location within the disk (e.g., relative to snowlines), and mechanism (e.g., core accretion versus gravitational instability). We can now probe the composition of the planet-forming regions of disks, and that in gas-giant exoplanets, to scrutinise these theories and diagnostics. So far, ALMA has revealed that the outer disk regions are typically metal-depleted and O-poor, whereas JWST is showing that the inner disk regions around Sun-like stars are mostly O-rich. Further, JWST is showing that most transiting gas-giant planets are typically metal-enriched and O-rich, consistent with formation at/within the water snowline and pollution by icy bodies. There is emerging an arguably "conventional" picture of gas-giant planet formation for transiting planets, to be confirmed, of course, with future data.</description>

      <title>Modeling of non-rotating neutron stars in 5D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the modeling of anisotropic magnetized static neutron stars within the framework of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (5D EGB) gravity. While Einstein's gravity has traditionally been employed to examine neutron stars, recent observational advancements have revealed its limitations in accurately describing high-mass astronomical objects-particularly in predicting or explaining certain observed neutron star masses. In response, this research seeks to address the limitations of Einstein's gravity in characterizing high-mass neutron stars by modifying the gravitational action and incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. This term holds significant dynamical relevance in higher dimensions, particularly within the context of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity explored in this study, thereby providing a more realistic description of gravitational phenomena under extreme conditions. By deriving the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and utilizing the AV18 potential, we analyze the profiles of metric functions, density and pressure, gradients of density and pressure, the anisotropic function and its trace, mass-function and compactness, the mass-radius curve, surface redshift function, equation of state parameters, and radial and tangential sound speeds. Additionally, stability factors, adiabatic indices, and energy conditions are examined. The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific values of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the model. Furthermore, higher dimensions enhance resistance to gravitational collapse, resulting in an increase in the maximum mass predicted by the proposed model. Ultimately, calculations show that the modified Buchdahl inequality is satisfied as well.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of the Protoplanetary Nebula OH\,231.8+4.2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. OH 231.8+4.2 , also known as the Rotten Egg or Calabash nebula is a protoplanetary nebula which is seen in the direction of the open cluster M 46. While an association of the nebula with the cluster has been suggested in the past, this has been never confirmed. Here, we present accurate trigonometric parallax and proper motion measurements using VLBI observations of masers in the nebula and Gaia DR3 data for the cluster.
  Methods. We observed 22 GHz H2O and 43 GHz SiO masers around OH 231.8+4.2 using the Very Long Baseline Array at 4 epochs over 1 year. We also calculated the parallax and proper motion of the open star cluster M 46 using Gaia DR3 data.
  Results. Based on astrometric monitoring for 1 year, we measured an annual parallax of OH 231.8+4.2 to be 0.65 +\- 0.01 mas (stat.) +\- 0.02 mas (syst.), corresponding to a distance of 1.54 +\- 0.05 kpc. This agrees well with the parallax of M 46 from the Gaia DR3 data, which is 0.639 +\- 0.001 mas (stat.) +\- 0.010 mas (syst.). We re-estimated the luminosity of OH 231.8+4.2 to be 1.4 x 10^4 L_sol. However, there is a 15 km/s velocity difference between OH 231.8+4.2 and M 46 which could be caused by a past merger event.</description>

Abstract: We present high angular resolution ($0.19''$ or $\approx24$ pc) ALMA observations of the $^{12}$CO(3-2) line emission of the galaxy NGC 4751. The data provide evidence for the presence of a central SMBH. Assuming a constant mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$), we infer a SMBH mass $M_\text{BH}=3.43^{+0.45}_{-0.44}[\text{stat},3\sigma]^{+0.22}_{-0.64}[\text{sys}]\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ and a F160W filter stellar $M/L_{F160W}=2.68\pm0.11[\text{stat},3\sigma]^{+0.10}_{-0.80}[\text{sys}]$ M$_\odot$/L$_{\odot,\text{F160W}}$, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. Assuming a linearly spatially-varying $M/L$, we infer $M_\text{BH}=2.79^{+0.75}_{-0.57}[\text{stat},3\sigma]^{+0.75}_{-0.45}[\text{syst}]\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ and $(M/L_\text{F160W})/(\text{M}_\odot/\text{L}_{\odot,\text{F160W}})=3.07^{+0.27}_{-0.35}[\text{stat},3\sigma]^{+0.08}_{-1.14}[\text{sys}]-0.09^{+0.08}_{-0.06}[\text{stat},3\sigma]^{+0.08}_{-0.01}[\text{sys}](R/\text{arcsec})$, where $R$ is the galactocentric radius. We also present SMBH mass estimates using the Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method and Very Large Telescope Spectrograph for INtegral Field Observations in the Near Infrared (SINFONI) stellar kinematics. Assuming a cylindrically-aligned velocity ellipsoid (JAM$_\text{cyl}$) we infer $M_\text{BH}=(2.52\pm 0.36)\times10^9$ M$_\odot$, while assuming a spherically-aligned velocity ellipsoid (JAM$_\text{sph}$) we infer $M_\text{BH}=(3.24\pm0.87)\times10^9$ M$_\odot$. The SMBH mass assuming a constant $M/L$ is statistically consistent with that of JAM$_\text{sph}$, whereas the mass assuming a linearly-varying $M/L$ is consistent with both JAM$_\text{cyl}$ and JAM$_\text{sph}$ (within the uncertainties). Our derived masses are larger than (and inconsistent with) one previous stellar dynamical measurement using the Schwarzschild orbit-superposition method and the same SINFONI kinematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations and theory suggest that Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) heating and mass loss from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars play a crucial role in the interstellar medium (ISM) of massive galaxies. We perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the central few kiloparsecs of massive galaxies, including radiative cooling and mass and energy injection from AGB winds and SNIa (resolving each SNIa remnant, a few $\times10~\mathrm{pc}$ in size), excluding black hole feedback. We study systems with different initial core thermodynamic profiles, focusing on NGC 1399. Our simulations reproduce its observed density and entropy profiles well. Over $100~\mathrm{Myr}$, two steady-state profiles emerge, depending on the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) pressure and the ratio of Ia heating to cooling: (i) if SNIa heating is less than cooling, a cooling flow develops; (ii) if SNIa heating is comparable to or exceeds cooling, SNIa heating drives a slow subsonic outflow of AGB ejecta, with black hole accretion at small radii. This outflow, pressure-confined by the CGM, adapts the ISM to the CGM properties: a low entropy CGM results in a dense, low entropy ISM with higher black hole accretion, while a high entropy CGM leads to a less dense, high entropy ISM with lower accretion. This suggests that the AGB-SNIa regulated ISM connects CGM and galaxy scales, potentially influencing black hole feedback in massive halos. Approximate methods of modeling Ia heating, such as clustered SNIa and smoothly distributed heating, produce unrealistic ISM profiles over $100~\mathrm{Myr}$, highlighting the importance of resolving SNIa in simulations.</description>

      <title>The Structure and Formation Histories of Low-Mass Quiescent Galaxies in the Abell 2744 Cluster Environment</title>

Abstract: Low-mass quiescent galaxies are thought to predominantly reside in overdense regions, as environmental effects are often invoked to explain their shutdown of star formation. These longer-timescale quenching mechanisms - such as interactions with hot gas in the intracluster medium and dynamical encounters with other cluster galaxies - leave imprints on galaxy morphologies, emphasizing the importance of quantifying the structures of low-mass quiescent galaxies in galaxy clusters at $z&lt;0.5$. Using spectrophotometric data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience programs, we present the first measurement of the quiescent size-mass relation between $7&lt;\log(M_\star/M_\odot)&lt;10$ using JWST imaging, based on a sample of 1531 galaxies in the $z=0.308$ Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. The resulting size-mass relation has a significantly higher scatter than similar-redshift field samples, despite comparable best-fit relations in both the dwarf and intermediate-mass regimes. Both "progenitor bias", where larger, diskier low-mass galaxies enter the cluster at later epochs, and a general expansion of galaxy structure from dynamical interactions could be at play. This evolutionary framework is further supported by the tentative evidence that older low-mass quiescent galaxies in the cluster are more spheroidal. The star-formation histories derived for our cluster sample imply their formation and quenching occurs relatively late, at $z&lt;1.5$. In this scenario, the progenitor population would have disky axis-ratio distributions at cosmic noon, in agreement with recent observations. While this leaves ample time for dynamical interactions to maintain quiescence and drive the observed subsequent morphological evolution post-quenching, the data disfavors an onset of quenching due to the environment.</description>

      <title>Survivors and Zombies: The Quenching and Disruption of Satellites around Milky Way Analogs</title>

Abstract: It is necessary to understand the full accretion history of the Milky Way in order to contextualize the properties of observed Milky Way satellite galaxies and the stellar halo. This paper compares the dynamical properties and star-formation histories of surviving and disrupted satellites around Milky Way-like galaxies using the DC Justice League suite of very high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way analogs and their halo environments. We analyze the full census of galaxies accreted within the past 12 Gyrs, which including both surviving satellites at $z=0$, and dwarf galaxies that disrupted and merged with the host prior to $z=0$. Our simulations successfully reproduce the trends in $M_*$-[Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe] observed in surviving Milky Way satellites and disrupted stellar streams, indicating earlier star-formation for disrupted progenitors. We find the likelihood and timescales for quenching and disruption are strongly correlated with the mass and time of infall. In particular, none of the galaxies accreted more than 12 Gyrs ago survived, and only 20% of all accreted galaxies with $M_*&gt;10^8M_\odot$ survive. Additionally, satellites with highly radial trajectories are more likely to quench and disrupt. Disruption proceeds quickly for $\geq10^6M_\odot$ satellites accreted $10{-}12$ Gyr ago, often on timescales similar to the $\sim300$ Myr snapshot spacing. For high-mass satellites, the disruption timescale is faster than the quenching timescale. As a result, 92% of disrupted galaxies remain star-forming up until disruption. In contrast, Ultra Faint Dwarfs (UFDs) tend to quench prior to accretion, and 94% of UFDs accreted up to 12 Gyr ago survive at $z=0$.</description>

      <title>Further Evidence for a Direct-Collapse Origin of the Supermassive Black Hole at the Center of the Infinity Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The z=1.14 $\infty$ galaxy consists of two ringed nuclei with an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) in between them. The system is likely the result of a nearly face-on collision between two disk galaxies with massive bulges. In van Dokkum et al. (2025) we suggested that the SMBH may have formed from shocked and compressed gas at the collision site, in a runaway gravitational collapse. Here we test this hypothesis using newly obtained JWST NIRSpec IFU observations. We first confirm that the system has a cloud of gas in between the nuclei that is photo-ionized by an AGN-like object near its center. Next, we constrain the origin of the SMBH from its radial velocity. If it formed in the cloud its velocity should be similar to the surrounding gas, whereas it would be offset if the SMBH had escaped from one of the nuclei or were associated with a faint galaxy. We find that the radial velocity of the SMBH is within $\sim 50$ km/s of that of the surrounding gas, as expected if the SMBH formed within the cloud. Unexpectedly, we find that both nuclei have active SMBHs as well, as inferred from very broad H$\alpha$ emission with FWHM $\sim 3000$ km/s. This rules out scenarios where the central SMBH was ejected from one of the nuclei in a gravitational recoil. Taken together, these results strengthen the hypothesis that the object at the center of the $\infty$ galaxy is a newly formed SMBH.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing patchy helium reionization using the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure</title>

Abstract: The intergalactic helium became fully ionized by the end of cosmic noon ($z\sim2$). Similarly to the reionization of hydrogen, helium reionization is expected to be patchy, driven by luminous quasars that ionize the intergalactic gas in their surrounding environment. Probing the morphology of ionized electrons during this epoch can provide crucial information about early structure formation, including the clustering and luminosities of quasars, the accretion rates, variability, and lifetimes of active galactic nuclei, as well as the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes. In this study, we present how measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be used to reconstruct the optical-depth fluctuations resulting from patchy helium reionization. As helium reionization occurred at lower redshifts, upcoming probes of large-scale structure surveys will present a significant opportunity to enhance the prospects of probing this epoch by their combined analysis with the CMB. Using a joint information-matrix analysis of hydrogen and helium reionization, we show that near-future galaxy and CMB surveys will have enough statistical power to detect optical-depth fluctuations due to doubly-ionized helium, providing a way of measuring the redshift and duration of helium reionization to high significance. We also show that modeling uncertainties in helium reionization can impact the measurement precision of parameters characterizing hydrogen reionization.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Substructure or Source Model Systematics? A Case Study of Cluster Lens Abell S1063</title>

Abstract: Mapping the small-scale structure of the universe through gravitational lensing is a promising tool for probing the particle nature of dark matter. Curved Arc Basis (CAB) has been proposed as a local lensing formalism in galaxy clusters, with the potential to detect low-mass dark matter substructure. In this work, we analyze the cluster lens Abell S1063 in search of dark matter substructure with the CAB formalism, using multi-band imaging data from JWST. We use two different source modeling methods: shapelets and pixel-based source reconstruction based on Delaunay triangulation. We find that source modeling systematics from shapelets result in a disagreement between Curved Arc Basis parameters measured from different filters. Source modeling with Delaunay significantly alleviates this systematic, as seen in the improvement in agreement across filters. We also find that inadequate complexity in source modeling can result in convincing spurious detections of dark matter substructure from strong gravitational lenses, as seen by our $\Delta \text{BIC} &gt; 20$ measurement of a $M \sim 10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$ subhalo with shapelets, a spurious detection that is not reproduced with Delaunay source modeling. We demonstrate that multi-band analysis with different JWST filters is key for disentangling source and lens model systematics from dark matter substructure detections.</description>

      <title>SPHERE/ZIMPOL insights into discs around evolved stars: arcs, asymmetries and dust properties</title>

Abstract: Second-generation circumbinary discs around evolved binary stars, such as post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) binaries, provide insights into poorly understood mechanisms of dust processing and disc evolution across diverse stellar environments. We present a multi-wavelength polarimetric survey of five evolved binary systems - AR Pup, HR 4049, HR 4226, U Mon, and V709 Car - using the Very Large Telescope SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument. Post-AGB discs show significant polarimetric brightness at optical and near-IR wavelengths, often exceeding 1% of the system's total intensity. We also measured a maximum fractional polarisation of the scattered light for AR Pup of ~0.7 in the V-band and ~0.55 in the I-band. To investigate wavelength-dependent polarisation, we combine the SPHERE/ZIMPOL dataset with results from previous SPHERE/IRDIS studies. This analysis reveals that post-AGB discs exhibit a grey to blue polarimetric colour in the optical and near-IR. Along with high fractional polarisation of the scattered light and polarised intensity distribution, these findings are consistent with a surface dust composition dominated by porous aggregates, reinforcing independent observational evidence for such grains in post-AGB circumbinary discs. We also find evidence of diverse disc geometries within the post-AGB sample, including arcs, asymmetries and significant variations in disc size across optical and near-IR wavelengths for some systems (U Mon, V709 Car). On comparing post-AGB discs to circumstellar environments around AGB stars and YSOs, we found that post-AGB systems exhibit a higher degree of polarisation than single AGB stars and are comparable to the brightest protoplanetary discs around YSOs.</description>

      <title>Constraining the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster Abell 2142 using MeerKAT L-band polarisation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields permeate the Universe, including galaxy clusters, and affect the thermodynamical properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that seed magnetic fields are amplified up to the $\mu$G-level in the ICM, but the magnetic field strength and structure have been studied in only a few clusters. Abell 2142 is a local massive cluster that shows evidence of a post-merger dynamical state. In this work, we aim to constrain the magnetic field intensity, radial profile and power spectrum within its ICM, providing key insights into the nature of this non-thermal component in galaxy clusters. We present MeerKAT observations of Abell 2142 in the L-band (872-1712 MHz), imaged in polarisation for the first time with this purpose. We derive the Rotation Measure (RM) from the radio galaxies' polarised emission by applying the RM synthesis technique and analyse both the RM and fractional polarisation ($\mathrm{F_p}$). To investigate the magnetic field distribution within the ICM, we compare our results with mock RM maps generated from 3D simulations of the cluster. We find that the RM dispersion, $\sigma_{\mathrm{RM}}$, decreases with projected radius, whereas the $\mathrm{F_p}$ increases. Both trends suggest that the magnetic field intensity decreases at larger distances from the cluster center, in agreement with studies on other clusters. Assuming that the magnetic field energy density scales with the gas thermal energy ($B \propto n_e^{0.5}$), a magnetic field with a power spectrum ranging from scales between 7 and 470 kpc, with peak at $\sim 140$ kpc and mean central strength of $9.5 \pm 1.0 \ \mu$G, provides the best fit to our data. The high central magnetic field lies at the upper end of the range observed in other systems and supports the possibility of an hadronic contribution to the diffuse radio emission previously detected at the cluster center.</description>

      <title>C3PO V: Comoving stellar pairs indicate rotational spin-down drives the main-sequence Li-Dip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lithium-dip observed in mid-F dwarfs remains a long-standing challenge for stellar evolution models. We present high-precision stellar parameters and A(Li) for 22 new comoving pairs, primarily located on the hotter side of the Li-Dip. Combined with pairs from the C3PO catalog, our sample includes 124 stars with Teff between 6000 and 7300 K, encompassing and extending slightly beyond the Li-Dip. Among them, 49 comoving pairs (98 stars) have both components within the temperature range of interest. Using this expanded set of comoving pairs observed with high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that rotational spin-down is the dominant process responsible for Li depletion in the Li-Dip. First, within comoving pairs, the star with v sin i &gt; 12 km/s shows higher A(Li) than its more slowly rotating companion within the Li-Dip, indicating that rotation-dependent mixing drives lithium depletion. Second, we observe a correlation between A(Li) and v sin i: fast rotators retain higher A(Li) with less scatter, while slow rotators show lower A(Li) and greater dispersion. Third, among slow rotators, A(Li) varies widely, suggesting that differences in initial rotation rates and spin-down histories influence how much Li is depleted. Some stars may have formed as fast rotators and spun down rapidly, leading to more Li depletion, while others may have started as slow rotators and retained more of their initial Li. These results demonstrate that rotational induced mixing plays an important role in shaping the Li-Dip beyond the effects of stellar age and mass.</description>

      <title>Halo Occupation Distribution of Quasars: Dependence on Luminosity, Redshift, Black Hole Mass and Feedback Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to explore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar halo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the quasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\sim 10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function. We note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars selected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias (a factor of $\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\sim 10-70\%$ in the satellite occupation fraction) is introduced in the reconstruction of quasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation function, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the central occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the occupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows a power-law like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction of quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \%$ of the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with previous clustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while the occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and feedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole (SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter space is well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has been found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.</description>
