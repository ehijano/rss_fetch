      <title>Voter demographics and socio-economic factors in kinetic models for opinion formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voter demographics and socio-economic factors like age, sex, ethnicity, education level, income, and other measurable factors like behaviour in previous elections or referenda are of key importance in modelling opinion formation dynamics. Here, we revisit the kinetic opinion formation model from D\"uring and Wright (2022) and compare in more detail the influence of different choices of characteristic demographic factors and initial conditions. The model is based on the kinetic opinion formation model by Toscani (2006) and the leader-follower model of D\"uring et al. (2009) which leads to a system of Fokker-Planck-type partial differential equations. In the run-up to the 2024 general election in the United Kingdom, we consider in our numerical experiments the situation in the so-called `Red Wall' in North and Midlands of England and compare our simulation results to other election forecasts.</description>

      <title>Impact of quantum noise on phase transitions in an atom-cavity system with limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations are inherent in open quantum systems and they affect not only the statistical properties of the initial state but also the time evolution of the system. Using a generic minimal model, we show that quantum noise smoothens the transition between a stationary and a dynamical phase corresponding to a limit cycle (LC) in the semiclassical mean-field approximation of a generic open quantum system. Employing truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we show that the inherent quantum noise pushes the system to exhibit signatures of LCs for interaction strengths lower than the critical value predicted by the standard mean-field theory, suggesting a noise-induced emergence of temporal ordering. Our work demonstrates that the apparent crossover-like behaviour between stationary phases brought by finite-size effects from quantum fluctuations also apply to transitions involving dynamical phases. To demonstrate this on a specific physical system, we consider a transversely pumped atom-cavity setup, wherein LCs have been observed and identified as continuous time crystals (CTCs). We compare the oscillation frequencies of the LCs in the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) regimes, and find that the frequencies have larger shot-to-shot fluctuations in 1D. This has an important consequence in the effectiveness of entrainment of LCs for a periodically driven pump intensity or light-matter coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Divergence asymmetry and connected components in a general duplication-divergence graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter introduces a generalization of known duplication-divergence models for growing random graphs. This general duplication-divergence model includes a new coupled divergence asymmetry rate, which allows to obtain the structure of random growing networks by duplication-divergence in a continuous range of configurations between two known limit cases (i) complete asymmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect only edges of either the original or the copy vertex, and (ii) symmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect equiprobably both the original and the copy vertex. Multiple connected sub-graphs (of order greater than one) (of order greater than one) emerge as the divergence asymmetry rate slightly moves from the complete asymmetric divergence case. Mean-field results of priorly published models are nicely reproduced by this generalization. In special cases, the connected components size distribution $C_s$ suggests a power-law scaling of the form $C_s \sim s^{-\lambda}$ for $s&gt;1$, e.g., with $\lambda \approx 5/3$ for divergence rate $\delta \approx 0.7$.</description>
