      <title>Explainable Galaxy Interaction Prediction with Hybrid Attention Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy interaction classification remains challenging due to complex morphological patterns and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose an attentive neural ensemble that combines AG-XCaps, H-SNN, and ResNet-GRU architectures, trained on the Galaxy Zoo DESI dataset and enhanced with LIME to enable explainable predictions. The model achieves Precision = 0.95, Recall = 1.00, F1 = 0.97, and Accuracy = 96%, outperforming a Random Forest baseline by significantly reducing false positives (23 vs. 70). This lightweight (0.45 MB) and scalable framework provides an interpretable and efficient solution for large-scale surveys such as Euclid and LSST, advancing data-driven studies of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Habitable Worlds Observatory Living Worlds Working Group: Surface Biosignatures on Potentially Habitable Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is the first NASA Astrophysics flagship mission with a key science goal of searching for signs of life on rocky habitable exoplanets beyond our solar system. The Living Worlds Community Working Group was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize planets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. The Surface Biosignatures Task assessed the measurement requirements and instrument needs to detect these biosignatures under an 'Earth through time' scenario. Surface biosignatures are planetary-scale spectral features resulting from absorption and/or scattering of radiation by organisms containing photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigments. This secondary class of biosignature can be used to corroborate atmospheric biosignatures by providing multiple lines of evidence to aid in assessing their biogenicity. Furthermore, surface biopigments are the only way to detect more primitive forms of anoxygenic photosynthesis if oxygenic photosynthesis never evolved. Key Findings: To detect biopigments on the surface of planets under Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern atmospheric compositions (15 percent coverage, 50 percent cloud cover), an SNR of 20-40 would be needed over 500-1100 nm. However, there may be some cases in which lower SNR is required; studies are ongoing. Coronagraph requirements: (1) The detection of surface biosignatures would be greatly enhanced by having as many parallel coronagraph channels as possible across the entire wavelength range with no or minimal gaps between channels. (2) Retrieval studies revealed that restricted wavelength ranges (e.g., 0.4 - 0.7 microns), such as may be used during initial survey strategies, are not sufficient to deconvolve the biopigment features from the abiotic background.</description>

      <title>Planet-Host Stars Across the Galaxy in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the 2040s, the exoplanet field will have moved from the discovery of a few thousand planets to hundreds of thousands, thanks to Gaia DR5, TESS, PLATO, Roman, and their successors. At that stage, the key bottleneck will no longer be planet detection, but our ability to understand how planetary systems form, evolve, and diversify across different stellar and Galactic environments.
  To address this, we need a large-scale, high-resolution spectroscopic survey of planet-host stars, spanning a broad range of Galactic environments (thin and thick disks, bulge, halo, clusters, associations), and including a well-defined control sample of non-hosts. Such a survey must deliver homogeneous stellar parameters, detailed abundance determinations, ages, and kinematics for tens of thousands of hosts, extending to the faint magnitudes probed by future missions but are beyond the reach of existing and currently planned spectroscopic facilities.</description>

      <title>LUMOS : Linear programming Utility for Multi-messenger Optical Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational-wave events by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA has opened new avenues for multi-messenger astrophysics; however, electromagnetic counterparts remain elusive due to large localization uncertainties. Wide-field optical surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) play a crucial role in follow-up, but efficient scheduling is essential. In this work, we present LUMOS, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach that selects fields via a maximum coverage problem and schedules observations to maximize cumulative probability while respecting observability constraints. Using 1199 GW events from O4, we compare the LUMOS scheduler with gwemopt, showing an 84.7 percent higher mean cumulative probability and better performance in nearly all cases. While designed for ZTF, LUMOS's framework parallels the M4OPT toolkit for space missions, highlighting the broader applicability of MILP-based scheduling to both ground- and space-based follow-up.</description>

      <title>Using 23 Years of ACS/SBC Data to Understand Backgrounds:Explaining &amp; Predicting Background Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analysis of 23 years of Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC data has shown that background levels can vary considerably between observations, with most filters showing over an order of magnitude variation. For the shorter-wavelength filters, the background is understood to be dominated by airglow; however, what precisely drives background variations is not well constrained for any filter. Here, we explore the causes of the background variation. Using over 8,000 archival SBC observations, we developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the background for an observation, based upon a set of 23 observational parameters. This model indicates that, depending on filter, the SBC background is generally dominated by Solar elevation, Solar separation angle, Earth limb angle of observation, SBC temperature, and target Galactic latitude.</description>

      <title>The Second CHIME/FRB Catalog of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 4539 fast radio bursts (FRBs) observed with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope between 25 July 2018 and 15 September 2023. These bursts originate from 3641 unique sources, including 981 bursts from 83 known repeating sources. For each FRB, the catalog provides a $O(10')$ estimate of sky location along with corresponding measurements of cumulative exposure time and survey sensitivity over the observing period. It includes a total-intensity dynamic spectrum between 400 and 800 MHz at 0.983 ms resolution. From this spectrum, we constrain a model of the burst morphology and measure key parameters such as arrival time, intrinsic temporal width, dispersion measure, scattering time, and flux density. This second catalog includes all FRBs from the first catalog, with every event reprocessed using a uniform and improved analysis framework. We show that previously published inferences remain valid under the updated measurements. We assess consistency of the detection rate across observational parameters, present initial distributions of burst properties, and outline ongoing and future studies that will use this catalog to investigate the nature of FRBs and their utility as astrophysical and cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>True Masses using RV data with Hipparcos and Gaia Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-period companions are detected and characterized thanks to long-baseline radial velocity surveys. Combining Doppler time-series with astrometry, and in particular with proper motion anomalies technique, it is possible to put strong constraints on their orbital inclination and true mass. This work aims to present a model that combines Hipparcos and Gaia astrometric data with radial velocity measurements to constrain the orbital inclinations and true masses of long-period companions. Additionally, we re-analyse a small sample of targets that have not yet been studied using this combined approach. This research leverages the simultaneous modelling of proper motion anomalies and radial velocities, in conjunction with an analysis of the sensitivity curve. This approach serves not only as a verification of the parameters but also as a means to acquire valuable insights into planetary systems. The new analyses reveal that some of the targets classified as brown dwarfs or small-mass stars have a planetary nature. HD 5388 b and HD 6718 b are likely planets. HD 141937 b is likely a planet, but the current dataset does not allow us to firmly constrain its true mass. HD 16760 b belongs to the brown dwarf regime and it has a probable second companion. 30 Ari B b falls within the stellar regime, but the presence of an additional stellar companion could compromise the reliability of the final results. For HD 148427 b, HD 96127 b and HIP 65891 b we determined a range for the orbital inclinations.</description>

      <title>Expect the unexpected: augmented mixture models for black-hole-population studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole population studies are currently performed either using astrophysically motivated models (informed but rigid in their functional forms) or via non-parametric methods (flexible but not directly interpretable). In this paper, we present a statistical framework to complement the predictive power of astrophysically motivated models with the flexibility of non-parametric methods. Our method makes use of the Dirichlet distribution to robustly infer the relative weights of different models as well as of the Gibbs sampling approach to efficiently explore the parameter space. After having validated our approach using simulated data, we apply this method to the BBH mergers observed during the first three Observing Runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration using both phenomenological and astrophysical models as parametric models, finding results in agreement with the currently available literature.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Aligned Anticipation of Forbush Decreases from Entropy and Fractal Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a feature-based framework to anticipate Forbush decreases in one-minute neutron-monitor records by tracking sliding-window invariants from information theory, scaling, and geometry. For each station we compute marker time series, including Shannon, spectral, approximate and sample entropy; Lempel-Ziv complexity; correlation dimension; and Higuchi and Katz fractal dimensions. Markers are smoothed with an exponentially weighted moving average and analyzed through within-station standardized first differences. Timing is referenced to an operational alignment time defined as the minimum of the smoothed count first difference, and marker leads are reported in minutes (negative values indicate anticipation). Station-level detectability is evaluated on a pre-alignment window using a robust z-score detector with bilateral threshold and persistence, without cross-correlation or hypothesis testing. We apply the pipeline to two FD episodes with broad station coverage (2023-04-23 and 2024-05-10; 28 stations each). Across events, a compact CORE panel shows consistently high detection rates and predominantly anticipatory lead distributions, with typical median leads on the order of several hours depending on the invariant and event. Lead dispersion across stations is substantial, with interquartile ranges commonly spanning a few hours, highlighting the need for station-wise criteria and distributional summaries rather than single-station inference. Representative marker trajectories confirm that early flagging corresponds to sustained pre-alignment excursions in marker differences, not tabulation artifacts. The approach is reproducible from open code, operates on native station units without cross-station homogenization, and remains qualitatively stable under sensitivity sweeps of windowing, smoothing, and detector parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave astronomy has entered a regime where it can extract information about the population properties of the observed binary black holes. The steep increase in the number of detections will offer deeper insights, but it will also significantly raise the computational cost of testing multiple models. To address this challenge, we propose a procedure that first performs a non-parametric (data-driven) reconstruction of the underlying distribution, and then remaps these results onto a posterior for the parameters of a parametric (informed) model. The computational cost is primarily absorbed by the initial non-parametric step, while the remapping procedure is both significantly easier to perform and computationally cheaper. In addition to yielding the posterior distribution of the model parameters, this method also provides a measure of the model's goodness-of-fit, opening for a new quantitative comparison across models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06087v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) excels at producing complex data structures (text, images, videos) by learning patterns from training examples. Across scientific disciplines, researchers are now applying generative models to "inverse problems" to directly predict hidden parameters from observed data along with measures of uncertainty. While these predictive or posterior-based methods can handle intractable likelihoods and large-scale studies, they can also produce biased or overconfident conclusions even without model misspecifications. We present a solution with Frequentist-Bayes (FreB), a mathematically rigorous protocol that reshapes AI-generated posterior probability distributions into (locally valid) confidence regions that consistently include true parameters with the expected probability, while achieving minimum size when training and target data align. We demonstrate FreB's effectiveness by tackling diverse case studies in the physical sciences: identifying unknown sources under dataset shift, reconciling competing theoretical models, and mitigating selection bias and systematics in observational studies. By providing validity guarantees with interpretable diagnostics, FreB enables trustworthy scientific inference across fields where direct likelihood evaluation remains impossible or prohibitively expensive.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Active-Passive Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: experimental implementation and microdosimetric characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space radiation is one of the major obstacles to space exploration. If not mitigated, radiation can interact both with biological and electronic systems, inducing damage and posing significant risk to space missions. Countermeasures can only be studied effectively with ground-based accelerators that act as a proxy for space radiation. Following an in-silico design and optimization process we have developed a galactic cosmic ray (GCR) simulator using a hybrid active-passive methodology. In this approach, the primary beam energy is actively switched and the beam interacts with specifically designed passive modulators. In this paper, we present the implementation of such a GCR simulator and its experimental microdosimetric characterization. Measuring the GCR field is of paramount importance, both before providing it to the user as a validated radiation field and for achieving the best possible radiation description. The issue is addressed in this paper by using a tissue equivalent proportional counter to measure radiation quality and by comparing experimental measurements with Monte Carlo simulations. In conclusion, we will demonstrate the GCR simulator's capability to reproduce a GCR field.</description>

Abstract: We describe the design and commissioning tests for the DSA-110 Not-So-Fast Radio Burst (NSFRB) search pipeline, a 1.4GHz image-plane single-pulse search sensitive to 134ms-160.8s radio bursts. Extending the pulse width range of the FRB search by 3 orders of magnitude, the NSFRB search is sensitive to the recently-discovered Galactic Long Period Radio Transients (LPRTs or LPTs). The NSFRB search operates in real-time, utilizing a custom GPU-accelerated search code, \texttt{cerberus}, implemented in Python with JAX. We summarize successful commissioning sensitivity tests with continuum sources and pulsar B0329+54, estimating the 90% completeness $25\sigma$ flux (fluence) limit to be ~1200mJy (~160Jy ms). Future tests of recovery of longer timescale transients, e.g. CHIME J1634+44, are planned to supplement injection testing and B0329+54 observations. An offline DSA-110 NSFRB Galactic Plane Survey was conducted to search for LPRTs, covering $-3.5^\circ&lt;b&lt;5.7^\circ$ and $141^\circ&lt;l&lt;225^\circ$ (~770 square degrees) in Galactic coordinates. We estimate an upper limit Poissonian burst rate ~2 hr$^{-1}$ per square degree (~17 hr$^{-1}$} per $3^\circ\times3^\circ$ survey grid cell) maximized across the inner $|b|&lt;0.25^\circ$ of the surveyed region. By imposing the ~1200mJy flux limit on two representative models (the magnetar plastic flow model and the White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary model), we reject with 95% confidence the presence of White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary LPRTs (beamed in a detectable direction) with periods between ~10-50s within ~95% of the surveyed region. Combined with the prevalence of LPRTs in the Galactic Plane, our results motivate further consideration of both White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary models and isolated magnetar models. We will continue to explore novel LPRT search strategies during real-time operations, such as triggered periodicity searches and additional targeted surveys.</description>

      <title>Identification and characterization of distorted gravitational waves by lensing using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can be distorted by intervening mass distributions while propagating, leading to frequency-dependent modulations that imprint a distinct signature on the observed waveforms. Bayesian inference for GW lensing with conventional sampling methods is costly, and the problem is exacerbated by the rapidly growing GW catalog. Moreover, assessing the statistical significance of lensed candidates requires thousands, if not millions, of simulations to estimate the background from noise fluctuations and waveform systematics, which is infeasible with standard samplers. We present a novel method, DINGO-lensing, for performing inference on lensed GWs, extending the neural posterior estimation framework DINGO. By comparing our results with those using conventional samplers, we show that the compute time of parameter estimation of lensed GWs can be reduced from weeks to seconds, while preserving accuracy both in the posterior distributions and the evidence ratios. We train our neural networks with LIGO detector noise at design sensitivity and a lens model that accommodates two overlapping images with a constant $\pi/2$ phase shift. We show that the lensing parameters are recovered with millisecond precision for the time delays. We also demonstrate that our network can identify signals diffracted by point masses, highlighting its flexibility for searches. By simulating thousands of lensed and nonlensed events, we determine how the detectability changes with different source properties. DINGO-lensing provides a scalable and efficient avenue for identifying and characterizing gravitationally lensed GW events in the upcoming observing runs.</description>

      <title>Development &amp; Characterization of Electrodes for large-scale Xenon Time Projection Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers are the core detector elements of many experiments that conduct searches for Dark Matter and rare events, as well as in neutrino and high-energy physics. As part of this detector technology, high-voltage electrodes are instrumental for the generation of observable signals and their physical interpretation. Thus, electrode design and manufacturing has to fulfill stringent requirements, and their production is associated with significant engineering challenges. In this work we describe the successful development of electrodes on the 1.5 m-scale, from their design and simulation to subsequent assembly and high-voltage testing in a gaseous argon environment. The produced electrodes were recently installed as an anode and a cathode during an upgrade to the XENONnT experiment.</description>
