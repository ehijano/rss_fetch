      <title>Convex surfaces with prescribed induced metrics in anti-de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a closed surface of genus at least $2$, let $h$ be a smooth metric of curvature $K&lt;-1$ on $S$, and let $h_0$ be a hyperbolic metric on $S$. We show that there exists a unique quasifuchsian AdS spacetime with left metric isotopic to $h_0$, containing a past-convex Cauchy surface with induced metric isotopic to $h$.</description>

      <title>Double extension of flat pseudo-Riemannian $F$-Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the concept of a flat pseudo-Riemannian $F$-Lie algebra and construct its corresponding double extension. This algebraic structure can be interpreted as the infinitesimal analogue of a Frobenius Lie group devoid of Euler vector fields. We show that the double extension provides a framework for generating all weakly flat Lorentzian non-abelian bi-nilpotent $F$-Lie algebras possessing one dimensional light-cone subspaces. A similar result can be established for nilpotent Lie algebras equipped with flat scalar products of signature $(2,n-2)$ where $n\geq 4$. Furthermore, we use this technique to construct Poisson algebras exhibiting compatibility with flat scalar products.</description>

      <title>The injectivity radius of the compact Stiefel manifold under the Euclidean metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The injectivity radius of a manifold is an important quantity, both from a theoretical point of view and in terms of numerical applications. It is the largest possible radius within which all geodesics are unique and length-minimizing. In consequence, it is the largest possible radius within which calculations in Riemannian normal coordinates are well-defined. A matrix manifold that arises frequently in a wide range of practical applications is the compact Stiefel manifold of orthogonal $p$-frames in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We observe that geodesics on this manifold are space curves of constant Frenet curvatures. Using this fact, we prove that the injectivity radius on the Stiefel manifold under the Euclidean metric is $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Mapping Cone and Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a smooth manifold, we associate to any closed differential form a mapping cone algebra. The cohomology of this mapping cone algebra can vary with the de Rham cohomology class of the closed form. We present a novel Morse theoretical description for the mapping cone cohomology. Specifically, we introduce a Morse complex for the mapping cone algebra which is generated by pairs of critical points with the differential defined by gradient flows and an integration of the closed form over spaces of gradient flow lines. We prove that the cohomology of our cone Morse complex is isomorphic to the mapping cone cohomology and hence independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex. We also obtain sharp inequalities that bound the dimension of the mapping cone cohomology in terms of the number of Morse critical points and the properties of the specified closed form. Our results are widely applicable, especially for any manifold equipped with a geometric structure described by a closed differential form. We also obtain a bound on the difference between the number of Morse critical points and the Betti numbers.</description>

      <title>Convergence and collapsing of CAT$(0)$-lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the theory of convergence for CAT$(0)$-lattices (that is groups $\Gamma$ acting geometrically on proper, geodesically complete CAT$(0)$-spaces) and their quotients (CAT$(0)$-orbispaces). We describe some splitting and collapsing phenomena, explaining precisely how these action can degenerate to a possibly non-discrete limit action. Finally, we prove a compactness theorem for the class of compact CAT$(0)$-homology orbifolds, and some applications: an isolation result for flat orbispaces and an entropy-pinching theorem.</description>

      <title>Orthosystoles and orthokissing numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary, we study the orthosystole, i.e. the length of a shortest essential arc from the boundary to the boundary. We recover and extend work by Bavard completely characterizing the surfaces maximizing the orthosystole in the case of a single boundary component. For multiple boundary components, we construct surfaces with large orthosystole and show that their orthosystole grows, as the genus goes to infinity, at the same rate as Bavard's upper bound.</description>

      <title>Discrete harmonic maps between hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a topological cell decomposition of a closed surface equipped with edge weights, we consider the Dirichlet energy of any geodesic realization of the 1-skeleton graph to a hyperbolic surface. By minimizing the energy over all possible hyperbolic structures and over all realizations within a fixed homotopy class, one obtains a discrete harmonic map into an optimal hyperbolic surface. We characterize the extremum by showing that at the optimal hyperbolic structure, the discrete harmonic map and the edge weights are induced from a weighted Delaunay decomposition.</description>

      <title>Hermitian Lie algebroids over analytic spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop some important properties of complex Riemannian geometry for complex algebraic varieties and study Hermitian metrics on analytic spaces. Then we define Hermitian metrics on a holomorphic Lie algebroid and consider the associated characteristic foliation with canonically induced inner product. Moreover, we consider an example of a Hermitian Lie algebroid $\mathcal{L}$ and describe the induced inner product on a special $\mathcal{L}$-invariant subspace.
  Later, we consider hypercohomologies associated with leaf spaces, leaves and some $\mathcal{L}$-invariant subspaces for the characteristic foliation $\mathfrak{a}(\mathcal{L})$ of a holomorphic Lie algebroid $\mathfrak{a}: \mathcal{L} \rightarrow \mathcal{T}_X$ over a Hermitian manifold $X$. Also, we extend the notion equivariant de Rham cohommology in the analytic case.</description>

      <title>The Lichnerowicz Laplacian on normal homogeneous spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new formula for the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on normal homogeneous spaces in terms of Casimir operators. We derive some practical estimates and apply them to the known list of non-symmetric, compact, simply connected homogeneous spaces $G/H$ with $G$ simple whose standard metric is Einstein. This yields many new examples of Einstein metrics which are stable in the Einstein-Hilbert sense, which have long been lacking in the positive scalar curvature setting.</description>

      <title>Homological Lie brackets on moduli spaces and pushforward operations in twisted K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.10990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of pushforward operations for principal $G$-bundles equipped with a certain type of orientation.
  In the case $G=BU(1)$ and orientations in twisted K-theory we construct two pushforward operations, the projective Euler operation, whose existence was conjectured by Joyce, and the projective rank operation. We classify all stable pushforward operations in this context and show that they are all generated by the projective Euler and rank operation.
  As an application, we construct a graded Lie algebra structure on the homology of a commutative H-space with a compatible $BU(1)$-action and orientation. These play an important role in the context of wall-crossing formulas in enumerative geometry.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for various polarized varieties over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, which broadly includes K-trivial case, K-ample case, Fano case, minimal models, certain classes of fibrations, certain metrized "minimal-like" models minimizes the Arakelov theoretic analogue of the Mabuchi K-energy, as conjectured in [Od15]. This is an Arakelov theoretic analogue of [H22b].</description>

      <title>Symplectic Morse Theory and Witten Deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On symplectic manifolds, we introduce a Morse-type complex with elements generated by pairs of critical points of a Morse function. The differential of the complex consists of gradient flows and an integration of the symplectic structure over spaces of gradient flow lines. Using the Witten deformation method, we prove that the cohomology of this complex is independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex and is in fact isomorphic to the cohomology of differential forms of Tsai, Tseng and Yau (TTY). We also obtain Morse-type inequalities that bound the dimensions of the TTY cohomologies by the number of Morse critical points and the interaction of symplectic structure with the critical points.</description>

      <title>On the Cheeger inequality in Carnot-Carath\'eodory spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Cheeger inequality, a lower bound on the first nontrivial eigenvalue of a Laplacian, to the case of geometric sub-Laplacians on rank-varying Carnot-Carath\'eodory spaces. The proof is geometric, and works for Dirichlet, Neumann and mixed boundary conditions. One of the main technical tools in the proof is a generalization of Courant's nodal domain theorem, which is proven from scratch for Neumann and mixed boundary conditions. Carnot groups and the Baouendi-Grushin cylinder are treated as examples.</description>
