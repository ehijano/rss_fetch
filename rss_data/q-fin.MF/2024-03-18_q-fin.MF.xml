      <title>Hydrodynamics of Markets:Hidden Links Between Physics and Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An intriguing link between a wide range of problems occurring in physics and financial engineering is presented. These problems include the evolution of small perturbations of linear flows in hydrodynamics, the movements of particles in random fields described by the Kolmogorov and Klein-Kramers equations, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Feller processes, and their generalizations. They are reduced to affine differential and pseudo-differential equations and solved in a unified way by using Kelvin waves and developing a comprehensive math framework for calculating transition probabilities and expectations. Kelvin waves are instrumental for studying the well-known Black-Scholes, Heston, and Stein-Stein models and more complex path-dependent volatility models, as well as the pricing of Asian options, volatility and variance swaps, bonds, and bond options. Kelvin waves help to solve several cutting-edge problems, including hedging the impermanent loss of Automated Market Makers for cryptocurrency trading.

      <title>A Mean-Field Game of Market Entry: Portfolio Liquidation with Trading Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider both $N$-player and mean-field games of optimal portfolio liquidation in which the players are not allowed to change the direction of trading. Players with an initially short position of stocks are only allowed to buy while players with an initially long position are only allowed to sell the stock. Under suitable conditions on the model parameters we show that the games are equivalent to games of timing where the players need to determine the optimal times of market entry and exit. We identify the equilibrium entry and exit times and prove that equilibrium mean-trading rates can be characterized in terms of the solutions to a highly non-linear higher-order integral equation with endogenous terminal condition. We prove the existence of a unique solution to the integral equation from which we obtain the existence of a unique equilibrium both in the mean-field and the $N$-player game.</description>

      <title>Optimal Portfolio Choice with Cross-Impact Propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimal portfolio choice problems in continuous time where the agent's transactions create both transient cross-impact driven by a matrix-valued Volterra propagator, as well as temporary price impact. We formulate this problem as the maximization of a revenue-risk functional, where the agent also exploits available information on a progressively measurable price predicting signal. We solve the maximization problem explicitly in terms of operator resolvents, by reducing the corresponding first order condition to a coupled system of stochastic Fredholm equations of the second kind and deriving its solution. We then give sufficient conditions on the matrix-valued propagator so that the model does not permit price manipulation. We also provide an implementation of the solutions to the optimal portfolio choice problem and to the associated optimal execution problem. Our solutions yield financial insights on the influence of cross-impact on the optimal strategies and its interplay with alpha decays.</description>

      <title>Existence of optimal controls for stochastic Volterra equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of relaxed optimal controls in the weak formulation of stochastic control problems for stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs). Our study can be applied to rough processes that arise when the kernel appearing in the controlled SVE is singular at zero. The existence of relaxed optimal policies relies on the interaction between integrability hypotheses on the kernel and growth conditions on the running cost functional and the coefficients of the controlled SVEs. Under classical convexity assumptions, we can also deduce the existence of optimal strict controls.</description>
