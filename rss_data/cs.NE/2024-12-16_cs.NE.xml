      <title>Integrating Functionalities To A System Via Autoencoder Hippocampus Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating multiple functionalities into a system poses a fascinating challenge to the field of deep learning. While the precise mechanisms by which the brain encodes and decodes information, and learns diverse skills, remain elusive, memorization undoubtedly plays a pivotal role in this process. In this article, we delve into the implementation and application of an autoencoder-inspired hippocampus network in a multi-functional system. We propose an autoencoder-based memorization method for policy function's parameters. Specifically, the encoder of the autoencoder maps policy function's parameters to a skill vector, while the decoder retrieves the parameters via this skill vector. The policy function is dynamically adjusted tailored to corresponding tasks. Henceforth, a skill vectors graph neural network is employed to represent the homeomorphic topological structure of subtasks and manage subtasks execution.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional next-generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) has attracted much attention due to its excellent performance in spatio-temporal forecasting of complex systems and its ease of implementation. This paper shows that NG-RC can be encoded as a kernel ridge regression that makes training efficient and feasible even when the space of chosen polynomial features is very large. Additionally, an extension to an infinite number of covariates is possible, which makes the methodology agnostic with respect to the lags into the past that are considered as explanatory factors, as well as with respect to the number of polynomial covariates, an important hyperparameter in traditional NG-RC. We show that this approach has solid theoretical backing and good behavior based on kernel universality properties previously established in the literature. Various numerical illustrations show that these generalizations of NG-RC outperform the traditional approach in several forecasting applications.</description>

      <title>Understand the Effectiveness of Shortcuts through the Lens of DCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Difference-of-Convex Algorithm (DCA) is a well-known nonconvex optimization algorithm for minimizing a nonconvex function that can be expressed as the difference of two convex ones. Many famous existing optimization algorithms, such as SGD and proximal point methods, can be viewed as special DCAs with specific DC decompositions, making it a powerful framework for optimization. On the other hand, shortcuts are a key architectural feature in modern deep neural networks, facilitating both training and optimization. We showed that the shortcut neural network gradient can be obtained by applying DCA to vanilla neural networks, networks without shortcut connections. Therefore, from the perspective of DCA, we can better understand the effectiveness of networks with shortcuts. Moreover, we proposed a new architecture called NegNet that does not fit the previous interpretation but performs on par with ResNet and can be included in the DCA framework.</description>

      <title>Brain-inspired Chaotic Graph Backpropagation for Large-scale Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) with unsupervised learning can solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with efficient time complexity, making them versatile for various applications. However, since this method maps the combinatorial optimization problem to the training process of a graph neural network, and the current mainstream backpropagation-based training algorithms are prone to fall into local minima, the optimization performance is still inferior to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) COP methods. To address this issue, inspired by possibly chaotic dynamics of real brain learning, we introduce a chaotic training algorithm, i.e. chaotic graph backpropagation (CGBP), which introduces a local loss function in GNN that makes the training process not only chaotic but also highly efficient. Different from existing methods, we show that the global ergodicity and pseudo-randomness of such chaotic dynamics enable CGBP to learn each optimal GNN effectively and globally, thus solving the COP efficiently. We have applied CGBP to solve various COPs, such as the maximum independent set, maximum cut, and graph coloring. Results on several large-scale benchmark datasets showcase that CGBP can outperform not only existing GNN algorithms but also SOTA methods. In addition to solving large-scale COPs, CGBP as a universal learning algorithm for GNNs, i.e. as a plug-in unit, can be easily integrated into any existing method for improving the performance.</description>

      <title>EVOS: Efficient Implicit Neural Training via EVOlutionary Selector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.</description>

      <title>Interlocking-free Selective Rationalization Through Genetic-based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A popular end-to-end architecture for selective rationalization is the select-then-predict pipeline, comprising a generator to extract highlights fed to a predictor. Such a cooperative system suffers from suboptimal equilibrium minima due to the dominance of one of the two modules, a phenomenon known as interlocking. While several contributions aimed at addressing interlocking, they only mitigate its effect, often by introducing feature-based heuristics, sampling, and ad-hoc regularizations. We present GenSPP, the first interlocking-free architecture for selective rationalization that does not require any learning overhead, as the above-mentioned. GenSPP avoids interlocking by performing disjoint training of the generator and predictor via genetic global search. Experiments on a synthetic and a real-world benchmark show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.</description>

      <title>A Gated Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Mixtures of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces KAMoE, a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework based on Gated Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (GRKAN). We propose GRKAN as an alternative to the traditional gating function, aiming to enhance efficiency and interpretability in MoE modeling. Through extensive experiments on digital asset markets and real estate valuation, we demonstrate that KAMoE consistently outperforms traditional MoE architectures across various tasks and model types. Our results show that GRKAN exhibits superior performance compared to standard Gating Residual Networks, particularly in LSTM-based models for sequential tasks. We also provide insights into the trade-offs between model complexity and performance gains in MoE and KAMoE architectures.</description>
