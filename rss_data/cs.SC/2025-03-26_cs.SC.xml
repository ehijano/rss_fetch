      <title>Enhancing Symbolic Regression with Quality-Diversity and Physics-Inspired Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents QDSR, an advanced symbolic Regression (SR) system that integrates genetic programming (GP), a quality-diversity (QD) algorithm, and a dimensional analysis (DA) engine. Our method focuses on exact symbolic recovery of known expressions from datasets, with a particular emphasis on the Feynman-AI benchmark. On this widely used collection of 117 physics equations, QDSR achieves an exact recovery rate of 91.6~$\%$, surpassing all previous SR methods by over 20 percentage points. Our method also exhibits strong robustness to noise. Beyond QD and DA, this high success rate results from a profitable trade-off between vocabulary expressiveness and search space size: we show that significantly expanding the vocabulary with precomputed meaningful variables (e.g., dimensionless combinations and well-chosen scalar products) often reduces equation complexity, ultimately leading to better performance. Ablation studies will also show that QD alone already outperforms the state-of-the-art. This suggests that a simple integration of QD, by projecting individuals onto a QD grid, can significantly boost performance in existing algorithms, without requiring major system overhauls.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric Solutions of Linear Difference Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Petkov\v{s}ek's algorithm for computing hypergeometric solutions of scalar difference equations to the case of difference systems $\tau(Y) = M Y$, with $M \in {\rm GL}_n(C(x))$, where $\tau$ is the shift operator. Hypergeometric solutions are solutions of the form $\gamma P$ where $P \in C(x)^n$ and $\gamma$ is a hypergeometric term over $C(x)$, i.e. ${\tau(\gamma)}/{\gamma} \in C(x)$. Our contributions concern efficient computation of a set of candidates for ${\tau(\gamma)}/{\gamma}$ which we write as $\lambda = c\frac{A}{B}$ with monic $A, B \in C[x]$, $c \in C^*$. Factors of the denominators of $M^{-1}$ and $M$ give candidates for $A$ and $B$, while another algorithm is needed for $c$. We use the super-reduction algorithm to compute candidates for $c$, as well as other ingredients to reduce the list of candidates for $A/B$. To further reduce the number of candidates $A/B$, we bound the so-called type of $A/B$ by bounding local types. Our algorithm has been implemented in Maple and experiments show that our implementation can handle systems of high dimension, which is useful for factoring operators.</description>
