      <title>Structures with not too fast unlabelled growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{S}$ be the class of all structures whose growth rate on orbits of subsets of size $n$ is not faster than $\frac{2^n}{p(n)}$ for any polynomial $p$. In this article we give a complete classification of all structures in $\mathscr{S}$ in terms of their automorphism groups. As a consequence of our classification we show that $\mathscr{S}$ has only countably many structures up to bidefinability, all these structures are first-order interpretable in $(\mathbb{Q};&lt;)$ and they are interdefinable with a finitely bounded homogeneous structure. Furthermore, we also show that all structures in $\mathscr{S}$ have finitely many first-order reduct up to interdefinability, thereby confirming Thomas' conjecture for the class $\mathscr{S}$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic independence of solutions to multiple Lotka-Volterra systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider some non-zero complex numbers $a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i$ with $1 \leq i \leq n$ and the associated classical Lotka-Volterra systems
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  x' = a_i xy + b_i y \newline
  y' = c_i xy + d_i y \text{ .}
  \end{cases}
  \] We show that as long as $b_i \neq d_i$ for all $i$ and $\{ b_i, d_i\} \neq \{ b_j, d_j\}$ for $i \neq j$, any tuples $(x_1,y_1) , \cdots , (x_m,y_m)$ of pairwise distinct, non-degenerate solutions of these systems are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{C}$, meaning $\mathrm{trdeg}((x_1,y_1) , \cdots , (x_m,y_m)/\mathbb{C}) = 2m$. Our proof relies on extending recent work of Duan and Nagloo by showing strong minimality of these systems, as long as $b_i \neq d_i$. We also generalize a theorem of Brestovski which allows us to control algebraic relations using invariant volume forms. Finally, we completely classify all invariant algebraic curves in the non-strongly minimal, $b_i = d_i$ case by using machinery from geometric stability theory.</description>

      <title>$\kappa$-barely independent families and Tukey types of ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two infinite cardinals $\kappa$ and $\lambda$, we introduce and study the notion of a $\kappa$-barely independent family over $\lambda.$ We provide some conditions under which these types of families exist. In particular, we relate the existence of large $\kappa$-barely independent families with the generalized reaping numbers $\mathfrak{r}(\kappa,\lambda)$ and use these relations to give conditions under which every uniform ultrafilter over a given cardinal $\lambda$ is both Tukey top and has maximal character. Finally, we show that $\mathfrak{p}&gt;\omega_1$ the non-existence of barely independent families over $\omega_1.$</description>

      <title>Some questions on entangled linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled linear orders were first introduced by Abraham and Shelah. Todor\v{c}evi\'c showed that these linear orders exist under $\mathsf{CH}$. We prove the following results: (1) If $\mathsf{CH}$ holds, then, for every $n &gt; 0$, there is an $n$-entangled linear order which is not $(n+1)$-entangled. (2) If $\mathsf{CH}$ holds, then there are two homeomorphic sets of reals $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that $A$ is entangled but $B$ is not $2$-entangled. (3) If $\mathbb{R}\subseteq \mathrm{L}$, then there is an entangled $\Pi_1^1$ set of reals. (4) If $\diamondsuit$ holds, then there is a $2$-entangled non-separable linear order.</description>

      <title>Canonical completion and duality for cylindric ortholattices and cylindric Boolean algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the algebraic and topological representation theory of cylindric ortholattices and cylindric Boolean algebras. The first contribution demonstrates that cylindric ortholattices are closed under canonical completions. By equipping a spectral topology to the dual space associated with the canonical completion, we then establish a dual equivalence between the category of cylindric ortholattices and a certain subcategory of the category of spectral spaces. This work builds on the completion and duality results obtained by Harding, McDonald, and Peinado in the setting of monadic ortholattices combined with the duality results obtained by McDonald and Yamamoto in the setting of general ortholattices. By working with the duality theory for Boolean algebras established by Bezhanishvili and Holliday, we then obtain completion and duality results for cylindric Boolean algebras. A key aspect of our duality results is that they are constructive in the sense that they obtain in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory independently of the Axiom of Choice.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality relations and operators on bounded quasi-implication algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study various relational and algebraic aspects of the bounded quasi-implication algebras introduced by Hardegree. By generalizing the constructions given by MacLaren and Goldblatt within the setting of ortholattices, we construct various orthogonality relations from bounded quasi-implication algebras.
  We then introduce certain bounded quasi-implication algebras with an additional operator, which we call monadic quasi-implication algebras, and study them within the setting of quantum monadic algebras. A quantum monadic algebra is an orthomodular lattice equipped with a closure operator, known as a quantifier, whose closed elements form an orthomodular sub-lattice. It is shown that every quantum monadic algebra can be converted into a monadic quasi-implication algebra with the underlying magma structure being determined by the operation of Sasaki implication on the underlying orthomodular lattice. It is then conversely demonstrated that every monadic quasi-implication algebra can be converted into a quantum monadic algebra. These constructions are shown to induce an isomorphism between the category of quantum monadic algebras and the category of monadic quasi-implication algebras.
  Finally, by generalizing the constructions given by Harding as well as Harding, McDonald, and Peinado in the setting of monadic ortholattices, we construct various monadic orthoframes from monadic quasi-implication algebras.</description>

      <title>Model Equivalences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We look at equivalence relations on the set of models of a theory -- MERs, for short -- such that the class of equivalent pairs is itself an elementary class, in a language appropriate for pairs of models. We provide many examples of definable MERs, along with the first steps of a classification theory for them. We characterize the special classes of definable MERs associated with preservation of formulas, either in classical first order logic or in continuous logic, and uncover an intrinsic role for the latter. We bring out a nontrivial relationship with interpretations (imaginary sorts), leading to a wider hierarchy of classes related to the preservation of reducts. We give results about the relationship between these classes, both for general theories and for theories satisfying additional model-theoretic properties, such as stability.</description>

      <title>Term Assignment and Categorical Models for Intuitionistic Linear Logic with Subexponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a typed lambda calculus ${\bf SILL}(\lambda)_{\Sigma}$, a type-theoretic version of intuitionistic linear logic with subexponentials, that is, we have many resource comonadic modalities with some interconnections between them given by a subexponential signature. We also give proof normalisation rules and prove the strong normalisation and Church-Rosser properties for $\beta$-reduction by adapting the Tait-Girard method to subexponential modalities. Further, we analyse subexponentials from the point of view of categorical logic. We introduce the concepts of a Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage to characterise models of linear type theories with a single exponential and affine and relevant subexponentials and a more general case respectively. We also generalise several known results from linear logic and show that every Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage can be viewed as a symmetric monoidal closed category equipped with a family of monoidal adjunctions of a particular kind. In the final section, we give a stronger 2-categorical characterisation of Cocteau categories.</description>

      <title>A model theory of topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An algebraization of the notion of topology has been proposed more than seventy years ago in a classical paper by McKinsey and Tarski. However, in McKinsey and Tarski's setting the model theoretical notion of homomorphism does not correspond to the notion of continuity. We notice that the two notions correspond if instead we consider a preorder relation $ \sqsubseteq $ defined by $a \sqsubseteq b$ if $a$ is contained in the topological closure of $b$.
  A specialization poset is a partially ordered set endowed with a further coarser preorder relation $ \sqsubseteq $. We show that every specialization poset can be embedded in the specialization poset naturally associated to some topological space, where the order relation corresponds to set-theoretical inclusion. Specialization semilattices are defined in an analogous way and the corresponding embedding theorem is proved. Some basic topological facts and notions are recovered in this apparently very weak setting. The interest of these structures arises from the fact that they also occur in many rather disparate settings, even far removed from topology.</description>
