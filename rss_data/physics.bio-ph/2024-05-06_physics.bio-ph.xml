      <title>An Efficient Finite Element Solver for a Nonuniform size-modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck Ion Channel Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient finite element iterative method for solving a nonuniform size-modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck ion channel (SMPNPIC) model, along with a SMPNPIC program package that works for an ion channel protein with a three-dimensional crystallographic structure and an ionic solvent with multiple ionic species. In particular, the SMPNPIC model is constructed and then reformulated by novel mathematical techniques so that each iteration of the method only involves linear boundary value problems and nonlinear algebraic systems, circumventing the numerical difficulties caused by the strong nonlinearities, strong asymmetries, and strong differential equation coupling of the SMPNPIC model. To further improve the method's efficiency, an efficient modified Newton iterative method is adapted to the numerical solution of each related nonlinear algebraic system. Numerical results for a voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and a mixture solution of four ionic species demonstrate the method's convergence, the package's high performance, and the importance of considering nonuniform ion size effects. They also partially validate the SMPNPIC model by the anion selectivity property of VDAC.</description>

      <title>Robust undulatory locomotion via neuromechanical adjustments in a dissipative medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative environments are ubiquitous in nature, from microscopic swimmers in low-Reynolds-number fluids to macroscopic animals in frictional media. In this study, motivated by various behaviours of {\it Caenorhabditis elegans} during swimming and crawling locomotion, we consider a mathematical model of a slender elastic locomotor with an internal rhythmic neural pattern generator. By analysing the dynamical systems of the model using a Poincar\'e section, we found that local neuromechanical adjustments to the environment can create robust undulatory locomotion. This progressive behaviour emerges as a global stable periodic orbit in a broad range of parameter regions. Further, by controlling the mechanosensation, we were able to design the dynamical systems to manoeuvre with progressive, reverse, and turning motions as well as apparently random, complex behaviours, as experimentally observed in {\it C. elegans}. The mechanisms found in this study, together with our methodologies with the dynamical systems viewpoint, are useful for deciphering complex animal adaptive behaviours and also designing adaptive robots for a wide range of dissipative environments.</description>

      <title>Proliferation-driven mechanical feedback regulates cell dynamics in growing tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local stresses in a tissue, a collective property, regulate cell division and apoptosis. In turn, cell growth and division induce active stresses in the tissue. As a consequence, there is a feedback between cell growth and local stresses. However, how the cell dynamics depend on local stress-dependent cell division and the feedback strength is not fully understood. Here, we probe the consequences of stress-mediated growth and cell division on cell dynamics using agent-based simulations of a two-dimensional growing tissue. We discover a rich dynamical behavior of individual cells, ranging from jamming (mean square displacement, $\Delta (t) \sim t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha$ less than unity), to hyperdiffusion ($\alpha &gt; 2$) depending on cell division rate and the strength of the mechanical feedback. Strikingly, $\Delta (t)$ is determined by the tissue growth law, which quantifies cell proliferation (number of cells $N(t)$ as a function of time). The growth law ($N(t) \sim t^{\lambda}$ at long times) is regulated by the critical pressure that controls the strength of the mechanical feedback and the ratio between cell division-apoptosis rates. We show that $\lambda \sim \alpha$, which implies that higher growth rate leads to a greater degree of cell migration. The variations in cell motility are linked to the emergence of highly persistent forces extending over several cell cycle times. Our predictions are testable using cell-tracking imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Multi-grid reaction-diffusion master equation: applications to morphogen gradient modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-grid reaction-diffusion master equation (mgRDME) provides a generalization of stochastic compartment-based reaction-diffusion modelling described by the standard reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME). By enabling different resolutions on lattices for biochemical species with different diffusion constants, the mgRDME approach improves both accuracy and efficiency of compartment-based reaction-diffusion simulations. The mgRDME framework is examined through its application to morphogen gradient formation in stochastic reaction-diffusion scenarios, using both an analytically tractable first-order reaction network and a model with a second-order reaction. The results obtained by the mgRDME modelling are compared with the standard RDME model and with the (more detailed) particle-based Brownian dynamics simulations. The dependence of error and numerical cost on the compartment sizes is defined and investigated through a multi-objective optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Leak Proof PDBBind: A Reorganized Dataset of Protein-Ligand Complexes for More Generalizable Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many physics-based and machine-learned scoring functions (SFs) used to predict protein-ligand binding free energies have been trained on the PDBBind dataset. However, it is controversial as to whether new SFs are actually improving since the general, refined, and core datasets of PDBBind are cross-contaminated with proteins and ligands with high similarity, and hence they may not perform comparably well in binding prediction of new protein-ligand complexes. In this work we have carefully prepared a cleaned PDBBind data set of non-covalent binders that are split into training, validation, and test datasets to control for data leakage, defined as proteins and ligands with high sequence and structural similarity. The resulting leak-proof (LP)-PDBBind data is used to retrain four popular SFs: AutoDock Vina, Random Forest (RF)-Score, InteractionGraphNet (IGN), and DeepDTA, to better test their capabilities when applied to new protein-ligand complexes. In particular we have formulated a new independent data set, BDB2020+, by matching high quality binding free energies from BindingDB with co-crystalized ligand-protein complexes from the PDB that have been deposited since 2020. Based on all the benchmark results, the retrained models using LP-PDBBind consistently perform better, with IGN especially being recommended for scoring and ranking applications for new protein-ligand systems.</description>

      <title>Demixing fluorescence time traces transmitted by multimode fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fiber photometry is a significantly less invasive method compared to other deep brain imaging microendoscopy approaches due to the use of thin multimode fibers (MMF diameter $&lt;$ 500 $\mu$m). Nevertheless, the transmitted signals get scrambled upon propagation within the MMF, thus limiting the technique's potential in resolving temporal readouts with cellular resolution. Here, we demonstrate how to separate the time trace signals of several fluorescent sources probed by a thin ($\approx$ 200 $\mu$m) MMF with typical implantable length in a mouse brain. We disentangled several spatio-temporal fluorescence signals by using a general unconstrained non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm directly on the raw video data. Furthermore, we show that commercial and low-cost open-source miniscopes display enough sensitivity to image the same fluorescence patterns seen in our proof of principle experiment, suggesting that a new avenue for novel minimally invasive deep brain studies with multimode fibers in freely-behaving mice could be possible.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and Stoichiometric Laws Ruling the Fates of Growing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We delve into growing open chemical reaction systems (CRSs) characterized by autocatalytic reactions within a variable volume, which changes in response to these reactions. Understanding the thermodynamics of such systems is crucial for comprehending biological cells and constructing protocells, as it sheds light on the physical conditions necessary for their self-replication. Building on our recent work, where we developed a thermodynamic theory for growing CRSs featuring basic autocatalytic motifs with regular stoichiometric matrices, we now expand this theory to include scenarios where the stoichiometric matrix has a nontrivial left kernel space. This extension introduces conservation laws, which limit the variations in chemical species due to reactions, thereby confining the system's possible states to those compatible with its initial conditions. By considering both thermodynamic and stoichiometric constraints, we clarify the environmental and initial conditions that dictate the CRSs' fate-whether they grow, shrink, or reach equilibrium. We also find that the conserved quantities significantly influence the equilibrium state achieved by a growing CRS. These results are derived independently of specific thermodynamic potentials or reaction kinetics, therefore underscoring the fundamental impact of conservation laws on the growth of the system.</description>
