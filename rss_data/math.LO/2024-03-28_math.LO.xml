      <title>Topological Vector Spaces: a non-standard approach with monads and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By generalizing the overspill principle towards directed sets, a new and extensive formalism is developed for monads and galaxies in non-standard enlargements. It is shown that monads and galaxies can be manipulated using order-preserving and order-reversing set-to-set maps, and that set properties associated with these maps can be extended not only to internal sets but to all monads and galaxies. An abstract theory of Intersections of Galaxies is introduced. These concepts are applied to basic topology as well (locally convex) topological vector spaces and their properties. Local properties and completeness can be defined and characterized effortlessly. Duality theory is studied in this framework, allowing in particular to formulate brief and insightful proofs for the theorems of Mackey-Arens and Grothendieck completeness without any technicalities.</description>

      <title>A categorical formulation of Kraus' paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a categorical formulation of Kraus' "magic trick" for recovering information from truncated types. Rather than type theory, we work in Van den Berg-Moerdijk path categories with a univalent universe, and rather than propositional truncation we work with arbitrary cofibrations, which includes truncation as a special case. We show, using Kraus' argument that any cofibration with homogeneous domain is a monomorphism. We give some simple concrete examples in groupoids to illustrate the interaction between homogeneous types, cofibrations and univalent fibrations.</description>

      <title>Elementary Properties of Free Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We start a systematic analysis of the first-order model theory of free lattices. Firstly, we prove that the free lattices of finite rank are not positively indistinguishable, as there is a positive $\exists \forall$-sentence true in $\mathbf F_3$ and false in $\mathbf F_4$. Secondly, we show that every model of $\mathrm{Th}(\mathbf F_n)$ admits a canonical homomorphism into the profinite-bounded completion $\mathbf H_n$ of $\mathbf F_n$. Thirdly, we show that $\mathbf H_n$ is isomorphic to the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of $\mathbf F_n$, and that $\mathbf H_n$ is not positively elementarily equivalent to $\mathbf F_n$, as there is a positive $\forall\exists$-sentence true in $\mathbf H_n$ and false in $\mathbf F_n$. Finally, we show that $\mathrm{DM}(\mathbf F_n)$ is a retract of $\mathrm{Id}(\mathbf F_n)$ and that for any lattice $\mathbf K$ which satisfies Whitman's condition $\mathrm{(W)}$ and which is generated by join prime elements, the three lattices $\mathbf K$, $\mathrm{DM}(\mathbf K)$, and $\mathrm{Id}(\mathbf K)$ all share the same positive universal first-order theory.</description>

      <title>Computable Scott sentences and the weak Whitehead problem for finitely presented groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $A$ is a computable Hopfian finitely presented structure, then $A$ has a computable $d$-$\Sigma_2$ Scott sentence if and only if the weak Whitehead problem for $A$ is decidable. We use this to infer that every hyperbolic group as well as any polycyclic-by-finite group has a computable $d$-$\Sigma_2$ Scott sentence, thus covering two main classes of finitely presented groups. Our proof also implies that every weakly Hopfian finitely presented group is strongly defined by its $\exists^+$-types, a question which arose in a different context.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic automatic complexity of finite strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new complexity measure for finite strings using probabilistic finite-state automata (PFAs), in the same spirit as existing notions employing DFAs and NFAs, and explore its properties. The PFA complexity $A_P(x)$ is the least number of states of a PFA for which $x$ is the most likely string of its length to be accepted. The variant $A_{P,\delta}(x)$ adds a real-valued parameter $\delta$ specifying a lower bound on the gap in acceptance probabilities between $x$ and other strings. We relate $A_P$ to the DFA and NFA complexities, obtain a complete classification of binary strings with $A_P=2$, and prove $A_{P,\delta}(x)$ is computable for every $x$ and for cofinitely many $\delta$ (depending on $x$). Finally, we discuss several other variations on $A_P$ with a view to obtaining additional desirable properties.</description>

      <title>Flip-Breakability: A Combinatorial Dichotomy for Monadically Dependent Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A conjecture in algorithmic model theory predicts that the model-checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on a hereditary graph class if and only if the class is monadically dependent. Originating in model theory, this notion is defined in terms of logic, and encompasses nowhere dense classes, monadically stable classes, and classes of bounded twin-width. Working towards this conjecture, we provide the first two combinatorial characterizations of monadically dependent graph classes. This yields the following dichotomy.
  On the structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by a Ramsey-theoretic property called flip-breakability. This notion generalizes the notions of uniform quasi-wideness, flip-flatness, and bounded grid rank, which characterize nowhere denseness, monadic stability, and bounded twin-width, respectively, and played a key role in their respective model checking algorithms. Natural restrictions of flip-breakability additionally characterize bounded treewidth and cliquewidth and bounded treedepth and shrubdepth.
  On the non-structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by explicitly listing few families of forbidden induced subgraphs. This result is analogous to the characterization of nowhere denseness via forbidden subdivided cliques, and allows us to resolve one half of the motivating conjecture: First-order model checking is AW[$*$]-hard on every hereditary graph class that is monadically independent. The result moreover implies that hereditary graph classes which are small, have almost bounded twin-width, or have almost bounded flip-width, are monadically dependent.
  Lastly, we lift our result to also obtain a combinatorial dichotomy in the more general setting of monadically dependent classes of binary structures.</description>
