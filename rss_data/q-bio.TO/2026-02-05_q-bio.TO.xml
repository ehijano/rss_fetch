      <title>Mathematical simulations of pediatric hemodynamics in isolated ventricular septal defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer modeling of the cardiovascular system has potential to revolutionize personalized medical care. This is especially promising for congenital heart defects, such as ventricular septal defect (VSD), a hole between the two ventricles of the heart. However, relatively few studies have built computer models for VSD, nor have they considered how natural adaptation to the cardiovascular system with age might interact with the presence of a small, medium, or large size VSD. Here, we combine a lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system with two key modeling components: a size-dependent resistance dictating shunt flow between the two ventricles and age-dependent scaling relationships for the systemic and pulmonary circulations. Our results provide insight into changes in hemodynamic conditions with various VSD sizes. We investigate the combined effects of VSD size, vascular parameters, and age, showing distinct differences with these three factors. This study lays the necessary foundation for studying VSD and towards building digital shadows and digital twins for managing VSD in pediatrics.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Lesion Pattern Formation in Dendritic Keratitis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dendritic keratitis is a form of eye infection caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV). The virus spreads via direct cell-to-cell infection among corneal epithelial cells. This leads to the formation of dendritic lesions characterized by terminal bulbs at their tips. Under immunosuppression, the condition may progress to geographic keratitis, which is a map-shaped lesion with dendritic tails. The mechanism of this pattern formation remains to be elucidated. In this study, we propose a mathematical model to elucidate the mechanisms of lesion pattern formation in dendritic keratitis. Our model shows that increased production of infection-suppressive cytokines induces dendritic patterns with terminal bulbs, whereas reduced cytokine levels lead to geographic patterns. Furthermore, altering the spatial distribution of cytokine production can reproduce dendritic tails. By including external cytokine secretion, we could reproduce tapered lesions observed in non-HSV keratitis. By clarifying the mechanisms behind terminal bulb formation and reproducing atypical lesion morphologies, our findings enhance the understanding of herpetic keratitis and highlight the utility of mathematical modeling in ophthalmology.</description>
