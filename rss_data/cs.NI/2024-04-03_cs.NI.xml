      <title>Critiques protocolaires d'Internet: comparaison des projets IPFS et SecureScuttleButt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores two critical infrastructure proposals as alternatives to the current state of the Internet protocols: IPFS (Interplanetary File System) and Scuttlebutt, highlighting the political a priori and debates of these technical enterprises. To do so, I propose to analyze the discourses of the developers of these two systems in the mode of a critical discourse analysis.This article highlights a particular form of criticism of Internet regimes: infrastructural criticism, and highlights its variety through a comparative study. Through these two case studies, we will see how different alternatives to the current spatio-temporal implementations of the Internet allow us to identify the agency dimensions of these acts of hijacking and substitution, characterizing two quite different approaches to decentralized protocols, yet linked by a technical similarity.</description>

      <title>A Universal Deep Neural Network for Signal Detection in Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning (DL) has been emerging as a promising approach for channel estimation and signal detection in wireless communications. The majority of the existing studies investigating the use of DL techniques in this domain focus on analysing channel impulse responses that are generated from only one channel distribution such as additive white Gaussian channel noise and Rayleigh channels. In practice, to cope with the dynamic nature of the wireless channel, DL methods must be re-trained on newly non-aged collected data which is costly, inefficient, and impractical. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel universal deep neural network (Uni-DNN) that can achieve high detection performance in various wireless environments without retraining the model. In particular, our proposed Uni-DNN model consists of a wireless channel classifier and a signal detector which are constructed by using DNNs. The wireless channel classifier enables the signal detector to generalise and perform optimally for multiple wireless channel distributions. In addition, to further improve the signal detection performance of the proposed model, convolutional neural network is employed. Extensive simulations using the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing scheme demonstrate that the bit error rate performance of our proposed solution can outperform conventional DL-based approaches as well as least square and minimum mean square error channel estimators in practical low pilot density scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Mean Field Game Model for Timely Computation in Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of task offloading in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems constituting $N$ devices assisted by an edge server (ES), where the devices can split task execution between a local processor and the ES. Since the local task execution and communication with the ES both consume power, each device must judiciously choose between the two. We model the problem as a large population non-cooperative game among the $N$ devices. Since computation of an equilibrium in this scenario is difficult due to the presence of a large number of devices, we employ the mean-field game framework to reduce the finite-agent game problem to a generic user's multi-objective optimization problem, with a coupled consistency condition. By leveraging the novel age of information (AoI) metric, we invoke techniques from stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) theory and study the tradeoffs between increasing information freshness and reducing power consumption. In numerical simulations, we validate that a higher load at the ES may lead devices to upload their task to the ES less often.</description>

      <title>Bodyless Block Propagation: TPS Fully Scalable Blockchain with Pre-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite numerous prior attempts to boost transaction per second (TPS) of blockchain system, most of them were at a price of degraded decentralization and security. In this paper, we propose a bodyless block propagation (BBP) scheme for which the blockbody is not validated and transmitted during the block propagation process, to increase TPS without compromising security. Rather, the nodes in the blockchain network anticipate the transactions and their ordering in the next upcoming block so that these transactions can be pre-executed and pre-validated before the birth of the block. Our theoretical analysis shows that BBP can improve the TPS scalability from $O(1/log(N))$ to $O(1)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the network.
  It is critical, however, that all nodes have a consensus on the transaction content of the next block. This paper puts forth a transaction selection, ordering, and synchronization algorithm to drive the nodes to reach such a consensus.To deal with the undetermined Coinbase address of the next block, we further put forth an algorithm to deal with such unresolvable transactions for an overall consistent and TPS-efficient scheme. With our scheme, most transactions do not need to be validated and transmitted during block propagation, ridding the dependence of propagation time on the number of transactions in the block, and making the system TPS scalable. \textcolor{blue}{Both our theoretical analysis and experimental results underscore the potential of BBP for achieving full TPS scalability. In particular, the experimental results show that BBP can reduce block propagation time by 4x with respect to the current Ethereum blockchain, and its TPS performance is limited by the node hardware performance rather than block propagation.</description>

      <title>Distribution Grid Monitoring Based on Widely Available Smart Plugs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing popularity of e-mobility, heat pumps, and renewable generation such as photovoltaics is leading to scenarios which the distribution grid was not originally designed for. Moreover, parts of the distribution grid are only sparsely instrumented, leaving the distribution system operator unaware of possible bottlenecks resulting from the introduction of such loads and renewable generation. To overcome this lack of information, we propose the use of widely available smart home devices, such as smart plugs, for grid monitoring. We detail the aggregation and storage of smart plug measurements for distribution grid monitoring and examine the accuracy of the measurements. A case study shows how the average monitoring error in a distribution grid area decreases the more measurement devices are installed. Hence, simple smart plugs can help with distribution grid monitoring and provide valuable information to the DSO.</description>
