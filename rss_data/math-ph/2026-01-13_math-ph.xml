      <title>Port--Hamiltonian Diffusion Models: A Control-Theoretic Perspective on Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, yet they are commonly formulated as black-box stochastic systems with limited interpretability and few structural guarantees. In this paper, we establish a control-theoretic foundation for diffusion models by embedding them within the port--Hamiltonian (PH) systems framework. We show that the score function can be interpreted as the gradient of a learnable Hamiltonian energy, allowing both the forward and reverse diffusion processes to be formulated as structured PH dynamics. The reverse-time generative process is further interpreted as a feedback-controlled PH system, where dissipation plays a fundamental role in stabilizing sampling dynamics. This formulation yields intrinsic stability guarantees that are independent of score estimation accuracy. A simple analytical example illustrates the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Generalization of the DLR Equations: $q$-Specifications and $q$-Equilibrium Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a {\it non-linear} generalization of the classical Dobrushin-Lanford-Ruelle (DLR) framework by developing the concept of a $q$-specification and the associated $q$-equilibrium measures. These objects arise naturally from a family of non-linear $q$-stochastic operators acting on the space of probability measures. A $q$-equilibrium measure is characterized as a fixed point of such operators, providing a non-linear analogue of the Gibbs equilibrium in the sense of DLR. We establish general conditions ensuring the existence and uniqueness of $q$-equilibrium measures and demonstrate how quasilocality plays a decisive role in their construction. Moreover, we exhibit examples of $q$-specifications with an empty set of $q$-equilibrium measures. We characterize the set of $q$-equilibrium measures by studying the dynamical systems generated by a class of $q$-stochastic operators. As a concrete application, we show that for the one-dimensional Ising model at sufficiently low temperatures, multiple $q$-equilibrium measures may exist, even though the classical Gibbs measure remains unique. Our results reveal that the $q$-specification formalism extends the DLR theory from linear to non-linear settings and opens a new direction in the study of Gibbs measures and equilibrium states of physical systems.</description>

      <title>Comminution as a Non-Hermitian Quantum Field Theory: Log-Size Jump Generators, Branching Embeddings, and the Airy Solvable Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure-breakage population balance equations (PBEs) give the standard deterministic description of fragmentation and comminution. They predict mean particle size distributions, but they do not determine fluctuations, size-size correlations, or universality under coarse-graining. We develop a field-theoretic framework anchored in the PBE kernel inputs (selection rate and daughter distribution) and compatible with the stochastic Doi-Peliti approach.
  From homogeneous kernels we derive an exact Markov jump generator in log-size for a mass-weighted (tagged-mass) distribution, with a jump law that is a probability density fixed by the daughter distribution. The generator is generically non-self-adjoint, admits a Lindblad embedding, and has a second-quantized extension. The deterministic PBE appears as the one-body sector, while multi-point correlators encode finite-population fluctuations. We also give a binary-fragmentation embedding whose mean-field limit reproduces the PBE but whose higher correlators capture multiplicative cascade noise. For a linear Airy-type kernel, long-wavelength coarse-graining yields an effective Airy operator as a solvable quadratic sector about a stationary profile, producing explicit mode-sum formulas for equal-time connected two-point correlations. Overall, the framework separates what is fixed by kernel data from what requires additional stochastic modeling and links comminution kernels to universality classes.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for the divisor of the good Boussinesq equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A third-order operator with periodic coefficients is an L-operator in the Lax pair for the Boussinesq equation on a circle. The projection of the divisor of the Floquet solution poles for this operator coincides with the spectrum of the three-point Dirichlet problem. The sign of the norming constant of the three-point problem determines the sheet of the Riemann surface on which the pole lies. We solve the inverse problem for a third-order operator with three-point Dirichlet conditions when the spectrum and norming constant are known. We construct a mapping from the set of coefficients to the set of spectral data and prove that this mapping is an analytic bijection in the neighborhood of zero.</description>

      <title>Classical elliptic ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model: relation to Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat and 1-site classical XYZ model with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a description of the classical elliptic ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model with 8 independent coupling constants through a pair of ${\rm BC}_1$ type classical Sklyanin algebras generated by the (classical) quadratic reflection equation with non-dynamical XYZ $r$-matrix. For this purpose, we consider the classical version of the $L$-operator for the Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model proposed by O. Chalykh. In ${\rm BC}_1$ case it is factorized to the product of two Lax matrices depending on 4 constants. Then we apply an IRF-Vertex type gauge transformation and obtain a product of the Lax matrices for the Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostats. Each of them is described by the ${\rm BC}_1$ version of the classical Sklyanin algebra. In particular case, when 4 pairs of constants coincide, the ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model exactly coincides with the relativistic Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat. Explicit change of variables is obtained. We also consider another special case of the ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model with 7 independent constants. We show that it can be reproduced by considering the transfer matrix of the classical 1-site XYZ chain with boundaries. In the end of the paper, using another gauge transformation we represent the Chalykh's Lax matrix in a form depending on the Sklyanin's generators.</description>

      <title>A PDE approach for the invariant measure of stochastic oscillators with hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a PDE approach as an alternative to Monte Carlo simulations for computing the invariant measure of a white-noise-driven bilinear oscillator with hysteresis. This model is widely used in engineering to represent highly nonlinear dynamics, such as the Bauschinger effect. The study extends the stochastic elasto-plastic framework of Bensoussan et al. [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 47 (2009), pp. 3374--3396] from the two-dimensional elasto-perfectly-plastic oscillator to the three-dimensional bilinear elasto-plastic oscillator. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov function, the existence of an invariant measure is established. This extension thus enables the modelling of richer hysteretic behavior and broadens the scope of PDE alternatives to Monte Carlo methods. Two applications demonstrate the method's efficiency: calculating the oscillator's threshold crossing frequency (providing an alternative to Rice's formula) and probability of serviceability.</description>

      <title>Diffraction by a Right-Angle Penetrable Wedge: Closed-Form Solution for General Refractive Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional time-harmonic transmission problem for an impedance-matched ($\rho=1$) right-angle penetrable wedge at general refractive index ratio $\nu&gt;1$. Starting from Sommerfeld spectral representations, the transmission conditions on the two wedge faces yield a closed spectral functional system whose unknowns live on the Snell surface $\Sigma_\nu: Y^2=\nu^2 t^4+2(\nu^2-2)t^2+\nu^2$. We uniformize $\Sigma_\nu$ by Jacobi/Weierstrass elliptic functions on a torus $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ and solve the resulting $2\times 2$ genus-one Riemann--Hilbert problem in closed form for general finite forcing data. The Sommerfeld radiation condition and the Meixner edge condition are enforced by a simple residue-sum constraint. The construction extends the special lemniscatic case $\nu^2=2$ treated in arXiv:2601.04183 and yields a practical evaluation recipe expressed in theta/sigma products and explicit triangular factor matrices. We include the complete Sommerfeld representation connecting the spectral solution to the physical field, explicit forcing data for plane wave incidence, and a worked symbolic example at $\nu=3/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce novel integrable stochastic processes associated with the $D_2$ quantum group, which can be decomposed into two XXX spin chains (or two symmetric simple exclusion processes). We establish the integrability of the model under three types of boundary conditions (periodic, twisted, and open boundaries), and present its exact solution, including the spectrum, eigenstates, and some observables.</description>

      <title>Finslerian geometrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a unified framework of geometrodynamics based on the Finsler geometry to reveal the relationship between spacetime and dynamics.The Lagrangian of electron in electromagnetic field as the Finsler function gives the Finslerian metric, which modifies spacetime metric in the Finsler-Randers space. The geodesic equation gives the effective mass, forces, and effective (or geometric) fields. Using the Chern connection, we construct the generalized Einstein-Maxwell equations. In the local natural basis, we give generalized Maxwell equations and wave equations. We find that the geometric field couples with electromagnetic field and gives effective charges and currents. We analyze several typical cases, such as flat spacetime, vacuum and Berwald structure. We find that the electromagnetic field vanishes, but there still exists the magnetic potential in the Berwald space. These results provide some hints to understand some puzzles, such as axion and dark energy. These formulations stimulate some clues to explore deeper geometric structures behind physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>A proposal for the algebra of a novel noncommutative spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum structure of spacetime at fundamental scales via a novel, Lorentz-invariant noncommutative coordinate framework. Building on insights from noncommutative geometry, spectral theory, and algebraic quantum field theory, we systematically construct a quantum spacetime algebra whose geometric and causal properties are derived from first principles. Using the Weyl algebra formalism and the Gelfand--Naimark--Segal (GNS) construction, we rigorously define operator-valued coordinates that respect Lorentz symmetry and encode quantum gravitational effects through nontrivial commutation relations. We show how the emergent quantum spacetime exhibits minimal length effects, which deliver both classical Minkowski distances and quantum corrections proportional to the Planck length squared. Furthermore, we establish that noncommutativity respects a fuzzy form of causality, where the quantum causal structure gives back the light cone in the classical limit, vanishing for spacelike separations and encoding a time orientation for timelike intervals.</description>

      <title>On the weak coupling limit of the periodic quantum Lorentz gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report partial progress on the weak coupling limit behavior of observables for the periodic quantum Lorentz gas. Our results indicate that for certain observables, the limit behavior is trivial and can be described via a transport equation, while for other observables, the existence of the limit hinges on the regularity properties at resonant momenta of a certain Bloch-Wigner transform. We are currently unable to prove or disprove this regularity property, and so the weak coupling limit for these observables remains an open question. A novelty of this work is the use of the sewing lemma in the derivation of the kinetic scaling limit for almost every mometum.</description>

      <title>Even Odd Splitting of the Gaussian Quantum Fisher Information: From Symplectic Geometry to Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a canonical decomposition of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for centered multimode Gaussian states into two additive pieces: an even part that captures changes in the symplectic spectrum and an odd part associated with correlation-generating dynamics. On the pure-state manifold, the even contribution vanishes identically, while the odd contribution coincides with the QFI derived from the natural metric on the Siegel upper half-space, revealing a direct geometric underpinning of pure-Gaussian metrology. This also provides a link between the graphical representation of pure Gaussian states and an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of graphical parameters. For evolutions completely generated by passive Gaussian unitaries (orthogonal symplectics), the odd QFI vanishes, while thermometric parameters contribute purely to the even sector with a simple spectral form; we also derive a state-dependent lower bound on the even QFI in terms of the purity-change rate. We extend the construction to the full QFI matrix, obtaining an additive even odd sector decomposition that clarifies when cross-parameter information vanishes. Applications to unitary sensing (beam splitter versus two-mode squeezing) and to Gaussian channels (loss and phase-insensitive amplification), including joint phase loss estimation, demonstrate how the decomposition cleanly separates resources associated with spectrum versus correlations. The framework supplies practical design rules for continuous-variable sensors and provides a geometric lens for benchmarking probes and channels in Gaussian quantum metrology.</description>

However, the corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows have remained open, due to the coordinate singularity at the origin and the strong degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the vacuum free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. We prove that, for a general class of spherically symmetric initial density: $\rho_0^{\beta}\in H^3$ with $\beta\in (\frac{1}{3},\gamma-1]$ ($\gamma$: adiabatic exponent) vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, no vacuum forms inside the fluid in finite time, and we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. Particularly, when $\beta=\gamma-1$, the initial density contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $\gamma\ge 2$. Our analysis is mainly based on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, thereby obtaining flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; while, near the boundary, we construct $\rho_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which differ fundamentally from the classical BD entropy estimates and yield novel flow-map-weighted estimates for both the fluid and the effective velocities. These estimates enable us to obtain the uniform upper bound for the density and show that no cavitation occurs inside the fluid. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear equations involving similar difficulties.</description>

      <title>A Lindblad and Non-Hermitian Spectral Framework for Fragmentation Dynamics and Particle Size Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population balance equations (PBEs) for pure fragmentation describe how particle size distributions (PSDs) evolve under breakage and fragment redistribution. We map a self-similar fragmentation class to: a conservative pure-jump master equation in log-size space; an exact Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) dilation whose diagonal sector reproduces that master equation; and a controlled small-jump limit where the dynamics reduce to a Fokker-Planck operator that can be symmetrized into a Schrodinger-type spectral problem.
  Two points ensure correctness and applicability. First, the Lindblad embedding is exact when the daughter kernel is interpreted in mass-weighted form (equivalently, when z*kappa(z) is a probability measure). Second, for genuinely non-Hermitian dynamics the stationary PSD is naturally a biorthogonal product of left and right ground states, not a naive modulus square; the usual modulus squared of psi appears only in pseudo-Hermitian or effectively dephased regimes.
  We then give a spectral dictionary linking typical PSD shapes to low-dimensional potential families in log-size space and outline inverse routes to infer effective potentials from data: parametric fitting with time-resolved PSDs, a direct steady-state inversion from a smoothed PSD, and an outlook toward inverse spectral ideas. A synthetic example demonstrates forward simulation and inverse parameter recovery in an Airy-type half-line model.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian qLDPC: TQFT Formalism, Addressable Gauging Measurement and Application to Magic State Fountain on 2D Product Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes is the tradeoff between connectivity and universality. It is widely believed that in order to perform native logical non-Clifford gates, one needs to resort to 3D product-code constructions. In this work, we extend Kitaev's framework of non-Abelian topological codes on manifolds to non-Abelian qLDPC codes (realized as Clifford-stabilizer codes) and the corresponding combinatorial topological quantum field theories (TQFT) defined on Poincar\'e CW complexes and certain types of general chain complexes. We also construct the spacetime path integrals as topological invariants on these complexes. Remarkably, we show that native non-Clifford logical gates can be realized using constant-rate 2D hypergraph-product codes and their Clifford-stabilizer variants. This is achieved by a spacetime path integral effectively implementing the addressable gauging measurement of a new type of 0-form subcomplex symmetries, which correspond to addressable transversal Clifford gates and become higher-form symmetries when lifted to higher-dimensional CW complexes or manifolds. Building on this structure, we apply the gauging protocol to the magic state fountain scheme for parallel preparation of $O(\sqrt{n})$ disjoint CZ magic states with code distance of $O(\sqrt{n})$, using a total number of $n$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Introduction of Probability Density Alternation Method for Inverse Analyses of Integral Equations in Surface Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integral equations frequently arise in surface science, and in some cases, they must be treated as inverse problems. In our previous work on optical tweezers, atomic force microscopy, and surface force measurement apparatus, we performed inverse calculations to obtain the pressure between parallel plates from measured interaction forces. These inverse analyses were used to reconstruct solvation structures near solid surfaces and density distribution profiles of colloidal particles. In the course of these studies, we developed a method that enables inverse analyses through a unified and systematic procedure, hereafter referred to as the Probability Density Alternation (PDA) method. The central idea of this method is to reformulate a given integral equation in terms of probability density functions. In this letter, we demonstrate the validity of the PDA method both analytically and numerically. While the PDA method is less advantageous for single integral equations, it becomes a convenient and powerful approach for inverse analyses involving double or higher-order integral equations.</description>

      <title>WFR-FM: Simulation-Free Dynamic Unbalanced Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) metric extends dynamic optimal transport (OT) by coupling displacement with change of mass, providing a principled geometry for modeling unbalanced snapshot dynamics. Existing WFR solvers, however, are often unstable, computationally expensive, and difficult to scale. Here we introduce WFR Flow Matching (WFR-FM), a simulation-free training algorithm that unifies flow matching with dynamic unbalanced OT. Unlike classical flow matching which regresses only a transport vector field, WFR-FM simultaneously regresses a vector field for displacement and a scalar growth rate function for birth-death dynamics, yielding continuous flows under the WFR geometry. Theoretically, we show that minimizing the WFR-FM loss exactly recovers WFR geodesics. Empirically, WFR-FM yields more accurate and robust trajectory inference in single-cell biology, reconstructing consistent dynamics with proliferation and apoptosis, estimating time-varying growth fields, and applying to generative dynamics under imbalanced data. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in efficiency, stability, and reconstruction accuracy. Overall, WFR-FM establishes a unified and efficient paradigm for learning dynamical systems from unbalanced snapshots, where not only states but also mass evolve over time.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to Unitary Hamiltonians in Non-Unitary String-Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>Hidden free energy released by explicit parity-time-symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the familiar two-stream instability is the result of spontaneous parity-time (PT)-symmetry breaking in a conservative system, and more importantly, explicit PT-symmetry breaking by viscosity can destabilize the system in certain parameter regimes that are stable when viscosity vanishes. This reveals that complex systems may possess hidden free energies protected by PT-symmetry and viscosity, albeit dissipative, can expose the systems to these freed energies by breaking PT-symmetry explicitly. Such a process is accompanied by instability and total variation growth.</description>

      <title>The past stability of Kasner singularities for the $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein vacuum spacetime under polarized $U(1)$-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new proof to a past stability result established in Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck (arXiv:2012.05888), for Kasner solutions of the $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein vacuum equations under polarized $U(1)$-symmetry. Our method, inspired by Beyer-Oliynyk-Olvera-Santamar{\'\i}a-Zheng (arXiv:1907.04071, arXiv:2502.09210), relies on a newly developed $(2+1)$ orthonormal-frame decomposition and a careful symmetrization argument, after which the Fuchsian techniques can be applied.
  We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete and crushing at the Big Bang singularity. They are achieved by reducing the $(3+1)$ Einstein vacuum equations to a Fuchsian system coupled with several constraint equations, with the symmetry assumption playing an important role in the reduction. Using Fuchsian theory together with finite speed of constraints propagation, we obtain global existence and precise asymptotics of the solutions up to the singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum system is one of the most promising applications for quantum algorithms. Here we propose a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) \emph{Ansatz} for finding ground state configuration interaction (CI) wavefunctions. We map CI for fermions to a quantum circuit using a subspace superposition, then apply diagonal Walsh operators to encode the wavefunction. The algorithm can be used to solve both full CI and selected CI wavefunctions, resuling in exact and near-exact solutions for electronic ground states. Both the subspace selection and wavefunction \emph{Ansatz} can be applied to any Hamiltonian that can be written in a qubit basis. The algorithm bypasses costly classical matrix diagonalizations, which is advantageous for large-scale applications. We demonstrate results for several molecules using quantum simulators and hardware.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces Lie groups in degenerate geometric (Clifford) algebras that preserve four fundamental subspaces determined by the grade involution and reversion under the adjoint and twisted adjoint representations. We prove that these Lie groups can be equivalently defined using norm functions of multivectors applied in the theory of spin groups. We also study the corresponding Lie algebras. Some of these Lie groups and algebras are closely related to Heisenberg Lie groups and algebras. The introduced groups are interesting for various applications in physics and computer science, in particular, for constructing equivariant neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an Aganagic-Vafa brane supported on a special Lagrangian submanifold $\mathcal{L}$ in a non-compact toric Calabi-Yau threefold $\mathcal{X}$. From the perspective of geometric engineering, the Aganagic-Vafa branes give rise to a special class of half-BPS codimension-two defects in 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric field theories in the presence of $\Omega$-background. We propose that the defect partition functions give generating functions of refined, non-negative, integral open BPS invariants of the pair $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{L})$, across different K\"{a}hler moduli chambers they are expanded in. In the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, the partition function provides a partially resummed solution to a $q$-difference equation that quantizes the mirror curve of $\mathcal{X}$ in an unambiguous fashion, in a polarization determined by the discrete labels of the Aganagic-Vafa brane. We demonstrate our method at examples of $\mathbb{C}^3$, resolved conifold, resolved $A_1$-singularity, local $F_0$, and local $F_1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present analytical solutions of Schr\"odinger equation for Coulomb potential in presence of a Dunkl reflection operator. Expressions are offered for eigenvalues, eigenfunctions and radial densities for H-isoelectronic series (Z=1-3). The degeneracy in energy in absence and presence of the reflection has been discussed. The standard deviation, Shannon entropy, R\'enyi entropy in position space have been derived for arbitrary quantum states. Then several important complexity measures like L\'opez-Ruiz-Mancini-Calbet (LMC), Shape-R\'enyi complexity (SRC), Generalized R\'enyi complexity (GRC), R\'enyi complexity ratio (RCR) are considered in the analytical framework. Representative results are given for three one-electron atomic ions in tabular and graphical format. Changes in these measures with respect to parity and Dunkl parameter have been given in detail. Most of these results are offered here for the first time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research presents a novel approach in quantum computing by transforming ARM assembly instructions for use in quantum algorithms. The core achievement is the development of a method to directly map the ARM assembly language, a staple in classical computing, to quantum computing paradigms. The practical application of this methodology is demonstrated through the computation of the Fibonacci sequence. This example serves to validate the approach and underscores its potential in simplifying quantum algorithms. Grover's Algorithm was realized through the use of quantum-specific instructions. These transformations were developed as part of an open-source assembly-to-quantum compiler (github.com/arhaverly/AssemblyToQuantumCompiler). This effort introduces a novel approach to utilizing classical instruction sets in quantum computing and offers insight into potential future developments in the field. The AssemblyToQuantumCompiler streamlines quantum programming and enables computer scientists to transition more easily from classical to quantum computer programming.</description>

      <title>Geometric theory of constrained Schr\"odinger dynamics with application to time-dependent density-functional theory on a finite lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a central tool for studying the dynamical electronic structure of molecules and solids, yet aspects of its mathematical foundations remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the foundations of TDDFT within a finite-dimensional setting by developing a general geometric framework for Schr\"odinger dynamics subject to prescribed expectation values of selected observables. We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schr\"odinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator. Numerical illustrations for the Hubbard dimer demonstrate the behavior of these new approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new formulation of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) based on the geometric structure of the set of states constrained to have a fixed density. Orbital-free TDDFT is formulated using a hydrodynamics equation involving a new universal density-to-current functional map. In the corresponding Kohn--Sham equation, the density is reproduced using a non-local operator. Numerical simulations for one-dimensional soft-Coulomb systems are provided.</description>

      <title>Explicit complex time integrators for stiff problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most numerical methods for time integration use real-valued time steps. Complex time steps, however, can provide an additional degree of freedom, as we can select the magnitude of the time step in both the real and imaginary directions. We show that specific paths in the complex time plane lead to expanded stability regions, providing clear computational advantages for complex-valued systems. In particular, we highlight the Schr\"odinger equation, for which complex time integrators can be uniquely optimal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these benefits extend to certain classes of real-valued stiff systems by coupling complex time steps with the Projective Integration method.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-similar quasicrystals (like the famous Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings) are exceptional geometric structures in which long-range order, quasiperiodicity, non-crystallographic orientational symmetry, and discrete scale invariance are tightly interwoven in a beautiful way. In this paper, we show how such structures may be generalized from Euclidean space to Minkowski spacetime. We construct the first examples of such Lorentzian quasicrystals (the spacetime analogues of the Penrose or Ammann-Beenker tilings), and point out key novel features of these structures (compared to their Euclidean cousins). We end with some (speculative) ideas about how such spacetime quasicrystals might relate to reality. This includes an intriguing scenario in which our infinite $(3+1)$D universe is embedded (like one of our spacetime quasicrystal examples) in a particularly symmetric $(9+1)$D torus $T^{9,1}$ (which was previously found to yield the most symmetric toroidal compactification of the superstring). We suggest how this picture might help explain the mysterious seesaw relationship $M_{\rm Pl}M_{\rm vac}\approx M_{\rm EW}^{2}$ between the Planck, vacuum energy, and electroweak scales ($M_{\rm Pl}$, $M_{\rm vac}$, $M_{\rm EW}$).</description>

      <title>Serial vs parallel recall in the Blume-Every-Griffiths neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully connected Blume-Emery-Griffiths neural networks performing pattern recognition and associative memory have been heuristically studied in the past (mainly via the replica trick and under the replica symmetric assumption) as generalization of the standard Hopfield reference. In these notes, at first, by relying upon Guerra interpolation, we re-obtain the existing picture rigorously. Next we show that, due to dilution in the patterns, these networks are able to switch from serial recall (where one pattern is retrieved per time) to parallel recall (where several patterns are retrieved at once) and the larger the dilution, the stronger this emerging multi-tasking capability. In particular, we inspect the regimes of mild dilution (where solely a low storage of pattern can be enabled) and extreme dilution (where a medium storage of patterns can be sustained) separately as they give rise to different outcomes: the former displays hierarchical recall (distributing the amplitudes of the retrieved signals with different amplitudes), the latter -instead- performs a equal-strength recall (where a O(1) fraction of all the patterns is simultaneously retrieved with the same amplitude per pattern). Finally, in order to implement graded responses in the neurons, variations on theme obtained by enlarging the possible values of neural activity these neurons may sustain are also discussed generalizing the Ghatak-Sherrington model for inverse freezing in Hebbian terms.</description>

      <title>Double Categorical Approaches to AQFT I: Axiomatic Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In operator-algebraic AQFT one routinely moves back and forth between two kinds of structure: inclusions of local algebras coming from inclusions of regions, and bimodules/intertwiners that implement the standard $L^2$-based constructions used to compare and compose observables. The obstruction to making this interplay genuinely functorial is that there are two independent compositions (restriction along inclusions and fusion/transport along bimodules) and they must be compatible on commuting spacetime diagrams, which is exactly the situation a double category is designed to encode. Part I resolves this by building a spacetime double category and a von Neumann algebra double category inspired by previous work by Orendain, and by packaging an AQFT input as a pseudo double functor whose vertical part is the Haag-Kastler net and whose squares record the required compatibilities in a well-typed way forced by commutativity. We formulate the Haag-Kastler axioms in this setup, establish the coherence needed for the construction, and work out representative examples.</description>

      <title>The FBSDE approach to sine-Gordon up to $6\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic analysis of the sine-Gordon Euclidean quantum field $(\cos (\beta \varphi))_2$ on the full space up to the second threshold, i.e. for $\beta^2 &lt; 6 \pi$. The basis of our method is a forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) for a decomposition $(X_t)_{t \geqslant 0}$ of the interacting Euclidean field $X_{\infty}$ along a scale parameter $t \geqslant 0$. This FBSDE describes the optimiser of the stochastic control representation of the Euclidean QFT introduced by Barashkov and one of the authors. We show that the FBSDE provides a description of the interacting field without cut-offs and that it can be used effectively to study the sine-Gordon measure to obtain results about large deviations, integrability, decay of correlations for local observables, singularity with respect to the free field, Osterwalder-Schrader axioms and other properties.</description>

      <title>Parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation: p-racks, solutions &amp; quantum algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of the parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is established from a purely algebraic point of view. The first step towards this objective is the introduction of certain generalizations of the familiar shelves and racks called parametric (p)-shelves and racks. These objects satisfy a parametric self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Novel, non-reversible solutions are obtained from p-shelf/rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all reversible set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the identity map via a parametric twist. The universal algebras associated to both p-rack and generic parametric, set-theoretic solutions are next presented and the corresponding universal R-matrices are derived. The admissible universal Drinfel'd twist is constructed allowing the derivation of the general set-theoretic universal R-matrix. By introducing the concept of a parametric coproduct we prove the existence of a parametric co-associativity. We show that the parametric coproduct is an algebra homomorphism and the universal R-matrices satisfy intertwining relations with the algebra coproducts</description>

Abstract: We revisit the well known Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule (BS) of order 2 for a self-adjoint 1-D h-Pseudo-differential operator within the algebraic and microlocal framework of Helffer and Sjoestrand; BS holds precisely when Gram matrix consisting of scalar products of some WKB solutions with respect to the ``flux norm'' (or microlocal Wronskian) is not invertible. We simplify somewhat our previous proof [A. Ifa H. Louati and M. Rouleux. Bohr-Sommerfeld Quantization Rules Revisited: the Method of Positive Commutators. J. Math. Sci. Univ. Tokyo, 25(2):2018] by working in spatial representation only, as in complex WKB theory for Schroedinger operator. We consider also the scattering problem.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Various Regimes of Non-Hermiticity and a Holographic Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variance of the number of particles in a set is an important quantity in understanding the statistics of non-interacting fermionic systems in low dimensions. An exact map of their ground state in a harmonic trap in one and two dimensions to the classical Gaussian unitary and complex Ginibre ensemble, respectively, allows to determine the counting statistics at finite and infinite system size. We will establish two new results in this setup. First, we uncover an interpolating central limit theorem between known results in one and two dimensions, for linear statistics of the elliptic Ginibre ensemble. We find an entire range of interpolating weak non-Hermiticity limits, given by a two-parameter family for the mesoscopic scaling regime. Second, we considerably generalize the proportionality between the number variance and the entanglement entropy between Fermions in a set $A$ and its complement in two dimensions. Previously known only for rotationally invariant sets and external potentials, we prove a holographic principle for general non-rotationally invariant sets and random normal matrices. It states that both number variance and entanglement entropy are proportional to the circumference of $A$.</description>

Abstract: We show that heat defines a gauge connection on a line bundle over work configurations. Vanishing curvature is equivalent to the local existence of entropy and temperature functions such that heat can be expressed as $TdS$. A conjecture of Jauch, that entropy and temperature arise from a conservation law, is shown to follow as a special case. Global equilibrium may nevertheless fail in the presence of a thermal analogue of geometric phase.</description>

Abstract: We study the propagation of energy in one-dimensional anharmonic chains subject to a periodic, localized forcing. For the purely harmonic case, forcing frequencies outside the linear spectrum produce exponentially localized responses, preventing equi-distribution of energy per degree of freedom. We extend this result to anharmonic perturbations with bounded second derivatives and boundary dissipation, proving that for small perturbations and non-resonant forcing, the dynamics converges to a periodic stationary state with energy exponentially localized uniformly in the system size. The perturbed periodic state is described by a convergent power type expansion in the strength of the anharmonicity. This excludes chaoticity induced by anharmonicity, independently of the size of the system. Our perturbative scheme can also be applied in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be some smooth, closed, compact Riemannian manifold and $(M_N\mapsto M)_N$ be an increasing sequence of large degree cyclic covers of $M$ that converges when $N\rightarrow +\infty$, in a suitable sense, to some limit $\mathbb{Z}^p$ cover $M_\infty$ over $M$. Motivated by recent works on zeta determinants on random surfaces and some natural questions in Euclidean quantum field theory, we show the convergence of the sequence $ \frac{\log\det_\zeta(\Delta_{N})}{\text{Vol}(M_N)} $ when $N\rightarrow +\infty$ where $\Delta_N$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M_N$. We also generalize our results to the case of twisted Laplacians coming from certain flat unitary vector bundles over $M$.</description>

      <title>Unitary equivalence in Generalized Uncertainty Principle theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the issue of unitary equivalence within Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) theories in the one-dimensional case. For a deformed Heisenberg algebra, its representation in terms of Hilbert space and conjugate operators is not uniquely determined, raising the question of whether different realizations of the same algebra are equivalent and describe the same physics. After proposing a definition of a quantum GUP theory, we establish conditions for unitary equivalence. Using this framework, we rigorously prove that two commonly used representations are unitarily equivalent, specifying the conditions under which this equivalence holds. We demonstrate this equivalence explicitly by providing a unitary map and showing how both GUP formulations yield the same physical results in two examples: the quantum harmonic oscillator and a free-falling particle. Finally, we discuss a case in which equivalence fails, suggesting that a generalization of the Stone-von Neumann theorem may not be possible within the GUP framework under our definition of unitary equivalence.</description>

      <title>Granger Causality Maps for Langevin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wahl et al. (2016, 2017) introduced the idea of Granger causality (GC) maps for Langevin systems: dynamics are localised linearly at each point in phase space as vector Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (VOU) processes, for which GCs may in principle be calculated, thus constructing a GC map on phase space. Their implementation, however, suffered a significant drawback: GCs were approximated from models based on discrete-time stroboscopic sampling of local VOU processes, which is not only computationally inefficient, but more seriously, unfeasible on regions of phase space where local dynamics are unstable, leaving "holes" in the GC maps. We solve these problems by deriving an analytical expression for GC rates associated with a VOU process which, under quite general conditions, yields a meaningful solution even in the unstable case. Applied to GC maps, this not only "fills in the holes", but also furnishes a computationally efficient method of calculation devolving to solution of continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations which, in the case of a univariate source, become simple quadratic equations. We show, furthermore, that the GC rate for VOU processes is invariant under rescaling of the overall fluctuations intensity, so that GC maps may effectively be calculated for deterministic nonlinear dynamical systems, with a residual "ghost of noise" represented by a variance-covariance map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotic completeness of Rayleigh scattering in models of atoms and molecules of non-relativistic QED is expected, but for a proof we still lack sufficient control on the number of emitted soft photons. So far, this obstacle has only been overcome for the spin-boson model. In a general class of models asymptotic completeness holds provided the expectation value of the photon number $N$ remains bounded uniformly in time. This has been established by Faupin and Sigal. We review and simplify their work, and, more importantly, we replace the bound on $N$ by a weaker assumption on the distribution of $N$ that is both necessary and sufficient for asymptotic completeness.</description>

      <title>Field Theory Equivalences as Spans of $L_\infty$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-classically equivalent field theories are related by a quasi-isomorphism between their underlying $L_\infty$-algebras, but such a quasi-isomorphism is not necessarily a homotopy transfer. We demonstrate that all quasi-isomorphisms can be lifted to spans of $L_\infty$-algebras in which the quasi-isomorphic $L_\infty$-algebras are obtained from a correspondence $L_\infty$-algebra by a homotopy transfer. Our construction is very useful: homotopy transfer is computationally tractable, and physically, it amounts to integrating out fields in a Feynman diagram expansion. Spans of $L_\infty$-algebras allow for a clean definition of quasi-isomorphisms of cyclic $L_\infty$-algebras. Furthermore, they appear naturally in many contexts within physics. As examples, we first consider scalar field theory with interaction vertices blown up in different ways. We then show that (non-Abelian) T-duality can be seen as a span of $L_\infty$-algebras, and we provide full details in the case of the principal chiral model. We also present the relevant span of $L_\infty$-algebras for the Penrose-Ward transform in the context of self-dual Yang-Mills theory and Bogomolny monopoles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02473v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum states can be written in infinitely many ways depending on the choices of basis. Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state has a lot of properties useful in the study of entanglement. All bipartite states admit Schmidt decomposition, but this does not extend to multipartite systems. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Schmidt decompositions of multipartite states. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the decomposition for a Schmidt decomposable multipartite state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Potts spin glass with additional ferromagnetic interaction parametrized by $t$. It has long been observed that the Potts color symmetry breaking for the spin glass order parameter is closely related to the ferromagnetic phase transition. To clarify this, we identify a single critical value $t_\mathrm{c}$, which marks the onset of both color symmetry breaking and the transition to ferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Maximality of the futures of points in globally hyperbolic maximal conformally flat spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let M be a globally hyperbolic conformally spacetime. We prove that the indecomposable past/future sets (abbrev. IPs/IFs) -in the sense of Penrose, Kronheimer and Geroch -of the universal cover of M are domains of injectivity of the developing map. This relies on the central observation that diamonds are domains of injectivity of the developing map. Using this, we provide a new proof of a result of completeness by C. Rossi, which notably simplifies the original arguments. Furthermore, we establish that if, in addition, M is maximal, the IPs/IFs are maximal as globally hyperbolic conformally flat spacetimes. More precisely, we show that they are conformally equivalent to regular domains of Minkowski spacetime as defined by F. Bonsante.</description>

      <title>Conformable Scaling and Critical Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>GSO Defects: IIA/IIB Walls and the Surprisingly Stable $\mathrm{R}7$-Brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed Swampland Cobordism Conjecture predicts the existence of new non-supersymmetric objects which supplement the spectrum of low-energy gravitational effective field theories. In this paper, we study a subset of these defects related to the GSO projection on the string worldsheet. These include the predicted domain wall between Type IIA and IIB superstring theories and the newly-discovered $\mathrm{R}7$-brane. We study these defects in two different ways: via long-string probes and target-space effective field theory. We find that the $\mathrm{R}7$-brane can be identified with a collapsed cylindrical configuration of the IIA/IIB wall, and further, that the $\mathrm{R}7$-brane is stable, in contrast to previous expectations. Moreover, we argue that BPS D-branes pulled across the IIA/IIB wall become non-BPS D-branes, which we identify with fluxbrane configurations. We show that the non-BPS D-branes of either Type II theory are charged under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ remnant of the Ramond-Ramond potentials of the other, which we identify with the mod 2 reduction of the Ramond-Ramond fluxes. Similar considerations provide a complementary perspective on the Heterotic ${\mathfrak{so}(32)}$ S-duals of known non-BPS 7- and 8-branes in Type I string theory.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Controlled Freezing and Revival of Bell Nonlocality through Environmental Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the distance between two qubits coupled to a structured reservoir acts as a single geometric control that can store, revive, or suppress Bell nonlocality. In a mirror-terminated guide, quantum correlations lost to the bath return at discrete recurrence times, turning a product state into a Bell-violating one without any entangling drive (only local basis rotations/readout). In the continuum limit, we derive closed-form criteria for the emergence of nonlocality from backflow, and introduce a Bell-based analogue of the BLP measure to quantify this effect. We also show how subwavelength displacements away from a decoherence-free node quadratically reduce the lifetime of a dark state or bright state, enabling highly sensitive interferometric detection. All results rely on analytically solvable models and are compatible with current superconducting and nanophotonic platforms, offering a practical route to passive, geometry-controlled non-Markovian devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a contour integral formalism for computing the K-theoretic equivariant 3-vertex. Within the Jeffrey--Kirwan (JK) residue framework, we show that, by an appropriate choice of the reference vector, both the equivariant Donaldson--Thomas (DT) and Pandharipande--Thomas (PT) 3-vertices can be extracted from the same integrand. We analyze three distinct limits of the PT 3-vertex, recovering the unrefined topological vertex, the refined topological vertex, and the Macdonald refined topological vertex. Higher-rank extensions of PT counting and the DT/PT correspondence are also explored. From a quantum algebraic perspective, we construct an operator version of the equivariant PT 3-vertex and term it the Pandharipande--Thomas $qq$-character. We then discuss its connection with the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</description>

      <title>Average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The onset of quantum ergodicity is often quantified by the average ratio of consecutive level spacings. The reference values for ergodic quantum systems have been obtained numerically from the spectra of large but finite-dimensional random matrices. This work introduces a weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings, having the propery that the average can be computed numerically for random matrices of infinite dimension. A Painlev\'e differential equation is solved numerically in order to determine this average for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices, thereby providing a reference value for ergodic quantum systems obeying time-reversal symmetry (provided that the time-reversal operator squares to the identity matrix). A Wigner surmise-inspired analytical calculation is found to yield a qualitatively accurate picture for the statistics of high-dimensional random matrices from each of the symmetry classes. For Poissonian level statistics, a significantly different average is found, indicating that the average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings can be used as a probe for quantum ergodicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the large $N$ limit of spectral duality between rational Gaudin models introduced by Adams, Harnad and Hurtubise. The limit of the ${\rm gl}_N$ model is performed by means of a noncommutative torus algebra represented by the fields on a torus with the Moyal-Weyl star product. We apply the approach developed by Hoppe, Olshanetsky and Theisen to the Gaudin-type models and describe the corresponding integrable field theory (2d hydrodynamics) on a torus. The dual model is the large $N$ limit of the ${\rm gl}_M$ Gaudin model with $N$ marked points written in the form of the Gaudin model with irregular singularities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Filtering at Finite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pose and solve the problem of quantum filtering based on continuous-in-time quadrature measurements (homodyning) for the case where the quantum process is in a thermal state. The standard construction of quantum filters involves the determination of the conditional expectation onto the von Neumann algebra generated by the measured observables with the non-demolition principle telling us to restrict the domain (the observables to be estimated) to the commutant of the algebra. The finite-temperature case, however, has additional structure: we use the Araki-Woods representation for the measured quadratures, but the Tomita-Takesaki theory tells us that there exists a separate, commuting representation and therefore the commutant will have a richer structure than encountered in the Fock vacuum case. We apply this to the question of quantum trajectories to the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model. Here, the two representations are interpreted as the fields in the right and left Rindler wedges.</description>

      <title>Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</description>

      <title>A Universal Chern Model on Arbitrary Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a triangulation of a closed orientable surface, we place single-mode resonators or single-orbital artificial atoms at its vertices, edges and facets, and we devise near-neighbor hopping terms derived from the boundary and Poincar\'e duality maps of the simplicial complex of the triangulation. Regardless of the surface or its triangulation, these terms always lead to tight-binding Hamiltonians with large and clean topological spectral gaps, carrying non-trivial Chern numbers in the limit of infinite refinement of the triangulation. We confirm this via numerical simulations, and demonstrate how these models enable topological edge modes at the surfaces of real-world objects. Furthermore, we describe a metamaterial whose dynamics reproduces that of the proposed model, thus bringing the topological metamaterials closer to real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized in an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares W_n using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local block-XY mixer that preserves the one-hot manifold and has a constant spectral gap on the one-excitation sector. At the level of expressivity, we establish per-block controllability, implying approximate universality per block. At the level of distributional behavior, we show that, after natural block and symbol permutation twirls, shallow CE-QAOA realizes an encoded unitary 1-design and supports approximate second-moment (2-design) behavior; combined with a Paley-Zygmund argument, this yields finite-shot anticoncentration guarantees.
  Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic feasibility checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is a polynomial shot budget. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r &gt;= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) minimax separation. In noiseless circuit simulations of traveling salesman problem instances with n in {4,...,10} locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem size.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Approach to the Definition of the Path Integral Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We to define a Path Integral in Lorentzian time by restricting the relevant domain of integration on $C([0,1],M)$ over a Riemannian configuration manifold $(M,g)$ and considering the dynamics of a particle evolving between to fixed endpoints with a referential non-degenerate classical trajectory, formulating a framework around a quadratic Lagrangian. Through fibration, we reduce the infinite-dimensional space under consideration to an $L^2$-isometric flux spaces in which we consider a stochastic process associated to a Gaussian measure. The Path Integral is subsequently defined as an expectation value with respect to the Gaussian measure, allowing us to rigorously formulate the former as a functional integral. We prove mathematical correspondence between the Stochastic Path Integral and the Euclidean Path Integral theory formulated rigorously under the Feynman-Kac theorem.</description>

      <title>From Device to Dynamics: An Iterative Architectural Framework for High-Performance Single-Photon Detection at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01328v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon detection is a cornerstone of quantum technology, traditionally regarded as a static device-level operation constrained by the intrinsic physical properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). Consequently, high-performance detection has been heavily reliant on superconducting technologies, whose requirement for cryogenic temperatures imposes significant infrastructure burdens and limits scalable deployment. To circumvent these constraints, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detection (ESPD) framework, which shifts the photon-detection paradigm from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing (QIP) task. By incorporating state preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy decision analysis, we establish a nonlinear dynamical model that reformulates detection as an iteratively enhanced process. This architecture enables systematic performance upgrades through structural design rather than material modification, allowing high-performance detection with exclusively room-temperature hardware. Through analytical approximations, Monte Carlo analysis, and numerical simulations, we show that the ESPD dynamics converge to a high-performance basin of attraction even when initialized by low-performance SPDs. While physical realization requires further component integration efforts, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for enhancing detection via architectural QIP principles. It provides not only a blueprint for next-generation room-temperature photon detection but also a general methodology for transcending device-level constraints in broader quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Hartwig asymptotics for non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the two-dimensional analogue of the asymptotics for Toeplitz determinants with Fisher-Hartwig singularities, for general real symbols. This formula has applications to random normal matrices with complex spectra: (i) the characteristic polynomial converges to a Gaussian multiplicative chaos random measure on the limiting droplet, in the subcritical phase; (ii) the electric potential converges pointwise to a logarithmically correlated field; (iii) the measure of its level sets (i.e. thick points) is identified; (iv) the associated free energy undergoes a freezing transition.
  This establishes emergence of the Liouville quantum gravity measure from free fermions in 2d, and universality with respect to the external potential.</description>

      <title>Finding Graph Isomorphisms in Heated Spaces in Almost No Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining whether two graphs are structurally identical is a fundamental problem with applications spanning mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and network science. Despite decades of study, graph isomorphism remains a challenging algorithmic task, particularly for highly symmetric structures. Here we introduce a new algorithmic approach based on ideas from spectral graph theory and geometry that constructs candidate correspondences between vertices using their curvatures. Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic. Although the method does not yet guarantee success on all isomorphic inputs, we find that it correctly resolves every instance tested in deterministic polynomial time, including a broad collection of graphs known to be difficult for classical spectral techniques. These results demonstrate that enriched spectral methods can be far more powerful than previously understood, and suggest a promising direction for the practical resolution of the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for Learning Quantum Channels in Diamond Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that learning an unknown quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ requires $ \Omega\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ channel queries when $d_A\leq rd_B/2$ or $d_A=rd_B$. This improves the best previous $\Omega(d_A d_B r)$ bound by introducing explicit $\varepsilon$-dependence. We show that this scaling is optimal, up to logarithmic farctors, when $d_A=rd_B$. The proof constructs an ensemble of channels that are well separated in diamond norm yet admit Stinespring isometries that are close in operator norm.</description>

      <title>Exact Multimode Quantization of Superconducting Circuits via Boundary Admittance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, which reduces a multiport electromagnetic environment to the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ at the Josephson junction, naturally leads to an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition determining the dressed mode spectrum. This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $\alpha$, and dispersive shift $\chi$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.</description>
