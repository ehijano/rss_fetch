      <title>Superradiant amplification by rotating viscous compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fluctuations of rotating viscous stars, using the causal relativistic hydrodynamics of Bemfica, Disconzi, Kovtun, and Noronha. We derive, in a slow-rotation approximation, a coupled system of equations describing the propagation of axial gravitational waves through the star, which couple to internal viscous modes. We show that rotating viscous stars amplify incoming low-frequency gravitational waves, a phenomenon which we argue to be universal. Superradiant amplification does not seem to trigger an instability for uniformly rotating stars, even if the object is compact enough to have light rings.</description>

      <title>Testing the Quantum Equivalence Principle with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study modifications of gravitational wave observables, such as the wave amplitude and frequency, which follow from the quantum equivalence principle, and are expressed in terms of the inertial, gravitational and rest masses of the LIGO/Virgo mirrors. We provide bounds on the violations of the quantum equivalence principle by comparing the results with the most resolved gravitational wave events observed by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. The formalism is equally applicable to other future ground and space-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Progress toward the detection of the gravitational-wave background from stellar-mass binary black holes: a mock data challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the third LIGO--Virgo gravitational-wave transient catalog includes 90 signals, it is believed that ${\cal O}(10^5)$ binary black holes merge somewhere in the Universe every year. Although these signals are too weak to be detected individually with current observatories, they combine to create a stochastic background, which is potentially detectable in the near future. LIGO--Virgo searches for the gravitational-wave background using cross-correlation have so far yielded upper limits. However, Smith \&amp; Thrane (2017) showed that a vastly more sensitive ``coherent'' search can be carried out by incorporating information about the phase evolution of binary black hole signals. This improved sensitivity comes at a cost; the coherent method is computationally expensive and requires a far more detailed understanding of systematic errors than is required for the cross-correlation search. In this work, we demonstrate the coherent approach with realistic data, paving the way for a gravitational-wave background search with unprecedented sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Leading-order gravitational time delay of massive particles by a moving Schwarzschild lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading-order gravitational time delay of relativistic neutral massive particles (e.g., neutrinos or high-energy cosmic-ray particles) caused by a moving Schwarzschild black hole with a constant radial velocity is investigated for the first time. On the basis of the equations of motion in the spacetime of the moving lens, we achieve a new unified formula for the travel times of relativistic massive and massless particles propagating from the source to the observer within the first post-Minkowskian approximation. The analytical form of the difference between the travel times of a relativistic massive particle and a light signal in this geometry, as well as that of two relativistic massive particles, is thus obtained in the weak-field and slow-motion limit. The influence of the radial lens motion on the leading-order Schwarzschild time delay of relativistic massive particles is then discussed. It is found that in the slow-motion limit, the radial lens motion towards the observer decreases the flight time of an ultrarelativistic massive particle, when compared with the case of no translational motion of the central body. Conversely, if the lens gets away from the detector radially under the same conditions, the propagation process of the particle will slow down and its flight time will thus increase in comparison with the Schwarzschild case. Finally, we analyze the magnitude of the full radial motion effect of the lens and evaluate the possibility of its astronomical detection by modeling three typical black holes as the lens respectively.</description>

      <title>Anomaly freedom in effective Loop Quantum Cosmology refined: extended functional dependence of the counter-terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instead of assuming that they depend only on the background variables, we investigate the hypothesis that counter-terms appearing in the deformed algebra approach to loop quantum cosmology depend on the full phase-space variables. We derive the associated anomalies and solve the entire system in several specific cases. New restrictions on the generalized holonomy corrections are obtained.</description>

      <title>On Geometrization of Classical Fields II (MES: dark matter, energy)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of arXiv:2502.01174 geometrization of classical fields in the 4d--Finsler space of MES (Model of Embedded Spaces) is continued. The model postulates a proper metric set of a distributed matter element and states that the space-time of the Universe is a physical Embedding of such sets. The Embedding geometry is a Finsler-like relativistic geometry with connectivity depending on the mechanical state of matter: torsion and non-metricity are absent. The Least Action Principle provides the geodesic motion of matter, leads to nonlinearity of the system of field equations, anisotropy and Weyl-invariance of gravitation MES. It is shown that in the special case of Embedding (conformal Weyl metric) the geometrization of fields can be realized completely: namely, to obtain Maxwell-type equations and to find the gravitational sources, lying behind the $\Lambda$ term of Einstein-type equation. They are identified as dark matter and energy of the Universe, and the estimates of their material-field composition are close to the observed ones. It is also shown that the Embedding's gravitational and electromagnetic potentials are mutual gauge fields. Further development of the MES implies going beyond the Weyl metric.</description>

Abstract: We show that for a Topological Star the renormalized angular momentum parameter, $\nu$, appearing in the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi-type or in the quantum-Seiberg-Witten-type approaches of the perturbation equations, has 1) a direct link with the geodesic radial action computed along the null orbits of the background and 2) admits an exact resummation in terms of hypergeometric functions, generalizing previous results valid in the Schwarzschild case, see Ref.[arXiv:2504.07862 [hep-th]].</description>

      <title>Perihelion precession of planetary orbits solved from quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the perihelion precession of planetary orbits using quantum field theory extending the Standard Model to include gravity. Modeling the gravitational bound state of an electron via the Dirac equation of unified gravity [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)], and taking the classical planetary state limit, we obtain orbital dynamics exhibiting a precession in agreement with general relativity. This demonstrates that key general relativistic effects in planetary motion can emerge directly from quantum field theory without invoking the geometric framework of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Clarifying the relation between covariantly conserved currents and Noether's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On one hand, proper conservation laws, that is, the existence of local functions of the fields whose divergence vanishes on-shell, are associated with global symmetries and are a consequence of Noether's first theorem. On the other hand, covariant conservation laws, i.e., the same type of laws but featuring a covariant divergence, are associated with local symmetries and are a consequence (under certain conditions) of Noether's second theorem. In this paper, we clarify under which conditions Noether's second theorem, which is mostly known for providing relations between the equations of motion of a theory that possesses some local symmetries, can be used to generate covariantly conservation laws. We also investigate the relation between the conserved current of a theory with global symmetry and the covariantly conserved current of the corresponding local symmetry. We treat these issues using only the tools of Calculus, in the fashion of Noether's original article, avoiding the somewhat complicated mathematical tools that plague much of the literature on this topic, thus making the article readable for the general physicist.</description>

      <title>The AdS Perspective on the Nonlinear Tails in Black Hole Ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes gradually settle into their static configuration by emitting gravitational waves, whose amplitude diminish over time according to a power-law decay at fixed spatial locations. We show that the nonlinear tails in the presence of a quadratic source, which have been recently found to potentially dominate over the linear ones, can be simply derived from the AdS$_2$$\times$S$^2$ spacetime perspective with their amplitudes being related to the Aretakis constants.</description>

      <title>Complete quasinormal modes of Type-D black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14635v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra of black holes exhibit two open problems [Conf. Proc. C 0405132, 145 (2004); CQG 26, 163001 (2009)]: (i) the discontinuity in highly damped QNMs between Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions as $a \to 0$, and (ii) the unexplained spectral proximity between QNMs and algebraically special (AS) frequencies, particularly the anomalous multiplet splitting for Kerr $\ell=2$, $m \geq 0$ modes. We develop a novel method to compute complete QNM spectra for Type-D black holes, solving both problems and establishing a mathematical framework for boundary value problems of dissipative systems. Using analytic continuation of radial eigenvalue equations, our method eliminates the dependence on auxiliary parameters in the connection formulas for confluent Heun solutions. This breakthrough overcomes the long-standing challenge of calculating QNMs that cross or lie on the negative imaginary axis (NIA). For Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes ($0 \leq \hat{n} \leq 41$, $2 \leq \ell \leq 16$), we present complete spectra validated through scattering amplitudes with errors $&lt;10^{-10}$. The results provide definitive solutions to both open problems: (i) The inability of conventional methods to compute QNMs crossing or residing on the NIA leads to apparent discontinuities in Kerr spectra as $a \to 0$. (ii) When a QNM exactly coincides with the AS frequency, an additional QNM (unconventional mode) appears nearby. For the Kerr case with $\ell=2$, overtone sequences from both unconventional and AS modes exhibit precisely $2\ell+1$ branches, without multiplets or supersymmetry breaking at AS frequencies. Our method confirms Leung's conjecture of high-$\ell$ unconventional mode deviations from the NIA through the first $\ell=3$ calculation. Moreover, this paradigm surpasses the state-of-the-art Cook's continued fraction and isomonodromic methods in computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic gravity theories emerge as the low-energy limit of many grand-unified and quantum-gravity theories. We report the first gravitational-wave ringdown constraints on such theories obtained purely from the quasinormal-mode spectra of rapidly-spinning black-hole remnants. We find no quadratic-gravity signatures from ringdown signals measured by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, thereby constraining the coupling length scale of axi-dilaton gravity below 34 km, dynamical Chern-Simons gravity below 49 km, and scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity below 47 km.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave background detection using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting the faint gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal from dominant detector noise and disentangling its %diverse astrophysical and cosmological components remain significant challenges for traditional methods like cross-correlation analysis. We propose a novel hybrid approach that combines deep learning with Bayesian inference to identify and characterize the GWB more rapidly than current techniques. Our method utilizes a custom-designed multi-scale multi-headed autoencoder (MSMHAutoencoder) architecture to separate GWB signals from detector noise, and subsequently Marcov Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation to disentangle the GWB components. Using simulated data representative of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network at design sensitivity, we show that our MSMHAutoencoder can detect with high confidence (log noise Bayes factor of 3) a GWB from binary black hole mergers with fractional energy density $\Omega_{\text{BBH}} \approx 10^{-9}$ at 25 Hz. In the presence of such an astrophysical GWB, we can simultaneously measure a cosmological component as faint as $\Omega_{\text{Cosmo}} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-10}$ using 47.4 days of training data.</description>

      <title>Gravity versus astrophysics in black hole images and photon rings: equatorial emissions and spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EHT collaboration released in 2019 the first horizon-scale images of a black hole accretion flow, opening a novel route for plasma physics comprehension and gravitational tests. Although the present unresolved images deeply depend on the astrophysical properties of the accreted matter, GR predicts that they contain highly lensed observables, the "photon rings", embodying the effects of strong-field gravity. Focusing on the supermassive black hole M87* and adopting a geometrically thin, equatorial disc as a phenomenological configuration for the accreting matter, our goal is to study the degeneracy of spacetime curvature and of physically-motivated emission processes on EHT-like images observed at 230 and 345 GHz. In a parametric framework, we simulate adaptively ray-traced images using GYOTO in various spherically-symmetric spacetime geometries, for a comprehensive class of disc velocities and realistic synchrotron emission profiles. We then extract the width and the peak position of 1D intensity cross sections on the direct image and the first photon ring. We show that, among the investigated quantities, the most appropriate observables to probe the geometry are the peak positions of the first photon ring. Small geometric deviations can be unequivocally detected, regardless of the motion of the disc, ranging from a Keplerian to a radially infalling one, if the black hole mass-to-distance estimate is accurate up to around 2%; the current uncertainty of 11% being sufficient just to access extreme deviations. The equatorial set-up of this paper, favoured by present EHT observations of M87*, is adapted to model future measurements at higher observing frequencies, where absorption effects are negligible, and with higher resolution, indispensable to resolve the photon rings. Additional work is needed to investigate if our conclusions hold for more realistic disc configurations.</description>

      <title>Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration from QCD Confinement Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a phenomenological extension of the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model by introducing a coupling between the Polyakov loop potential and the Hubble parameter $H(t)$, inspired by the hypothesis that the QCD vacuum, particularly in the confined phase, may be sensitive to the large-scale dynamics of the universe. The coupling term, proportional to $(H(t)/H_0)^d f(\Phi)$, vanishes in the deconfined regime and acts as a dynamical dark energy contribution at late times, without invoking a fundamental cosmological constant. This framework maintains the thermodynamic consistency of the PNJL model and introduces a minimal modification to the effective potential, controlled by a single exponent $d$. We confront the model with low-redshift cosmological data, including cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernovae, HII galaxies, and quasars. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo analysis, we derive constraints on the model parameters and compare its performance with LambdaCDM. Our results show that the modified PNJL cosmology provides a statistically competitive fit to current data within 68% C.L.; while offering a theoretically motivated alternative to standard dark energy scenarios. We discuss the implications for QCD in curved spacetime and suggest avenues for further theoretical and observational investigation.</description>

      <title>The fast, the slow and the merging: probes of evaporating memory burdened PBHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called memory-burden effect implies that evaporating Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) inevitably stabilize before complete decay. This stabilization opens a new mass window for PBH Dark Matter below $10^{15}\,$g. The transition to the memory-burdened phase is not instantaneous but unfolds over cosmological timescales, with some PBHs entering this phase in the present epoch. Additionally, a fraction of PBHs undergo mergers today, forming ''young'' semiclassical black holes that evaporate at unsuppressed rates. Both processes generate fluxes of stable astrophysical particles, which are constrained by current measurements of high-energy $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos. Moreover, the steep increase in energy injection at higher redshifts perturbs the ionization history of the Universe, leading to complementary bounds from observations of the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. We find that the reopened window enabled by the memory-burden effect is largely within reach of detection, both locally and across cosmological distances. We further describe how our findings restrict the values of the critical exponent characterizing the memory burden phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Beyond diagonal approximations: improved covariance modeling for pulsar timing array data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for nHz gravitational-wave backgrounds (GWBs) typically model time-correlated noise by assuming a diagonal covariance in Fourier space, neglecting inter-frequency correlations introduced by the finite observation window. We show that this diagonal approximation can lead to biased estimates of spectral parameters, especially for the common red process that represents the GWB. To address these limitations, we present a method that (i) computes the time-domain autocorrelation on a coarse grid using a fast Fourier transform (FFT), (ii) interpolates it accurately to the unevenly sampled observation times, and (iii) incorporates it into a low-rank likelihood via the Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury identity. Using both analytic covariance comparisons and end-to-end simulations inspired by the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we demonstrate that our method captures frequency correlations faithfully, avoids Gibbs ringing, and recovers unbiased spectral parameters with modest computational cost. As PTA datasets increase in sensitivity and complexity, our approach offers a practical and scalable path to fully accurate covariance modeling for current and future analyses.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave imprints on spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite growing interest, there is a scarcity of known predictions in the regime where both quantum and relativistic effects become observable. Here, we investigate a combined atom-field system in a curved spacetime, focusing specifically on gravitational-wave backgrounds. We show that a plane gravitational wave modifies spontaneous emission from a single atom, both in terms of sidebands in the spectrum and directionality of the emission. While the total decay rate remains unchanged, implying that no information about the gravitational wave is stored in the atomic internal state alone, the wave leaves imprints on the evolution of the composite atom-field system. To quantify how well this effect can be measured, we analyze both the classical Fisher information associated with photon number measurements and the quantum Fisher information. Our analysis indicates that the effect could be measured in state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments and points to spontaneous emission as a potential probe of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Decorating Asymptotically Flat Space-Time with the Moduli Space of String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: N=2, 4 and 8 supersymmetric string theories in four dimensional flat space-time have moduli space of vacua. We argue that starting from a theory where the moduli approach a particular moduli space point A at infinity, we can construct a classical solution that contains an arbitrarily large space-time region where the moduli take values corresponding to any other moduli space point B of our choice to any desired accuracy. Therefore the observables of a theory with a given set of asymptotic values of the moduli will have complete information on the observables for any other asymptotic values of the moduli. Also it is physically impossible for any experiment, performed over a finite time, to determine the asymptotic values of the moduli. We point out the difference between asymptotically flat space-time and asymptotically AdS space-time in this regard and discuss the possible implication of these results for holographic duals of string theories in flat space-time. For N=2 supersymmetric theories, A and B could correspond to compactifications on topologically distinct Calabi-Yau manifolds related by flop or conifold transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantum detection of boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum detection of spacetime conicity was investigated in reference [Phys. Lett. B 820, 136482 (2021)] through the analysis of the response function of an Unruh-deWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field. In particular, it was shown that the detector can discern the presence of the deficit angle of a region of spacetime even when it is placed on a flat region with no conical deficit and (due to the rapid switching on and off) is classically isolated from the conical region. The scalar field was supposed to be continuous at the three dimensional timelike hypersurface connecting both regions and it was argued that the non-trivial effects on the response function were only due to the deficit angle of the outer conical region. In this paper, we study the response function of the Unruh-deWitt detector on the same classical framework, but exploring the effects of the choice of boundary conditions for the scalar field at the connecting hypersurface. These boundary conditions are extracted from the two-interval Sturm-Liouville theory and each one gives rise to a physically inequivalent sensible dynamics for the quantum field. We show that they play an important role on the response function of the detector, which effectively ``feels'' the combined effect of conicity + boundary condition.</description>

Abstract: Lagrangians which transform homogeneously under a global transformation of the fields (a global rescaling, for instance) can be written on-shell as a total derivative which has a universal, solution-independent expression, using a functional version of the Euler theorem for homogeneous functions. We study the uniqueness of this expression and how this result can be used in the construction of generalized Komar charges.</description>

      <title>DESI results and Dark Energy from QCD topological sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a physically motivated model of dark energy (DE) rooted in the topological structure of the Quantum ChromoDynamic (QCD) vacuum. In this framework, DE emerges as the Universe expands, from the difference in vacuum energy between the expanding Universe and Minkowski spacetime, driven by QCD vacuum topological sectors. This leads to a modification of the dark energy term in the Friedmann equation, which then scales with the Hubble parameter as $\rho_{\rm DE}(t) \propto H(t)$ when dark energy dominates the expansion of the Universe. The QCD scale, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD} \sim 100~{\rm MeV}$, naturally sets the energy density of DE and provides a compelling explanation for why its impact on cosmic expansion becomes significant only in the recent cosmological epoch. Importantly, the entire framework is grounded in Standard Model (SM) physics, involving no new fields or coupling constants. Key predictions of the model include: (a) A present-day DE equation of state $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$, asymptotically approaching the de Sitter limit $w_{\rm DE} = -1$ in the future, with the corresponding asymptotic Hubble constant $\overline{H}$ set by $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. (b) At redshifts $z \ge 0$, $w_{\rm DE}$ can lie above or below $-1$ and may cross this boundary multiple times, behavior qualitatively consistent with recent DESI observations. (c) The solution to the Friedmann equation in this framework can deviate from the canonical $\Lambda$CDM form at $z \ge 0$. (d) If such deviation occurs, it can be tested using cosmological observations, CMB anisotropies, BAO, SNIa, and large-scale structure, which we propose to explore in future work. (e) Finally, we point out a potential connection between our framework and the observed $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>Enhancing photon-axion conversion probability with squeezed coherent states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states with N photons added can significantly enhance the conversion probability.</description>

      <title>The power of SKA to Constrain cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds below the astrophysical foreground noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inspirals of supermaissive black hole binaries provide a convinced gravitational wave background in the nHz band, serving as the fiducial model of the recent gravitational wave signal reported by the PTA experiments. The uncertainties of the number of binaries contributing to each frequency bin introduce a foreground noise in the nHz and $\mu$Hz bands against the observation of the underlying gravitational wave backgrounds of the cosmological origin. In this work, we investigate a new method to constrain the cosmological gravitational wave strength under the astrophysical foreground. The energy density fluctuations from cosmological gravitational-wave sources can generally trigger the formation of compact subhalos of dark matter, and the upcoming Square Kilometer Array has the ability to constrain the abundance of the subhalos at the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ level. The cosmological gravitational wave energy spectra from various sources are expected to be constrained several orders of magnitude below the astrophysical foreground, providing more strict constraints on the parameter spaces of corresponding new physics models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational scattering of a spinning probe mass in a Kerr background using the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) approach. This corresponds to the leading term (0SF) in the gravitational self-force expansion for the spinning two-body problem with large mass hierarchy. By reformulating the geodesic and Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations as a recursive Berends-Giele type equation known from multi-gluon scattering, we develop a novel integration-by-parts formalism on the worldline that enables systematic computation of scattering observables - specifically the impulse and spin kick - to arbitrary orders in Newton's constant and spin. Here, the transition to a position space formalism is key. We present explicit results up to and including the physical 7PM order, thereby incorporating all relevant higher-spin and higher-curvature terms on the worldline, advancing beyond previous calculations. This work represents an initial step to reconceptualise the gravitational self-force expansion through worldline quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When quantum measurements are conducted over spacelike-separated regions of spacetime, a natural and commonly assumed physical postulate, called Einstein causality, asserts that they should commute. In this paper, we provide a generalisation to L\"uders' rule \`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture \`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated (pre)compact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</description>

Abstract: A quantum object is extended by virtue of quantum uncertainty. Subjected to gravity, it therefore experiences tidal forces and other relativistic effects. As a result, entropy and purity affect geodesic motion and acquire weight, an observation that has broad implications from free-fall experiments to Hawking radiation. If the object's position is quantum correlated in at least two directions, a complete description of its geodesic motion requires non-Riemannian geometry of a form controlled by the entropy and purity of its state. In addition, the analysis reveals a new Minkowski structure on a subspace of entanglement degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Developments of initial data on big bang singularities for the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work, Ringstr\"om proposed a geometric notion of initial data on big bang singularities. Moreover, he conjectured that initial data on the singularity could be used to parameterize quiescent solutions to Einstein's equations; that is, roughly speaking, solutions whose leading order asymptotics are convergent. We prove that given initial data on the singularity for the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations in 4 spacetime dimensions, as defined by Ringstr\"om, there is a corresponding unique development of the data. We do not assume any symmetry or analyticity, and we allow for arbitrary closed spatial topology. Our results thus present an important step towards resolving Ringstr\"om's conjecture. Furthermore, our results show that the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations have a geometric singular initial value problem formulation, which is analogous to the classical result by Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch for initial data on a Cauchy hypersurface.
  In the literature, there are two conditions which are expected to ensure that quiescent behavior occurs. The first one is an integrability condition on a special spatial frame. The second one is an algebraic condition on the eigenvalues of the expansion normalized Weingarten map associated with a foliation of the spacetime near the singularity. Our result is the first such result where both possibilities are allowed. That is, we allow for the first condition to ensure quiescence in one region of space and for the second condition to take over in the region where the first one is violated. This fact allows for our results to include the vacuum setting.</description>

Abstract: Heterodyne detection using microwave cavities is a promising method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves or ultralight axion dark matter. In this work, we report on studies conducted on a spherical 2-cell cavity developed by the MAGO collaboration for high-frequency gravitational waves detection. Although fabricated around 20 years ago, the cavity had not been used since. Due to deviations from the nominal geometry, we conducted a mechanical survey and performed room-temperature plastic tuning. Measurements and simulations of the mechanical resonances and electromagnetic properties were carried out, as these are critical for estimating the cavity's gravitational wave coupling potential. Based on these results, we plan further studies in a cryogenic environment. The cavity characterisation does not only provide valuable experience for a planned physics run but also informs the future development of improved cavity designs.</description>

Abstract: We present all possible analytical solutions of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric in Einstein-aether theory for all values of the cosmological constant and spatial curvature with many reasonable values of the equation-of-state parameter. We analyze the dynamics of each model analytically and also graphically by plotting the geometric radius, Hubble and deceleration parameters along with the effective energy conditions. All our results are compared with the corresponding models in General Relativity. The two key results are (i) the aether does not qualitatively change the dynamics of the cosmological models but merely scales the geometric radius, Hubble, and deceleration parameters, and (ii) we found eight models that are entirely void of any aether, meaning in such a universe aether does not play any role cosmologically, although it affects the solar system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Rotating spacetimes with a free scalar field in four and five dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct explicit rotating solutions in Einstein's theory of relativity with a minimally coupled free scalar field rederiving and finding solutions in four or five spacetime dimensions. These spacetimes describe, in particular, the back-reaction of a free scalar field evolving in a Kerr spacetime. Adapting the general integrability result obtained many years ago from Eri\c{s}-G\"{u}rses to simpler spherical coordinates, we present a method for rederiving the four-dimensional Bogush-Gal'tsov solution. Furthermore, we find the five-dimensional spacetime featuring a free scalar with two distinct angular momenta. In the static limit, these five-dimensional geometries provide higher-dimensional extensions of the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime. Last but not least, we obtain the four-dimensional version of a Kerr-Newman-NUT spacetime endowed with a free scalar, where the scalar field's radial profile is extended to incorporate dependence on the polar angular coordinate. Our results offer a comprehensive analysis of several recently proposed four-dimensional static solutions with scalar multipolar hair, representing a unified study of spacetimes with a free scalar field in both four and five dimensions under the general integrability result of Eri\c{s}-G\"{u}rses.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of charged and accelerating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconsider various C-metric spacetimes describing charged and (slowly) accelerating AdS black holes in different theories of (non-linear) electrodynamics and revisit their thermodynamic properties. Focusing first on the Maxwell theory, we find a parametrization of the metric where we can eliminate the non-trivial `normalization' of the boost Killing vector which was crucial for obtaining consistent thermodynamics in previous studies. We also calculate the Euclidean action using i) the standard holographic renormalization and ii) using the topological renormalization, showing that in the presence of overall cosmic string tension the two do not agree. These results are also extended to accelerating black holes in ModMax and RegMax non-linear electrodynamics. Interestingly, for the latter the electrostatic potential picks up a modification, that remains to be explained, but is consistent with the topological renormalization and the (generalized) Hawking--Ross prescription. Our study indicates that thermodynamics of charged accelerating black holes is far from being completely understood.</description>

      <title>Bunch-Davies initial conditions and non-perturbative inflationary dynamics in Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to simulate realistic inhomogeneities during cosmological inflation with high precision using numerical relativity. Stochastic initial conditions are set in line with the Bunch-Davies vaccuum and satisfy the Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints of General Relativity to leading order in perturbation theory. The subsequent fully non-linear dynamical evolution is formulated within a family of geodesic gauges but can in principle be adapted to any choice of coordinates. We present 3 examples of inflationary dynamics: a simple quadratic potential, a potential with an inflection point and a strong resonance model. When perturbations are small, we recover standard predictions of cosmological perturbation theory, and we quantify strongly non-linear inhomogeneities when non-perturbative configurations emerge, such as in the strong resonance model. Our results pave the way towards the first realistic non-perturbative, and fully non-linear Numerical Relativity simulations of the early inflationary universe.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution and regular black hole formation in gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adopt an effective action inspired by asymptotically safe gravity, in which the effective gravitational constant is parametrized as $G(\epsilon) = G_{N} /[1 + \tilde{\omega} (G_{N}^{2} \epsilon)^{\alpha}]$, where $G_{N}$ and $\epsilon$ denote Newton's gravitational constant and the energy density of the matter field, respectively, with two dimensionless model parameters, $\tilde{\omega}$ and $\alpha$. Within this framework, we investigate the complete gravitational collapse of a homogeneous ball of perfect fluid and find that singularity is completely resolved for $\alpha &gt; 1$ but not for $1/2 \le \alpha \le 1$. The case of $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/2$ is inconsistent with asymptotic safety. Moreover, we note that although the singularity cannot be fully resolved for $\alpha = 1$, it is significantly weakened by quantum gravity effects. Furthermore, we successfully construct a static exterior metric which, together with the interior solution, describes the dynamical formation of regular black holes in an asymptotically flat spacetime. The resulting regular black hole, obtained as the final static state, contains a de Sitter core and admits a static metric fully expressible in terms of the Lerch transcendent for general cases and in elementary functions for certain values of $\alpha$, including $\alpha = 2$. We also discuss the formation of gravastars and the late-time evaporation process of the regular black holes.</description>

      <title>General Einstein-Cartan quadratic gravity with derivative couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity we consider an action, containing up to quadratic terms of the Ricci scalar and the Holst invariant, coupled non-minimally to a scalar field, including couplings of its derivatives to curvature. We derive the equivalent metric theory, featuring an extra dynamical pseudoscalar degree of freedom associated with the presence of the Holst term in the action. We study the evolution of the resulting two-field system in a FRW background and show that it evolves rapidly into an effective single-field inflationary model. We find that the model is consistent with the latest observational data for a wide range of its parameters, determining the necessary upper limits on derivative coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Bias-Corrected Importance Sampling for Inferring Beyond-Vacuum-GR Effects in Gravitational-Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming gravitational wave (GW) observatory LISA will measure the parameters of sources like extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) to exquisite precision. These measurements will also be sensitive to perturbations to the vacuum, GR-consistent evolution of sources, which might be caused by astrophysical environments or deviations from general relativity (GR). Previous studies have shown such ``beyond-vacuum-GR'' perturbations to potentially induce severe biases ($\gtrsim 10\sigma$) on recovered parameters under the ``null'' vacuum-GR hypothesis. While Bayesian inference can be performed under the null hypothesis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers, it is computationally infeasible to repeat for more than a modest subset of all possible beyond-vacuum-GR hypotheses. We introduce bias-corrected importance sampling, a generic inference technique for nested models that is informed by the null hypothesis posteriors and the linear signal approximation to correct any induced inference biases. For a typical EMRI source that is significantly influenced by its environment but has been inferred only under the null hypothesis, the proposed method efficiently recovers the injected (unbiased) source parameters and the true posterior at a fraction of the expense of redoing MCMC inference under the full hypothesis. In future GW data analysis using the output of the proposed LISA global-fit pipeline, such methods may be necessary for the feasible and systematic inference of beyond-vacuum-GR effects.</description>

      <title>Harvesting correlations from BTZ black hole coupled to a Lorentz-violating vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of Lorentz violation on correlations harvesting, specifically focusing on the harvested entanglement and harvested mutual information between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in the Lorentz-violating BTZ-like black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that Lorentz symmetry breaking has contrasting impacts on entanglement harvesting and mutual information harvesting in BTZ backgrounds: it enhances mutual information harvesting while suppressing entanglement harvesting. This phenomenon suggests that the increase in total correlations in Lorentz-violating vector field backgrounds with gravitational coupling is predominantly driven by classical components, with quantum correlations contributing less to the overall mutual information. These results indicate that Lorentz violation, as a quantum property of spacetime, may impose intrinsic constraints on the quantum information capacity encoded in spacetime due to competition among quantum degrees of freedom for resources. Furthermore, Lorentz symmetry breaking expands the \textit{entanglement shadow} region, further demonstrating its disruptive effect on quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Detecting Cosmological Phase Transitions with Taiji: Sensitivity Analysis and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the capability of the Taiji space-based gravitational wave observatory to detect stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by first-order phase transitions in the early universe. Using a comprehensive simulation framework that incorporates realistic instrumental noise, galactic double white dwarf confusion noise, and extragalactic compact binary backgrounds, we systematically analyze Taiji's sensitivity across a range of signal parameters. Our Bayesian analysis demonstrates that Taiji can robustly detect and characterize phase transition signals with energy densities exceeding $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.4 \times 10^{-11}$ across most of its frequency band, with particularly strong sensitivity around $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ Hz. For signals with amplitudes above $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.1 \times 10^{-10}$, Taiji can determine the peak frequency with relative precision better than $10\%$. These detection capabilities would enable Taiji to probe electroweak-scale phase transitions in various beyond-Standard-Model scenarios, potentially revealing new physics connected to baryogenesis and dark matter production. We quantify detection confidence using both Bayes factors and the Deviance Information Criterion, finding consistent results that validate our statistical methodology.</description>

      <title>Dictionary revision for mapping boundary data to bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correspondence between gravitational observables derived from scattering processes and adiabatic invariants in bound orbits, within the framework of the Post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion, has garnered significant attention in the study of bound orbital systems. However, the existing dictionary for this correspondence, \textcolor{black}{characterized by the transformation $\beta\rightarrow i \beta$ and $b\rightarrow \pm i |b|$ with $\beta=arccosh \gamma$}, produces complex-valued quantities of bound orbits in 4PM calculations. These results contradict fundamental physical principles, thereby highlighting deficiencies in the existing dictionary. Our research identifies a critical issue: the Fourier transform of the scattering amplitude incorporates a factor of $(p_\infty^2)^{-n/2}$. This factor introduces singularities at $p_\infty^2 = 0$, thereby rendering the original dictionary become ineffective, as it assumes the possibility of connecting both scattering states and bound states at the singular point. We propose a rigorous modification by employing Hawking's method for black hole radiation, specifically analytical continuing $p_\infty^2 \rightarrow p_\infty^2 e^{-i \pi}$. We also evaluate the new dictionary by comparing the binding energy calculated using effective one-body theory with numerical relativity simulation data from the SXS collaboration. Our findings indicate a remarkable agreement between the two sets of results. This revised dictionary enhances the applicability of gravitational observables derived from scattering processes to bound orbits and effectively fulfills the objectives envisioned by the pioneers who proposed this correspondence.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Solutions and pre-inflationary in $F(R, T)$ Gravity with Axion Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate wormhole solutions and inflationary initial conditions in the coupled axion-inflaton/scalar field system within $F(R,T)$ gravity. Notably, the Euclidean action is reduced by approximately $10^5$ compared with the GR case. In Euclidean AdS spacetime, we construct Euclidean (semi-)wormhole geometries that naturally set inflationary initial conditions. To enhance the probability of sustained inflation and address the short inflation duration issue in the no-boundary proposal, we constrain $\lambda$ to $\lambda &lt; -\kappa$ by analyzing the properties of the Euclidean action. This constraint causes the probability weight $ P \propto e^{-S_E} $ to favor high-potential regions, achieving sufficient inflation while maintaining a nearly Gaussian perturbation spectrum. The results suggest that matter-geometry coupling in $F(R,T)$ gravity provides a novel mechanism for reconciling quantum cosmology with observational requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We work out a precise holographic duality between sine dilaton gravity, and DSSYK. More precisely, canonical quantization of sine dilaton gravity reproduces q-Schwarzian quantum mechanics, which is the auxiliary system that arises from the chord diagrams of DSSYK. The role of the chord number in DSSYK is played by the (Weyl rescaled) geodesic length in the bulk. The most puzzling aspect of reconciling DSSYK with a simple gravitational dual at the classical level is the distinction between temperature and "fake temperature". At the q-Schwarzian level, we clarify how this arises from the constraint that the chord number is positive. The on-shell q-Schwarzian action with the constraint reproduces the thermodynamics of DSSYK. Semi-classically, in sine dilaton gravity this translates to the insertion of a defect, from which we deduce that fake temperature is the Hawking temperature of a smooth Lorentzian black hole. We comment on several relations with dS space. One remarkable feature is that in sine dilaton gravity quantization discretizes spacetime, therefore the Hilbert space is discrete.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Active Seismic Isolation Systems in Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors such as KAGRA, a 3-km long underground laser interferometer in Japan, require elaborate passive and active seismic isolation of their mirrors. With the aim of detecting passing gravitational waves that create a relative mirror displacement of less than $10^{-22}\ \mathrm{m}$ at frequencies of tens to hundreds of Hz, all environmental couplings must be stringently suppressed. This paper presents the result of applying the H-infinity optimization method to the active seismic isolation of a gravitational-wave detector for the first time. The so-called \textit{sensor correction} and \textit{sensor fusion} schemes of the seismic attenuation system of KAGRA's signal recycling mirror are used as a test bed. We designed and implemented optimal sensor correction and sensor fusion filters, resulting in a sevenfold attenuation of seismic noise coupling to the signal recycling mirror in the 0.1-0.5 Hz band, with the downstream effect of an 88.2% noise performance improvement in the same frequency band. When combined with other hardware upgrades, the implementation of sensor correction and sensor fusion contributed to an increase in KAGRA's duty cycle from 53% in the O3GK observation run to 80% in O4a, demonstrating the effectiveness of the H-infinity optimization approach.</description>

      <title>A topological contribution to Bogoliubov coefficient for cosmological particle production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle production in cosmology is often efficiently computed in terms of Bogoliubov transforms. Restricting to a particular class of dispersion relationships, we identify a map between the number of particles produced in a special kinematic limit and a Stokes phenomena related topology of analytic continuation of the Bogoliubov coefficient functions. Intuitively, this kinematic limit corresponds to the long wavelength limit although a more precise description depends on the nature of the curved spacetime. To identify the topology, we reformulate the usual Bogoliubov computations as a type of SU(1,1) gauged differential equation and utilize a special gauge together with a discrete symmetry that naturally characterizes the dispersion relationship. Using a dark matter model and a nonzero constant spatial curvature model, we estimate how such topological contributions will arise in physical applications.</description>

      <title>Generalized entropy of gravitational fluctuations</title>

Abstract: The corrections to holographic entanglement entropy from bulk quantum fields in a classical gravitational background are now well understood. They lead, in particular, to unitary Page curves for evaporating black holes. However, the correct treatment of quantum fluctuations of the metric, including graviton excitations, is a longstanding problem. We provide a gauge-invariant prescription for the generalized entropy of gravitons in anti-de Sitter space in terms of areas and bulk entanglement entropy, generalizing the quantum extremal surface prescription to accommodate fluctuations in the semiclassical spacetime geometry. This task requires a careful treatment of the area operator on the graviton Hilbert space and the definition of a "quantum extremal gauge" in which the extremal surface is unperturbed. It also requires us to determine the correct vacuum modular Hamiltonian for the graviton field, which we fix by requiring that it doesn't contain a boundary term in extremal gauge. We check our prescription with an explicit computation of the vacuum-subtracted generalized entropy of states containing a graviton in an AdS-Rindler background. Our results exactly match vacuum-subtracted von Neumann entropies for stress-tensor excited states in holographic conformal field theory with $d&gt;2$ dimensions. We also use covariant phase space techniques to give a partial proof of our prescription when the entanglement wedge for the background spacetime has a bifurcate Killing horizon. Along the way, we identify a class of perturbative graviton states that have parametrically larger generalized entropy, in the small $G_N$ expansion, than any low-energy excitations of an ordinary quantum field.</description>

      <title>Measuring Decoherence Due to Quantum Vacuum Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a particle with vacuum fluctuations--which theoretically exist even in the complete absence of matter--can lead to observable irreversible decoherence if it were possible to switch on and off the particle charge suddenly. We compute the leading order decoherence effect for such a scenario and propose an experimental setup for its detection. Such a measurement might provide further insights into the nature of vacuum fluctuations and a novel precision test for the decoherence theory.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Modeling of Correlated Noise in Space-Based Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the statistical properties of noise is important in data analysis for space-based gravitational wave detectors. Noise in different time-delay interferometry channels correlates with each other. Many studies often assume uncorrelated noise and ignore the off-diagonal elements in the noise covariance matrix. This could lead to some bias in the parameter estimation of gravitational wave signals. In this paper, we present a framework for reconstructing the full noise covariance matrix, including frequency-dependent auto- and cross-correlated power spectral densities, without assuming the parametric analytic expressions of the noise model. Our approach combines spline interpolation with trigonometric basis functions to construct a semi-analytical representation of the noise. We then employ trans-dimensional Bayesian inference to fit the correlated noise structure.The resulting software package, $\texttt{NOISAR}$, successfully recovers both auto- and cross-correlated power spectral features with a relative error of about $10\%$.</description>

      <title>Viability of warm inflation with standard model interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal warm inflation scenario proposed in Ref. [1] -- featuring an axionlike inflaton coupled to Standard Model (SM) gluons via the standard interaction $\phi G \tilde G$ -- offers a compelling bridge between inflationary dynamics and SM particle content. While the model retains only the inflaton as a beyond-SM field, its original analysis relied on some approximate treatments of warm inflation's (WI) dynamics. Here, we revisit this scenario using WI2easy, a precision computational tool for WI dynamics [2], to rigorously evaluate the model's viability and full range of model's parameters compatible with the observational parameters. Overall, we find that the results of Ref. [1] hold, but with significant differences in the weak and strong dissipative regimes of WI.</description>
