      <title>BDDC Preconditioning on GPUs for Cardiac Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to understand cardiac arrhythmia, computer models for electrophysiology are essential. In the EuroHPC MicroCARD project, we adapt the current models and leverage modern computing resources to model diseased hearts and their microstructure accurately. Towards this objective, we develop a portable, highly efficient, and performing BDDC preconditioner and solver implementation, demonstrating scalability with over 90% efficiency on up to 100 GPUs.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Local Optimizer-Tracking Solver for Differential-Algebriac Equations with Optimization Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sequential solver for differential-algebraic equations with embedded optimization criteria (DAEOs) was developed to take advantage of the theoretical work done by Deussen et al. Solvers of this type separate the optimization problem from the differential equation and solve each individually. The new solver relies on the reduction of a DAEO to a sequence of differential inclusions separated by jump events. These jump events occur when the global solution to the optimization problem jumps to a new value. Without explicit treatment, these events will reduce the order of convergence of the integration step to one. The solver implements a "local optimizer tracking" procedure to detect and correct these jump events. Local optimizer tracking is much less expensive than running a deterministic global optimizer at every time step. This preserves the order of convergence of the integrator component without sacrificing performance to perform deterministic global optimization at every time step. The newly developed solver produces correct solutions to DAEOs and runs much faster than sequential DAEO solvers that rely only on global optimization.</description>

      <title>Typical Algorithms for Estimating Hurst Exponent of Time Sequence: A Data Analyst's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hurst exponent is a significant indicator for characterizing the self-similarity and long-term memory properties of time sequences. It has wide applications in physics, technologies, engineering, mathematics, statistics, economics, psychology and so on. Currently, available methods for estimating the Hurst exponent of time sequences can be divided into different categories: time-domain methods and spectrum-domain methods based on the representation of time sequence, linear regression methods and Bayesian methods based on parameter estimation methods. Although various methods are discussed in literature, there are still some deficiencies: the descriptions of the estimation algorithms are just mathematics-oriented and the pseudo-codes are missing; the effectiveness and accuracy of the estimation algorithms are not clear; the classification of estimation methods is not considered and there is a lack of guidance for selecting the estimation methods. In this work, the emphasis is put on thirteen dominant methods for estimating the Hurst exponent. For the purpose of decreasing the difficulty of implementing the estimation methods with computer programs, the mathematical principles are discussed briefly and the pseudo-codes of algorithms are presented with necessary details. It is expected that the survey could help the researchers to select, implement and apply the estimation algorithms of interest in practical situations in an easy way.</description>
