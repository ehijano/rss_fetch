      <title>Deciphering Spin-Parity Assignments of Nuclear Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-parity assignments of nuclear levels are critical for understanding nuclear structure and reactions. However, inconsistent notation conventions and ambiguous reporting in research papers often lead to confusion and misinterpretations. This paper examines the policies of the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF) and the evaluations by Endt and collaborators, highlighting key differences in their approaches to spin-parity notation. Sources of confusion are identified, including ambiguous use of strong and weak arguments and the conflation of new experimental results with prior constraints. Recommendations are provided to improve clarity and consistency in reporting spin-parity assignments, emphasizing the need for explicit notation conventions, clear differentiation of argument strengths, community education, and separate reporting of new findings. These steps aim to enhance the accuracy and utility of nuclear data for both researchers and evaluators.</description>

      <title>Isomeric yield ratios and mass spectrometry of Y and Nb isotopes in the neutron-rich N=60 region: the unusual case of $^{98}$Y</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isomeric yield ratio (IYR) of fission products is an observable that carries relevant information about the fragments emerging from the scission of a fissioning nucleus. We report on IYR of $^{96,98,100}$Y and $^{100,102}$Nb, together with the previously reported values for $^{97}$Y and $^{99}$Nb, produced in the 28 MeV $\alpha$-induced fission of $^{232}$Th at the Ion Guide Isotope Separation On-Line (IGISOL) facility of the University of Jyv{\"a}skyl{\"a}. We measured the IYR using two different techniques, the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance (PI-ICR) and the multiple-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MR-TOF-MS) methods. Moreover, we measured the masses of the long-lived isomeric states in $^{98,100}$Y and $^{100,102}$Nb populated via in-trap $\beta$-decay of their precursors. Since the $\beta$-decay selectively populates states with a favourable spin-parity, we could identify the measured state and show that in all cases except $^{102}$Nb the ground state is the low-spin state. This measurement confirms the spin-parity assignments of all the nuclei as they are reported on the ENSDF evaluations, disagreeing with the assignment for $^{100}$Y reported on the NUBASE2020 evaluation.
  Making also use of previously reported data, we observe an anomalously low IYR for the $N=59$ isotope $^{98}$Y as compared to other yttrium or neighboring niobium isotopes. This behavior is very rare across the nuclear chart and is posited to be connected to the characteristic shape coexistence of $^{98}$Y and to the change in the charge radii of the ground and excited states in the $N=58-60$ region.</description>

      <title>Exploring the effects of $\alpha$-clustered structure of $^{16}O$ nuclei in anisotropic flow fluctuations in $^{16}O$-$^{16}O$ collisions at the LHC within a CGC+Hydro framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effects of the presence of clustered nuclear structure of $^{16}O$ in the final state elliptic flow fluctuations through $^{16}O$-$^{16}O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7$ TeV within a hybrid model, IPGlasma+MUSIC+iSS+ UrQMD. We compare the results of elliptic flow fluctuations using $\alpha$-clustered nuclear structure to the Woods-Saxon nuclear profile having no clustered structure. We observe a significant difference in the elliptic flow fluctuations, which arise due to the consideration of a clustered nuclear structure of $^{16}O$.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of open-shell nuclei from spherical coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the spherical coupled-cluster ab initio method for open-shell nuclei where two nucleons are removed from a shell subclosure. Following the recent implementation of the two-particle attached approach [Phys. Rev.C 110 (2024) 4, 044306], we focus on the two-particle-removed method. Using the equations-of-motion framework, we address both nuclear structure and dipole response functions by coupling coupled-cluster theory with the Lorentz integral transform technique. We perform calculations using chiral interactions, including three-nucleon forces, and estimate many-body uncertainties by comparing different coupled-cluster truncation schemes. We validate our approach by studying ground-state energies, excited states, and electric dipole polarizabilities in the oxygen and calcium isotopic chains. For binding energies and selected low-lying excited states, we achieve an accuracy comparable to that of the established closed-shell coupled-cluster theory and generally agree with experiment. Finally, we underestimate experimental data for electric dipole polarizabilities, particularly in calcium isotopes.</description>

      <title>Fusion research in a Deuterium-Tritium tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent ITER re-baselining calls for new fusion-relevant research best carried out in a DT-capable tokamak device with similar characteristics. The present paper describes key issues that could be addressed in a Suitably Enhanced DT-capable Tokamak (SET), with tungsten plasma facing components, boronization systems, and 10 MW of ECRH, based on characteristics and knowledgebase of JET. We discuss hardware options, and show that fusion-relevant operational scenarios could be achieved. Notably, development, validation and testing of fusion and nuclear diagnostics, to be used in next generation devices, would require a D-T capable tokamak as described.</description>

      <title>Multireference covariant density functional theory for shape coexistence and isomerism in $^{43}$S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the multireference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT) to describe the low-lying states of the odd-mass nucleus $^{43}$S near the neutron magic number $N=28$ with shape coexistence. The wave functions of the low-lying states are constructed as superpositions of configurations with different intrinsic shapes and $K$ quantum numbers, projected onto good particle numbers and angular momenta. The MR-CDFT successfully reproduces the main features of the low-energy structure in $^{43}$S. Our results indicate that the ground state, $3/2^-_1$, is predominantly composed of the intruder prolate one-quasiparticle (1qp) configuration $\nu1/2^-[321]$. In contrast, the $7/2^-_1$ state is identified as a high-$K$ isomer, primarily built on the prolate 1qp configuration $\nu7/2^-[303]$. Additionally, the $3/2^-_2$ state is found to be an admixture dominated by an oblate configuration with $K^\pi = 1/2^-$, along with a small contribution from a prolate configuration with $K^\pi = 3/2^-$. These results demonstrate the capability of MR-CDFT to capture the intricate interplay among shape coexistence, $K$-mixing, and isomerism in the low-energy structure of odd-mass nuclei around $N = 28$.</description>

      <title>The Gaseous Prototype (GaP): a GanESS demonstrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GanESS experiment will exploit the high-pressure noble gas time projection chamber technology to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) at the European Spallation Source (ESS). The detector, able to operate at pressures up to 50 bar with different noble gases (Xe, Ar and Kr), will employ electroluminescence to amplify the ionization signal with the objective of reaching a threshold as low as 1-2 e$^-$, equivalent to $&lt;$ 100 eV$_{\text{ee}}$. The Gaseous Prototype (GaP) has been built to characterize the technique at the few-keV energy regime and to understand various aspects related to the technology. Concretely, it will be used to measure the quenching factor of the different mediums as well as to characterize the electroluminescence yield and detection threshold under different operational conditions. The present paper describes the Gaseous Prototype and its first results operating with gaseous argon at moderate pressures (up to 10 bar). A potential detection threshold lower than 2.9 keV has been observed following operation with a $^{55}$Fe calibration source.</description>

      <title>Combined Evidence for the $X_{17}$ Boson After PADME Results on Resonant Production in Positron Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Positron Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati has reported an excess of $e^+e^-$ final-state events from positron annihilation on fixed-target atomic electrons. While the global significance remains at the $1.8\,\sigma$ level, the excess is centered around $\sqrt{s} \sim 17\,\text{MeV}$, coinciding with the invariant mass at which anomalous $e^+e^-$ pair production has previously been observed in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states in $^8$Be, $^4$He and $^{12}$C, thereby strengthening the case for a common underlying origin, possibly involving a hypothetical new $X_{17}$ boson. We discuss the significance of this independent accelerator-based evidence. Combining it with existing nuclear physics results, we obtain a value for the $X_{17}$ mass of $m_{X_{17}} = 16.88 \pm 0.05\,$ MeV, reducing the uncertainty from nuclear physics determinations alone by more than a factor of two.</description>

      <title>From existing and new nuclear and astrophysical constraints to stringent limits on the equation of state of neutron-rich dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through continuous progress in nuclear theory and experiment and an increasing number of neutron-star observations, a multitude of information about the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities is available. To constrain the EOS across its entire density range, this information needs to be combined consistently. However, the impact and model-dependency of individual observations vary. We present a broad compendium of different constraints and apply them individually to a large set of EOS candidates within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, we explore different ways how chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics can be used to place a likelihood on EOS candidates. We also investigate the impact of nuclear experimental constraints, as well as different radio and X-ray observations of neutron star (NS) masses and radii. This is augmented by reanalyses of the existing data from BNS coalescences, in particular of GW170817, with improved models for the tidal waveform and kilonova light curves, which we also utilize to construct a tight upper limit of 2.39$\,$M$_\odot$ on the TOV mass based on GW170817's remnant. Our diverse set of constraints is eventually combined to obtain stringent limits on NS properties. We organize the combination in a way to distinguish between constraints where the systematic uncertainties are deemed small and those that rely on less conservative assumptions. For the former, we find the radius of the canonical 1.4$\,$M$_\odot$ neutron star to be $R_{1.4}= 12.26_{-0.91}^{+0.80}\,$km and the TOV mass at $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.25_{-0.22}^{+0.42}\,$M$_\odot$ (95% credibility). Including all the presented constraints yields $R_{1.4}= 12.20_{-0.48}^{+0.50}\,$km and $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.30_{-0.20}^{+0.07}\,$M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>The X17 boson and the d(p,e+ e-)3He and d(n,e+ e-)3H processes: a theoretical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work deals with the e+ e- pair production in the d(p,e+e-)3He and d(n,e+ e-)3H processes, in order to evidentiate possible effects due to the exchange of a hypothetical low-mass boson, the so-called X17. These processes are studied for energies of the incident beams in the range 18-30 MeV, in order to have a sufficient energy to produce such a boson, whose mass is estimated to be around 17 MeV. We first analyze them as a purely electromagnetic processes, in the context of a state-of-the-art approach to nuclear strong-interaction dynamics and nuclear electromagnetic currents, derived from chiral effective field theory chiEFT. Next, we examine how the exchange of a hypothetical low-mass boson would impact the cross sections for such processes. We consider several possibilities, that this boson is either a scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, or axial particle. The main aim of the study is to exploit the specular structure of the 3He and 3H nuclei to investigate the isospin dependency of the X17-nucleon interaction, as the alleged "proto-phobicity".</description>

      <title>Proton Radiation Damage and Annealing of COSI p-type Cross-strip HPGe Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to understand the effects of a space radiation environment on cross-strip germanium detectors, we investigated the effects of high-energy proton damage on a COSI detector and the capabilities of high-temperature annealing in repairing detector spectral resolution. We irradiated a COSI-balloon cross-strip high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector with 150 MeV protons resulting in a net fluence of $4.95\times10^8$ p$^+$/cm$^2$ and corresponding to ~10 years in COSI's space radiation environment. We repaired the resulting degradation in spectral resolution through a series of high-temperature anneals to obtain a final FWHM of 4.08 keV, within 37% of its preradiation value (2.98 keV FWHM). We characterized the repair of charge traps with time spent under high-temperature anneal to inform an annealing procedure for long-term maintenance of COSI's spectral resolution.</description>

      <title>Right-handed weak currents in neutrinoless $\beta \beta $ decays and ton scale $\beta\beta$ detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Right handed weak-currents (RHCs) in the left-right (L-R) symmetric model for neutrinoless double beta decays (DBDs) of both the $0^+~\to~0^+$ and $0^+~\to~2^+$ transitions are discussed from both theoretical and experimental view points. $&lt;\lambda&gt;$ and $&lt;\eta&gt;$-terms are related by $&lt;\lambda&gt;/&lt;\eta&gt; \approx \tan\beta$, which is constrained in the regions of $1-60$ for SUSY grand unified theories (GUTs) and of $1-165$ for non-SUSY GUTs. The enhancement mechanisms of the $&lt;\eta&gt;$ term over the $&lt;\lambda&gt;$ term in the $0^+$ transition are shown, and the $\Delta$ isobar contribution to the NME for the transition to the 2$^+$ state is found to be of the order of $20\%$ of the NME with the quenched weak coupling. The new and interesting RHC regions of $&lt;\lambda&gt;\approx 5\times10^{-8}$ and $&lt;\eta&gt;\approx 1.5\times 10^{-10}$ are shown to be exclusively explored by measuring both the $\beta\beta $ and $\gamma$ rays associated with the ground and excited DBDs by means of the ton-scale DBD detectors for the IH (inverted hierarchy) $\nu$-masses. The actual RHCs to be studied depend on the RHC NMEs.</description>

      <title>Maintaining a Resonance Condition of an RF Spin Rotator Through a Feedback Loop in a Storage Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the successful application of a phase-lock feedback system to maintain the resonance condition of a radio frequency (rf) spin rotator (specifically, an rf Wien filter) with respect to a 120 kHz spin precession in the Cooler Synchrotron (COSY) storage ring. Real-time monitoring of the spin precession and the rf Wien filter signal allows the relative phase between the two to be stabilized at an arbitrary setpoint. The feedback system compensates for deviations in the relative phase by adjusting the frequency and/or phase as needed. With this method, a variation in phase relative to the demand phase with a standard deviation of $\sigma_{\Delta\varphi}\approx 0.2\mathrm{rad}$ could be achieved. The system was implemented in two runs aiming at a first direct measurement of the deuteron electric dipole moment in 2018 and 2021. In addition, the difference between a single-bunch beam affected by the spin rotator and a two-bunch system in which only one bunch is exposed to the spin rotator fields is discussed. Both methods have been used during these beam times. The ability to keep the spin precession and the rf fields synchronized is also crucial for future investigations of electric dipole moments of charged particles using storage rings.</description>
