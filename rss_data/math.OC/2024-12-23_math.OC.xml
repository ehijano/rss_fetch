      <title>Battery swapping station location for electric vehicles: a simulation optimization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles face significant energy supply challenges due to long charging times and congestion at charging stations. Battery swapping stations (BSSs) offer a faster alternative for energy replenishment, but their deployment costs are considerably higher than those of charging stations. As a result, selecting optimal locations for BSSs is crucial to improve their accessibility and utilization. Most existing studies model the BSS location problem using deterministic and static approaches, often overlooking the impact of stochastic and dynamic factors on solution quality. This paper addresses the facility location problem for BSSs within a city network, considering stochastic battery swapping demand. The objective is to optimize the placement of a given set of BSSs to minimize demand loss. To achieve this, we first develop a mathematical programming model for the problem. Then, we propose a simulation optimization method based on a large neighborhood search framework to handle large-scale instances. To reduce the computational cost of simulations, Bayesian optimization is employed to solve the single-station allocation subproblem during the repair process. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach and highlight the importance of incorporating dynamic factors in decision-making.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-loop Energy and Thermal Management for Electric Racing Cars through Optimization-based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an energy and thermal management system for electric race cars, where we tune a lift-off-throttle signal for the driver in real-time to respect energy budgets and thermal constraints. First, we compute the globally optimal state trajectories in a real-time capable solving time, optimizing a 47-kilometer horizon in 2.5 seconds. Next, for safe operation with a human driver, we simplify it to a maximum-power-or-coast operation in full-throttle regions (straights). Thereby, both the positions from which the vehicle should start coasting and the optimal throttle map are subject to tuning. To this end, we define the coasting sections with a threshold on the co-state trajectory of the kinetic energy from the optimal solution. We devise an online implementable bisection algorithm to tune this threshold and adapt it using PI feedback. Finally, we validate the proposed approach for an electric endurance race car and compare three variants with varying implementation challenges: one re-optimizing and updating the kinetic co-state trajectory online, one applying only the bisection algorithm online, and one relying exclusively on feedback control. Our results show that, under typical racing disturbances, our energy management can achieve stint times ranging from less than 0.056\% to 0.22\% slower compared to offline optimization with a priori knowledge of disturbances, paving the way for on-board implementations and testing.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Regret Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider decision-making problems involving the optimization of linear objective functions with uncertain coefficients. The probability distribution of the coefficients--which are assumed to be stochastic in nature--is unknown to the decision maker but is assumed to lie within a given ambiguity set, defined as a type-1 Wasserstein ball centered at a given nominal distribution. To account for this uncertainty, we minimize the worst-case expected regret over all distributions in the ambiguity set. Here, the (ex post) regret experienced by the decision maker is defined as the difference between the cost incurred by a chosen decision given a particular realization of the objective coefficients and the minimum achievable cost with perfect knowledge of the coefficients at the outset. For this class of ambiguity sets, the worst-case expected regret is shown to equal the expected regret under the nominal distribution plus a regularization term that has the effect of drawing optimal solutions toward the "center" of the feasible region as the radius of the ambiguity set increases. This novel form of regularization is also shown to arise when minimizing the worst-case conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of regret. We show that, under certain conditions, distributionally robust regret minimization problems over type-1 Wasserstein balls can be recast as tractable finite-dimensional convex programs.</description>

      <title>De-singularity Subgradient for the $q$-th-Powered $\ell_p$-Norm Weber Location Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weber location problem is widely used in several artificial intelligence scenarios. However, the gradient of the objective does not exist at a considerable set of singular points. Recently, a de-singularity subgradient method has been proposed to fix this problem, but it can only handle the $q$-th-powered $\ell_2$-norm case ($1\leqslant q&lt;2$), which has only finite singular points. In this paper, we further establish the de-singularity subgradient for the $q$-th-powered $\ell_p$-norm case with $1\leqslant q\leqslant p$ and $1\leqslant p&lt;2$, which includes all the rest unsolved situations in this problem. This is a challenging task because the singular set is a continuum. The geometry of the objective function is also complicated so that the characterizations of the subgradients, minimum and descent direction are very difficult. We develop a $q$-th-powered $\ell_p$-norm Weiszfeld Algorithm without Singularity ($q$P$p$NWAWS) for this problem, which ensures convergence and the descent property of the objective function. Extensive experiments on six real-world data sets demonstrate that $q$P$p$NWAWS successfully solves the singularity problem and achieves a linear computational convergence rate in practical scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Digital transformation acts as a main factor in the development and competitiveness of Japanese companies. In this context, the digital copy management algorithm based on the P2M (Project to Method) method plays a significant role in increasing efficiency and reducing costs through the implementation of digital technologies.

      <title>Classical Combinatorial Optimization Scaling for Random Ising Models on 2D Heavy-Hex Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by near term quantum computing hardware limitations, combinatorial optimization problems that can be addressed by current quantum algorithms and noisy hardware with little or no overhead are used to probe capabilities of quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this study, a specific class of near term quantum computing hardware defined combinatorial optimization problems, Ising models on heavy-hex graphs both with and without geometrically local cubic terms, are examined for their classical computational hardness via empirical computation time scaling quantification. Specifically the Time-to-Solution metric using the classical heuristic simulated annealing is measured for finding optimal variable assignments (ground states), as well as the time required for the optimization software Gurobi to find an optimal variable assignment. Because of the sparsity of these Ising models, the classical algorithms are able to find optimal solutions efficiently even for large instances (i.e. $100,000$ variables). The Ising models both with and without geometrically local cubic terms exhibit average-case linear-time or weakly quadratic scaling when solved exactly using Gurobi, and the Ising models with no cubic terms show evidence of exponential-time Time-to-Solution scaling when sampled using simulated annealing. These findings point to the necessity of developing and testing more complex, namely more densely connected, optimization problems in order for quantum computing to ever have a practical advantage over classical computing. Our results are another illustration that different classical algorithms can indeed have exponentially different running times, thus making the identification of the best practical classical technique important in any quantum computing vs. classical computing comparison.</description>

      <title>Robust Dynamic Edge Service Placement Under Spatio-Temporal Correlated Demand Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge computing allows Service Providers (SPs) to enhance user experience by placing their services closer to the network edge. Determining the optimal provisioning of edge resources to meet the varying and uncertain demand cost-effectively is a critical task for SPs. This paper introduces a novel two-stage multi-period robust model for edge service placement and workload allocation, aiming to minimize the SP's operating costs while ensuring service quality. The salient feature of this model lies in its ability to enable SPs to utilize dynamic service placement and leverage spatio-temporal correlation in demand uncertainties to mitigate the inherent conservatism of robust solutions. In our model, resource reservation is optimized in the initial stage, preemptively, before the actual demand is disclosed, whereas dynamic service placement and workload allocation are determined in the subsequent stage, following the revelation of uncertainties. To address the challenges posed by integer recourse variables in the second stage of the resulting tri-level adjustable robust optimization problem, we propose a novel iterative, decomposition-based approach, ensuring finite convergence to an exact optimal solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model and approach.</description>

      <title>On the optimal growth of autocatalytic subnetworks: A Mathematical Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are essential for modeling and analyzing complex systems across fields, from biochemistry to economics. Autocatalytic reaction network -- networks where certain species catalyze their own production -- are particularly significant for understanding self-replication dynamics in biological systems and serve as foundational elements in formalizing the concept of a circular economy. In a previous study, we developed a mixed-integer linear optimization-based procedure to enumerate all minimal autocatalytic subnetworks within a network. In this work, we define the maximum growth factor (MGF) of an autocatalytic subnetwork, develop mathematical optimization approaches to compute this metric, and explore its implications in the field of economics and dynamical systems. We develop exact approaches to determine the MGF of any subnetwork based on an iterative procedure with guaranteed convergence, which allows for identifying autocatalytic subnetworks with the highest MGF. We report the results of computational experiments on synthetic CRNs and two well-known datasets, namely the Formose and E. coli reaction networks, identifying their autocatalytic subnetworks and exploring their scientific ramifications. Using advanced optimization techniques and interdisciplinary applications, our framework adds an essential resource to analyze complex systems modeled as reaction networks.</description>

      <title>A Cahn--Hilliard--Willmore phase field model for non-oriented interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a new phase field model for representing non-oriented interfaces, approximating their area and simulating their area-minimizing flow. Our contribution is related to the approach proposed in arXiv:2105.09627 that involves ad hoc neural networks. We show here that, instead of neural networks, similar results can be obtained using a more standard variational approach that combines a Cahn-Hilliard-type functional involving an appropriate non-smooth potential and a Willmore-type stabilization energy. We show some properties of this phase field model in dimension $1$ and, for radially symmetric functions, in arbitrary dimension. We propose a simple numerical scheme to approximate its $L^2$-gradient flow. We illustrate numerically that the new flow approximates fairly well the mean curvature flow of codimension $1$ or $2$ interfaces in dimensions $2$ and $3$.</description>

      <title>Proximity-based approximation algorithms for integer bilevel programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We primarily consider bilevel programs where the lower level is a convex quadratic minimization problem under integer constraints. We show that it is $\Sigma_2^p$-hard to decide if the optimal objective for the leader is lesser than a given value. Following that, we consider a natural algorithm for bilevel programs that is used as a heuristic in practice. Using a result on proximity in convex quadratic minimization, we show that this algorithm provides an additive approximation to the optimal objective value of the leader. The additive constant of approximation depends on the flatness constant corresponding to the dimensionality of the follower's decision space and the condition number of the matrix $Q$ defining the quadratic term in the follower's objective function. We show computational evidence indicating the speed advantage as well as that the solution quality guarantee is much better than the worst-case bounds. We extend these results to the case where the follower solves an integer linear program, with an objective perfectly misaligned with that of the leader. Using integer programming proximity, we show that a similar algorithm, used as a heuristic in the literature, provides additive approximation guarantees.</description>

      <title>A quantum dual logarithmic barrier method for linear optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to speed up some optimization methods. One can use quantum computers to solve linear systems via Quantum Linear System Algorithms (QLSAs). QLSAs can be used as a subroutine for algorithms that require solving linear systems, such as the dual logarithmic barrier method (DLBM) for solving linear optimization (LO) problems. In this paper, we use a QLSA to solve the linear systems arising in each iteration of the DLBM. To use the QLSA in a hybrid setting, we read out quantum states via a tomography procedure which introduces considerable error and noise. Thus, this paper first proposes an inexact-feasible variant of DLBM for LO problems and then extends it to a quantum version. Our quantum approach has quadratic convergence toward the central path with inexact directions and we show that this method has the best-known $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n} \log (n \mu_0 /\zeta))$ iteration complexity, where $n$ is the number of variables, $\mu_0$ is the initial duality gap, and $\zeta$ is the desired accuracy. We further use iterative refinement to improve the time complexity dependence on accuracy. For LO problems with quadratically more constraints than variables, the quantum complexity of our method has a sublinear dependence on dimension.</description>

      <title>Examining Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport and Sinkhorn Divergences for Spatial Forecast Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimal transport (OT) problem seeks to find the cheapest mapping between two distributions with equal total density, given the cost of transporting density from one place to another. Unbalanced OT allows for different total density in each distribution. This is the typical setting for precipitation forecast and observation data, when considering the densities as accumulated rainfall, or intensity. In this work, entropic unbalanced OT and its associated Sinkhorn divergence are examined as a spatial forecast verification method for precipitation data. It offers many attractive features, such as morphing one field into another, defining a distance between fields and providing feature based optimal assignment. It is found that the Sinkhorn divergence is robust against the common double penalty problem (a form of phase error), aligns with expert assessments of model performance, and allows for a variety of novel pictorial illustrations of error. It provides informative summary scores, and has few limitations to its application. Combined, these findings place unbalanced entropy regularised optimal transport and the Sinkhorn divergence as an informative method which follows geometric intuition.</description>

      <title>The monopolist's free boundary problem in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Monopolist's problem with a focus on the free boundary separating bunched from unbunched consumers, especially in the plane, and give a full description of its solution for the family of square domains $\{(a,a+1)^2\}_{a \ge 0}$. The Monopolist's problem is fundamental in economics, yet widely considered analytically intractable when both consumers and products have more than one degree of heterogeneity. Mathematically, the problem is to minimize a smooth, uniformly convex Lagrangian over the space of nonnegative convex functions. What results is a free boundary problem between the regions of strict and nonstrict convexity. Our work is divided into three parts: a study of the structure of the free boundary problem on convex domains in ${\mathbf R}^n$ showing that the product allocation map remains Lipschitz up to most of the fixed boundary and that each bunch extends to this boundary; a proof in ${\mathbf R}^2$ that the interior free boundary can only fail to be smooth in one of four specific ways (cusp, high frequency oscillations, stray bunch, nontranversal bunch); and, finally, the first complete solution to Rochet and Chon\'e's example on the family of squares $\Omega = (a,a+1)^2$, where we discover bifurcations first to targeted and then to blunt bunching as the distance $a \ge 0$ to the origin is increased. We use techniques from the study of the Monge--Amp\'ere equation, the obstacle problem, and localization for measures in convex-order.</description>

      <title>Debiasing of Two-Line Element Sets for Batch Least Squares Pseudo-Orbit Determination in MEO and GEO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of accurate and timely state predictions for objects in near-Earth orbits is becoming increasingly important due to the growing congestion in key orbital regimes. The Two-line Element Set (TLE) catalogue remains, to this day, one of the few publicly-available, comprehensive sources of near-Earth object ephemerides. At the same time, TLEs are affected by measurement noise and are limited by the low accuracy of the SGP4 theory, introducing significant uncertainty into state predictions. Previous literature has shown that filtering TLEs with batch least squares methods can yield significant improvements in long-term state prediction accuracy. However, this process can be highly sensitive to TLE quality which can vary throughout the year. In this study, it is shown that either extended-duration fit windows of the order of months, or the removal of systematic biases in along-track position prior to state estimation can produce significant reductions in post-fit position errors. Simple models for estimating these systematic biases are shown to be effective without introducing the need for high-complexity Machine Learning (ML) models. Furthermore, by establishing a TLE-based error metric, the need for high accuracy ephemerides is removed when creating these models. For selected satellites in the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) regime, post-fit position errors are reduced by up to 80 %, from approximately 5 km to 1 km; meanwhile, for selected satellites in the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)/Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GSO) regime, large oscillations in post-fit position error can be suppressed.</description>

      <title>Tutorial Problems for Nonsmooth Dynamics and Optimal Control: Ski Jumping and Accelerating a Bike Without Pedaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonsmooth phenomena, such as abrupt changes, impacts, and switching behaviors, frequently arise in real-world systems and present significant challenges for traditional optimal control methods, which typically assume smoothness and differentiability. These phenomena introduce numerical challenges in both simulation and optimization, highlighting the need for specialized solution methods. Although various applications and test problems have been documented in the literature, many are either overly simplified, excessively complex, or narrowly focused on specific domains. On this canvas, this paper proposes two novel tutorial problems that are both conceptually accessible and allow for further scaling of problem difficulty. The first problem features a simple ski jump model, characterized by state-dependent jumps and sliding motion on impact surfaces. This system does not involve control inputs and serves as a testbed for simulating nonsmooth dynamics. The second problem considers optimal control of a special type of bicycle model. This problem is inspired by practical techniques observed in BMX riding and mountain biking, where riders accelerate their bike without pedaling by strategically shifting their center of mass in response to the track's slope.</description>

      <title>SUBMASSIVE: Resolving Subclass Cycles in Very Large Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large knowledge graphs capture information of a large number of entities and their relations. Among the many relations they capture, class subsumption assertions are usually present and expressed using the \texttt{rdfs:subClassOf} construct. From our examination, publicly available knowledge graphs contain many potentially erroneous cyclic subclass relations, a problem that can be exacerbated when different knowledge graphs are integrated as Linked Open Data. In this paper, we present an automatic approach for resolving such cycles at scale using automated reasoning by encoding the problem of cycle-resolving to a MAXSAT solver. The approach is tested on the LOD-a-lot dataset, and compared against a semi-automatic version of our algorithm. We show how the number of removed triples is a trade-off against the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Uniform Stability for Non-Euclidean Empirical Risk Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study first-order algorithms that are uniformly stable for empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems that are convex and smooth with respect to $p$-norms, $p \geq 1$. We propose a black-box reduction method that, by employing properties of uniformly convex regularizers, turns an optimization algorithm for H\"older smooth convex losses into a uniformly stable learning algorithm with optimal statistical risk bounds on the excess risk, up to a constant factor depending on $p$. Achieving a black-box reduction for uniform stability was posed as an open question by (Attia and Koren, 2022), which had solved the Euclidean case $p=2$. We explore applications that leverage non-Euclidean geometry in addressing binary classification problems.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Beyond Diagonal RIS: A Universal Framework Applicable to Arbitrary Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a promising technology for future wireless communication systems due to their ability to control the propagation environment in a hardware- and energy-efficient way. Recently, the concept of RISs has been extended to beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs), which unlock the full potential of RISs thanks to the presence of tunable interconnections between RIS elements. While various algorithms have been proposed for specific BD-RIS architectures, a universal optimization framework applicable to arbitrary architectures is still lacking. In this paper, we bridge this research gap by proposing an architecture-independent framework for BD-RIS optimization, with the main focus on sum-rate maximization and transmit power minimization in multiuser multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems. Specifically, we first incorporate BD-RIS architectures into the models by connecting the scattering matrix with the admittance matrix and introducing appropriate constraints to the admittance matrix. The formulated problems are then solved by our custom-designed partially proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (pp-ADMM) algorithms. The pp-ADMM algorithms are computationally efficient, with each subproblem either admitting a closed-form solution or being easily solvable. We further explore the extension of the proposed framework to general utility functions and multiuser multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approaches achieve a better trade-off between performance and computational efficiency compared to existing methods. We also compare the performance of various BD-RIS architectures in MU-MISO systems using the proposed approach, which has not been explored before due to the lack of an architecture-independent framework.</description>

Abstract: A measure representation result for a functional modelling optimal design problems for plastic deformations, under linear growth conditions, is obtained.
  Departing from an energy with a bulk term depending on the second gradient, as well as a perimeter term, the functional in question corresponds to the relaxation of this energy with respect to a pair $(\chi,u)$, where $\chi$ is the characteristic function of a set of finite perimeter and $u$ is a function of bounded hessian.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Policy Iteration for Entropy-Regularized Stochastic Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07059v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a general entropy-regularized stochastic control problem on an infinite horizon, we prove that a policy iteration algorithm (PIA) converges to an optimal relaxed control. Contrary to the standard stochastic control literature, classical H\"{o}lder estimates of value functions do not ensure the convergence of the PIA, due to the added entropy-regularizing term. To circumvent this, we carry out a delicate estimation by moving back and forth between appropriate H\"{o}lder and Sobolev spaces. This requires new Sobolev estimates designed specifically for the purpose of policy iteration and a nontrivial technique to contain the entropy growth. Ultimately, we obtain a uniform H\"{o}lder bound for the sequence of value functions generated by the PIA, thereby achieving the desired convergence result. Characterization of the optimal value function as the unique solution to an exploratory Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation comes as a by-product. The PIA is numerically implemented in an example of optimal consumption.</description>

      <title>Descent Methods for Vector Optimization Problems: A Majorization-Minimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a unified framework and convergence analysis of first-order methods for vector optimization problems (VOPs) from a majorization-minimization perspective. By selecting different surrogate functions, the general method can be reduced to various existing first-order methods, both with and without line search. Our unified convergence analysis reveals that the slow convergence of the steepest descent method is primarily attributed to the significant gap between the surrogate and objective functions. Consequently, narrowing this surrogate gap can enhance the performance of first-order methods. Interestingly, we elucidate that selecting a tighter surrogate function is equivalent to using an appropriate base of the dual cone in the direction-finding subproblem. Building on this insight, we employ the Barzilai-Borwein method to narrow the surrogate gap and propose a Barzilai-Borwein descent method for VOPs (BBDVO) with polyhedral cones. By reformulating the subproblem, we provide a novel perspective on the Barzilai-Borwein descent method, bridging the gap between this method and the steepest descent method. Furthermore, by selecting an appropriate base and reformulating the subproblem in the Newton method, we also provide a novel perspective on the preconditioned Barzilai-Borwein method. Finally, several numerical experiments are presented to validate the efficiency of the BBDVO.</description>

      <title>Martingale deep learning for very high dimensional quasi-linear partial differential equations and stochastic optimal controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14395v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a highly parallel and derivative-free martingale neural network learning method is proposed to solve Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations arising from stochastic optimal control problems (SOCPs), as well as general quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In both cases, the PDEs are reformulated into a martingale formulation such that loss functions will not require the computation of the gradient or Hessian matrix of the PDE solution, while its implementation can be parallelized in both time and spatial domains. Moreover, the martingale conditions for the PDEs are enforced using a Galerkin method in conjunction with adversarial learning techniques, eliminating the need for direct computation of the conditional expectations associated with the martingale property. For SOCPs, a derivative-free implementation of the maximum principle for optimal controls is also introduced. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, which is capable of solving HJB and quasilinear parabolic PDEs accurately in dimensions as high as 10,000.</description>

      <title>Better bounds on Grothendieck constants of finite orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grothendieck constants $K_G(d)$ bound the advantage of $d$-dimensional strategies over $1$-dimensional ones in a specific optimisation task. They have applications ranging from approximation algorithms to quantum nonlocality. However, apart from $d=2$, their values are unknown. Here, we exploit a recent Frank-Wolfe approach to provide good candidates for lower bounding some of these constants. The complete proof relies on solving difficult binary quadratic optimisation problems. For $d\in\{3,4,5\}$, we construct specific rectangular instances that we can solve to certify better bounds than those previously known; by monotonicity, our lower bounds improve on the state of the art for $d\leqslant9$. For $d\in\{4,7,8\}$, we exploit elegant structures to build highly symmetric instances achieving even greater bounds; however, we can only solve them heuristically. We also recall the standard relation with violations of Bell inequalities and elaborate on it to interpret generalised Grothendieck constants $K_G(d\mapsto2)$ as the advantage of complex quantum mechanics over real quantum mechanics. Motivated by this connection, we also improve the bounds on $K_G(d\mapsto2)$.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Newton Dynamics for Neural Networks: A Riemannian Optimization Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of Gauss-Newton dynamics for training neural networks with smooth activation functions. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional, smooth, embedded submanifold of the Euclidean output space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we prove \emph{last-iterate} convergence of the Riemannian gradient flow to the optimal in-class predictor at an \emph{exponential rate} that is independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix, \emph{without} requiring explicit regularization. We further characterize the critical impacts of the neural network scaling factor and the initialization on the convergence behavior. In the overparameterized regime, we show that the Levenberg-Marquardt dynamics with an appropriately chosen damping factor yields robustness to ill-conditioned kernels, analogous to the underparameterized regime. These findings demonstrate the potential of Gauss-Newton methods for efficiently optimizing neural networks, particularly in ill-conditioned problems where kernel and Gram matrices have small singular values.</description>

      <title>On Generalization and Regularization via Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has gained prominence in operations research and machine learning as a powerful method for achieving solutions with favorable out-of-sample performance. Two compelling explanations for its success are the generalization bounds derived from Wasserstein DRO and its equivalence to regularization schemes commonly used in machine learning. However, existing results on generalization bounds and regularization equivalence are largely limited to settings where the Wasserstein ball is of a specific type, and the decision criterion takes certain forms of expected functions. In this paper, we show that generalization bounds and regularization equivalence can be obtained in a significantly broader setting, where the Wasserstein ball is of a general type and the decision criterion accommodates any form, including general risk measures. This not only addresses important machine learning and operations management applications but also expands to general decision-theoretical frameworks previously unaddressed by Wasserstein DRO. Our results are strong in that the generalization bounds do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the equivalency to regularization is exact. As a by-product, we show that Wasserstein DRO coincides with the recent max-sliced Wasserstein DRO for {\it any} decision criterion under affine decision rules -- resulting in both being efficiently solvable as convex programs via our general regularization results. These general assurances provide a strong foundation for expanding the application of Wasserstein DRO across diverse domains of data-driven decision problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of the dynamical optimal transport problem in which the energy to be minimised is modulated by the covariance matrix of the distribution. Such transport metrics arise naturally in mean-field limits of certain ensemble Kalman methods for solving inverse problems. We show that the transport problem splits into two coupled minimization problems: one for the evolution of mean and covariance of the interpolating curve and one for its shape. The latter consists in minimising the usual Wasserstein length under the constraint of maintaining fixed mean and covariance along the interpolation. We analyse the geometry induced by this modulated transport distance on the space of probabilities as well as the dynamics of the associated gradient flows. Those show better convergence properties in comparison to the classical Wasserstein metric in terms of exponential convergence rates independent of the Gaussian target. On the level of the gradient flows a similar splitting into the evolution of moments and shapes of the distribution can be observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a continuous-time contracting model that extends the problem introduced by Sannikov and later rigorously analysed by Possama\"{i} and Touzi. In our model, a principal hires a risk-averse agent to carry out a project. Specifically, the agent can perform two different tasks, namely to increase the instantaneous growth rate of the project's value, and to reduce the likelihood of accidents occurring. In order to compensate for these costly actions, the principal offers a continuous stream of payments throughout the entire duration of a contract, which concludes at a random time, potentially resulting in a lump-sum payment. We examine the consequences stemming from the introduction of accidents, modelled by a compound Poisson process that negatively impact the project's value. Furthermore, we investigate whether certain economic scenarii are still characterised by a golden parachute as in Sannikov's model. A golden parachute refers to a situation where the agent stops working and subsequently receives a compensation, which may be either a lump-sum payment leading to termination of the contract or a continuous stream of payments, thereby corresponding to a pension.</description>

Abstract: The critical length phenomenon of the Korteweg-de Vries equation is well known, however, in higher dimensions, it is unknown. This work explores this property in the context of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, a two-dimensional generalization of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Specifically, we demonstrate observability inequalities for this equation, which allow us to deduce the exact boundary controllability and boundary exponential stabilization of the linear system, provided the spatial domain length avoids certain specific values, which is a direct consequence of the Paley-Wiener theorem. To the best of our knowledge, our work introduces new results by identifying a set of critical lengths for the two-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation.</description>
