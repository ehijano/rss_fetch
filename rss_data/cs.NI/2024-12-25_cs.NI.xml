      <title>UAV Communications: Impact of Obstacles on Channel Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized as effective platforms for carrying Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base Stations (BSs), enabling low-cost, agile, and flexible wireless networks with high Quality of Service (QoS). The next generation of wireless communications will rely on increasingly higher frequencies, which are easily obstructed by obstacles. One of the most critical concepts yet to be fully addressed is positioning the UAV at optimal coordinates while accounting for obstacles. To ensure a line of sight (LoS) between UAVs and user equipment (UE), improve QoS, and establish reliable wireless links with maximum coverage, obstacles must be integrated into the proposed placement algorithms. This paper introduces a simulation-based measurement approach for characterizing an air-to-ground (AG) channel in a simple scenario. By considering obstacles, we present a novel perspective on channel characterization. The results, in terms of throughput, packet delivery, packet loss, and delay, are compared using the proposed positioning approach.</description>

      <title>Towards Cognitive Service Delivery on B5G through AIaaS Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is pivotal in advancing mobile network systems by facilitating smart capabilities and automation. The transition from 4G to 5G has substantial implications for AI in consolidating a network predominantly geared towards business verticals. In this context, 3GPP has specified and introduced the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) entity at the network's core to provide insights based on AI algorithms to benefit network orchestration. This paper proposes a framework for evolving NWDAF that presents the interfaces necessary to further empower the core network with AI capabilities B5G and 6G. In addition, we identify a set of research directions for realizing a distributed e-NWDAF.</description>

      <title>Adapting Large Language Models for Improving TCP Fairness over WiFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new transmission control protocol (TCP) relies on Deep Learning (DL) for prediction and optimization, but requires significant manual effort to design deep neural networks (DNNs) and struggles with generalization in dynamic environments. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), this study proposes TCP-LLM, a novel framework leveraging LLMs for TCP applications. TCP-LLM utilizes pre-trained knowledge to reduce engineering effort, enhance generalization, and deliver superior performance across diverse TCP tasks. Applied to reducing flow unfairness, adapting congestion control, and preventing starvation, TCP-LLM demonstrates significant improvements over TCP with minimal fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale IPv6-Based Measurement of the Starlink Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks have attracted considerable attention for their ability to deliver global, low-latency broadband Internet services. In this paper, we present a large-scale measurement study of the Starlink network, the largest LEO satellite constellation to date. We begin by proposing an efficient method for discovering active Starlink user routers, identifying approximately 3.2 million IPv6 addresses across 102 countries and 123 regions-representing, to the best of our knowledge, the most complete list of Starlink user routers' active IPv6 addresses. Based on the discovered user routers, we map the Starlink backbone network, which consists of 33 Points of Presence (PoPs) and 70 connections between them. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed statistical analysis of active Starlink users and PoPs. Finally, we summarize the IPv6 address assignment strategy adopted by the Starlink network. The dataset of the backbone network is publicly available at https://ki3.org.cn/#/starlink-network.</description>

      <title>TPAoI: Ensuring Fresh Service Status at the Network Edge in Compute-First Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In compute-first networking, maintaining fresh and accurate status information at the network edge is crucial for effective access to remote services. This process typically involves three phases: Status updating, user accessing, and user requesting. However, current studies on status effectiveness, such as Age of Information at Query (QAoI), do not comprehensively cover all these phases. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel metric, TPAoI, aimed at optimizing update decisions by measuring the freshness of service status. The stochastic nature of edge environments, characterized by unpredictable communication delays in updating, requesting, and user access times, poses a significant challenge when modeling. To address this, we model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) algorithm for optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TPAoI metric effectively minimizes AoI, ensuring timely and reliable service updates in dynamic edge environments. Results indicate that TPAoI reduces AoI by an average of 47\% compared to QAoI metrics and decreases update frequency by an average of 48\% relative to conventional AoI metrics, showing significant improvement.</description>

      <title>NetScaNDN: A Scalable and Flexible Testbed To Evaluate NDN on Multiple Infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution from traditional IP-based networking to Named Data Networking (NDN) represents a paradigm shift to address the inherent limitations of current network architectures, such as scalability, mobility, and efficient data distribution. NDN introduces an information-centric approach where data is identified and retrieved based on names rather than locations, offering more efficient data dissemination and enhanced security. However, the transition to NDN, alongside the need to integrate it with existing IP infrastructures, necessitates the development of flexible and scalable testbeds that support diverse experimental scenarios across various physical media and networking protocol stacks.
  In this paper, we present NetScaNDN, a scalable, flexible, and plug-and-play testbed designed to facilitate such experiments. NetScaNDNl employs an automated process for node discovery, configuration, and installation, enabling seamless setup and execution of experiments on both wired and wireless infrastructures simultaneously. Additionally, it incorporates a central log repository using the syslog protocol, allowing comprehensive measurement and evaluation of user-defined metrics across different network layers. NetScaNDN offers a robust platform for researchers to explore and validate various networking scenarios, advancing the study of IP and NDN-based applications.</description>

      <title>Development and Application of a Decentralized Domain Name Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.</description>

      <title>Space-time Peer-to-Peer Distribution of Multi-party Entanglement for Any Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph states are a class of important multiparty entangled states, of which bell pairs are the special case. Realizing a robust and fast distribution of arbitrary graph states in the downstream layer of the quantum network can be essential for further large-scale quantum networks. We propose a novel quantum network protocol called P2PGSD inspired by the classical Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network to efficiently implement the general graph state distribution in the network layer, which demonstrates advantages in resource efficiency and scalability over existing methods for sparse graph states. An explicit mathematical model for a general graph state distribution problem has also been constructed, above which the intractability for a wide class of resource minimization problems is proved and the optimality of the existing algorithms is discussed. In addition, we leverage the spacetime quantum network inspired by the symmetry from relativity for memory management in network problems and used it to improve our proposed algorithm. The advantages of our protocols are confirmed by numerical simulations showing an improvement of up to 50% for general sparse graph states, paving the way for a resource-efficient multiparty entanglement distribution across any network topology.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Design for Continual Learning in IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a new online learning technique over sequentially generated streaming data from different tasks, aiming to maintain a small forgetting loss on previously-learned tasks. Existing work focuses on reducing the forgetting loss under a given task sequence. However, if similar tasks continuously appear to the end time, the forgetting loss is still huge on prior distinct tasks. In practical IoT networks, an autonomous vehicle to sample data and learn different tasks can route and alter the order of task pattern at increased travelling cost. To our best knowledge, we are the first to study how to opportunistically route the testing object and alter the task sequence in CL. We formulate a new optimization problem and prove it NP-hard. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm to achieve approximation ratios of $\frac{3}{2}$ for underparameterized case and $\frac{3}{2} + r^{1-T}$ for overparameterized case, respectively, where $r:=1-\frac{n}{m}$ is a parameter of feature number $m$ and sample number $n$ and $T$ is the task number. Simulation results verify our algorithm's close-to-optimum performance.</description>
