      <title>Transporting Baguettes With Minimal Action: The Geometry of Optimal Nonequilibrium Processes in Stochastic Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What are the fundamental limitations placed by the laws of thermodynamics on the energy expenditure needed to carry out a given task in a nonequilibrium environment in finite time? In this thesis, we investigate "optimal nonequilibrium processes": how nonequilibrium state changes in a thermodynamic system may be performed most efficiently, in the sense of requiring the least amount of thermodynamic work. Surprisingly, there is a hidden, fundamental geometric structure in this optimization problem that is related to the mathematics of optimal transport theory: how to optimally send, e.g., baguettes from bakeries to caf\'es, given supply and demand constraints, that requires the least amount of total distance traveled by the baguettes. After giving a brief overview on the mathematical framework of stochastic thermodynamics for the overdamped Langevin equation, we present a trio of works: (1) applying optimal control theory to the Fokker-Planck equation to calculate exact optimal protocols for low-dimensional systems, which reproduces the intriguing previously-discovered discontinuities in globally optimal protocols and reveals new non-monotonic optimal protocols for a certain system; (2) exploiting the importance sampling of Langevin trajectories under different protocols, to adaptively optimize protocols by controlling the thermodynamic state trajectory, which is useful for efficiently calculating free energy differences between different Hamiltonians; and finally, (3) deriving an exact geometric description of optimal nonequilibrium processes and a geodesic-counterdiabatic decomposition for the optimal protocols that enact them, which satisfyingly explains the highly non-intuitive properties of discontinuities and possible non-monotonicity in globally optimal protocols.</description>

      <title>Symmetric L\'evy flights in semi-infinite domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symmetric L\'evy flights in a semi-infinite domain $[0,\infty)$ with a reflecting and absorbing boundary at 0. To this end, we use the fractional differential equation that governs the L\'evy process. Incorporating the boundary conditions in L\'evy flights has been an open and tricky question, as the long jumps can lead to the L\'evy flights leaping over the boundary. We, for the first time, incorporate reflecting and absorbing boundary conditions for L\'evy flights and solve the fractional differential equation analytically to find the probability densities. Monte Carlo simulations are also performed for both boundary conditions to verify the results. Analytical and simulation results perfectly coincide for the reflecting boundary condition and, for the absorbing boundary condition, they coincide for the large abscissa values.</description>

      <title>Novel Market Temperature Definition Through Fluctuation Theorem: A Statistical Physics Framework for Financial Crisis Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to financial crisis prediction by establishing a thermodynamic-like framework derived from the fluctuation theorem of statistical physics. We define market temperature through the probability ratio of positive to negative returns and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying market states and predicting potential crises. Our empirical analysis spans nine major global indices from 2005 to 2025, revealing statistically significant differences in temperature dynamics between crisis and non-crisis periods. Most notably, we discover a counterintuitive relationship between market temperature stability and crisis occurrence: crises tend to emerge more frequently during periods of apparent temperature stability rather than instability. This finding suggests that unusually stable periods in market temperature might signal the accumulation of systemic risks, similar to the calm before a storm in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Efficient Sampling of Three-Dimensional Spin Glasses and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling the three-dimensional (3D) spin glass -- i.e., generating equilibrium configurations of a 3D lattice with quenched random couplings -- is widely regarded as one of the central and long-standing open problems in statistical physics. The rugged energy landscape, pronounced critical slowing down, and intrinsic ergodicity breaking render standard Monte Carlo methods severely inefficient, particularly for large systems at low temperatures. In this work, we introduce the Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TNMCMC) approach to address the issue. It generates large-scale collective updates in MCMC using tensor networks on the 2D slices of the 3D lattice, greatly improving the autocorrelation time and offering orders-of-magnitude speed-ups over conventional MCMC in generating unbiased samples of the Boltzmann distribution. We conduct numerical experiments on 3D spin glasses up to system size $64\times 64\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that TNMCMC dramatically suppresses critical slowing down in large disordered systems, which usually require a supercomputer to perform MCMC simulations. Furthermore, we apply our approach to the 3-state Potts model up to system size $64\times 64\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that the TNMCMC approach efficiently traverses the exponential barriers of the strong first-order transition, whereas conventional MCMC fails. Our results reveal that TNMCMC opens a promising path toward tackling long-standing, formidable three-dimensional problems in statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Stationary densities and delocalized domain walls in asymmetric exclusion processes competing for finite pools of resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the stationary densities and domain walls in the steady states of a pair of asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEPs) antiparallelly coupled to two particle reservoirs without any spatial extent by using the model in Haldar et al, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 111}, 014154 (2025). We show that the model admits {\em delocalized} domain walls which exist for some choices of the model parameters that define the effective entry and exit rates into the TASEP lanes. Surprisingly, in the parameter space spanned by these model parameters, the delocalized domain walls covers an {\em extended} region. The corresponding phase diagrams in the plane of the control parameters have different topology from those for an open TASEP or other models with multiple TASEPs connected to two reservoirs.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional lattice random walks in a Gaussian random potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study random walks evolving in continuous time on a one-dimensional lattice where each site $x$ hosts a quenched random potential $U_x$. The potentials on different sites are independent, identically distributed Gaussian random variables. We analyze three distinct models that specify how the transition rates depend on $U_x$: the random-force-like model, random walks with randomized stepping times, and the Gaussian trap model. Our analysis focuses on five key disorder-dependent quantities defined for a finite chain with $N$ sites: the probability current, its reciprocal (the resistance), the splitting probability, the mean first-passage time $T_N$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_N$ in a periodic chain. By determining the moments of these random variables, we demonstrate that the probability current, resistance, and splitting probability are not self-averaging, which leads to pronounced differences between their average and typical behaviors. In contrast, $T_N$ and $D_N$ become self-averaging when $N \to \infty$, though they exhibit strong sample-to-sample fluctuations for finite $N$.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium statistics of barrier crossings with competing pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological, chemical, and physical systems are underpinned by stochastic transitions between equilibrium states in a potential energy. Here, we consider such transitions in a minimal model with two possible competing pathways, both starting from a local potential energy minimum and eventually finding the global minimum. There is competition between the distance to travel in state space and the height of the potential energy barriers to be surmounted, for the transition to occur. One pathway has a higher energy barrier to go over, but requires traversing a shorter distance, whereas the other pathway has a lower potential barrier but it is substantially further away in configuration space. The most likely pathway taken depends on the available time for the transition process; when only a relatively short time is available, the most likely path is the one over the higher barrier. We find that upon varying temperature the overall most likely pathway can switch from one to the other. We calculate the statistics of where the barrier crossing occurs and the distribution of times taken to reach the potential minimum. Interestingly, while the configuration space statistics is complex, the time of arrival statistics is rather simple, having an exponential probability density over most of the time range. Taken together, our results show that empirically observed rates in nonequilibrium systems should not be used to infer barrier heights.</description>

      <title>Synchronization transitions and spike dynamics in a higher-order Kuramoto model with L\'{e}vy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization in various complex networks is significantly influenced by higher-order interactions combined with non-Gaussian stochastic perturbations, yet their mechanisms remain mainly unclear. In this paper, we systematically investigate the synchronization and spike dynamics in a higher-order Kuramoto model subjected to non-Gaussian L\'{e}vy noise. Using the mean order parameter, mean first-passage time, and basin stability, we identify clear boundaries distingusihing synchronization and incoherent states under different stability indexes and scale parameters of L\'{e}vy noise. For fixed coupling parameters, synchronization weakens as the stability index decreases, and even completely disappears when the scale parameter exceeds a critical threshold. By varying coupling parameters, we find significant dynamical phenomena including bifurcations and hysteresis. L\'{e}vy noise smooths the synchronization transitions and requires stronger coupling compared to Gaussian white noise. Furthermore, we define spikes and systematically investigate their statistical and spectral characteristics. The maximum number of spikes is observed at small scale parameter. A generalized spectral analysis further reveals burst-like structure via an edit distance algorithm. Moreover, a power-law distribution is observed in the large inter-window intervals of spikes, showing great memory effects. These findings deepen the understanding of synchronization and extreme events in complex networks driven by non-Gaussian L\'{e}vy noise.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Inference in Complex Systems: When Stochastic Models Become Indistinguishable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust inference methods are essential for parameter estimation and model selection in stochastic modeling approaches, which provide interpretable frameworks for describing time series of complex phenomena. However, applying such methods is often challenging, as they typically demand either high-frequency observations or access to the model's analytical solution, resources that are rarely available in practice. Here, we address these limitations by designing a novel Monte Carlo method based on full-path statistics and bridge processes, which optimize sampling efforts and performance even under coarse sampling. We systematically investigate how experimental design -- particularly sampling frequency and dataset size -- shapes inference accuracy, revealing optimal sampling regimes and the fundamental limits of model distinguishability. We validate our approach on four datasets -- optical tweezers, human microbiome, topic mentions in social media, and forest population dynamics -- where resolution-dependent limits to inference emerge, offering fresh insight into ongoing debates about the dominant sources of noise in these systems. Overall, this work shows how combining minimal stochastic models with path-inference tools and model selection can guide the experimental design of optimized strategies in data collection and clarify the boundaries of model-based understanding in complex systems.</description>

      <title>A minimal model of self-organized clusters with phase transitions in ecological communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex ecological communities, species may self-organize into clusters or clumps where highly similar species can coexist. The emergence of such species clusters can be captured by the interplay between neutral and niche theories. Based on the generalized Lotka-Volterra model of competition, we propose a minimal model for ecological communities in which the steady states contain self-organized clusters. In this model, species compete only with their neighbors in niche space through a common interaction strength. Unlike many previous theories, this model does not rely on random heterogeneity in interactions. By varying only the interaction strength, we find an exponentially large set of cluster patterns with different sizes and combinations. There are sharp phase transitions into the formation of clusters. There are also multiple phase transitions between different sets of possible cluster patterns, many of which accumulate near a small number of critical points. We analyze such a phase structure using both numerical and analytical methods. In addition, the special case with only nearest neighbor interactions is exactly solvable using the method of transfer matrices from statistical mechanics. We analyze the critical behavior of these systems and make comparisons with existing lattice models.</description>

      <title>Order from chaos with adaptive circuits on quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable quantum devices provide a platform to control the coherent dynamics of quantum wavefunctions. Here we experimentally realize adaptive monitored quantum circuits, which incorporate conditional feedback into non-unitary evolution, to control quantum chaotic dynamics using a combination of local mid-circuit measurements and resets. The experiments are performed with an IBM superconducting quantum processor using up to 100 qubits that samples a quantum version of the classically chaotic Bernoulli map. This map scrambles quantum information, while local measurements and feedback attempt to steer the dynamics toward a state that is a fixed point of the map. This competition drives a dynamical phase transition between quantum and classical dynamics that we observe experimentally and describe theoretically using noisy simulations, matrix product states, and mappings to statistical mechanics models. Estimates of the universal critical properties are obtained to high accuracy on the quantum computer thanks to the large number of qubits utilized in the calculation. By successfully applying up to nearly 5000 entangling gates and 5000 non-unitary mid-circuit operations on systems up to 100 qubits, this experiment serves as a signpost on the route towards fault tolerance.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Optimal Velocity Drag Model for Traffic Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Hybrid Optimal Velocity-Drag (OVD) model that combines the behavioral structure of the classical Optimal Velocity Model (OVM) with a drag-based saturation law motivated by Newtonian mechanics. The model retains the OVM principle that desired speed depends on headway, but replaces the linear relaxation law with a formulation that enforces bounded accelerations and smooth convergence to equilibrium. After reviewing the OVM framework and its stability properties, we introduce the OVD dynamics and derive the dispersion relation from a linear stability analysis of uniform flow. This analysis shows that the OVD formulation preserves the instability mechanisms responsible for stop-and-go waves, while avoiding the unrealistic acceleration predictions of the classical OVM. We also illustrate the model using desired velocity functions of hyperbolic tangent type, a common choice in the OVM literature, and highlight applications to large-scale traffic simulation and empirical data studies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the OVD model enforces bounded accelerations while preserving the nonlinear instabilities of the classical OVM, providing a physically grounded and interpretable foundation for advancing traffic flow research.</description>

      <title>Anti-hyperuniform Critical States of Active Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are fundamental to the collective dynamics of non-equilibrium systems and in active matter, mediating spontaneous flows, dynamic self-organization, and emergent pattern formation. Here, we reveal critical states in active nematics, marked by slowed defect density relaxation, amplified fluctuations, and heightened sensitivity to activity. Near criticality, defect interactions become long-ranged, scaling with system size, and the system enters an anti-hyperuniform regime with giant number fluctuations of topological defects and defect clustering. This transition reflects a dual scaling behavior: fluctuations are uniform at small scales but become anti-hyperuniform at larger scales, \tm{as supported by experimental measurements on large-field-of-view endothelial monolayers. We find that these anti-hyperuniform states with multiscale defect density fluctuations are robust to varying parameters, introducing frictional damping, and changing boundary conditions.} Finally, we show that the observed anti-hyperuniformity originates from defect clustering, distinguishing this transition from defect-unbinding or phase separation processes. Beyond fundamental implications for non-equilibrium systems, these results may inform biological contexts where topological defects are integral to processes such as morphogenesis and collective cellular self-organization.</description>

      <title>Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model in a Quantum Glassy Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of `Yukawa models' in which Majorana fermions, interacting via all-to-all random couplings as in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, are parametrically coupled to disordered bosonic degrees of freedom described by a quantum $p-$spin model. The latter has its own non-trivial dynamics leading to quantum paramagnetic (or liquid) and glassy phases. At low temperatures, this setup results in SYK behavior within each metastable state of a rugged bosonic free energy landscape, the effective fermionic couplings being different for each metastable state. We show that the boson-fermion coupling enhances the stability of the quantum spin-glass phase and strongly modifies the imaginary-time Green's functions of both sets of degrees of freedom. In particular, in the quantum spin glass phase, the imaginary-time dynamics is turned from a fast exponential decay characteristic of a gapped phase into a much slower dynamics. In the quantum paramagnetic phase, on the other hand, the fermions' imaginary-time dynamics get strongly modified and the critical SYK behavior is washed away.</description>

      <title>IsingFormer: Augmenting Parallel Tempering With Learned Proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.</description>

      <title>Replication and Information Extraction in a Minimal Agent-Environment Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an unsupervised classifying agent that evolves by enforcing self-consistency of its labels under continual exposure to a data-generating environment. Because the agent's predictions feed back into its own regularized updates, the dynamics can stabilize into self-sustaining modes of operation, which we coin functional replicators. Remarkably, such replicators can spontaneously align with the latent structure of the environment, despite never being exposed to ground-truth labels or selected for adaptation. Using analytical tools from statistical mechanics and numerical experiments, we show that the onset of this regime corresponds to a transition driven by weak correlations between the agent's initial state and environmental structure. Extending the model to multiple agents, we find that their mutual influence can spontaneously break symmetry and produce consensus, illustrating a minimal setting for decentralized collective learning.</description>

      <title>Surface Optimisation Governs the Local Design of Physical Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain's connectome and the vascular system are examples of physical networks whose tangible nature influences their structure, layout, and ultimately their function. The material resources required to build and maintain these networks have inspired decades of research into wiring economy, offering testable predictions about their expected architecture and organisation. Here we empirically explore the local branching geometry of a wide range of physical networks, uncovering systematic violations of the long-standing predictions of length and volume minimisation. This leads to the hypothesis that predicting the true material cost of physical networks requires us to account for their full three-dimensional geometry, resulting in a largely intractable optimisation problem. We discover, however, an exact mapping of surface minimisation onto high-dimensional Feynman diagrams in string theory, predicting that with increasing link thickness, a locally tree-like network undergoes a transition into configurations that can no longer be explained by length minimisation. Specifically, surface minimisation predicts the emergence of trifurcations and branching angles in excellent agreement with the local tree organisation of physical networks across a wide range of application domains. Finally, we predict the existence of stable orthogonal sprouts, which not only are prevalent in real networks but also play a key functional role, improving synapse formation in the brain and nutrient access in plants and fungi.</description>

      <title>How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands'' form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory, we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Population genetics in complex ecological communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ecological interactions can dramatically alter evolutionary outcomes in complex communities. Yet, the classic theoretical results of population genetics (e.g., Kimura's fixation formula) largely ignore ecological effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by using dynamical mean-field theory to integrate ecology into classical population genetics models. We show that ecological interactions between parents and mutants result in frequency-dependent selection and can be characterized by a single emergent parameter that measures the strength of ecological feedbacks. We derive an explicit analytic expression for the fixation probability that generalizes Kimura's famous result and analyze it in various ecological and evolutionary limits. We find that ecological interactions suppress fixation probabilities for moderately beneficial mutants when compared to Kimura's predictions, with the strength of suppression increasing with larger effective population sizes, greater selective differences between parent and mutant, and for ecosystems with a large number of "open niches" (i.e., ecosystems well below the packing bound). Frequency-dependent selection also gives rise to prolonged parent-mutant coexistence in complex communities, a phenomenon absent in classical population genetics. Our study establishes a framework for integrating ecological interactions into population genetics models and helps illuminate how ecology can affect evolutionary outcomes.</description>

      <title>Decoupling hydrodynamization from thermalization via nonlinear Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early thermalization puzzle arises from the unexpectedly early applicability of hydrodynamics in heavy-ion collisions. While hydrodynamics has traditionally been associated with the onset of local thermal equilibrium, its derivations -- whether microscopic or macroscopic -- rely instead on linearization around equilibrium. However, the linearization timescale -- the time at which a system's evolution begins to follow a linearized equation -- has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we employ the spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation -- the lowest-order truncation of the spectral Bogoliubov--Born--Green--Kirkwood--Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy -- to analyze the timescales of linearization and thermalization under three distinct truncation schemes. The first two truncations allow for analytic treatment via recursive spectral equations, while the third requires numerical methods for generic initial conditions. The analysis is performed for a homogeneous, massless system with a constant differential cross section. For this simplified setup, we find a robust separation: the linearization time is consistently about half the thermalization time ($\tau_{\mathrm{lin}}/\tau_{\mathrm{therm}} \approx 1/2$). This separation of timescales suggests an explanation for the early applicability of hydrodynamics and points toward a possible quantitative resolution of the early thermalization puzzle.</description>

      <title>An operator-Weyl-symbol approach to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, by an approach that employs Weyl symbols for operators, a semiclassical theory is developed for the offdiagonal function in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which is for offdiagonal elements $\langle{E_i}\left|O\right|{E_j}\rangle$ of an observable $O$ on the energy basis. It is shown analytically that the matrix of $O$ has a banded structure, possessing a bandwidth $w_b$ that scales linearly with $\hbar$, a phase-space gradient of the classical Hamiltonian, $\langle\left|{\boldsymbol{\nabla }H_{\rm cl}}\right|\rangle$, and an $O$-dependent property. This predicts that the thermalization timescale of a quantum system may be inversely proportional to the phase-space gradient of the Hamiltonian, aligning with intuitions in classical thermalization. This approach also elucidates the origin of a $\rho_{\rm dos}^{-1/2}$-scaling of the offdiagonal function. The analytical predictions are checked numerically in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new theoretical method to describe the monitored dynamics of bosonic many-body systems based on the concept of the most likely trajectory. We show how such trajectory can be identified from the probability distribution of quantum trajectories, i.e. measurement readouts, and how it successfully captures the monitored dynamics beyond the average state. We prove the method to be exact in the case of Gaussian theories and then extend it to the interacting Sine-Gordon model. Although no longer exact in this framework, the method captures the dynamics through a self-consistent time-dependent harmonic approximation and reveals an entanglement phase transition in the steady state from an area-law to a logarithmic-law scaling.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a family of radially symmetric Coulomb gas systems at inverse temperature $\beta = 2$. The family is characterised by the property that the density of the equilibrium measure vanishes on a ring at radius $r_*$, which lies strictly inside the droplet. The large $n$ expansion of the logarithm of the partition function is obtained up to a novel $n^{1/4}$ term. We perform a double scaling limit of the correlation kernel at the $n^{1/4}$ scale and obtain a new limiting kernel in the bulk, which differs from the well-known Ginibre kernel.</description>

Abstract: The majority of analysis of interacting systems is done for weak and well-balanced interactions, when in fact topology and rare event factors often result in strong and sign-biased interactions when considering real systems. We analyse the impact of strong mutualistic interactions in a uniformly weighted Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi network under generalised Lotka-Volterra dynamics. In difference to the typical case we show the interaction topology and system dynamics combine to produce power law abundance distributions in a critical region of the phase diagram, identifiable as a Griffiths phase. We find asymptotic expressions for the fixed point solution in this region, and establish the boundary of this region as when topology alone determines the abundance distribution. We show that the Griffiths phase persists for strong mutualistic interactions more generally, and survives when combined with weak all-to-all competition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of stochastic interacting particles with general diffusion coefficient and drift functions and we study the types of collisions that arise in them. In particular, interactions between particles are inversely proportional to their separation, and the coupling function of interaction is also considered in great generality. Our main result indicates that under very mild conditions, all collisions are simple almost surely, namely, only one pair of particles collides at any time, while more complicated collisions such as three-body or disjoint two-body collisions occur with zero probability. In order to obtain our results we make use of symmetric polynomials on the square of particle separations; the degree of these polynomials indicates the type of collision, and by a locality argument we show that polynomials indicating a non-simple collision almost surely do not cancel. We make use of our main result to study the Hausdorff dimension of times at which collisions occur, and we show that this dimension is given by the ratio between the interaction coupling and diffusion functions. Our results cover many of the most well-known particle systems, such as the Dyson model and Wishart processes and their extensions to non-constant diffusion coefficients and background drifts.</description>

      <title>Geometric flow of planar domain-wall loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric evolution of elastic domain-wall loops in two dimensions. Assuming an instantaneous, isotropic, and homogeneous arc-velocity response of the domain wall to external pressure and local signed curvature, we derive closed dynamical equations linking the enclosed area and loop perimeter for both linear and nonlinear arc-velocity response functions. This reduced description enables predictions for the dynamics of both spontaneous and externally driven domains-subjected to constant or alternating fields-within the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau scalar $\phi ^4$ model. In the linear response regime, where a non-crossing principle holds in the absence of external driving, we obtain exact results. In particular, we demonstrate that the relaxation rate of the total spontaneous magnetization becomes quantized for arbitrary initial conditions involving multiple, possibly nested, loops, with discrete jumps corresponding to individual loop collapse events. Under external driving, the avoidance principle breaks down due to sparse interactions between interfaces-either within a single loop or between multiple loops-leading to coalescence or splitting events that change the number of loops. A quantized geometrical observable involving the total area and perimeter is identified in this case as well, exhibiting discrete jumps both at interface interaction events and at individual loop collapses. We further use approximate area-perimeter relations to estimate the spontaneous collapse lifetimes of compact magnetic domains, as well as their dynamics under alternating-field-assisted collapse in disordered ultrathin magnetic films. Our predictions are compared with experimental observations in such systems.</description>

      <title>ChromRec: Directional Recognition-Driven Self-Assembly of Histone Octamer and Chromatin Fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center Recognition potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>

      <title>Effective Free Energy Landscapes and Hawking-Page Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent interesting development on the dynamics of black hole phase transitions, the Hawking-Page transition, has been the so-called Gibbs free energy landscape approach. In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a canonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon radius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is defined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius treated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond to the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free energy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an associated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of black hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which is independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the Fokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by considering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale with black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can be used to study the modification of the Hawking-Page transition of a black hole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes under a multiplicative noise, unless the effective and the original free energy become extremal at the same horizon radius. For this latter situation some theoretical noise profiles which are monotonically increasing/deceasing functions of the horizon radius are considered. It is found that stronger noise disfavors the formation of black hole.</description>

Abstract: Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</description>

      <title>Improving accuracy of tree-tensor network approach by optimization of network structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model in order to analyze how the performance of the algorithm depends on the detailed updating schemes of the structural optimization. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.</description>

      <title>Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home when Doubled and Scaled</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of numerous physical systems, such as spins and qubits, can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Error bounds on the universal Lindblad equation in the thermodynamic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14916v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has the desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors from several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation remain small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Fate of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Paired Phase in Coupled $XY$ Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intriguing phases may emerge when two-dimensional systems are coupled in a bilayer configuration. In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) paired superfluid phase was predicted and claimed to be numerically observed in a coupled $XY$ model with ferromagnetic interlayer interactions, as reported in [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.100601}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 100601 (2019)}]. However, both our Monte Carlo simulations and analytical analysis show that this model does not exhibit a BKT paired phase. We then propose a new model incorporating paired-phase gradient interlayer interactions to realize the BKT paired phase. Moreover, we observe that the anomalous magnetic dimension varies along the phase transition line between the disordered normal phase and the BKT paired phase. This finding requires an understanding beyond the conventional phase transition theory.</description>

      <title>Exact large-scale correlations in diffusive systems with general interactions: explicit characterisation without the Dean--Kawasaki equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterising the statistical properties of classical interacting particle systems is a long-standing question. For Brownian particles the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean--Kawasaki equation. This equation remains mostly formal and linearization (or higher-order expansions) is required to obtain explicit expressions for physical observables, with a range of validity not easily defined. Here, by combining macroscopic fluctuation theory with equilibrium statistical mechanics, we provide a systematic alternative to the Dean--Kawasaki framework to characterize large-scale correlations. This approach enables us to obtain explicit and exact results for dynamical observables such as tracer cumulants and bath-tracer correlations in one dimension, both in and out of equilibrium. In particular, we reveal a generic non-monotonic spatial structure in the response of the bath following a temperature quench. Our approach applies to a broad class of interaction potentials and extends naturally to higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a theoretical framework known as {\it ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory} has been developed to study large-scale fluctuations and correlations in many-body systems exhibiting ballistic transport. In this paper, we review this theory in the context of a one-dimensional gas of hard rods. The initial configurations of the rods are sampled from a probability distribution characterised by slowly varying conserved density profiles across space. Beginning from a microscopic description, we first formulate the macroscopic fluctuation theory in terms of the phase-space density of quasiparticles. In the second part, we apply this framework to compute the two-point, two-time correlation functions of the conserved densities in the Euler scaling limit. We derive an explicit expression for the correlation function which not only reveals its inherent symmetries, but is also straightforward to evaluate numerically for a given initial state. Our results also recover known expressions for space-time correlations in equilibrium for the hard-rod gas.</description>

      <title>Evaporative Refrigeration Effect in Evaporation and Condensation between Two Parallel Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the cooling wall. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on an approximate quasi-continuum approach. This work examines this effect rigorously by studying evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Numerical results show that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, reaffirming the evaporative refrigeration effect. The present work further reveals that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. While the dominant mechanism is the asymmetry in the molecular distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules at the interface, additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion, similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. The impacts of key parameters, including liquid thickness, Knudsen number, and accommodation coefficient, are investigated. The numerical simulation shows that with a thicker vapor, a thinner liquid film, and a larger accommodation coefficient, leads to stronger evaporative refrigeration effect. This work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning, refrigeration, and membrane distillation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06466v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</description>

We demonstrate that this approach provides access to features well beyond the semiclassical method applied previously, including the description of resonant excitations and analytic prediction for the time evolution after a quantum quench. We also demonstrate that it agrees with the meson/bubble spectrum results from exact diagonalisation and the numerical simulations of the time evolution.</description>

      <title>Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning Applied to the Majority Vote Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.</description>

Abstract: The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of timescales in a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder</title>

Abstract: Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.</description>

      <title>Non-diagonal open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum chains by separation of variables: Complete spectrum and matrix elements of some quasi-local operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:1206.0646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integrable quantum models, associated to the transfer matrices of the 6-vertex reflection algebra for spin 1/2 representations, are studied in this paper. In the framework of Sklyanin's quantum separation of variables (SOV), we provide the complete characterization of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the transfer matrix and the proof of the simplicity of the transfer matrix spectrum. Moreover, we use these integrable quantum models as further key examples for which to develop a method in the SOV framework to compute matrix elements of local operators. This method has been introduced first in [1] and then used also in [2], it is based on the resolution of the quantum inverse problem (i.e. the reconstruction of all local operators in terms of the quantum separate variables) plus the computation of the action of separate covectors on separate vectors. In particular, for these integrable quantum models, which in the homogeneous limit reproduce the open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum chains with non-diagonal boundary conditions, we have obtained the SOV-reconstructions for a class of quasi-local operators and determinant formulae for the covector-vector actions. As consequence of these findings we provide one determinant formulae for the matrix elements of this class of reconstructed quasi-local operators on transfer matrix eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Certifying quantum enhancements in thermal machines beyond the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19280v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. Introducing a comparison with classical machines using the same set of thermodynamic resources, we show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage under mild conditions. This advantage applies to both cases where the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators: the three-level amplifier, the three-qubit autonomous refrigerator, and a noise-induced-coherence machine.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Quantum Phase Transitions of the $\phi^4$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20704v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss and revisit the finite temperature extension of the renormalization group (RG) treatment of $T=0$ field theories, focusing as a case study on the $\phi^4$ model. We first discuss the extension of RG equations of the very same model from $T=0$ to finite $T$ in the usual way by resorting to sums on the Matsubara frequencies and fixing the physical temperature parameter $T$. We show that this approach, although useful for a variety of applications, may lead to the disappearance of the critical points as extracted from the RG flow. Since the identification of fixed points is key in the study of classical and quantum phase transitions, wepropose a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. Once introduced this dimensionless temperature $\tau$, we investigate the consequences on the thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model and construct its phase diagram. Finally, we formulate requirements for the phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the quantum and classical phase diagrams of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Digital-Analog Simulations of Schr\"odinger Cat States in the Dicke-Ising Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''. Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schr\"odinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</description>

      <title>A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect without global symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a system initially farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and recently explored in quantum settings. While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation.</description>

      <title>Role of interaction anisotropy in polymer cononsolvency: insights from the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cononsolvency occurs when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for polymers over specific composition ranges, causing macroscopic phase separation or microscopic chain collapse. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between macroscopic and microscopic manifestations of cononsolvency remains unclear. A key challenge is identifying which interactions govern cononsolvency: coarse-grained analyses like standard Flory--Huggins models assume purely isotropic interactions, while atomistic simulations contain complex anisotropic interactions that cannot be precisely controlled or isolated. Here, we address the role of interaction anisotropy using the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework, which yields $\chi$ as a thermodynamic average over both configurational and internal-state coarse-grained degrees of freedom. This enables controlled comparison between systems with isotropic versus orientation-dependent interactions that share identical effective $\chi$ parameters, either driving cononsolvency by strong solvent-cosolvent affinity or preferential polymer-cosolvent affinity. While pairs of systems exhibit equivalent macroscopic phase behavior, lattice Monte Carlo simulations reveal that those featuring orientation-dependent interactions generate distinct collapse signatures, particularly in reentrant coil-globule transitions or characteristics of the solvation structure. These results demonstrate how microscopic interactions influences cononsolvency behavior beyond what effective $\chi$ parameters alone predict.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part I: equilibrium multifarious self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.</description>

Abstract: We study five-point correlators of the $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $\epsilon'$ operators in the critical 3d Ising model. We consider the $\sigma \times \sigma$ and $\sigma \times \epsilon$ operator product expansions (OPEs) and truncate them by including a finite set of exchanged operators. We approximate the truncated operators by the corresponding contributions in appropriate disconnected five-point correlators. We compute a number of OPE coefficients that were previously unknown and show that these are consistent with predictions obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization of the critical 3d Ising model.</description>

      <title>Dynamic syndrome decoder in volume-law phases of hybrid quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phases of matter with volume-law entanglement are frequently observed in quantum circuits and have numerous applications, ranging from deepening our understanding of quantum mechanics to advancements in quantum computing and cryptography. Their capacity to host entangled, complex quantum information is complemented by their ability to efficiently obscure it from quantum measurements through scrambling, reminiscent of quantum error-correction. However, the issue of initial-state decodability has primarily been studied in measurement-only models with area-law phases, which limit the entanglement of the encoded state. In this work, we introduce a class of Clifford circuits in one and two dimensions that feature a decodable volume law phase, allowing for information retrieval in logarithmic circuit depths. We present the Sign-Color Decoder that tracks stabilizers revealing the initial state, akin to monitoring a dynamically-changing syndrome for error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this approach in scenarios where error locations are either known or unknown to the decoder, and we provide new insights about the relationship between the decodability transition and measurement-induced phase transition. We propose that this decodability transition is universal across various settings, including different circuit geometries. Our findings pave the way for using volume law states as encoders with mid-circuit measurements, opening potential applications in quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For equilibrium hard spheres the stochastic geometry of the insertion space, the room to accommodate another sphere, relates exactly to the equation of state. We begin to extend this idea to active matter, analyzing insertion space for repulsive active particles in one and two dimensions using both on- and off-lattice models. In 1D we derive closed-form expressions for the mean insertion cavity size, cavity number, and total insertion volume, all in excellent agreement with simulations. Strikingly, activity increases the total insertion volume and tends to keep the insertion space more connected. These results provide the first quantitative foundation for the stochastic geometry of active matter, and opens up a new route to building a thermodynamics of active systems.</description>

      <title>Effective delocalization in the one-dimensional Anderson model with stealthy disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the Anderson model in one dimension with "stealthy" disorder, defined as having a power spectrum that vanishes in a continuous band of wave numbers. Motivated by recent studies on the optical transparency properties of stealthy hyperuniform layered media, we compute the localization length via the perturbation theory expansion of the self-energy. We find that, for fixed energy and small but finite disorder strength $W$, there exists for any finite length system a range of stealthiness $\chi$ for which the localization length exceeds the system size. This kind of "effective delocalization" is the result of the novel kind of correlated disorder that spans a continuous range of length scales, a defining characteristic of stealthy systems. Unlike uncorrelated disorder, for which the localization length $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2}$ to leading order for small W, the leading order terms in the perturbation expansion of $\xi$ for stealthy disordered systems vanish identically for a progressively large number of terms as $\chi$ increases such that $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2n}$ with arbitrarily large $n$. Moreover, we support our analytical results with numerical simulations. Our results may serve as a first step in investigating the role of stealthy disorder in quantum systems, which is of both theoretical and experimental relevance.</description>

Abstract: Topological phenomena in quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing attention, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, a general framework for identifying such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we propose a universal fingerprint for detecting nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems protected by global on-site symmetries. Specifically, we analytically establish an exact relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems.</description>
