      <title>Growth of Science and Women: Methodological Challenges of Using Structured Big Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we quantify an inflow of women into science in the past three decades. Structured Big Data allow us to estimate the contribution of women scientists to the growth of science by disciplines (N = STEMM 14 disciplines) and over time (1990-2023). A monolithic segment of STEMM science emerges from this research as divided between the disciplines in which the growth was powerfully driven by women - and the disciplines in which the role of women was marginal. There are four disciplines in which 50% of currently publishing scientists are women; and five disciplines in which more than 50% of currently young scientists are women. But there is also a cluster of four highly mathematized disciplines (MATH, COMP, PHYS, and ENG) in which the growth of science is only marginally driven by women. Digital traces left by scientists in their publications indexed in global datasets open two new dimensions in large-scale academic profession studies: time and gender. The growth of science in Europe was accompanied by growth in the number of women scientists, but with powerful cross-disciplinary and cross-generational differentiations. We examined the share of women scientists coming from ten different age cohorts for 32 European and four comparator countries (the USA, Canada, Australia, and Japan). Our study sample was N = 1,740,985 scientists (including 39.40% women scientists). Three critical methodological challenges of using structured Big Data of the bibliometric type were discussed: gender determination, academic age determination, and discipline determination.</description>

      <title>Comment on Lubineau et al. (2023) 'Does word flickering improve reading? Negative evidence from four experiments using low and high frequencies'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, Lubineau et al. published an article [1] detailing several experiments carried out with dyslexic readers. These authors attempted to measure the change in reading performance under different reading conditions using flickering devices. Beyond the low-frequency systems which have nevertheless shown their interest for some cases, we restrict here our response to the high-frequency systems, i.e. electronically controlled glasses (Lexilens) and lamps, designed and built upon recent work by Le Floch and Ropars [2]. Lubineau et al. found no significant change in reading performance at either low or high frequencies and concluded that these devices provide no or minor benefits. Unfortunately, experimental misunderstandings and some methodological issues invalidate namely the main conclusion concerning the high frequency systems.</description>

      <title>Home Swapping -- An Innovative Approach to Reduce Traffic Congestion and Carbon Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, worsened by the rapid urbanization and the increasing prevalence of private vehicles, has significantly increased commuting time for everyone. In this paper, we used a dataset with over 400,000 real mobility trajectories of individuals spanning 9 days in a major Chinese city to investigate an innovative approach to swap homes between households in addressing the challenge of peak-hour traffic congestion. We observed that, empirically, households choose their home location strategically such that the average commuting distance is roughly 3 times less than that when their home is randomly located, showing features of self-organization. Remarkably, we found that the average commuting distance can be further reduced by 50% through home swapping at the city-level, leading to a large reduction in traffic congestion. To make home swapping more realistic, we swap homes only if the following socio-demographic factors including the distance from the city center, housing price and amenity accessibility are preserved for both households, such that the average commuting distance can still be reduced by 13%. As both home-workplace distance and traffic congestion are reduced, as a side benefit, carbon emissions from vehicles are also greatly reduced by almost 80%, and 40% when socio-demographic factors are considered. The distance from the city center is shown to be the most influential factor affecting the benefit brought by home swapping, and further analysis indicates that developing a polycentric city layout could significantly enhance such benefit. This study suggests that mitigating traffic congestion requires a long-term, holistic and strategic approach to urban planning, suggesting a need for coordinating individual residence locations and a polycentric city layout.</description>

      <title>Coupling quantum-like cognition with the neuronal networks within generalized probability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent years are characterized by intensive applications of the methodology and mathematical apparatus of quantum theory, quantum-like modeling, in cognition, psychology, and decision making. In spite of the successful applications of this approach to a variety of psychological effects, e.g., the order, conjunction, disjunction, and response replicability effects, one may (but need not) feel dissatisfaction due to the absence of clear coupling to the neurophysiological processes in the brain. For the moment, this is just a phenomenological approach. In this paper we construct the quantum-like representation of the networks of communicating neurons. It is based not on standard quantum theory, but on generalized probability theory (GPT) with the emphasis of the operational measurement approach. We employ GPT's version which is based on ordered linear state space (instead of complex Hilbert space). A network of communicating neurons is described as a weighted ordered graph that in turn is encoded by its weight matrix. The state space of weight matrices is embedded in GPT with effect-observables and state updates within measurement instruments theory. The latter plays the crucial role. This GPT based model shows the basic quantum-like effects, as e.g. the order, non-repeatability, and disjunction effects; the latter is also known as interference of decisions. This GPT coupling also supports quantum-like modeling in medical diagnostic for neurological diseases, as depression and epilepsy. Although the paper is concentrated on cognition and neuronal networks, the formalism and methodology can be straightforwardly applied to a variety of biological and social networks.</description>

      <title>Is the Italian university ready for a gender leap? A regional perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discussion on the readiness of Italian universities to address gender-related issues from a regional standpoint is proposed. A statistical analysis is conducted on data of all scholars enrolled in Italian universities from 2000 to 2023 to investigate why the glass ceiling of the full professor position remains so challenging to break in almost all scientific fields and across all regions of Italy.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fermi's Paradox using an Intragalactic Colonization Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore Fermi's Paradox via a system of differential equations and using simulations of dispersal and interactions between competing interplanetary civilizations. To quantify the resources and potentials of these worlds, three different state variables representing population, environment, and technology, are used. When encounters occur between two different civilizations, the deterministic Lanchester Battle Model is used to determine the outcome of the conflict. We use the Unity engine to simulate the possible outcomes of colonization by different types of civilizations to further investigate Fermi's question.
  When growth rates of population, technology and nature are out of balance, planetary civilizations can collapse. If the balance is adequate, then some civilizations can develop into dominating ones; nevertheless, they leave large spatial gaps in the distribution of their colonies. The unexpected result is that small civilizations can be left in existence by dominating civilizations in a galaxy due to those large gaps. Our results provide some insights into the validity of various solutions to Fermi's Paradox.</description>

      <title>Self-reinforcing cascades: A spreading model for beliefs or products of varying intensity or quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of how things spread often assume that transmission mechanisms are fixed over time. However, social contagions--the spread of ideas, beliefs, innovations--can lose or gain in momentum as they spread: ideas can get reinforced, beliefs strengthened, products refined. We study the impacts of such self-reinforcement mechanisms in cascade dynamics. We use different mathematical modeling techniques to capture the recursive, yet changing nature of the process. We find a critical regime with a range of power-law cascade size distributions with varying scaling exponents. This regime clashes with classic models, where criticality requires fine tuning at a precise critical point. Self-reinforced cascades produce critical-like behavior over a wide range of parameters, which may help explain the ubiquity of power-law distributions in empirical social data.</description>

      <title>Content Aware Analysis of Scholarly Networks: A Case Study on CORD19 Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationships among key elements of scientific research network, namely articles, researchers, and journals. We introduce a novel approach to use semantic information through the HITS algorithm based propagation of topic information in the network. The topic information is derived by using the Named Entity Recognition and Entity Linkage. In our case, MedCAT is used to extract the topics from the CORD19 Dataset, which is a corpus of academic articles about COVID-19 and coronavirus scientific network. Our approach focuses on the COVID-19 domain, utilizing the CORD-19 dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of integrating topic-related information within the citation framework. Through the application of a hybrid HITS algorithm, we show that incorporating topic data significantly influences article rankings, revealing deeper insights into the structure of the academic community.</description>

      <title>Spatial public goods games on any population structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatially structured populations has advanced significantly in the context of pairwise games, but the fundamental theory of group-based public goods games (PGGs) remains less explored. Here, we provide theoretical conditions under which cooperation thrive in spatial PGGs on any population structure, which are accurate under weak selection. We find that PGGs can support cooperation across all kinds of model details and on almost all network structures in contrast to pairwise games. For example, a class of networks that would otherwise fail to produce cooperation, such as star graphs, are particularly conducive to cooperation in spatial PGGs. This fundamental advantage of spatial PGGs derives from reciprocity through second-order interactions, allowing local structures such as the clustering coefficient to play positive roles. We also verify the robustness of spatial PGGs on empirical networks where pairwise games cannot support cooperation, which implies that PGGs could be a universal interaction mode in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>What can we learn from marketing skills as a bipartite network from accredited programs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between professional skills and higher education programs is modeled as a non-directed bipartite network with binary entries representing the links between 28 skills (as captured by the occupational information network, O*NET) and 258 graduate program summaries (as captured by commercial brochures of graduate programs in marketing with accreditation standards of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business). While descriptive analysis for skills suggests a qualitative lack of alignment between the job demands captured by O*NET, inferential analyses based on exponential random graph model estimates show that skills' popularity and homophily coexist with a systematic yet weak alignment to job demands for marketing managers.</description>

      <title>Robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection in the face of network perturbations, specifically edge deletions. Graph embedding techniques, which represent nodes as low-dimensional vectors, are widely used for various graph machine learning tasks due to their ability to capture structural properties of networks effectively. However, the impact of perturbations on the performance of these methods remains relatively understudied. The research considers state-of-the-art graph embedding methods from two families: matrix factorization (e.g., LE, LLE, HOPE, M-NMF) and random walk-based (e.g., DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec). Through experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks, the study reveals varying degrees of robustness within each family of graph embedding methods. The robustness is found to be influenced by factors such as network size, initial community partition strength, and the type of perturbation. Notably, node2vec and LLE consistently demonstrate higher robustness for community detection across different scenarios, including networks with degree and community size heterogeneity. These findings highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate graph embedding method based on the specific characteristics of the network and the task at hand, particularly in scenarios where robustness to perturbations is crucial.</description>

      <title>Modularity maximization and community detection in complex networks through recursive and hierarchical annealing in the D-Wave Advantage quantum processing units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic optimization has long been expected to outperform classical methods in solving NP-type problems. While this has been proven in certain experiments, its main applications still reside in academic problems where the size of the system to be solved would not represent an obstacle to any modern desktop computer. Here we develop a systematic procedure to find the global optima of the modularity function to discover community structure in complex networks solely relying on pure annealers rather than hybrid solutions. We bypass the one-hot encoding constraints by hierarchically and recursively encoding binary instances of the problem that can be solved without the need to guess the exact penalties for the Lagrange multipliers. We study the variability, and robustness of the annealing process as a function of network size, directness of connections, topology, and the resolution of the communities. We show how our approach produces meaningful and at least equally optimal solutions to state-of-the-art community detection algorithms while maintaining tractable computing times. Lastly, due to its recursive nature, the annealing process returns intermediate subdivisions thus offering interpretable rather than black-box solutions. These \textit{dendrograms} can be used to unveil normal and pathological hidden hierarchies in brain networks hence opening the door to clinical workflows. Overall, this represents a first step towards an applicable practice-oriented usage of pure quantum annealing potentially bridging two segregated communities in modern science and engineering; that of network science and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>One rule does not fit all: deviations from universality in human mobility modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of individual movement in cities has significant implications for policy decisions across various sectors. Existing research emphasizes the universality of human mobility, positing that simple models can capture population-level movements. However, population-level accuracy does not guarantee consistent performance across all individuals. By overlooking individual differences, universality laws may accurately describe certain groups while less precisely representing others, resulting in aggregate accuracy from a balance of discrepancies. Using large-scale mobility data, we assess individual-level accuracy of a universal model, the Exploration and Preferential Return (EPR), by examining deviations from expected behavior in two scaling laws - one related to exploration and the other to return patterns. Our findings reveal that, while the model can describe population-wide movement patterns, it displays widespread deviations linked to individuals' behavioral traits, socioeconomic status, and lifestyles, contradicting model assumptions like non-bursty exploration and preferential return. Specifically, individuals poorly represented by the EPR model tend to visit routine locations in sequences, exploring rarely but in a bursty manner when they do. Among socioeconomic factors, income most strongly correlates with significant deviations. Consequently, spatial inhomogeneity emerges in model accuracy, with lower performance concentrated in urbanized, densely populated areas, underscoring policy implications. Our results show that emphasizing population-wide models can propagate socioeconomic inequalities by poorly representing vulnerable population sectors.</description>
