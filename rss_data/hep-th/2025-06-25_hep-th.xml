      <title>On the reconstruction map in JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open question in AdS/CFT is how to reconstruct semiclassical bulk operators precisely enough that non-perturbative quantum effects can be computed. We propose a set of physically-motivated requirements for such a reconstruction map, and explicitly construct a map satisfying these requirements in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity. Our map is found by canonically quantizing "action-angle" variables for JT gravity, which are chosen to ensure that the spectrum of the fundamental quantum theory matches known results from the gravitational path integral. We then study unitary quantum dynamics in this theory, and obtain analytical predictions for the dynamics of the wormhole length, including its quantum fluctuations, leveraging techniques from quantum ergodicity theory. Level repulsion in the non-perturbative JT spectrum implies that the average wormhole length is non-monotonic in time, that fluctuations in wormhole length are non-perturbatively suppressed until nearly the Heisenberg time, and that the late-time-evolved Hartle-Hawking state has a heavy-tailed distribution of lengths. We discuss the implications of our results for the "complexity = volume" conjecture.</description>

      <title>Gravity, finite duality cascades and confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascading RG flows are characteristic of $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories realized by D3-branes probing singularities in the presence of fractional branes. A celebrated example is the Klebanov-Strassler model, which exhibits an infinite cascade that ends with confinement. In this work, we explore a related setup where the addition of an orientifold plane modifies the cascade structure: the RG flow now consists of a finite number of steps, originating from a UV fixed point with a finite number of degrees of freedom. We provide a supergravity solution dual to this flow, that reproduces all its salient features. The string frame curvature can be kept small up to parametrically large values of the holographic coordinate, larger than the one at which the first cascade step occurs.</description>

      <title>Tails from the Bulk: Gravitational Decay in AdS$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS black holes in $d = 5$ and identify a regime of late-time power-law decay for smooth initial data. Based on an analysis of the quasinormal mode spectrum, we predict and characterise this decay behaviour. We perform fully nonlinear numerical evolutions with long integration times that support the prediction and exhibit no signs of instability. Remarkably, the decay is modulated by a universal oscillatory pattern, consistent with subleading corrections from a large-angular-momentum (eikonal) analysis of the quasinormal mode spectrum.</description>

      <title>Further aspects of Supersymmetric Virasoro Minimal Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A supersymmetric version of the Virasoro minimal string was defined some time ago using random matrix model techniques. Several of the special properties of the matrix model that were noted (accessible fully non-perturbatively) underlie features shared by both 0A and 0B versions of the theory. This paper develops the formalism much further, including showing how the 0A and 0B choices familiar in continuum approaches have a direct analogue in terms of building solutions of the appropriate string equations. This also illuminates several key differences between the 0A and 0B models at the level of matrix model loop observables. The natural all-orders vanishing of loops, already observed in some 0A models, translates into the same for 0B. It is also noted that the leading amplitude for a single asymptotic boundary, as well as the trumpet partition function, are characters of a 2D superconformal field theory living on the boundary of a solid torus, suggesting a 3D chiral supergravity dual. Non-perturbative results are computed as well.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.</description>

      <title>Embedding $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_2$ in Complex Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework demonstrating how the spinor complex Lorentz group SL(2,C)/Z\_2 is realized as a canonical subgroup within a four-dimensional complex Riemannian manifold. Building on the complex, holomorphic metric extension and contour-integration regularization of classical singularities, we show that promoting the metric to a complex-valued tensor on a complex 4-fold enlarges the frame bundle to SO(4,C). Its spin double cover factorizes as a product of two independent SL(2,C) factors modulo a shared Z\_2, and selecting one Weyl factor recovers the familiar SL(2,C)/Z\_2 spin cover of the Lorentz group. By explicitly extending metric components and connection forms into the complex domain, using contour deformations to avoid coordinate-singular loci, we exhibit how left- and right-handed Weyl spinors transform under separate SL(2,C) factors, and how modding out a common Z\_2 reproduces the standard spin-Lorentz structure. In particular, the same contour-integration techniques that yield singularity-free Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions via a holomorphic radial coordinate also furnish a holomorphic spin bundle in which chiral spin representations live without imposing exotic matter or modifying the Einstein equations. This embedding clarifies the geometric origin of chirality, enables holomorphic factorization of curvature and connection forms, and provides a foundation for constructing holomorphic field theories and complexified gravity backgrounds. Our results indicate that extending the Lorentz group into a complex Riemannian setting not only recovers SL(2,C)/Z\_2 in a canonical fashion, but also establishes a geometric arena for studying chiral fermions, Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) instantons, and potential quantum-gravity corrections within a rigorously defined complex manifold.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy in effective field theory of general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown to all orders of perturbation theory that in the effective field theory of general relativity the condition of vanishing of the vacuum energy leads to the same value of the cosmological constant, viewed as a parameter of the effective Lagrangian, as obtained by demanding the consistency of the effective field theory in Minkowski background. The resulting effective action is characterized by the cosmological constant term that vanishes exactly.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the amplitude bootstrap program, the spirit of this work is to constrain the space of consistent inflationary correlation functions - specifically, the bispectrum of curvature perturbations - using fundamental principles such as unitarity, locality, analyticity, and symmetries. To this end, we assume a setup for inflation in which de Sitter isometries are only mildly broken by the slow roll of the inflaton field, and study the bispectrum imprinted by a generic hidden sector during inflation. Assuming that the hidden sector's contributions to primordial non-Gaussianity are dominated by the exchange of a scalar operator (which does not preclude high-spin UV completions), we derive nontrivial positivity constraints on the resulting bispectrum $B(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. In particular, we show that $B$ must be negative in a certain region around the equilateral configuration. For instance, for isosceles triangles (with $k_2=k_3$) this region is given by $0.027\lesssim k_3/k_1\leq 2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unitarity imposes upper and lower bounds on the bispectrum shape, thereby carving out a Bispectrum Island where consistent shapes in our setup can reside. We complement our analysis by contemplating alternative setups where the coupling to the hidden sector is allowed to strongly break de Sitter boosts. We also identify situations that would push the bispectrum off the island and the profound physical features they would reveal.</description>

      <title>Building multi-BTZ black holes through Riemann-Hilbert problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a recently found class of non-BPS black hole solutions with asymptotically $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ in type IIB supergravity, consisting of multiple BTZ black holes localized on an $S^3$, within the group theoretical framework of Breitenlohner and Maison (BM). Starting with the multi-neutral black string solution as a seed, we solve the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem for the BM linear system. First, we determine the monodromy matrix corresponding to this seed solution by generalizing the early work of Katsimpouri et al. on the four-charged black hole of STU supergravity, where some assumptions must be relaxed for the solutions with multiple horizons. By applying the Harrison transformation, a charge-generating transformation in the $SO(4,4)$ group, to the monodromy matrix, we obtain the multi-charged black string solution. Furthermore, through a ``subtraction'' procedure -- an $SO(4,4)$ transformation that changes the asymptotic structure from $R^{1,4}\times S^1\times T^4$ to $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ spacetime -- we derive the multi-BTZ black hole solution. This is the first example in which the subtraction procedure is applied to multiple black holes, and it may also have potential applications to other cases.</description>

      <title>Interior structure of the holographic s + p superconductor and chaotic-stable transition near the black hole singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the interior structure of a holographic multi-band superconductor with the coexistence of s-wave and p-wave order parameters. Especially, we investigate the singularity structure of this multi-band model. Different from the single p-wave case, the alternation rule is jointly determined by parameters involving both s-wave order and p-wave order. In the coexistence region, we derive the Kasner alternation laws from both analytical and numerical methods which fit each other nicely. Furthermore, we find that the occurrence of the s-wave order parameter will lead to a chaotic-stable transition for the near singularity structure which matches the expectation of cosmological billiard approach. This novel transition for the near singularity structure constitutes a holographic counterpart of the secondary condensation in boundary superconducting system, offering a complementary perspective for characterizing the properties of boundary condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Effective action of bosonic string theory at order $\alpha'^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive the classical effective action of bosonic string theory at order $\alpha'^{3}$ for the metric, Kalb-Ramond field, and dilaton by imposing a higher-derivative extension of the Buscher rules on the circular reduction of the minimal basis at this order, in the schemes where their corresponding actions at order $\alpha'$ are the Meissner and the Metsaev-Tseytlin schemes. We find that T-duality fixes all coupling constants in terms of the known overall factor at order $\alpha'$ and a single remaining parameter. This final parameter is determined by matching the single-trace term $\Tr(\epsilon \epsilon \epsilon \epsilon)$ in the four-graviton S-matrix element which lacks a massless pole, with the corresponding string theory amplitude. Our results for the Riemann quartic terms are in full agreement with those obtained from the nonlinear sigma-model approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the arguments of Maldacena and N\'u\~nez to include higher co-dimension brane setups and derive a new no-go theorem. Specifically, we show that under reasonable assumptions on the energy-momentum conservation and the bulk curvature, co-dimension-two branes fail to support stable de Sitter solutions. For co-dimensions higher than two embedded in a compact internal space, we show that negative tension sources would be required. This result places strong constraints on the viability of higher-dimensional braneworld models as a means to obtain de Sitter space within string theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study energy transport in a conformal junction connecting three 2D conformal field theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The holographic dual consists of three AdS$_3$ spacetimes joined along the worldsheet of a tensile string anchored at the junction. Within a specific range of string tension, where the bulk solution is uniquely determined, we find that all energy reflection and transmission coefficients vary monotonically with the string tension. Notably, the total energy transmission, which quantifies the energy flux from one CFT through the junction, is bounded above by the effective central charge associated with both the CFTs and the junction. Results for energy transport in conformal interfaces are recovered in a special limit. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to junctions connecting $N$ 2D CFTs.</description>

      <title>Continuous spin superparticle model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new model of a particle propagating in $4D$, ${\cal N}=1$ superspace that describes the dynamics of a continuous spin irreducible representation of the Poincar\'{e} supergroup. The model is characterized by two-component Weyl spinor additional even variables playing the role of extra coordinates. A canonical formulation, specific local fermionic $\kappa$-symmetry, and a compete system of bosonic and fermionic constraints are derived. All bosonic constrains are first-class, while fermionic constraints are a mixture of first and second classes. Using additional variables inherent in to the model, we split the fermionic constraints into first and second classes in a covariant way. Quantization of the model is carried out according to Dirac prescription imposing all the first-class constraints and half of the second-class constraints (Gupta-Bleuler procedure) on the wave function. At quantization, the fermionic constraints are written in terms of spinor supercovariant derivatives acting on superfields. The corresponding wave function, which is either a chiral or antichiral superfield, depends on additional variables and obeys the superfield constraints that define the continuous spin irreducible representation of the Poincar\'{e} supergroup in the superspace.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the anomaly indices of 4d Weyl fermions with symmetry $\mathrm{Spin}\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\mathrm{Spin}\times_{\mathbb{Z}_2}\mathbb{Z}_{2m}$ by reducing the continuous $\mathrm{Spin} \times \mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathrm{Spin}^c$ anomaly indices on five-dimensional manifolds to discrete sectors subject to flux quantization. We calculate the values of the 5d invertible theories on the corresponding manifold generators. We express the values of the 5d invertible theories on general manifolds in terms of their values on the manifold generators.</description>

      <title>Carroll Geometry Meets De Sitter Space via Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain how to relate the ideas of Carroll geometry, matrix theory on instantonic objects, and infinite boost limits of M-theory. Based on these new insights, we explore the implications for possible holographic constructions involving a de Sitter or flat space bulk. We show that Carroll-like geometry in a hypothetical de Sitter holography mirrors the recently realized important role played by Galilei-like geometry in matrix theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence. This also allows us to generate examples of holography with a Carroll-like bulk.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Symmetry Breaking and Interactions in a Symmetry Protected Topological Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the one dimensional massive Thirring model or equivalently the sine-Gordon model in the repulsive regime with general Dirichlet boundary conditions, which are characterized by two boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}$ associated with the left and right boundaries respectively. In the presence of these boundary fields, which explicitly break the charge conjugation symmetry, the system exhibits a duality symmetry which changes the sign of the mass parameter $m_0$ and shifts the values of the boundary fields by $\phi_{L,R}\rightarrow \phi_{L,R}+\pi$. When the mass parameter $m_0&lt;0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=0$, or equivalently due to duality symmetry, when the mass parameter $m_0&gt;0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=\pi$, the system is at a trivial point. Here, the ground state is unique just as in the case of periodic boundary conditions. In contrast, when the mass parameter $m_0&lt;0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=\pi$, and equivalently due to the duality symmetry, when the mass parameter $m_0&gt;0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=0$, the system is at a topological point where it exhibits a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, which is characterized by the existence of zero energy bound states at both the boundaries. For a given value of the mass parameter $m_0$, we find that these phases remain stable in the presence of symmetry breaking fields at the boundary, provided they are smaller than certain critical values which depend on the strength of the interactions in the bulk. Hence, we show that the stability of the SPT and trivial phases depends on the interplay of the symmetry breaking boundary field values and the bulk interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Open-closed 3d gravity as a random ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an ensemble of boundary CFTs within the framework of a tensor model recently constructed to model 3d quantum gravity. The incorporation of CFT borders introduces new elements to the gravity theory. In particular, it leads to an open-closed extension of Virasoro TQFT, which in the classical limit gives rise to 3d gravity with tensionful end-of-the-world branes. It also provides predictions for off-shell manifolds with bordered asymptotic boundaries, such as the annulus wormhole. As an application, we construct a purely open variant of the tensor model to study a purely open bootstrap problem in the context of CFT triangulation. We also briefly discuss the extension to non-orientable CFTs.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Complexity of Radon transforms and the hybrid functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18911v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the reconstruction problem, the universal representation of inverse Radon transforms may imply the needed complexity of the direct Radon transforms which leads to the additional contributions. Meanwhile, in the standard theory of generalized functions, if the origin function which generates the Radon image is a pure-real function, as a rule the complexity of Radon transform becomes in question. In the letter, we demonstrate that the Fourier method together with the hybrid (Wigner-like) function ensure naturally the corresponding complexity. In its turn, this complexity provides not only the additional contribution to the inverse Radon transforms, but also it makes an essential impact on the reconstruction and optimization procedures within the frame of the incorrect problems. The presented method can be effectively used for the practical tasks of reconstruction problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phases of a strongly coupled QCD-like theory at finite baryon chemical potential using s-confining supersymmetric QCD deformed by anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Focusing on the case of three colors and four flavors, we identify novel phases including spontaneous breaking of baryon number and/or parity. Both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed as the baryon chemical potential is varied. These findings may offer insights into possible phases of real QCD at intermediate baryon densities.</description>

      <title>Universal framework with exponential speedup for the quantum simulation of quantum field theories including QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum simulation framework universally applicable to a wide class of quantum systems, including quantum field theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, we generalize an efficient quantum simulation protocol developed for bosonic theories in [Halimeh et al., arXiv:2411.13161] which, when applied to Yang-Mills theory, demonstrated an exponential resource advantage with respect to the truncation level of the bosonic modes, to systems with both bosons and fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transform and also the Verstraete-Cirac transform. We apply this framework to QCD using the orbifold lattice formulation and achieve an exponential speedup compared to previous proposals. As a by-product, exponential speedup is achieved in the quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, the latter being a special limit of the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian. In the case of Hamiltonian time evolution of a theory on an $L^d$ spatial lattice via Trotterization, one Trotter step can be realized using $\mathcal{O}(L^d)$ numbers of CNOT gates, Hadamard gates, phase gates, and one-qubit rotations. We show this analytically for any matter content and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge group with any $N$. Even when we use the Jordan-Wigner transform, we can utilize the cancellation of quantum gates to significantly simplify the quantum circuit. We also discuss a block encoding of the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of unitaries using the Verstraete-Cirac transform. Our protocols do not assume oracles, but rather present explicit constructions with rigorous resource estimations without a hidden cost, and are thus readily implementable on a quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system in the course of a gedanken scattering experiment. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the initial state and the scattering matrix that guarantee that the subsystem entropy increases. The class of states that meet these criteria are more correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by classical processes alone.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Unified Field Theory of Gravity and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a holomorphic framework in which gravity, gauge interactions, and their couplings to charges and currents emerge from a single geometric action on a four-complex-dimensional manifold. The Hermitian metric yields on the real slice $y^\mu = 0$, a real symmetric metric $g_{(\mu \nu)}$ giving the vacuum Einstein equations, and an antisymmetric part $g_{[\mu \nu]}$ that reproduces Maxwell's equations with sources. A single holomorphic gauge connection for $G_{\text{GUT}}$, such as $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$, encodes all gauge sectors; its Bianchi identities give homogeneous Yang--Mills equations, and variation imposes $\nabla_\mu F^{\mu \nu}_A = J^\nu_A$. Chiral fermions arise from a holomorphic Dirac Lagrangian and couple minimally to all gauge fields, reproducing the Standard Model spectrum. Anomaly cancellation follows from holomorphic gauge invariance. A holomorphic adjoint Higgs breaks $G_{\text{GUT}} \rightarrow SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ with unified coupling, and a second Higgs breaks electroweak symmetry, generating $W^\pm$, $Z$, and fermion masses. Below the unification scale, couplings run by standard renormalization-group flow. This construction unifies Einstein gravity, Yang--Mills theory, electromagnetism, and chiral fermions into a single classical geometric framework, and admits quantization via a holomorphic path integral that reproduces standard Feynman rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the range of validity of the semiclassical approximation of a quantum master equation designed to describe the $c\bar{c}$ dynamics in a quark gluon plasma at various temperatures, in the quantum Brownian regime. We perform a comparative study of various properties, e.g. the charmonia yield, of the Wigner density obtained with the Lindblad equation and with the associated semiclassical Fokker-Planck equation. The semiclassical description is found to reproduce with a remarkable accuracy the results obtained through the full quantum description. We show that, to a large extent, this can be attributed to the non-unitary components of the dynamics that result from the contact of the $c\bar{c}$ subsystem with the thermal bath, leading to a rapid classicalization of the subsystem.</description>

      <title>Assessing the accuracy of the GENIE event generator with electron scattering data: Reduced cross section and nuclear transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduced cross sections of the semi-exclusive $(l,l'p)$ lepton scattering process can be identified with distorted nuclear spectral functions. Irrespective of the type of interaction the distorted spectral function is determined mainly by intrinsic properties of the target and the ejected nucleon interaction with residual nucleus. Thus the reduced cross sections of the neutrino and electron scattering on nuclei as functions of nucleon missing momentum and energy are similar up to Coulomb corrections. Here we demonstrate the utility of this approach by benchmarking the GENIE neutrino event generator against a broad set of semi-exclusive electron scattering data for carbon target. We observe persistent disagreements between the generator predictions and data in the range of nucleon missing momenta less than 80 MeV/c. The approach presented in this paper provide a great opportunity to test better the accuracy of nuclear models of quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, employed in neutrino event generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rates for particle interaction processes and decays will be modified in a Lorentz-violating quantum field theory, because of changes to the particle kinematics$-$particularly through the modified dispersion relations affecting the outgoing particle phase space. We outline here these changes to the rates for three-particle decays. Considering a process with a constant scattering amplitude (not directly modified by the Lorentz violation), we calculate leading order corrections to the kinematics for a decay into three identical spinless particles whose propagation is affected by a $c_{\mu\nu}$-type symmetric tensor background. We examine the angular distribution of the daughter particles and describe the shape of the corresponding Dalitz plot outlining the kinematically allowed region, according to two toy models for the $c_{\mu\nu}$ textures. Precision measurements of the boundaries of this region could be used to constrain Lorentz violation coefficients for the particles involved in processes such as $\eta\rightarrow 3\pi^{0}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Blume-Capel model in the scaling limit to realize the thermal perturbation of the tricritical Ising fixed point. We develop a numerical scaling-limit extrapolation for one-point functions and R\'enyi entropies in the ground state. In a mass quench scenario, we found long-living oscillations despite the absence of explicit spin-flip symmetry breaking or confining potential. We construct form factors of branch-point twist fields in the paramagnetic phase. In the scaling limit of small quenches, we verify form factor predictions for (i) the energy density and leading magnetic field using the dynamics of one-point functions, and (ii) branch-point twist fields using the dynamics of R\'enyi entropies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new formulation of non-dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics that incorporates spin degrees of freedom into the divergence-type theory framework. Due to the divergence-type structure, it is straightforward to enforce non-linear causality and symmetric hyperbolicity of the equations of motion, ensuring local well-posedness of the initial-value problem and stability of the theory. Furthermore, in a specific realization based on spin kinetic theory, we prove that the equations of motion remain non-linearly causal and symmetric-hyperbolic to all orders in the spin potential, provided a specific thermodynamic constraint is satisfied. This framework can be applied for numerical simulations to study the dynamics of spin-polarized fluids, such as the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been revealed that, in curved black-hole spacetimes, non-minimally coupled massive Proca fields may be characterized by the existence of poles in their linearized perturbation equations and may therefore develop exponentially growing instabilities. Interestingly, recent numerical computations [H. W. Chiang, S. Garcia-Saenz, and A. Sang, arXiv:2504.04779] have provided compelling evidence that the onset of monopole instabilities in the composed black-hole-field system is controlled by the dimensionless physical parameter $\mu r_-$, where $\mu$ is the proper mass of the non-minimally coupled Proca field and $r_-\equiv (-2\alpha)^{1/3}r_{\text{H}}$ is the radial location of the pole [here $\alpha$ is the non-minimal coupling parameter of the Einstein-Proca theory and $r_{\text{H}}$ is the radius of the black-hole horizon]. In the present paper we use {\it analytical} techniques in order to explore the physical properties of critical (marginally-stable) composed Schwarzschild-black-hole-nonminimally-coupled-monopole-Proca-field configurations. In particular, we derive a remarkably compact analytical formula for the discrete spectrum $\{\mu(r_{\text{H}},r_-;n) \}^{n=\infty}_{n=1}$ of Proca field masses which characterize the critical black-hole-monopole-Proca-field configurations in the dimensionless regime ${{r_- -r_{\text{H}}}\over{r_{\text{H}}}}\ll1$ of near-horizon poles. The physical significance of the analytically derived resonance spectrum stems from the fact that the critical field mass $\mu_{\text{c}}\equiv\mu(r_{\text{H}},r_-;n=1)$ marks the onset of instabilities in the Schwarzschild-black-hole-nonminimally-coupled-monopole-Proca-field system. In particular, composed black-hole-linearized-Proca-field configurations in the small-mass regime $\mu\leq\mu_{\text{c}}$ of the Proca field are stable.</description>

      <title>Self-dualities and Galois symmetries in Feynman integrals</title>

Abstract: It is well-known that all Feynman integrals within a given family can be expressed as a finite linear combination of master integrals. The master integrals naturally group into sectors. Starting from two loops, there can exist sectors made up of more than one master integral. In this paper we show that such sectors may have additional symmetries. First of all, self-duality, which was first observed in Feynman integrals related to Calabi--Yau geometries, often carries over to non-Calabi--Yau Feynman integrals. Secondly, we show that in addition there can exist Galois symmetries relating integrals. In the simplest case of two master integrals within a sector, whose definition involves a square root $r$, we may choose a basis $(I_1,I_2)$ such that $I_2$ is obtained from $I_1$ by the substitution $r \rightarrow -r$. This pattern also persists in sectors, which a priori are not related to any square root with dependence on the kinematic variables. We show in several examples that in such cases a suitable redefinition of the integrals introduces constant square roots like $\sqrt{3}$. The new master integrals are then again related by a Galois symmetry, for example the substitution $\sqrt{3} \rightarrow -\sqrt{3}$. To handle the case where the argument of a square root would be a perfect square we introduce a limit Galois symmetry. Both self-duality and Galois symmetries constrain the differential equation.</description>

      <title>Finite Landscape of 6d N=(1,0) Supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a bottom-up argument showing that the number of massless fields in six-dimensional quantum gravitational theories with eight supercharges is uniformly bounded. Specifically, we show that the number of tensor multiplets is bounded by $T\leq 193$, and the rank of the gauge group is restricted to $r(V)\leq 480$. Given that F-theory compactifications on elliptic CY 3-folds are a subset, this provides a bound on the Hodge numbers of elliptic CY 3-folds: $h^{1,1}({\rm CY_3})\leq 491$, $h^{1,1}({\rm Base})\leq 194$ which are saturated by special elliptic CY 3-folds. This establishes that our bounds are sharp and also provides further evidence for the string lamppost principle. These results are derived by a comprehensive examination of the boundaries of the tensor moduli branch, showing that any consistent supergravity theory with $T\neq0$ must include a BPS string in its spectrum corresponding to a "little string theory" (LST) or a critical heterotic string. From this tensor branch analysis, we establish a containment relationship between SCFTs and LSTs embedded within a gravitational theory. Combined with the classification of 6d SCFTs and LSTs, this then leads to the above bounds. Together with previous works, this establishes the finiteness of the supergravity landscape for $d\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Surface Defects in $A$-type Little String Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $A$-type Little String Theories (LSTs) are engineered from parallel M5-branes on a circle $\mathbb{S}_\perp^1$, probing a transverse $\mathbb{R}^4/\mathbb{Z}_M$ background. Below the scale of the radius of $\mathbb{S}_\perp^1$, these theories resemble a circular quiver gauge theory with $M$ nodes of gauge group $U(N)$ and matter in the bifundamental representation (or adjoint in the case of $M=1$). In this paper, we study these LSTs in the presence of a surface defect, which is introduced through the action of a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold that breaks the gauge groups into $[U(1)]^N$. We provide a combinatoric expression for the non-perturbative BPS partition function for this system. This form allows us to argue that a number of non-perturbative symmetries, that have previously been established for the LSTs, are preserved in the presence of the defect. Furthermore, we discuss the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit of the defect partition function: focusing in detail on the case $(M,N)=(1,2)$, we analyse two distinct proposals made in the literature. We unravel an algebraic structure that is responsible for the cancellation of singular terms in the NS limit, which we generalise to generic $(M,N)$. In view of the dualities of higher dimensional gauge theories to quantum many-body systems, we provide indications that our combinatoric expression for the defect partition are useful in constructing and analysing quantum integrable systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Timelike and gravitational anomalous entanglement from the inner horizon</title>

Abstract: In the context of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, the boundary causal development and the entanglement wedge of any boundary spacelike interval can be mapped to a thermal CFT$_2$ and a Rindler $\widetilde{\text{AdS}_3}$ respectively via certain boundary and bulk Rindler transformations. Nevertheless, the Rindler mapping is not confined in the entanglement wedges. While the outer horizon of the Rindler $\widetilde{\text{AdS}_3}$ is mapped to the RT surface, we also identify the pre-image of the inner horizon in the original AdS$_3$, which we call the inner RT surface. In this paper we give some new physical interpretation for the inner RT surface. First, the inner RT surface breaks into two pieces which anchor on the two tips of the causal development. Furthermore, we can take the two tips as the endpoints of a certain timelike interval and the inner RT surface is exactly the spacelike geodesic that represents the real part of the so-called holographic timelike entanglement entropy (HTEE). We also identify a timelike geodesic at boundary of the extended entanglement wedge, which represents the imaginary part of the HTEE. Second, in the duality between the topological massive gravity (TMG) and gravitational anomalous CFT$_2$, the entanglement entropy and the mixed state correlation that is dual to the entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) receive correction from the Chern-Simons term in the TMG. We find that, the correction to the holographic entanglement entropy can be reproduced by the area of the inner RT surface with a proper regulation, while the mixed state correlation can be represented by the saddle geodesic chord connecting the two pieces of the inner RT surface of the mixed state we consider, which we call the inner EWCS. The equivalence between the twist on the RT surface and the length of inner RT surface is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Higher Form and Higher Group Symmetries via Mirror Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09967v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we uncover a connection that relates the 1-form and the 2-group symmetries of 5D SCFTs derived from geometric engineering methods to monodromies of the corresponding B-models via mirror symmetry. Viewing defects as branes wrapping relative cycles in a non-compact CY3, we find that the defect groups can be read off from the VEVs of the corresponding line operators at the leading order. Via mirror map, we find that both the 1-form and the 2-group symmetries of the SCFT are related to the monodromy at the large radius point in the B-model. Additionally, we recursively obtain closed-form expressions of instanton expansions of the VEV of Wilson lines of certain 5D theories among which some have not been obtained so far using localization methods. We further conjecture that the 2-group symmetry is given by the Mordell-Weil torsion of the universal special geometry associated to the theory, generalizing the conjecture for rank-1 theories.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</description>

      <title>AdS$_3$ Carroll gravity: asymptotic symmetries and C-thermal configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic structure of three-dimensional Carroll gravity with negative cosmological constant is studied. We formulate a consistent set of boundary conditions preserved by an infinite-dimensional extension of the AdS$_3$ Carroll algebra, which turns out to be isomorphic to a precise generalized BMS$_3$ algebra. This is described by four independent functions of the circle at infinity, generating spatial superrotations, Carroll superboosts, spatial supertranslations and time supertranslations. Remarkably, this asymptotic symmetry algebra contains as subalgebras to BMS$_3$ (generated by spatial superrotations and time supertranslations) and the two-dimensional conformal algebra (spanned by spatial superrotations and spatial supertranslations). We also introduce a new solution - endowed with a Carroll extremal surface - that fulfills this set of asymptotic conditions. By taking advantage of the Chern-Simons formulation of the theory, Carroll thermal properties, obtained from regularity conditions, and entropy of the configuration are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Local uniqueness of the Black String with small circle size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study uniqueness of the Black String, i.e. the product of 4-dimensional Schwarzschild space with a circle of length L.
  In arXiv:2410.20967, this was reduced to a non-linear elliptic PDE, and we use this setup to show that for small L the Black String is infinitesimally rigid as a Ricci-flat metric.
  Using a fixed point theorem, we prove that this implies local uniqueness, i.e. there exist no other Ricci-flat metrics near the Black String, and we give bounds for the size of the neighborhood in which the Black String is unique.
  We compare this with the toy problem of a scalar field satisfying an elliptic equation that was already solved in arXiv:2410.20967 using different methods.
  In this case we can use the fixed point theorem method to prove not just a local but a global statement.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of a perfectly conducting plate on the Uehling potential of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), corresponding to the first loop correction to the classical Coulomb potential in that situation. We use the method of images adapted to the photon propagator, extending the method beyond the standard (classical) tree level calculation. We show that the effect of the plate on the quantum correction is much stronger than the expectation from a naive application of the method of images.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the glueball-fermion hard-scattering amplitude from the dilaton-dilatino closed string scattering amplitude in type IIB superstring theory, in the framework of the gauge/string theory duality. We investigate its high-energy scaling at fixed angle and also in the Regge limit. We derive the leading and sub-leading terms contributing to the scattering cross section. This dual calculation of the glueball-fermion scattering amplitude is particularly interesting since it involves the scattering of two different types of external states. We calculate explicitly some angular integrals for two scalar spherical harmonics and two spinor spherical harmonics on the five-sphere, leading to selection rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a lot of interest in Carroll black holes and in particular whether or not one could find a Carrollian analogue of a rotating black hole spacetime. Here we show that every stationary and axisymmetric solution (and thence also a black hole) of Carrollian general relativity in any number of $d&gt;3$ dimensions is necessarily also static (up to a "topological rotation"). The case of $d=3$ dimensions is special. There, the topological rotation is important and one can have a rotating Carroll BTZ black hole, obtained from a static one by the Carroll boost accompanied by the re-identification of the angular coordinate, similar to what happens in the Lorentzian case. We also find a Carrollian analogue of an accelerating black hole, showing that Schwarzschild is not the only possible stationary and axisymmetric Carroll black hole in four dimensions. A generalization of the no go theorem to include Maxwell, dilatonic, and axionic matter fields is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Decorating Asymptotically Flat Space-Time with the Moduli Space of String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: N=2, 4 and 8 supersymmetric string theories in four dimensional flat space-time have moduli space of vacua. We argue that starting from a theory where the moduli approach a particular moduli space point A at infinity, we can construct a classical solution that contains an arbitrarily large space-time region where the moduli take values corresponding to any other moduli space point B of our choice to any desired accuracy. Therefore the observables of a theory with a given set of asymptotic values of the moduli will have complete information on the observables for any other asymptotic values of the moduli. Also it is physically impossible for any experiment, performed over a finite time, to determine the asymptotic values of the moduli. We point out the difference between asymptotically flat space-time and asymptotically AdS space-time in this regard and discuss the possible implication of these results for holographic duals of string theories in flat space-time. For N=2 supersymmetric theories, A and B could correspond to compactifications on topologically distinct Calabi-Yau manifolds related by flop or conifold transitions.</description>

Abstract: We pave the way for future gravitational-wave detection experiments, such as the Big Bang Observer and DECIGO, to constrain dark sectors made of SU(N) Yang-Mills confined theories. We go beyond the state-of-the-art by combining first principle lattice results and effective field theory approaches to infer essential information about the non-perturbative dark deconfinement phase transition driving the generation of gravitational-waves in the early universe, such as the order, duration and energy budget of the phase transition which are essential in establishing the strength of the resulting gravitational-wave signal.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor potentials in loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform in this work an analysis of the background dynamics for $\alpha$-attractor models in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Particular attention is given to the determination of the duration of the inflationary phase that is preceded by the quantum bounce in these models. From an analysis of the general predictions for these models, it is shown that we can be able to put constraints in the parameter $\alpha$ of the potentials and also on the quantum model itself, especially the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. In particular, the constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral tilt of the cosmological perturbations limit the $\alpha$ parameter of the potentials to values such that $\alpha_{n=0} \lesssim 10$, $\alpha_{n=1} \lesssim 17$ and $\alpha_{n=2} \lesssim 67$, for the $\alpha$ attractors T, E, and $n=2$ models, respectively. Using the constraints on the minimal amount of e-folds of expansion from the quantum bounce up to the end of inflation leads to the upper bounds for the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for the $\alpha$-attractor models studied in this work: $\gamma_{n=0} \lesssim 51.2$, $\gamma_{n=1}\lesssim 63.4$ and $\gamma_{n=2} \lesssim 64.2$, which are obtained when fixing the parameter $\alpha$ in the potential at the values saturating the upper bounds given above for each model.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

      <title>Exceeding the maximum classical energy density in fully charged quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are anticipated to achieve significant advancements in energy storage capacity. In classical batteries, the energy density at each subsystem reaches its maximum value, denoted as $E_C$, which is determined by dividing the maximum energy by the number of subsystems. We demonstrate that this limit can be surpassed in quantum batteries by protocols of Quantum Energy Teleportaion (QET), allowing for the energy density at a subsystem to exceed the value of $E_C$. Our protocol offers enhanced efficiency, reduces experimental complexity on quantum computers, and enables instantaneous energy charging through Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). Leveraging quantum entanglement, this protocol significantly improves quantum energy storage systems, promising advances in quantum computing and new technological applications. This work represents a crucial step towards revolutionizing quantum energy storage and transfer.</description>

      <title>Machines and Mathematical Mutations: Using GNNs to Characterize Quiver Mutation Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in mathematics, enabling one to identify subtle patterns across collections of examples so vast that they would be impossible for a single researcher to feasibly review and analyze. In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate \emph{quiver mutation} -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph) into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster algebras, the question of \emph{mutation equivalence} is of fundamental concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? In this paper, we use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to independently discover mutation equivalence criteria for quivers of type $\tilde{D}$. Along the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to reconstruct known criteria from type $D$, adding to the growing evidence that modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and parsimonious rules from mathematical data.</description>

      <title>Estimating energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions using a transfer matrix formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for extracting energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions by computing the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix associated with the lattice QCD Hamiltonian. While mathematically and numerically equivalent to the recently introduced Lanczos procedure, our approach introduces a novel prescription for removing spurious eigenvalues using a kernel density estimator (KDE) and Gaussian-convoluted histogram method. This strategy yields a robust and stable estimate of the energy spectrum, outperforming the Cullum-Willoughby filtering technique in efficiency. In addition, we detail how this method can be applied to extract overlap factors from two-point correlation functions, as well as matrix elements from three-point functions with a current insertion. Furthermore, we extend the methodology to accommodate correlation matrices constructed from a variational basis of operators, with its Block formulation. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework by computing the two lowest energy levels for a broad range of hadrons, including several nuclei. Although the signal-to-noise ratio is not significantly improved, the extracted energy levels are found to be more reliable than those obtained with conventional techniques. Within a given statistical ensemble, the proposed method effectively captures both statistical uncertainties and systematic errors, including those arising from the choice of fitting window, making it a robust and practical tool for lattice QCD analysis.</description>

      <title>Unexpected shape of the primordial black hole mass function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a Universe with nearly-Gaussian initial curvature perturbations, the abundance of primordial black holes can be derived from the curvature power spectrum. When the latter is enhanced within a narrow range around a characteristic scale, the resulting mass function has a single distinct peak, corresponding to Schwarzschild radii set by the horizon entry time of that scale. In contrast, we show (both numerically and by providing an analytic estimation) that a broad enhancement - such as a plateau bounded by infrared and ultraviolet scales - produces a bimodal mass function, with a primary peak close to the infrared scale. We find that the typical initial gravitational potential (compaction function), conditioned on meeting the threshold for critical collapse, is generated by a thin spherical shell with infrared radius and a thickness comparable to the ultraviolet scale. This suggests a higher-than-expected abundance of PBH originating from Type II initial fluctuations. Our results significantly impact overproduction bounds on the amplitude of the power spectrum, and tighten the viable mass range for primordial black holes as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Topological Sum Rules and Spectral Flows of Chiral and Gravitational Axion-like Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03182v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the structure of off-shell effective actions arising from chiral and gravitational anomalies, focusing on the $JJJ_A$ (axial-vector/vector/vector) and $J_A TT $ (axial-vector/stress-energy tensors) correlators, relevant in the analysis of anomaly-driven interactions in perturbation theory. Our approach relies on conformal field theory in momentum space, extended to chiral anomalies. The analysis centers on the presence of both particle poles and anomaly poles within these interactions, characterizing their behavior both in the conformal and non conformal limits. Through explicit computations, we show that universal sum rules in the longitudinal sector regulate these interactions for all kinematic conditions, extending previous analysis, and we discuss the resulting spectral flow, an area law of the absorptive part of the anomaly form factors as one moves away from or returns to the conformal point. These features are absent in the local effective action of anomaly interactions, commonly used in the description of axion-like particles. The spectral densities in both cases are shown to be self-similar. Our results further show that anomaly poles correspond to true particle poles only in the conformal limit, when the interaction describes a massless S-matrix process supported on a null-surface. Under these conditions, they can be effectively described by two kinetically mixed pseudoscalar fields propagating on the light-cone. These studies find application in polarized deeply inelastic scattering, axion-like dark matter and analogue systems such as topological materials.</description>

      <title>Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) system at integer index $k$: polynomial algebras of integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite 3-parametric family of superintegrable and exactly-solvable quantum models on a plane, admitting separation of variables in polar coordinates, marked by integer index $k$ was introduced in Journ Phys A 42 (2009) 242001 and was called in literature the TTW system. In this paper it is conjectured that the Hamiltonian and both integrals of TTW system have hidden algebra $g^{(k)}$ - it was checked for $k=1,2,3,4$ - having its finite-dimensional representation spaces as the invariant subspaces. It is checked that for $k=1,2,3,4$ that the Hamiltonian $H$, two integrals ${\cal I}_{1,2}$ and their commutator ${\cal I}_{12} = [{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2]$ are four generating elements of the polynomial algebra of integrals of the order $(k+1)$: $[{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_{12}] = P_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, $[{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_{12}] = Q_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, where $P_{k+1},Q_{k+1}$ are polynomials of degree $(k+1)$ written in terms of ordered monomials of $H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12}$. This implies that polynomial algebra of integrals is subalgebra of $g^{(k)}$. It is conjectured that all is true for any integer $k$.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.</description>

      <title>Horizons, throats and bounces in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with a non-zero potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work conducts an in-depth exploration of exact electrically charged solutions, including traversable wormholes, black holes, and black bounces, within the framework of the scalar-tensor representation of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) with a non-zero scalar potential. By integrating principles from both the metric and Palatini formulations, HMPG provides a flexible approach to addressing persistent challenges in General Relativity (GR), such as the late-time cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark matter. Under the assumption of spherical symmetry, we employ an inverse problem technique to derive exact solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. This method naturally leads to configurations involving either canonical or phantom scalar fields. A thorough examination of horizon structures, throat conditions, asymptotic behaviour, and curvature regularity (via the Kretschmann scalar) reveals the intricate causal structures permitted by this theoretical model. The analysis uncovers a diverse range of geometric configurations, with the phantom sector exhibiting a notably richer spectrum of solutions than the canonical case. These solutions encompass traversable wormholes, black universe models, where the interior of a black hole evolves into an expanding cosmological phase rather than a singularity, as well as black bounce structures and multi-horizon black holes. The results demonstrate that introducing a non-zero scalar potential within HMPG significantly expands the array of possible gravitational solutions, yielding complex causal and curvature properties that go beyond standard GR. Consequently, HMPG stands out as a powerful theoretical framework for modelling extreme astrophysical environments, where deviations from classical gravity are expected to play a crucial role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the progress on exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models from a perspective of their application to competing reactions of particle creation from a false vacuum. Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, and for nearly the same other particle parameters, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven bosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify this effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its universality class.</description>

      <title>A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>3-dimensional charged black holes in $f({Q})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new exact charged black hole solutions in (2+1) dimensions within the framework of $f({Q})$ gravity, where ${Q}$ denotes the non-metricity scalar. By considering a cubic $f({Q})$ form we derive classes of charged and uncharged spherically symmetric solutions, and we identify conditions under which these reduce to the well-known Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. Notably, our analysis reveals a novel charged solution that is asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) but cannot be continuously deformed into a GR counterpart, and thus arising purely from the
  higher-order nature of the non-metricity corrections. Furthermore, we explore the geometrical properties of the solutions, demonstrating the existence of multiple horizons and a softer central singularity compared to GR. Additionally, we calculate various thermodynamic quantities, such as Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, with results confirming thermal stability. Finally, a detailed study of the geodesic motion and the effective potentials unveils stable photon orbits, as well as the effect of cubic non-metricity corrections on orbital dynamics.</description>
