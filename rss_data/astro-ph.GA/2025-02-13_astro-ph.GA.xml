      <title>Mapping Synthetic Observations to Prestellar Core Models: An Interpretable Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of molecular lines are a key tool to determine the main physical properties of prestellar cores. However, not all the information is retained in the observational process or easily interpretable, especially when a larger number of physical properties and spectral features are involved. We present a methodology to link the information in the synthetic spectra with the actual information in the simulated models (i.e., their physical properties), in particular, to determine where the information resides in the spectra. We employ a 1D gravitational collapse model with advanced thermochemistry, from which we generate synthetic spectra. We then use neural network emulations and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a machine learning technique, to connect the models' properties to the specific spectral features. Thanks to interpretable machine learning, we find several correlations between synthetic lines and some of the key model parameters, such as the cosmic-ray ionization radial profile, the central density, or the abundance of various species, suggesting that most of the information is retained in the observational process. Our procedure can be generalized to similar scenarios to quantify the amount of information lost in the real observations. We also point out the limitations for future applicability.</description>

      <title>Investigating photometric and spectroscopic variability in the multiply-imaged Little Red Dot A2744-QSO1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07875v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is a unique test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the $z=7.045$ multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to $18\pm3$ % for H$\alpha$ and up to $22\pm8$ % in H$\beta$, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}=4\times10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.</description>

      <title>The stellar mass composition of galaxy clusters and dependencies on dark matter halo properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze 700 clusters from the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulation ($M_{200}\geq5\times10^{13} \,M_{\odot}$ at (z=0)) to examine the radial stellar mass distribution of their central objects, consisting of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intracluster light (ICL). The BCG+ICL mass fraction weakly anticorrelates with $M_{200}$, but strongly correlates with the concentration, $c_{200}$, the assembly redshift, $z_{50}$, and the mass gap between the most massive and the fourth more massive member, $\Delta M_{\rm \ast, 4th}$. We explore different aperture radii to nominally separate the ICL from the BCG and calculate ICL fractions. For $r_{\rm{ap}}=2r_{\rm half}$, where $r_{\rm half}$ is the radius containing half the BCG+ICL mass, the ICL fraction is nearly independent of $M_{200}$, $c_{200}$, and $z_{50}$ with values $M_{\ast,\rm ICL}/(M_{\ast,\rm ICL}+M_{\ast,\rm BCG})= 0.33\pm0.03$. Including the stellar mass of the satellites, the fraction $M_{\ast,\rm ICL}/(M_{\ast,\rm ICL}+M_{\ast,\rm BCG}+M_{\rm \ast,sat})$ weakly anticorrelates with $M_{200}$ and strongly correlates with $c_{200}$, $z_{50}$, and $\Delta M_{\rm \ast, 4th}$, suggesting that in more concentrated/earlier assembled/more relaxed clusters more stellar mass is lost from the satellites (by tidal stripping, and mergers) in favour of the ICL and BCG. Indeed, we find that ex-situ stars dominate both in the BCG and ICL masses, with mergers contributing more to the BCG, while tidal stripping contributes more to the ICL. We find that the difference between the projected and 3D ICL fractions are only a few per cent and suggest using $2r_{\rm half}$ to separate the ICL from the BCG in observed clusters.</description>

      <title>Ly-$\alpha$ processing of solid-state Ethanolamine: Potential Precursors to Sugar and Peptide Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethanolamine (EA), a key component of phospholipids, has recently been detected in the interstellar medium within molecular clouds. To understand this observation, laboratory studies of its formation and destruction are essential and should be complemented by astrochemical models. This study investigates the photostability of EA ice under Lyman (Ly)-$\alpha$ (10.2 eV) irradiation at 10 K, and explores its potential role in the formation of simple and complex organic molecules in molecular clouds. The UV destruction cross section of EA was estimated to be ($4.7\pm0.3)\times10^{-18}$ cm$^2$, providing insight into its half-life of $6.5\times10^{7}$ yr in dense interstellar clouds. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry were used to identify various photoproducts, with their formation pathways discussed. Ethylene glycol and serine were tentatively detected during the warming up process following irradiation, suggesting that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules such as sugars, peptides and their derivatives. High mass signals detected in the mass spectrometer suggest the presence of several complex organic molecules, and further analysis of residues at room temperature is planned for future work. The results suggest that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules in space, with implications for the origin of life.</description>

      <title>What causes the ultraviolet extinction bump at the cosmic dawn?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enigmatic ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom, the strongest spectroscopic absorption feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve, has recently been detected at the cosmic dawn by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z=6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Although small graphite grains have historically long been suggested as the carrier of the 2175 Angstrom extinction bump and graphite grains are expected to have already been pervasive in the early Universe, in this work we demonstrate that small graphite grains are not responsible for the UV extinction bump seen at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, as the extinction bump arising from small graphite grains is too broad and peaks at wavelengths that are too short to be consistent with what is seen in JADES-GS-z6-0.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon and the Ultraviolet Extinction Bump at the Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First detected in 1965, the mysterious ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom is the most prominent spectroscopic feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve. Its carrier remains unidentified over the past six decades ever since its first detection, although many candidate materials have been proposed. Widely seen in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way as well as several nearby galaxies, this bump was recently also detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z~6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Differing from that of the known Galactic and extragalactic interstellar sightlines which always peak at ~2175 Angstrom, the bump seen at z~6.71 in JADES-GS-z6-0 peaks at an appreciably longer wavelength of ~2263 Angstrom and is the narrowest among all known Galactic and extragalactic extinction bumps. Here we show that the combined electronic absorption spectra quantum-chemically computed for a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules closely reproduce the bump detected by JWST in JADES-GS-z6-0. This suggests that PAH molecules have already been pervasive in the Universe at an epoch when asymptotic giant branch stars have not yet evolved to make dust.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Models of the Milky Way in Action Space with LAMOST DR8 and GAIA EDR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08164v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores dynamical models of the Milky Way (MW) by analyzing a sample of 86,109 K giant stars selected through cross-matching the LAMOST DR8 and Gaia EDR3 surveys. Our earlier torus models in Wang et al. (2017) did not include Gaia data, making them incompatible with the new proper motion distributions of samples. Here, we refine the construction of action-based, self-consistent models to constrain the three-dimensional velocity distribution of K giants over a larger parameter space, drawing on a series of existing MW models. This approach produces several new MW models. Our best-fit model for the local kinematics near the Sun indicates a MW virial mass of 1.35 $\times 10^{12} M_\odot$, a local stellar density of 0.0696 $\rm M_\odot pc^{-3}$, and a local dark matter density of 0.0115 $\rm M_\odot pc^{-3}$. Our main conclusion supports a thicker and more extended thick disk, alongside a cooler thin disk, compared to the best-fitting model in Wang et al. (2017). Near the Sun, our model aligns well with observations, but is less satisfactory at distances far from the Galactic center, perhaps implying unidentified structures. Further high-precision observations will be critical for understanding the dynamics in these outer Galactic regions, and will require a more realistic model.</description>

      <title>On the light-curves of disk and bulge novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the light curves of a sample of novae, classifying them into single-peaked and multiple-peaked morphologies. Using accurate distances from Gaia, we determine the spatial distribution of these novae by computing their heights, $Z$, above the Galactic plane. We show that novae exhibiting a single peak in their light curves tend to concentrate near the Galactic plane, while those displaying multiple peaks are more homogeneously distributed, reaching heights up to 1000 pc above the plane. A KS test rejects the null hypothesis that the two distributions originate from the same population at a significance level corresponding to $4.2\sigma$.</description>

      <title>FEASTS: The Fate of Gas and Star Formation in Interacting Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use HI data from the FAST Extended Atlas of Selected Targets Survey (FEASTS) to study the interplay between gas and star formation of galaxies in interacting systems. We build control and mock HI disks and parameterize HI disorder by a series of disorder parameters, describing the piling, clumpiness and expansion of HI. We find that interacting galaxies have higher HI disorder described by almost all disorder parameters. Systems with comparable stellar masses and small relative velocities tend to have stronger expansion and clumpiness of HI. At a given stellar mass, decreased HI and total neutral gas mass and suppressed star formation rate of secondary galaxies are correlated with most disorder parameters. For primary galaxies, HI and total neutral gas deficiency correlate with more HI piling at two ends of the system outside HI disks but not with the expansion or clumpiness of HI. We also find that the HI surface densities of both primary and secondary galaxies are lower within the HI disks and higher outside compared to the control galaxies. Our results suggest that while all the disorder parameters quantify the interaction strength almost equally well, they have different sensitivities in tracing star formation rate and gas mass enhancements. They also imply that while gas removal likely dominates the tidal effects on secondary galaxies, primary galaxies experience more complex situation that are possibly related to gas depletion and accretion happening at different interaction stages.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a diffuse, extended continuum source in quasars from the relative sizes of the broad line region and the UV-optical continuum source measured with microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microlensing by stars in the lens galaxy of a gravitationally lensed quasar is a phenomenon that can selectively magnify quasar subregions, producing observable changes in the continuum brightness or distortions in the emission line profiles. Hence, microlensing allows us to probe the inner quasar regions. In this paper, we report measurements of the ratio of the broad emission line region (BLR) radius to the continuum source radius in eight lensed quasars, for the CIV, MgII, and H$\alpha$ emission lines and their respective underlying continua at $\lambda\lambda$ 1550\AA , 2800\AA , and 6563 \AA . The microlensing-induced line profile distortions and continuum magnifications were observed in the same single-epoch datasets, and simultaneously compared with microlensing simulations. We found that, on average, the inner radius of the BLR starts at the end of the UV-optical continuum source, independently of the line ionization and the wavelength of the continuum. The half-light radius of the BLR is, on average, a factor of six larger than the half-light radius of the continuum source, independently of the quasar's bolometric luminosity. We also found a correlation between the BLR radius and the continuum source radius, supporting the idea that the dominant contribution to the UV-optical continuum may come from the BLR itself. Our results independently confirm the results of reverberation mapping studies, and extend them to higher-redshift, higher-luminosity quasars.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XI. Detection of infrared CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and disk d203-506: evidence of chemical pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The methylidyne cation (CH$^+$) and the methyl cation (CH$_3^+$) are building blocks of organic molecules, yet their coupled formation and excitation mechanisms remain mainly unprobed. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its high spatial resolution and good spectral resolution, provides unique access to the detection of these molecules. Our goal is to use the first detection of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and in the protoplanetary disk d203-506, irradiated by the Trapezium cluster, to probe their formation and excitation mechanisms and constrain the physico-chemical conditions. We use spectro-imaging acquired using both the NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS instruments to study the CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ spatial distribution at very small scales, and compare it to excited H$_2$ emission. CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ emissions originate from the same region as highly excited H$_2$. Our comparison between the Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ excitation and/or formation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of the observed CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational lines is around $T$ ~ 1500 K in the Bar and $T$ ~ 800 K in d203-506. Moreover, the column densities derived from the rovibrational emission are less than 0.1 % of the total known (CH$^+$) and expected (CH$_3^+$) column densities. These results show that CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH$^+$ rovibrational emission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H$_2$ via C$^+$ + H$_2^*$ = CH$^+$ + H. These results support a gas phase formation pathway of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ via successive hydrogen abstraction reactions. However, we do not find any evidence of CH$_2^+$ emission in the JWST spectrum. Finally, observed CH$^+$ intensities coupled with chemical formation pumping model provide a diagnostic tool to trace the local density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present accretion disc size measurements for the well-known quasar 3C 273 using reverberation mapping (RM) performed on high-cadence light-curves in seven optical filters collected with the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO). Lag estimates obtained using Javelin and PyROA are consistent with each other and yield accretion disc sizes a factor of ~2-7 larger than `thin disc' theoretical expectations. This makes 3C 273 one of a growing number of active galactic nuclei (AGN) to display the so-called `accretion disc size' problem usually observed in low-luminosity AGN. Power-law fits of the form tau~lambda^beta to the lag spectrum, and nufnu ~ nu^beta to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the variations, both give results consistent with the `thin disc' theoretical expectation of beta=4/3. The Starkey et al. `flat disc with a steep rim' model can fit both the lag estimates and the SED variations. Extrapolating the observed optical lags to putative dust-forming regions of the disc gives r~100-200 light-days. These radii are consistent with the size of the broad line region (BLR) as determined by near-infrared interferometric studies as well as with the best-fit location of the outer edge for the `flat disc with a steep rim' model. Therefore, the accretion disc in 3C 273 might be sufficiently extended to be dusty, allowing the BLR to emerge from it in a dusty outflow. A flux variation gradient analysis and the structure function of our LCO light-curves confirm that the optical variability in 3C 273 is dominated by the accretion disc rather than its radio jet.</description>

      <title>Searching for Nearby Diffuse Dwarf Galaxies in the COSMOS Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It remains challenging to systematically survey nearby diffuse dwarf galaxies and address the formation mechanism of this population distinguishing from regular ones. We carry out a pilot search for these galaxies in the COSMOS field using the deep \textit{HST}/F814W imaging data. We report three diffuse dwarf galaxies satisfying the criteria: (1) redshift $z&lt;0.2$, (2) effective radius $r_{\rm e}&gt;1.0''$, and (3) central surface brightness $\mu_{\rm 0}&gt;24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. Two of the three galaxies, COSMOS-UDG1 and COSMOS-UDG2, are recognized as ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with redshift $z=0.130$ and $0.049$, respectively. The third galaxy, COSMOS-dw1, is spectroscopically confirmed as a dwarf galaxy at $z=0.004$. We derive the physical properties through fitting their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) extracted from deep multiwavelength observations. COSMOS-dw1 has a stellar mass of $5.6_{-2.7}^{+2.5}\times10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$, harboring neutral hydrogen gas of mass $4.90\pm0.90\times10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$, hinting that this galaxy may be in the nascent stages of quenching. The estimated dynamical mass of $3.4\times10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$ further suggests that COSMOS-dw1 is predominantly of dark matter. COSMOS-UDG1 and COSMOS-UDG2 exhibit comparable stellar masses of $\sim 2\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. Notably, COSMOS-UDG1 is younger and more metal-rich than COSMOS-UDG2 and COSMOS-dw1. Conversely, COSMOS-UDG2 and COSMOS-dw1 have similar stellar metallicities, yet COSMOS-UDG2 is older than COSMOS-dw1. All three galaxies adhere to the stellar mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, implying they belong to the dwarf galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Anisotropic Ultra-long Wavelength Spectra using a Single Antenna on Lunar-orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultra-long wavelength sky ($\nu\lesssim 30$ MHz) is still largely unexplored, as the electromagnetic wave is heavily absorbed and distorted by the ionosphere on Earth. The far-side of the Moon, either in lunar-orbit or on lunar-surface, is the ideal site for observations in this band, and the upcoming Moon-based interferometers will obtain multi-frequency high-resolution sky maps. Making use of the lunar occultation of the sky and the anisotropy of antenna primary beam response, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the ultra-long wavelength spectral shape in multiple directions in the sky using only one antenna on lunar orbit. We apply the method to one antenna on one of the nine daughter satellites of the proposed Discovering the Sky at Longest wavelength (DSL) project. Using simulated observation data between 1 - 30 MHz from one dipole antenna, we find that the spectra for different regions on the sky can be reconstructed very well and the free-free absorption feature in each region can be derived from the reconstructed spectra. This work demonstrates the feasibility to reconstruct the anisotropic ultra-long wavelength spectra with very limited instrumentation on a lunar-orbit, with mature technologies already in place. It extends the application of such kind of satellite in revealing the distribution of free electrons in the Galactic interstellar medium from the distribution of absorption features in the ultra-long wavelength sky.</description>

      <title>BCDDM: Branch-Corrected Denoising Diffusion Model for Black Hole Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of black holes and accretion flows can be inferred by fitting Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data to simulated images generated through general relativistic ray tracing (GRRT). However, due to the computationally intensive nature of GRRT, the efficiency of generating specific radiation flux images needs to be improved. This paper introduces the Branch Correction Denoising Diffusion Model (BCDDM), which uses a branch correction mechanism and a weighted mixed loss function to improve the accuracy of generated black hole images based on seven physical parameters of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model. Our experiments show a strong correlation between the generated images and their physical parameters. By enhancing the GRRT dataset with BCDDM-generated images and using ResNet50 for parameter regression, we achieve significant improvements in parameter prediction performance. This approach reduces computational costs and provides a faster, more efficient method for dataset expansion, parameter estimation, and model fitting.</description>

      <title>Directly Imaging the Cooling Flow in the Phoenix Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the centers of many galaxy clusters, the hot ($\sim$10$^7$ K) intracluster medium (ICM) can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies and absence of soft X-ray lines from cooling gas suggest that most of this gas never cools - this is known as the "cooling flow problem." The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here, we present new observations of the Phoenix cluster using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne VI] $\lambda$7.652$\mu$m emission line, allowing us to probe gas at 10$^{5.5}$ K on large scales. These data show extended [Ne VI] emission cospatial with (i) the cooling peak in the ICM, (ii) the coolest gas phases, and (iii) sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate which we estimate to be 5,000-23,000 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. These data provide the first large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 10$^5$-10$^6$ K in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback plays in not only regulating but also promoting cooling.</description>

      <title>A Sizable Discrepancy in Ground-Based JAGB Distances to Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Freedman et al. (2024) report agreement of distances derived from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and the J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) at the 1$\%$ level for both nearby galaxies with ground-based imaging (0.5-4 Mpc) as well distant galaxies with JWST imaging (7-23 Mpc). Here we compare the same ground-based JAGB distances to uniformly reduced space-based optical TRGB distances from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We uncover a significant offset between these two distance scales of $\Delta\mu$ = 0.17 $\pm$ 0.04 (stat) $\pm$ 0.06 (sys) mag (9$\%$ in distance), with the HST TRGB distances being further. Inspections of the HST color-magnitude diagrams make a compelling case that the issue lies in the underlying JAGB distances. The source of the disagreement may lie with the lower resolution or photometric calibration of the ground-based near-infrared data, a contrast to the general agreement found between JWST JAGB and other space-based, second-rung distance indicators (Cepheids, Miras, TRGB) presented within Riess et al. (2024). High-resolution, near-infrared observations from an ongoing HST program will enable the simultaneous measurement of Cepheid, JAGB, and TRGB distances in four of these nearby galaxies and allow us to investigate whether the discrepancy noted here is due to ground-based observational systematics, or something intrinsic to the JAGB method relevant for this particular sample. A resolution of this discrepancy is required if the JAGB is to be used to determine a highly precise local value of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Impact of accretor size on the morphology of supersonic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast-moving accretors are ubiquitous in astrophysics. Their interaction with surrounding gas leaves characteristic imprints, forming structures like bow shocks, Mach cones, and density trails. We study how various physical processes affect the flow structure around an accretor with a one-way surface, its accretion rate, and accretion anisotropy. These processes correspond to distinct length scales: the Bondi radius, the bow shock's stand-off distance, and the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius. We conducted adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations using a spherical coordinate grid centred on the accretor. By varying the accretor's (numerical) size across scales -- from much smaller than the stand-off distance to much larger than the Bondi radius -- we analyse how these spatial scales affect steady-state flow physics. All simulations reach a steady state. When the accretor is smaller than the stand-off distance, a bow shock forms ahead, and a nearly spherically symmetric atmosphere develops within. Accretors smaller than the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius produce a Mach cone, while larger ones exhibit a supersonic-to-subsonic flow transition on larger scales. Fully resolved simulations align with Hoyle-Lyttleton theory, showing slightly anisotropic accretion with enhanced inflow from behind. In contrast, larger accretors approach the geometrical limit, accreting mainly from the flow direction, with a low-density 'shadow' forming behind. The accretor's size strongly influences small- and large-scale morphologies. Resolving the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius is essential for capturing large-scale flow characteristics. Resolving the stand-off distance is needed only to study the bow shock: since it determines the shock's position, its non-resolution does not affect large-scale flow morphology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I show that a dedicated space telescope with a meter-size aperture can detect numerous interstellar objects, 10-m in diameter, that pass within ~20 degrees from the Sun. Separating the emitted thermal radiation from the reflection of sunlight would allow to measure the surface temperature, area and albedo of these objects. Spectroscopic observations of any evaporated material at the expected temperature of ~600K would provide important clues about the nature and birth sites of interstellar objects.</description>

      <title>Fast-moving stars around an intermediate-mass black hole in Omega Centauri</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes have been found over a wide range of masses, from stellar remnants with masses of 5-150 solar masses (Msun), to those found at the centers of galaxies with $M&gt;10^5$ Msun. However, only a few debated candidate black holes exist between 150 and $10^5$ Msun. Determining the population of these intermediate-mass black holes is an important step towards understanding supermassive black hole formation in the early universe. Several studies have claimed the detection of a central black hole in $\omega$ Centauri, the Milky Way's most massive globular cluster. However, these studies have been questioned due to the possible mass contribution of stellar mass black holes, their sensitivity to the cluster center, and the lack of fast-moving stars above the escape velocity. Here we report observations of seven fast-moving stars in the central 3 arcseconds (0.08 pc) of $\omega$ Centauri. The velocities of the fast-moving stars are significantly higher than the expected central escape velocity of the star cluster, so their presence can only be explained by being bound to a massive black hole. From the velocities alone, we can infer a firm lower limit of the black hole mass of $\sim$8,200 Msun, making this a compelling candidate for an intermediate-mass black hole in the local universe.</description>

      <title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST: III. An Abundance of Direct Chemical Abundances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the gas-phase abundances of the elements He, N, O, Ne, S, Ar, and Fe in an individual H\textsc{ii} region known to be leaking Lyman-continuum photons in the Sunburst Arc, a highly magnified galaxy at redshift $z=2.37$. We detect the temperature-sensitive auroral lines [SII]$\lambda\lambda4069,4076$, [OII]$\lambda\lambda7320,7330$, [SIII]$\lambda6312$, [OIII]$\lambda4363$, and [NeIII]$\lambda3343$ in a stacked spectrum of 5 multiple images of the Lyman-continuum emitter (LCE), from which we directly measure the electron temperature in the low, intermediate, and high ionization zones. We also detect the density-sensitive doublets of [OII]$\lambda\lambda3727,3729$, [SII]$\lambda\lambda6717,6731$, and [ArIV]$\lambda\lambda4713,4741$, which constrain the density in both the low- and high-ionization gas. With these temperature and density measurements, we measure gas-phase abundances with similar rigor as studies of local galaxies. We measure a gas-phase metallicity for the LCE of $12+\log(\textrm{O}/\textrm{H}) = 7.97 \pm 0.05$, and find an enhanced nitrogen abundance $\log(\textrm{N}/\textrm{O}) = -0.65^{+0.16}_{-0.25}$. This nitrogen abundance is consistent with enrichment from a population of Wolf-Rayet stars, additional signatures of which are reported in a companion paper. Abundances of sulfur, argon, neon, and iron are consistent with local low-metallicity H\textsc{ii} regions and low-redshift galaxies. This study represents the most complete chemical abundance analysis of an individual H\textsc{ii} region at Cosmic Noon to date, which enables direct comparisons between local H\textsc{ii} regions and those in the distant universe.</description>

      <title>PAMS: The Perseus Arm Molecular Survey -- I. Survey description and first results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The external environments surrounding molecular clouds vary widely across galaxies such as the Milky Way, and statistical samples of clouds are required to understand them. We present the Perseus Arm Molecular Survey (PAMS), a James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) survey combining new and archival data of molecular-cloud complexes in the outer Perseus spiral arm in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O ($J$=3-2). With a survey area of $\sim$8 deg$^2$, PAMS covers well-known complexes such as W3, W5, and NGC 7538 with two fields at $\ell \approx 110^{\circ}$ and $\ell \approx 135^{\circ}$. PAMS has an effective resolution of 17 arcsec, and rms sensitivity of $T_\mathrm{mb} = 0.7$-1.0 K in 0.3 km s$^{-1}$ channels. Here we present a first look at the data, and compare the PAMS regions in the Outer Galaxy with Inner Galaxy regions from the CO Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey (CHIMPS). By comparing the various CO data with maps of H$_2$ column density from Herschel, we calculate representative values for the CO-to-H$_2$ column-density $X$-factors, which are $X_{^{12}\mathrm{CO (3-2)}}=4.0\times10^{20}$ and $X_{^{13}\mathrm{CO (3-2)}}=4.0\times10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$ with a factor of 1.5 uncertainty. We find that the emission profiles, size-linewidth and mass-radius relationships of $^{13}$CO-traced structures are similar between the Inner and Outer Galaxy. Although PAMS sources are slightly more massive than their Inner Galaxy counterparts for a given size scale, the discrepancy can be accounted for by the Galactic gradient in gas-to-dust mass ratio, uncertainties in the $X$-factors, and selection biases. We have made the PAMS data publicly available, complementing other CO surveys targeting different regions of the Galaxy in different isotopologues and transitions.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Mergers in the Epoch of Reionization II: Major Merger-Triggered Star Formation and AGN Activities at $z = 4.5 - 8.5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are a key driver of galaxy formation and evolution, including the triggering of AGN and star formation to a still unknown degree. We thus investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on star formation and AGN activity using a sample of 3,330 galaxies at $z = [4.5, 8.5]$ from eight JWST fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, and MACS-0416), collectively covering an unmasked area of 189 arcmin$^2$. We focuses on star formation rate (SFR) enhancement, AGN fraction, and AGN excess in major merger ($\mu &gt; 1/4$) close-pair samples, defined by $\Delta z &lt; 0.3$ and projected separations $r_p &lt; 100$ kpc, compared to non-merger samples. We find that SFR enhancement occurs only at $r_p &lt; 20$ kpc, with values of $0.25 \pm 0.10$ dex and $0.26 \pm 0.11$ dex above the non-merger medians for $z = [4.5, 6.5]$ and $z = [6.5, 8.5]$. No other statistically significant enhancements in galaxy sSFR or stellar mass are observed at any projected separation or redshift bin. We also compare our observational results with predictions from the SC-SAM simulation and find no evidence of star formation enhancement in the simulations at any separation range. Finally, we examine the AGN fraction and AGN excess, finding that the fraction of AGNs in AGN-galaxy pairs, relative to the total AGN population, is $3.25^{+1.50}_{-1.06}$ times greater than the fraction of galaxy pairs relative to the overall galaxy population at the same redshift. We find that nearly all AGNs have a companion within 100 kpc and observe an excess AGN fraction in close-pair samples compared to non-merger samples. This excess is found to be $1.26 \pm 0.06$ and $1.34 \pm 0.06$ for AGNs identified via the inferred BPT diagram and photometric SED selection, respectively.</description>

      <title>More is better: Strong constraints on the stellar properties of LEGA-C z ~ 1 galaxies with Prospector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the stellar properties of 2908 galaxies at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.0 from the LEGA-C survey. We emphasize the importance of high signal-to-noise, high spectral resolution spectroscopy in the inference of stellar population properties of galaxies. We estimate the galaxy properties with the SED fitting code Prospector, by fitting spectroscopy and broadband photometry together, drawn from the LEGA-C DR3 and UltraVISTA catalogs respectively. We report a positive correlation between light-weighted ages and stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_\star$). The trend with $\sigma_\star$ is weaker for the mass-weighted ages and stellar metallicity ($Z_\star$). On average, quiescent galaxies are characterized by high $Z_\star$, they are \sim 1.1 Gyr older, less dusty, with steeper dust attenuation slopes compared to star-forming galaxies. Conversely, star-forming galaxies are characterized by significantly higher dust optical depths and shallower (grayer) attenuation slopes. Low mass (high mass) star-forming galaxies have lower (higher) $Z_\star$, while their stellar populations are on average younger (older). A key pragmatic result of our study is that a linear-space metallicity prior is preferable to a logarithmic-space one when using photometry alone, as the latter biases the posteriors downward. Spectroscopy greatly improves stellar population measurements and is required to provide meaningful constraints on age, metallicity, and other properties. Pairing spectroscopy with photometry helps resolving the dust-age-metallicity degeneracy, yielding more accurate mass- and light-weighted ages, with ages inferred from photometry alone suffering such large uncertainties. Stellar metallicities are constrained by our spectroscopy, but precise measurements remain challenging (and impossible with photometry alone), particularly in the absence of Mg and Fe lines redward of 5000 $\AA$ in the observed spectrum.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Chemical Complexity in the W75N Star-Forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analysis of NOEMA interferometric observations of the high-mass star-forming region W75N(B) with a focus on molecular composition and distribution of prebiotic molecules in the source's multiple cores. Over twenty molecules are identified across the region, with many being fit for column density, rotational temperature, spectral line full width half maximum, and v$_{lsr}$. This work includes the first known detection and initial analysis of complex organic molecules in the MM2 and MM3 regions. Furthermore, parameter maps were created from the six molecules that were well fit across multiple regions. The molecular emission was imaged and correlated across different molecules and the continuum to reveal structural features. From the spatial and spectral analysis of the MM1 region, these results concur with those from other studies showing that there is a difference in chemical composition between the MM1a and MM1b regions, with sulfur-bearing molecules tracing MM1a and organic molecules tracing MM1b. The molecular emission imaged toward the MM3 region reveals two peaks, possibly indicating the presence of multiple young stellar objects. These results provide detailed quantitative information about the physical parameters and distributions of molecules in this source. Additionally, these results are part of a follow-up of a single-dish survey of multiple star-forming regions and are discussed in this context.</description>

      <title>Emulators for stellar profiles in binary population modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge about the internal physical structure of stars is crucial to understanding their evolution. The novel binary population synthesis code POSYDON includes a module for interpolating the stellar and binary properties of any system at the end of binary MESA evolution based on a pre-computed set of models. In this work, we present a new emulation method for predicting stellar profiles, i.e., the internal stellar structure along the radial axis, using machine learning techniques. We use principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction and fully-connected feed-forward neural networks for making predictions. We find accuracy to be comparable to that of nearest neighbor approximation, with a strong advantage in terms of memory and storage efficiency. By providing a versatile framework for modeling stellar internal structure, the emulation method presented here will enable faster simulations of higher physical fidelity, offering a foundation for a wide range of large-scale population studies of stellar and binary evolution.</description>

      <title>JAGB 2.0: Improved Constraints on the J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch-based Hubble Constant from an Expanded Sample of JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) is an overdensity of stars in the near-infrared, attributed to carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, and recently used as a standard candle for measuring extragalactic distances and the Hubble constant. Using JWST in Cycle 2, we extend JAGB measurements to 6 hosts of 9 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) (NGC 2525, NGC 3147, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5468, and NGC 5861), with two at $D \sim 40$ Mpc, all calibrated by the maser host NGC 4258. We investigate the effects of incompleteness and find that we are unable to recover a robust JAGB measurement in one of the two most distant hosts at $R \sim 40$ Mpc, NGC 3147. We compile all JWST JAGB observations in SNe Ia hosts, 15 galaxies hosting 18 SNe Ia, from the SH0ES and CCHP programs and employ all literature measures (mode, mean, median, model). We find no significant mean difference between these distances and those from HST Cepheids, $-0.03\pm0.02$ (stat) $\pm$ 0.05 (sys) mag. We find a difference of 0.11 $\pm$ 0.02 mag between JAGB mode measurements in the CCHP analyses of two fields in NGC 4258, a feature also seen in two SH0ES fields (see field-to-field variations in Li et al. 2024a), indicating significant field-to-field variation of JAGB measurements in NGC 4258 which produce a large absolute calibration uncertainty. Variations are also seen in the shape of the JAGB LF across galaxies so that different measures produce different values of the Hubble constant. We look for but do not (yet) find a standardizing relation between JAGB LF skew or color dependence and the apparent variation. Using the middle result of all JAGB measures to calibrate SNe Ia yields a Hubble constant of $H_0$ = 73.3 $\pm$ 1.4 (stat) $\pm$ 2.0 (sys) km/s/Mpc with the systematic dominated by apparent differences across NGC 4258 calibrating fields or their measures.</description>
