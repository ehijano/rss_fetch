      <title>Shape derivatives in bi-material level-set optimization with a precise interface: a comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate and compare formulations for computing shape derivatives in bi-material level-set optimization with precise modeling of the interface. The level-set function is parameterized using B-splines, whose coordinates serve as design variables. A precise mechanical model is obtained every design cycle, replicating the exact geometry of the bi-material design, using untrimming techniques and IGA on unstructured meshes. Design sensitivities are formulated by either a "discretize-then-differentiate" or a "differentiate-then-discretize" approach. A detailed comparative study shows the limitations of the latter in terms of accuracy, specifically when stresses near the material interface dominate the stress field. The precise representation of the interface facilitates an accurate evaluation of interfacial stresses, and the consistent discretized sensitivities enable to minimize them directly -- highlighting the main advantage of our framework. Furthermore, reducing the discretized approach by considering only interface control points and a selective set of adjacent control points provides an ideal trade-off between accuracy and numerical efficiency. This lays the foundations for multi-material shape and topology optimization procedures, considering accurate responses on the interface.</description>

      <title>Magnetic levitation in the field of a rotating dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that two permanent magnets of fixed orientation will either always repel or attract one another regardless of the distance between them. However, if one magnet is rotated at sufficient speed, a stable position at a given equilibrium distance can exist for a second free magnet. The equilibrium is produced by magnetic forces alone, which are strong enough to maintain a levitating state under gravity. We show that a stable levitation can be obtained when the rotating magnet is tilted from the rotation axis, with no offset in its position. In this regime, the levitating magnet remains centered and its spinning rate remains negligible, while its magnetic moment precesses in synchronization with the driving magnet. We provide a physical explanation of the levitation through a model relying on static dipolar interactions between the two magnets and present experimental results which validate the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Photonic Circuit of Arbitrary Non-Unitary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A design framework to implement non-unitary input-output operations to a practical unitary photonic integrated circuit is described. This is achieved by utilising the cosine-sine decomposition to recover the unitarity of the original operation. The recovered unitary operation is decomposed into fundamental unitary building blocks, forming a photonic integrated circuit network based on directional couplers and waveguide phase shifters. The individual building blocks are designed and optimised by three-dimensional full-wave simulations and scaled up using a circuit approach. The paper investigates the scalability and robustness of the design approach. Our study demonstrates that the proposed approach of performing unitary matrix completion can be applied to any arbitrary matrices. This design approach allows for implementation of non-unitary operations to perform various linear functions in neuromorphic photonics for computing, sensing, signal processing and communications.</description>
