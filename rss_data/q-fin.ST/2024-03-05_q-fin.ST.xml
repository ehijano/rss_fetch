      <title>Dimensionality reduction techniques to support insider trading detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of market abuse is an extremely complicated activity that requires the analysis of large and complex datasets. We propose an unsupervised machine learning method for contextual anomaly detection, which allows to support market surveillance aimed at identifying potential insider trading activities. This method lies in the reconstruction-based paradigm and employs principal component analysis and autoencoders as dimensionality reduction techniques. The only input of this method is the trading position of each investor active on the asset for which we have a price sensitive event (PSE). After determining reconstruction errors related to the trading profiles, several conditions are imposed in order to identify investors whose behavior could be suspicious of insider trading related to the PSE. As a case study, we apply our method to investor resolved data of Italian stocks around takeover bids.</description>

      <title>ARED: Argentina Real Estate Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Argentinian real estate market presents a unique case study characterized by its unstable and rapidly shifting macroeconomic circumstances over the past decades. Despite the existence of a few datasets for price prediction, there is a lack of mixed modality datasets specifically focused on Argentina. In this paper, the first edition of ARED is introduced. A comprehensive real estate price prediction dataset series, designed for the Argentinian market. This edition contains information solely for Jan-Feb 2024. It was found that despite the short time range captured by this zeroth edition (44 days), time dependent phenomena has been occurring mostly on a market level (market as a whole). Nevertheless future editions of this dataset, will most likely contain historical data. Each listing in ARED comprises descriptive features, and variable-length sets of images.</description>
