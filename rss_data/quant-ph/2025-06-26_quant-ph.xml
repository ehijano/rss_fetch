      <title>Entangled Quantum Negative Energy Teleportation as a Probe of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of semiclassical spacetime curvature via localized negative energy densities created by quantum energy teleportation (QET) and Casimir-enhanced confinement. Using realistic noise models and experimental architectures, we compute signal-to-noise ratios for detecting the resulting Ricci curvature via atomic clocks, interferometry, and optomechanical strain readout. We propose synchronization and squeezing strategies to enhance detectability and simulate spatial curvature profiles from focused QET pulses. Finally, we introduce a speculative framework -- the Quantum-Curvature Compression Channel -- as an experimentally motivated alternative to warp-drive geometries, enabling apparent geodesic compression through synchronized quantum energy operations. Our results clarify the experimental path toward laboratory tests of exotic stress-energy and semiclassical gravity effects.</description>

      <title>Utilization of SU(2) Symmetry for Efficient Simulation of Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates variational compilation methods for simulating quantum systems with internal SU(2) symmetry. The central component of the research is the application of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) method to extrapolate trained variational circuit parameters beyond the initial optimization range. An approach is proposed for predicting variationally compiled quantum states with a larger number of Trotter steps using extrapolated parameters, eliminating the need for retraining. The efficiency of the method is validated by comparing it with classical Trotterization and the results of variational training.
  The proposed method demonstrates an effective integration of symmetry-consistent quantum circuit architecture with spectral prediction techniques. The methodology shows promise for scalable modeling of strongly correlated systems, particularly in condensed matter physics problems, such as the Heisenberg model on Kagome lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization and average entropy of a subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Page's seminal result on the average von Neumann (VN) entropy does not immediately apply to realistic many-body systems which are restricted to physically relevant smaller subspaces. We investigate here the VN entropy averaged over the pure states in the subspace $\mathcal{H}_E$ corresponding to a narrow energy shell centered at energy $E$. We find that the average entropy is $\overline{S}_{1} \simeq \ln d_1$, where $d_1$ represents first subsystem's effective number of states relevant to the energy scale $E$. If $d_E = \dim{(\mathcal{H}_E)}$ and $D$ ($D_1$) is the Hilbert space dimension of the full system (subsystem), we estimate that $d_1 \simeq D_1^\gamma$, where $\gamma = \ln (d_E) / \ln (D)$ for nonintegrable (chaotic) systems and $\gamma &lt; \ln (d_E) / \ln (D)$ for integrable systems. This result can be reinterpreted as a volume-law of entropy, where the volume-law coefficient depends on the density-of-states for nonintegrable systems, and remains below the maximal possible value for integrable systems. We numerically analyze a spin model to substantiate our main results.</description>

      <title>Realization of pure gyration in an on-chip superconducting microwave device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic materials that emulate tight-binding Hamiltonians have enabled a wide range of advances in topological and non-Hermitian physics. A crucial requirement in such systems is the engineering of non-reciprocal couplings and synthetic magnetic fields. More broadly, the development of these capabilities in a manner compatible with quantum-coherent degrees of freedom remains an outstanding challenge, particularly for superconducting circuits, which are highly sensitive to magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate that pure gyration -- a non-reciprocal coupling with exactly matched magnitude but non-reciprocal $\pi$ phase contrast -- can be realized between degenerate states using only spatio-temporal modulation. Our experiments are performed using microwave superconducting resonators that are modulated using dc-SQUID arrays. We first show the existence of continuous exceptional surfaces in modulation parameter space where coupling with arbitrarily-large magnitude contrast can be achieved, with robust volumes of $\pi$ phase contrast contained within. We then demonstrate that intersection of these volumes necessarily gives rise to new continuous surfaces in parameter space where pure gyration is achieved. With this we experimentally demonstrate $&gt;58$ dB isolation and the first on-chip gyrator with only superconducting circuit elements. Our method is fully agnostic to physical implementation (classical or quantum) or frequency range and paves the way to large-scale non-reciprocal metamaterials.</description>

      <title>A spectral quantum algorithm for numerical differentiation and integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents low-complexity quantum algorithms for numerical differentiation and integration in partially bounded domains. The algorithms are based on a spectral approach that allows taking advantage of the computationally efficient quantum Fourier transform algorithm. Full derivations and gate-level circuit examples are presented. As part of the integration algorithms, we also develop an encoding technique to efficiently perform element-wise multiplication operations and unitary operators to perform partial summations of information encoded in state amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Multi-Dimensional Integration with Quantum Adaptive Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm that performs Quantum Adaptive Importance Sampling (QAIS) for Monte Carlo integration of multidimensional functions, targeting in particular the computational challenges of high-energy physics. In this domain, the fundamental ingredients for theoretical predictions such as multiloop Feynman diagrams and the phase-space require evaluating high-dimensional integrals that are computationally demanding due to divergences and complex mathematical structures. The established method of Adaptive Importance Sampling, as implemented in tools like VEGAS, uses a grid-based approach that is iteratively refined in a separable way, per dimension. This separable approach efficiently suppresses the exponentially growing grid-handling computational cost, but also introduces performance drawbacks whenever strong inter-variable correlations are present. To utilize sampling resources more efficiently, QAIS exploits the exponentially large Hilbert space of a Parameterised Quantum Circuit (PQC) to manipulate a non-separable Probability Density Function (PDF) defined on a multidimensional grid. In this setting, entanglement within the PQC captures the correlations and intricacies of the target integrand's structure. Then, the PQC strategically allocates samples across the multidimensional grid, focusing the samples in the small subspace where the important structures of the target integrand lie, and thus generates very precise integral estimations. As an application, we look at a very sharply peaked loop Feynman integral and at multi-modal benchmark integrals.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Networks for Propensity Score Estimation and Survival Analysis in Observational Biomedical Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of quantum neural networks (QNNs) for propensity score estimation to address selection bias in comparing survival outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgical techniques in a cohort of 1177 colorectal carcinoma patients treated at University Hospital Ostrava (2001-2009). Using a dataset with 77 variables, including patient demographics and tumor characteristics, we developed QNN-based propensity score models focusing on four key covariates (Age, Sex, Stage, BMI). The QNN architecture employed a linear ZFeatureMap for data encoding, a SummedPaulis operator for predictions, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) for robust, gradient-free optimization in noisy quantum environments. Variance regularization was integrated to mitigate quantum measurement noise, with simulations conducted under exact, sampling (1024 shots), and noisy hardware (FakeManhattanV2) conditions. QNNs, particularly with simulated hardware noise, outperformed classical logistic regression and gradient boosted machines in small samples (AUC up to 0.750 for n=100), with noise modeling enhancing predictive stability. Propensity score matching and weighting, optimized via genetic matching and matching weights, achieved covariate balance with standardized mean differences of 0.0849 and 0.0869, respectively. Survival analyses using Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox proportional hazards, and Aalen additive regression revealed no significant survival differences post-adjustment (p-values 0.287-0.851), indicating confounding bias in unadjusted outcomes. These results highlight QNNs' potential, enhanced by CMA-ES and noise-aware strategies, to improve causal inference in biomedical research, particularly for small-sample, high-dimensional datasets.</description>

      <title>Metamaterials in Superconducting and Cryogenic Quantum Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of fault-tolerant quantum computers based on superconducting circuits faces critical challenges in qubit coherence, connectivity, and scalability. This review establishes metamaterials, artificial structures with on-demand electromagnetic properties, as a transformative solution. By engineering the photonic density of states, metamaterials can suppress decoherence via the Purcell effect and create multi-mode quantum buses for hardware-efficient control and long-range qubit coupling. We provide a comprehensive overview, from foundational principles and Hamiltonian engineering to the materials science of high-coherence devices. We survey state-of-the-art performance, highlighting record coherence times and coupling strengths achieved through metamaterial design. Furthermore, we explore advanced applications where engineered environments give rise to exotic excitations and topologically protected states, enabling novel error correction schemes and qubit architectures. Ultimately, we argue that metamaterials are evolving from passive components into the core architectural element of next-generation quantum technologies, paving a viable path toward scalable quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties of randomized hypergraph states, extending the concept of randomized graph states to encompass hypergraph-based quantum states. In our model, imperfect generalized multiqubit gates are applied probabilistically, simulating experimentally realistic noisy gate operations where gate fidelity decreases with increasing hyperedge order. We analyze bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement of these mixed multiqubit states. Numerical results for various hypergraph configurations up to four qubits reveal rich and sometimes nonmonotonic entanglement behavior, stemming from the interplay between hyperedge structure and gate imperfections. We derive analytical expressions for entanglement witnesses based on randomization overlap for new hypergraph families. Our findings contribute to the understanding of entanglement resilience under gate imperfections, providing insights for the experimental implementation of hypergraph states in noisy quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A New Layout-Aware Quantum Circuit Synthesis with Davio Lattices Using Triangular Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum layout and the mapping of logical to physical qubits are essential in synthesizing a quantum circuit into a real quantum computer. In general, popular quantum layouts, such as the square grid and heavy-hex layouts, are not suitable for synthesizing a quantum circuit consisting of many Toffoli gates. Due to the limited connectivity in these layouts, additional SWAP gates are required for circuit synthesis. We introduce in this paper a triangular layout suited for Toffoli gates by exploring the advantages of Positive Davio lattices for quantum circuit synthesis. We also introduce methods of mapping the resulting triangular layouts onto square grid and heavy-hex layouts. Our approach highlights Davio lattices as a useful tool for circuit synthesis and brings out a new layout-aware method for efficient quantum circuit implementation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing with Qubit-Resonator Systems for Simultaneous Optimization of Binary and Continuous Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a method developed to solve combinatorial optimization problems by utilizing quantum bits. Solving such problems corresponds to minimizing a cost function defined over binary variables. However, in many practical cases, the cost function may also involve continuous variables. Representing continuous variables using quantum bits requires binary encoding, which demands a large number of qubits. To overcome this limitation, an approach using quantum resonators has been proposed, enabling the direct handling of continuous variables within the quantum annealing framework. On the other hand, certain optimization problems involve both binary and continuous variables simultaneously, and a quantum annealing method capable of efficiently solving such hybrid problems has not been established. Here, we propose a quantum annealing method based on a hybrid system composed of qubits and resonators, aiming to minimize cost functions that contain both binary and continuous variables. We present a general framework for hybrid quantum annealing using such systems, and investigate its feasibility and effectiveness through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Utility-Scale Error Mitigation for Quantum Quench Dynamics in Heisenberg Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum error mitigation method termed self-mitigation, which is comparable with zero-noise extrapolation, to achieve quantum utility on near-term, noisy quantum computers. We investigate the effectiveness of several quantum error mitigation strategies, including self-mitigation, by simulating quantum quench dynamics for Heisenberg spin chains with system sizes up to 104 qubits using IBM quantum processors. In particular, we discuss the limitations of zero-noise extrapolation and the advantages offered by self-mitigation at a large scale. The self-mitigation method shows stable accuracy with the large systems of 104 qubits with more than 3,000 CNOT gates. Also, we combine the discussed quantum error mitigation methods with practical entanglement entropy measuring methods, and it shows a good agreement with the theoretical estimation. Our study illustrates the usefulness of near-term noisy quantum hardware in examining the quantum quench dynamics of many-body systems at large scales, and lays the groundwork for surpassing classical simulations with quantum methods prior to the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Approach to the Continuum Heisenberg Spin-Chain Model: Position-Dependent Mass Formalism and Pre-canonical Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Painlev\'{e}'s singularity structure analysis, combined with stereographic mapping, has previously been applied to a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin-chain continuum model which identified a Hamiltonian density for the static version of the Landau-Lifshitz equation. In this work, we explore the equivalence of the Hamiltonian density to the nonlinear sigma model. It reveals its non-standard form and can be interpreted as a position-dependent mass Hamiltonian density. We then proceed with the quantization of this Hamiltonian density using the pre-canonical quantization procedure. The resulting Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation was found to take the form of a confluent Heun equation. By employing the functional Bethe-Ansatz method, we explicitly obtain the ground state and first excited state of the system. This analysis provides a comprehensive quantum description of the system, capturing the probabilistic structure of the field and information about the possible energy states of the spin system.</description>

      <title>Multivariate unbounded quantum regression via log-ratio probabilities mitigating barren plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have shown remarkable potential due to their capability of representing complex functions within exponentially large Hilbert spaces. However, their application to multivariate regression tasks has been limited, primarily due to inherent constraints of traditional approaches that rely on Pauli expectation values. In this work, we introduce a novel and simple post-processing method utilizing log-ratio probabilities (LRPs) of quantum states, enabling efficient and unbounded multivariate regression within existing QNN architectures. Our approach exponentially expands the number of regression outputs relative to qubit count, thus significantly improving parameter and qubit efficiency. Additionally, by enhancing parameter dependencies in the cost function and leveraging gradient pumping effects from the log-ratio transformation, our method mitigates the well-known barren plateau phenomenon, thereby stabilizing training. We further demonstrate that this approach facilitates robust uncertainty quantification, capturing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties simultaneously. Our findings underscore the practical potential of LRP-QNNs for complex multi-output regression tasks, particularly within current resource-constrained quantum hardware environments.</description>

      <title>Bounds on QCA Lattice Spacing from Data on Lorentz Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that discrete quantum walks, when extended to quantum cellular automata (QCA), can, in the continuum limit, reproduce relativistic wave equations and quantum field theories (QFTs), including free quantum electrodynamics (QED). This QCA/QFT correspondence bridges quantum information processing and high-energy physics, raising fundamental questions about the nature of spacetime: whether it is the continuum QFT or the discrete QCA that is fundamental. For while Lorentz invariance appears robust experimentally, it may only approximate a deeper discrete structure, particularly at Planck-scale energies. This high-energy Lorentz violation is potentially observable either through cumulative effects over cosmic distances or via small deviations at accessible energies. In this paper, we analyze the QCA corresponding to QED and show that it implies both a deviation from the speed of light and spatial anisotropies. Using current experimental and astrophysical constraints, we place upper bounds on the QCA lattice spacing, providing insight into the plausibility of a fundamentally discrete spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear sources of quantum light are foundational to nearly all optical quantum technologies and are actively advancing toward real-world deployment. Achieving this goal requires fabrication capabilities to be scaled to industrial standards, necessitating precise modeling tools that can both guide device design within realistic fabrication constraints and enable accurate post-fabrication characterization. In this paper, we introduce a modeling framework that explicitly integrates the engineering tools used for designing classical properties of integrated waveguides with quantum mechanical theory describing the underlying nonlinear interactions. We analyze the validity and limitations of approximations relevant to this framework and apply it to comprehensively study how typical fabrication errors and deviations from nominal design -- common in practical waveguide manufacturing -- affect the nonlinear optical response. Our findings highlight, in particular, a critical sensitivity of the framework to group-velocity dispersion, the potentially disruptive role of geometric inhomogeneities in the waveguide, and an upper bound on single-mode squeezed-state generation arising from asymmetric group-velocity matching conditions.</description>

      <title>Computed tomography of propagating microwave photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propagating photons serve as essential links for distributing quantum information and entanglement across distant nodes. Knowledge of their Wigner functions not only enables their deployment as active information carriers but also provides error diagnostics when photons passively leak from a quantum processing unit. While well-established for standing waves, characterizing propagating microwave photons requires post-processing of room-temperature signals with excessive amplification noise. Here, we demonstrate cryogenic and amplification-free Wigner function tomography of propagating microwave photons using a superconductor-normal metal-superconductor bolometer based on the resistive heating effect of absorbed radiation. By introducing two-field interference in power detection, the bolometer acts as a sensitive and broadband quadrature detector that samples the input field at selected angles at millikelvin with no added noise. Adapting the principles of computed tomography (CT) in medical imaging, we implement Wigner function CT by combining quadrature histograms across different projection angles and demonstrate it for Gaussian states at the single-photon level with different symmetries. Compressed sensing and neural networks further reduce the projections to three without compromising the reconstruction quality. These results address the long-standing challenge of characterizing propagating microwave photons in a superconducting quantum network and establish a new avenue for real-time quantum error diagnostics and correction.</description>

      <title>Complex orientation dependence of Casimir-Polder interaction induced by curvature and optical properties of the surface and the surrounding medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a multiple scattering expansion to systematically derive curvature corrections to the Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction between small an-isotropic particles and general magneto-dielectric surfaces. Our results, validated against exact solutions, reveal a complex, distance-dependent interplay between material properties and surface curvature in determining stable particle orientations. We demonstrate that even small surface curvature can induce or eliminate switches in the preferred orientation, a quantum effect that is diminished by thermal fluctuations. This work provides a crucial understanding of how to engineer nano-particle orientation through tune-able parameters, offering significant implications for micro- and nano-mechanical device design.</description>

      <title>Trion quantum coherence in site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministically positioned pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) exhibit exceptional quantum properties, making them highly promising candidates for scalable on-chip quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the coherent dynamics of positively charged excitons under the influence of strong magnetic fields in the Faraday configuration. Pyramidal quantum dots exhibit a fourfold splitting of the charged excitons even in the Faraday configuration, giving rise to an optically addressable double-{\Lambda} system akin to self-assembled quantum dots in oblique magnetic fields. Here, we investigate ultrafast complete coherent control of the trion to ground state transition utilizing advanced optical resonant excitation techniques and we observe quantum coherence over timescales that are similar to other prominent quantum dot platforms. These results pave the way towards establishing site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs QDs as scalable platforms for quantum information processing, expanding the reach of coherent control to new quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of quantum probes to accurately determine the strength of the local gravitational field on Earth. Our findings show that delocalized probes generally outperform localized ones, with the precision enhancement scaling quadratically with the separation between the two wavefunction components. This advantage persists under realistic position measurements, which can achieve precision not too far from the ultimate bound. We also discuss the influence of Earth's surface, demonstrating that its effect can be neglected until shortly before the particle hits the floor. Finally, we address the joint estimation of the gravitational acceleration $g$ and the probe mass $m$, proving that the excess estimation noise arising from their inherent incompatibility is negligible.</description>

      <title>Practical insights on the effect of different encodings, ans\"atze and measurements in quantum and hybrid convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the design choices of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) within quantum and hybrid convolutional neural network (HQNN and QCNN) architectures, applied to the task of satellite image classification using the EuroSAT dataset. We systematically evaluate the performance implications of data encoding techniques, variational ans\"atze, and measurement in approx. 500 distinct model configurations. Our analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of influence on model performance. For hybrid architectures, which were benchmarked against their direct classical equivalents (e.g. the same architecture with the PQCs removed), the data encoding strategy is the dominant factor, with validation accuracy varying over 30% for distinct embeddings. In contrast, the selection of variational ans\"atze and measurement basis had a comparatively marginal effect, with validation accuracy variations remaining below 5%. For purely quantum models, restricted to amplitude encoding, performance was most dependent on the measurement protocol and the data-to-amplitude mapping. The measurement strategy varied the validation accuracy by up to 30% and the encoding mapping by around 8 percentage points.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Based Excitation Filter for Molecular Ground-State Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular system simulation is one of the most promising areas for demonstrating practical quantum advantage with near-term quantum computers. The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading algorithm for studying molecular energy levels, yet it still faces significant challenges due to excessive circuit depth. This paper introduces a method to efficiently simplify the Unitary Coupled-Cluster with Single and Double Excitations (UCCSD) ansatz in classical computer. We propose to estimate the correlation energy contributions of excitations using their gradients at Hartree-Fock state, supported by theoretical proof. By projecting the system's full Hamiltonian and Hartree-Fock state onto the subspace of excitation operators, these gradients can be computed efficiently and parallelly on classical computers with complexity only equivalent to $16\times16$ matrix multiplication. Leveling these gradients, the simplified ansatz can be readily constructed through the ordering and truncation of the corresponding excitations. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy that utilizes free parameters to indirectly identify critical excitations, reducing gradient computations by $\thicksim$60\% by exploiting the constraints of spin adaptation. Numerical experiments on prototype molecular systems (H\textsubscript{4}, HF, H\textsubscript{2}O, BeH\textsubscript{2} and NH\textsubscript{3}) demonstrate that our primary results and ablative studies achieve parameter reductions up to 46\% and 69\%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks (ADAPT-VQE and SymUCCSD), enabling significantly more compact quantum circuits with enhanced near-term feasibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate performance estimation of experimentally demonstrated quantum memories is key to understand the nuances in their deployment in photonic quantum networks. While several software packages allow for accessible quantum simulation, they often do not account for the loss and noise in physical devices. We present a framework for modeling ensemble-based atomic quantum memories using the quantum channel formalism. We provide a Kraus matrix representation of several experimentally implemented state-of-the art quantum memories and give an overview of their most important performance metrics. To showcase the applicability of this approach, we implement a memory-assisted quantum token protocol within our simulation framework. Our digital twin model is readily extensible to other memory implementations and easily compatible with existing frameworks for performance simulation of experimental quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Controlling Casimir Effect in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks have played a pivotal role in physics, mathematics, and biology, propelling the recent revolution in artificial intelligence. This paper studies quantum field theories on networks and proposes a novel junction condition on the node. The junction condition is consistent with energy conservation in the sense that the total energy flow into the node is zero. As an application, we explore the Casimir effect on networks. Remarkably, the Casimir force on one edge can be changed from attractive to repulsive by adjusting the lengths of the other edges, providing a straightforward way to control the Casimir effect. We begin by discussing the Casimir effect for $(1+1)$-dimensional free massless scalars on a simple network. We then extend this discussion to various types of networks and higher dimensions. Finally, we offer brief comments on some open questions.</description>

      <title>Overcoming frequency resolution limits using a solid-state spin quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to determine precisely the separation of two frequencies is fundamental to spectroscopy, yet the resolution limit poses a critical challenge: distinguishing two incoherent signals becomes impossible when their frequencies are sufficiently close. Here, we demonstrate a simple and powerful approach, dubbed {\it superresolution quantum sensing}, which experimentally resolves two nearly identical incoherent signals using a solid-state spin quantum sensor. By identifying a sequence of ``magic interrogation times'', we eliminate quantum projection noise, overcoming the vanishing distinguishability of signals with near-identical frequencies. This leads to improved resolution, which scales as $t^{-2}$ in comparison to the standard $t^{-1}$ scaling. Together with a greatly reduced classical readout noise assisted by a nuclear spin, we are able to achieve sub-kHz resolution with a signal detection time of 80 microseconds. Our results highlight the potential of quantum sensing to overcome conventional frequency resolution limitations, with broad implications for precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic criteria for signaling in quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signaling quantum channels are fundamental to quantum communication, enabling the transfer of information from input to output states. In contrast, thermalisation erases information about the initial state. This raises a crucial question: How does the thermalising tendency of a quantum channel constrain its signaling power and vice versa? In this work, we address this question by considering three thermodynamic tasks associated with a quantum channel: the generation, preservation, and transmission of athermality. We provide faithful measures for athermality generation and athermality preservation of quantum channels, and prove that their difference quantifies athermality transmission. Analysing these thermodynamic tasks, we find that the signaling ability of a quantum channel is upper-bounded by its athermality preservation and lower-bounded by its athermality transmission, thereby establishing a fundamental relationship between signaling and thermodynamic properties of channels for quantum communication. We demonstrate this interplay for the example of the quantum switch, revealing an explicit trade-off between the signaling ability and athermality of the quantum channels it can implement.</description>

      <title>Robust Tripartite Entanglement Generation via Correlated Noise in Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement in a triangular spin-qubit system due to spatially correlated noise. In particular, we demonstrate how the formation of a highly entangled dark state -- a W state -- enables robust, long-lived tripartite entanglement. Surprisingly, we find that environmentally induced coherent coupling does not play a crucial role in sustaining this entanglement. This contrasts sharply with the two-qubit case, where the induced coupling significantly influences the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we explore two promising approaches to enhance the tripartite entanglement by steering the system towards the dark state: post-selection and coherent driving. Our findings offer a robust method for generating high-fidelity tripartite entangled states with potential applications in quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Framework for Simulating Linear PDEs with Robin Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an explicit, oracle-free quantum framework for numerically simulating general linear partial differential equations (PDEs) that extends previous work \cite{guseynov2024efficientPDE} to also encompass (a) Robin boundary conditions (which includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions as special cases), (b) inhomogeneous terms, and (c) variable coefficients in space and time. Our approach begins with a general finite-difference discretization and applies the Schrodingerisation technique to transform the resulting system into one satisfying unitary quantum evolution so quantum simulation can be applied.
  For the Schrodinger equation corresponding to the discretized PDE, we construct an efficient block-encoding of $H$, scaling polylogarithmically with the number of grid points $N$. This object is compatible with quantum signal processing, to create the evolution operator $e^{-iHt}$. The oracle-free nature of our method allows us to count complexity in more fundamental units (C-NOTs and one-qubit rotations), bypassing the inefficiencies of oracle queries. Thus, the overall algorithm scales polynomially with $N$ and linearly with spatial dimension $d$, offering a polynomial speedup in $N$ and an exponential advantage in $d$, alleviating the classical curse of dimensionality. The correctness and efficiency of the proposed approach are further supported by numerical simulations.
  By explicitly defining the quantum operations and their resource requirements, our approach stands as a practical solution for solving PDEs, distinct from others that rely on oracle queries and purely asymptotic scaling methods.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Checking in Band Structure Calculations on a Noisy Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band crossings in electronic band structures play an important role in determining the electronic, topological, and transport properties in solid-state systems, making them central to both condensed matter physics and materials science. The emergence of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors has sparked great interest in developing quantum algorithms to compute band structure properties of materials. While significant research has been reported on computing ground state and excited state energy bands in the presence of noise that breaks the degeneracy, identifying the symmetry at crossing points using quantum computers is still an open question. In this work, we propose a method for identifying the symmetry of bands around crossings and anti-crossings in the band structure of bilayer graphene with two distinct configurations on a NISQ device. The method utilizes eigenstates at neighbouring $\mathbf{k}$ points on either side of the touching point to recover the local symmetry by implementing a character-checking quantum circuit that uses ancilla qubit measurements for a probabilistic test. We then evaluate the performance of our method under a depolarizing noise model, using four distinct matrix representations of symmetry operations to assess its robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the reliability of our method by correctly identifying the correct band crossings of AA-stacked bilayer graphene around $K$ point, using the character-checking circuit implemented on a noisy IBM quantum processor $ibm\_marrakesh$.</description>

      <title>An adversary bound for quantum signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), have emerged as unifying frameworks in the context of quantum algorithm design. These techniques allow to carry out efficient polynomial transformations of matrices block-encoded in unitaries, involving a single ancilla qubit. Recent efforts try to extend QSP to the multivariate setting (M-QSP), where multiple matrices are transformed simultaneously. However, this generalization faces problems not encountered in the univariate counterpart: in particular, the class of polynomials achievable by M-QSP seems hard to characterize. In this work we borrow tools from query complexity, namely the state conversion problem and the adversary bound: we first recast QSP as a state conversion problem over the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions. We then show that the adversary bound for a $|0\rangle \mapsto (P, Q)$ state conversion in this space precisely identifies all and only the QSP protocols over $SU(2)$ in the univariate case. Motivated by this result, we extend the formalism to M-QSP: the computation of a M-QSP protocol of minimal space is thus reduced to a rank minimization problem involving the feasible solution space of the adversary bound.</description>

Abstract: Linear optical networks are fundamental to the advancement of quantum technologies, including quantum computing, communication, and sensing. The accurate characterization of these networks, described by unitary matrices, is crucial to their effective utilization and scalability. In this work, we present the method for reconstructing the transfer matrix of a linear optical interferometer based on the analysis of cross-correlation functions of photon counts between pairs of output modes. Our approach accounts for losses and photon indistinguishability, making it robust to experimental imperfections. By minimizing the requirements for the input states, the method simplifies the experimental implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through theoretical modeling and experimental validation in a 4-mode programmable integrated optical interferometer. The results show high fidelity in matrix reconstruction and successful application in boson sampling experiments. In addition, we provide a comprehensive formalism for correlation functions and discuss the robustness of the method to measurement errors. This work offers a practical and efficient solution for characterizing linear-optical networks, paving the way for scaling up photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Super-resolving frequency measurement with mode-selective quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision optical frequency measurement is indispensable to modern science and technology, yet conventional spectroscopic techniques struggle to resolve spectral features narrower than their bandwidth. Here, we introduce a unique platform for super-resolving frequency estimation utilizing a mode-selective atomic Raman quantum memory implemented in warm cesium vapor. By precisely engineering the light-matter interaction, our memory coherently stores the optimal temporal mode with high fidelity and retrieves it on-demand, realizing a mode crosstalk as low as 0.34%. For the task of estimating the separation between two spectral lines, we experimentally measure the mean squared error of the frequency estimate, achieving a sensitivity as small as 1/20 of the linewidth with up to a ($34\pm4$)-fold enhancement in precision over direct intensity measurements. This enhanced resolution of frequency measurements, combined with the memory's capability of on-demand storage, retrieval and mode conversion, paves the way for multifunctional memory-based time-frequency sensors and their integration within quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Experimental violation of a Bell-like inequality for causal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics allows for coherent control over the order in which different processes take place on a target system, giving rise to a new feature known as indefinite causal order. Indefinite causal order provides a resource for quantum information processing, and can be in principle be detected by the violation of certain inequalities on the correlations between measurement outcomes observed in the laboratory, in a similar way as quantum nonlocality can be detected by the violation of Bell inequalities. Here we report the experimental violation of a Bell-like inequality for causal order using a photonic setup where the order of two optical processes is controlled by a single photon of a polarization-entangled photon pair. Our proof-of-principle demonstration overcomes major technical challenges, including the need of high-speed quantum operations in photonic time-bin encoding, nanosecond synchronization of active optical and electronic elements to meet the target required for spacelike separation, and active temperature stabilization of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to ensure statistically significant violations. These experimental advances enable a statistically significant violation of the causal inequality, and open up a path towards a device-independent certification of indefinite order of events with uncharacterized quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum interference in integrated lithium niobate nanophotonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics has emerged as one of the leading platforms for the implementation of real-world-applicable quantum technologies, enabling secure communication, enhanced sensing capabilities, as well as resolving previously intractable computational challenges. However, to harness the full potential of the photonics platform, several engineering feats need to be accomplished, among those is the quest for a scalable source of pure single photons. While single photon sources can be implemented in a variety of different ways, integrated lithium niobate stands out as a prime contender for a monolithic quantum photonics platform, given its second-order nonlinearity and proven classical scalability. Despite the extensive effort put into developing the platform, integrating suitable photon pair sources remains a hurdle limiting the scalability of quantum photonic systems in lithium niobate. We engineer three-wave-mixing in a nanophotonic lithium niobate device, integrating multiple near-perfect spectrally separable heralded single photon sources. By mixing photons generated via the developed sources, we show bosonic interference between indistinguishable photons, a crucial interaction for many photonic quantum computing protocols. This demonstration of the first proof-of-principle multi-source interference in integrated lithium niobate contributes to developing a truly scalable quantum photonics platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. While superconducting qubits are among the most promising candidates for scalable QEC, their limited nearest-neighbor connectivity presents significant challenges for implementing a wide range of error correction codes. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a quantum error detection scheme that employs a dynamically reassigned ancillary qubit on a chain of three linearly connected transmon qubits. We show that this scheme achieves performance comparable to conventional static-ancilla circuits. Additionally, the approach facilitates efficient quantum state preparation, which we demonstrate with tomography of arbitrary logical states. Our results provide a flexible method for implementing QEC codes under connectivity constraints and highlight a promising path toward scalable quantum architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ensemble of product states is said to exhibit "quantum nonlocality without entanglement" if the states cannot be optimally discriminated by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We show that this property can depend on the measure of state discrimination. We present a family of ensembles, each consisting of six linearly independent, equally probable product states for which LOCC fails to achieve optimal minimum-error discrimination but succeeds in achieving optimal unambiguous discrimination.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inversion of Unknown Unitary Operations with Structured Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unknown unitary inversion is a fundamental primitive in quantum computing and physics. Although recent work has demonstrated that quantum algorithms can invert arbitrary unknown unitaries without accessing their classical descriptions, improving the efficiency of such protocols remains an open question. In this work, we present efficient quantum algorithms for inverting unitaries with specific Hamiltonian structures, achieving significant reductions in both ancilla qubit requirements and unitary query complexity. We identify cases where unitaries encoding exponentially many parameters can be inverted using only a single query. We further extend our framework to implement unitary complex conjugation and transposition operations, and develop modified protocols capable of inverting more general classes of Hamiltonians. We have also demonstrated the efficacy and robustness of our algorithms via numerical simulations under realistic noise conditions of superconducting quantum hardware. Our results establish more efficient protocols that improve the resources required for quantum unitary inversion when prior information about the quantum system is available, and provide practical methods for implementing these operations on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>How to use quantum computers for biomolecular free energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free energy calculations are at the heart of physics-based analyses of biochemical processes. They allow us to quantify molecular recognition mechanisms, which determine a wide range of biological phenomena from how cells send and receive signals to how pharmaceutical compounds can be used to treat diseases. Quantitative and predictive free energy calculations require computational models that accurately capture both the varied and intricate electronic interactions between molecules as well as the entropic contributions from motions of these molecules and their aqueous environment. However, accurate quantum-mechanical energies and forces can only be obtained for small atomistic models, not for large biomacromolecules. Here, we demonstrate how to consistently link accurate quantum-mechanical data obtained for substructures to the overall potential energy of biomolecular complexes by machine learning in an integrated algorithm. We do so using a two-fold quantum embedding strategy where the innermost quantum cores are treated at a very high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the viability of this approach for the molecular recognition of a ruthenium-based anticancer drug by its protein target, applying traditional quantum chemical methods. As such methods scale unfavorable with system size, we analyze requirements for quantum computers to provide highly accurate energies that impact the resulting free energies. Once the requirements are met, our computational pipeline FreeQuantum is able to make efficient use of the quantum computed energies, thereby enabling quantum computing enhanced modeling of biochemical processes. This approach combines the exponential speedups of quantum computers for simulating interacting electrons with modern classical simulation techniques that incorporate machine learning to model large molecules.</description>

      <title>Quantum master equation for nanoelectromechanical systems beyond the wide-band limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling the vibrations of an oscillator to electronic transport is a key building block for nanoelectromechanical systems. They describe many nanoscale electrical components such as molecular junctions. Inspired by recent experimental developments, we derive a quantum master equation that describes nanoelectromechanical systems in a generally overlooked situation: when the electronic transport is slower than the natural frequency of the oscillator. Here, a semi-classical model is no longer valid and we develop the missing fully quantum approach. Moreover, we go beyond the wide-band limit and study the consequence of maintaining energy dependent tunneling rates, which are required to describe effects found in real devices. To benchmark our results, we compare with numerically exact results obtained with the hierarchical equations of motion method, and find overall good agreements in the experimentally accessible steady state regime. Furthermore, we derive from the microscopic model a ready to use particle current expression that replicates features already observed experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a cyclic property of rotation sequences involving piecewise displacements $\beta$ about arbitrary axes in three dimensions. Specifically, when transformation to the toggling frame is applied successively $m$ times, for $\beta=2\pi/m$ the original sequence returns. This main result unites several families of rotation sequences used for error-tuned control across quantum technologies, from NMR and MRI to atomic clocks and atom-scale computing. For the widest class of cycle, $m=2$, we highlight sequence duality where every narrowband $\pi$-element sequence has a broadband $\pi$-element counterpart, and vice-versa. Higher cycles ($m&gt;2$) connect to polyhedral models for error-tolerant sequence design, characterized by vertex axes with $m$-fold rotational symmetry. We derive original sequences and outline their applications to spin control and spin decoupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to test whether the postulate of a measurement acting as an instantaneous projection onto an eigenstate of the measurement apparatus is compatible with physical reality. This approach is solely based on repeated measurements of local quantities with frequencies that are within reach of analog quantum simulation platforms, for instance Rydberg atom arrays or ultracold gases in optical lattices. Crucially, we also develop a continuous description of a quantum measurement finding that its repeated-measurement statistics (RMS) drastically differ from the projective case. This description is based on very general assumptions about quantum systems, most importantly maintaining continuous dynamics of the coherent part of the state. Our findings imply that the significantly different measurement statistics in the collapse-free description should be qualitatively replicated by any modification of standard quantum theory that is lacking explicit wave-function collapses.</description>

      <title>Speeding up thermalization and quantum state preparation through engineered quantum collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize fast thermalization and state preparation of a single mode cavity field using a collision model-like approach, where a sequence of qubits or three level system ancillae, sequentially interacting with the field, is engineered with a genetic algorithm approach. In contrast to optimal control techniques, there is no time-dependent system Hamiltonian control deployed and, in contrast to reservoir engineering, the engineered full system-environment dynamics is optimized, and the target is not a steady state. We prove a significant speed up in thermalization - for which we show that diagonal qubit ancilla states are sufficient - and in the preparation of coherent states. We demonstrate the preparation of squeezed states and of highly non-Gaussian states. Our work offers a new alternative for fast preparation of cavity states that lays in between optimal Hamiltonian control and reservoir engineering, and gives further insights on the resources needed to realize or speed up the preparation of such states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how recent protocols developed for the stabilization of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states can be used for the estimation of two-quadrature displacement sensing, with sensitivities approaching the multivariate quantum Cramer-Rao bound. Thanks to the stabilization, this sensor is backaction evading and can function continuously without reset, making it well suited for the detection of itinerant signals. Additionally, we provide numerical simulations showing that the protocol can unconditionally surpass the Gaussian limit of displacement sensing with prior information, even in the presence of realistic noise. Our work shows how reservoir engineering in bosonic systems can be leveraged for quantum metrology, with potential applications in force sensing, waveform estimation and quantum channel learning.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Enhancement of Measurement Precision via a Hybrid Quantum Switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology promises measurement precision beyond the classical limit by using suitably tailored quantum states and detection strategies. However, scaling up this advantage is experimentally challenging, due to the difficulty of generating high-quality large-scale probes. Here, we build a photonic setup that achieves enhanced precision scaling by manipulating the probe's dynamics through operations performed in a coherently controlled order. Our setup applies an unknown rotation and a known orbital angular momentum increase in a coherently controlled order, in a way that reproduces a hybrid quantum SWITCH involving gates generated by both discrete and continuous variables. The unknown rotation angle $\theta$ is measured with precision scaling as $1/4ml$ when a photon undergoes a rotation of $2m\theta$ and an angular momentum shift of $2l \hbar$. With a practical enhancement factor as high as 2317, the ultimate precision in our experiment is $0.0105^{\prime \prime}$ when using $7.16\times10^7$ photons, corresponding to a normalized precision of $\approx 10^{-4}$rad per photon. No photon interaction occurs in our experiment, and the precision enhancement consumes only a linearly increasing amount of physical resources while achieving a nonlinear scaling of the precision. We further indicate that this nonlinear enhancement roots in an in-depth exploration of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (HUP), and our findings not only deepen the understanding of the HUP but also pave a pathway for advancements in quantum metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting superconducting quantum circuits from non-ideal return loss, including out-of-band circulator behavior and enhancing the performance of broadband quantum-limited amplifiers can be accomplished using a superconducting version of a special class of microwave filters known as reflection-less filters. These filters can simultaneously permit low pass band loss to preserve quantum efficiency and broad band reflection-less characteristics in the stop and pass bands. The filter also suppresses thermal photons emitted in its pass band from the termination resistors by the nature of the dual network topology. This work will review the application, theory, design, and modeling of a superconducting reflection-less filter, followed by fabrication details and the presentation of cryogenic performance measurements of a monolithic device. The filter was fabricated using Al on Si, incorporating NiCr resistors, which allows for simple integration with other superconducting quantum devices. The filter with an area of 0.6 $\mathrm{\mathbf{mm^2}}$ achieves insertion loss below 1 dB, including its connectorized package over a 80\% fractional bandwidth centered at 8 GHz, and 10 dB packaged return loss from DC to above 14.5 GHz.</description>

      <title>Sequential Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate sequential quantum computing (SQC), a paradigm that utilizes multiple homogeneous or heterogeneous quantum processors in hybrid classical-quantum workflows. In this manner, we are able to overcome the limitations of each type of quantum computer by combining their complementary strengths. Current quantum devices, including analog quantum annealers and digital quantum processors, offer distinct advantages, yet face significant practical constraints when individually used. SQC addresses this by efficient inter-processor transfer of information through bias fields. Consequently, measurement outcomes from one quantum processor are encoded in the initial-state preparation of the subsequent quantum computer. We experimentally validate SQC by solving a combinatorial optimization problem with interactions up to three-body terms. A D-Wave quantum annealer utilizing 678 qubits approximately solves the problem, and an IBM's 156-qubit digital quantum processor subsequently refines the obtained solutions. This is possible via the digital introduction of non-stoquastic counterdiabatic terms unavailable to the analog quantum annealer. The experiment shows a substantial reduction in computational resources and improvement in the quality of the solution compared to the standalone operations of the individual quantum processors. These results highlight SQC as a powerful and versatile approach for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems, with potential applications in quantum simulation of many-body systems, quantum chemistry, among others.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Quantum Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing approaches the threshold where certain tasks demonstrably outpace their classical machines, the need for a precise, clear, consensus-driven definition of quantum advantage becomes essential. Rapid progress in the field has blurred this term across companies, architectures, and application domains. Here, we aim to articulate an operational definition for quantum advantage that is both platform-agnostic and empirically verifiable. Building on this framework, we highlight the algorithmic families most likely to achieve early advantage. Finally, we outline our vision for the near future, in which quantum computers enhance existing high-performance computing platforms, enabling new frontiers in chemistry, materials discovery, optimization, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Continuous operation of a coherent 3,000-qubit system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atoms are a promising platform for quantum science, enabling advances in areas ranging from quantum simulations and computation to metrology, atomic clocks and quantum networking. While atom losses typically limit these systems to a pulsed mode, continuous operation could significantly enhance cycle rates, remove bottlenecks in metrology, and enable deep-circuit quantum evolution through quantum error correction. Here we demonstrate an experimental architecture for high-rate, continuous reloading and operation of a large-scale atom array system while realizing coherent storage and manipulation of quantum information. Our approach utilizes a series of two optical lattice conveyor belts to transport atom reservoirs into the science region, where atoms are repeatedly extracted into optical tweezers without affecting the coherence of qubits stored nearby. Using a reloading rate of 300,000 atoms in tweezers per second, we create over 30,000 initialized qubits per second, which we leverage to assemble and maintain an array of over 3,000 atoms for more than two hours. Furthermore, we demonstrate persistent refilling of the array with atomic qubits in either a spin-polarized or a coherent superposition state while preserving the quantum state of stored qubits. Our results pave the way for realization of large-scale continuously operated atomic clocks, sensors, and fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Architectural mechanisms of a universal fault-tolerant quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is believed to be essential for the realization of large-scale quantum computers. However, due to the complexity of operating on the encoded `logical' qubits, understanding the physical principles for building fault-tolerant quantum devices and combining them into efficient architectures is an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we utilize reconfigurable arrays of up to 448 neutral atoms to implement all key elements of a universal, fault-tolerant quantum processing architecture and experimentally explore their underlying working mechanisms. We first employ surface codes to study how repeated QEC suppresses errors, demonstrating 2.14(13)x below-threshold performance in a four-round characterization circuit by leveraging atom loss detection and machine learning decoding. We then investigate logical entanglement using transversal gates and lattice surgery, and extend it to universal logic through transversal teleportation with 3D [[15,1,3]] codes, enabling arbitrary-angle synthesis with logarithmic overhead. Finally, we develop mid-circuit qubit re-use, increasing experimental cycle rates by two orders of magnitude and enabling deep-circuit protocols with dozens of logical qubits and hundreds of logical teleportations with [[7,1,3]] and high-rate [[16,6,4]] codes while maintaining constant internal entropy. Our experiments reveal key principles for efficient architecture design, involving the interplay between quantum logic and entropy removal, judiciously using physical entanglement in logic gates and magic state generation, and leveraging teleportations for universality and physical qubit reset. These results establish foundations for scalable, universal error-corrected processing and its practical implementation with neutral atom systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17303v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a sufficient condition for the controllability of a bilinear closed quantum system based on the notion of static field and weakly conically connected spectrum. More precisely, we show that if a controlled Hamiltonian with two inputs has a weakly conically connected spectrum, then, freezing one of the two inputs at almost every constant value, the obtained single-input system is controllable. The result is illustrated with two examples, enantiomer-selective excitation in a chiral molecule and the driven Jaynes--Cummings Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel proxy for firm linkages, Characteristic Vector Linkages (CVLs). We use this concept to estimate firm linkages, first through Euclidean similarity, and then by applying Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) to similarity learning. We demonstrate that both methods can be used to construct profitable momentum spillover trading strategies, but QCML similarity outperforms the simpler Euclidean similarity.</description>

      <title>Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating entangled atoms is a prerequisite to modeling quantum materials and remains an outstanding challenge for theory. I introduce a correlated wavefunction approach capable of simulating large entangled systems, and demonstrate its application to a 300-electron active space. Projected-interacting full configuration interaction plus density functional theory PiFCI+DFT combines near-exact correlated wavefunctions of multiple partially-interacting model systems, each corrected by a formally exact density functional. This approach can access large active spaces and visualize entanglement and strong correlation while maintaining competitive accuracy for molecular properties.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Corrections to Quantum Observables in $h\to WW^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Higgs boson decay $h \to WW^* \to \ell^+ \nu_\ell \ell'^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell'}$ provides a unique window into the structure of the Higgs couplings to electroweak gauge bosons and has recently gained attention for its potential to unveil quantum properties such as quantum entanglement between the intermediate gauge bosons. In this work, we present a systematic study of next-to-leading order electroweak corrections to the angular coefficients characterizing this decay. While these coefficients are highly constrained at leading order, radiative corrections induce shifts of up to 5% to the existing terms and generate novel structures that vanish at leading order, breaking previous relations among coefficients. Despite the impact of these higher-order effects, the $h\to WW^*$ channel exhibits greater stability under higher-order corrections compared to the previously studied $h \to ZZ^*$ decay, better preserving the underlying two-qutrit quantum structure.</description>

      <title>Holography for bulk-boundary local topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous article [arXiv:2307.12552], we introduced local topological order (LTO) axioms for quantum spin systems which allowed us to define a physical boundary manifested by a net of boundary algebras in one dimension lower. This gives a formal setting for topological holography, where the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules of the physical boundary algebra captures the bulk topological order.
  In this article, we extend the LTO axioms to quantum spin systems equipped with a topological boundary, again producing a physical boundary algebra for the bulk-boundary system, whose category of (topological) boundary DHR bimodules recovers the topological boundary order. We perform this analysis in explicit detail for Levin-Wen and Walker-Wang bulk-boundary systems.
  Along the way, we introduce a 2D braided categorical net of algebras built from a unitary braided fusion category (UBFC). Such nets arise as boundary algebras of Walker-Wang models. We consider the canonical state on this braided categorical net corresponding to the standard topological boundary for the Walker-Wang model. Interestingly, in this state, the cone von Neumann algebras are type I with finite dimensional centers, in contrast with the type II and III cone von Neumann algebras from the Levin-Wen models studied in [arXiv:2307.12552]. Their superselection sectors recover the underlying unitary category of our UBFC, and we conjecture the superselection category also captures the fusion and braiding.</description>

      <title>PhasePoly: An Optimization Framework forPhase Polynomials in Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has transformative computational power to make classically intractable computing feasible. As the algorithms that achieve practical quantum advantage are beyond manual tuning, quantum circuit optimization has become extremely important and integrated into today's quantum software stack. This paper focuses on a critical type of quantum circuit optimization -- phase-polynomial optimization. Phase polynomials represents a class of building-block circuits that appear frequently in quantum modular exponentials (the most time-consuming component in Shor's factoring algorithm), in quantum approximation optimization algorithms (QAOA), and in Hamiltonian simulations. Compared to prior work on phase polynomials, we focus more on the impact of phase polynomial synthesis in the context of whole-circuit optimization, from single-block phase polynomials to multiple block phase polynomials, from greedy equivalent sub-circuit replacement strategies to a systematic parity matrix optimization approach, and from hardware-oblivious logical circuit optimization to hardware-friendly logical circuit optimization. We also provide a utility of our phase polynomial optimization framework to generate hardware-friendly building blocks. Our experiments demonstrate improvements of up to 50%-with an average total gate reduction of 34.92%-and reductions in the CNOT gate count of up to 48.57%, averaging 28.53%, for logical circuits. Additionally, for physical circuits, we achieve up to 47.65% CNOT gate reduction with an average reduction of 25.47% across a representative set of important benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03334v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising for solving practical problems such as combinatorial optimization, quantum chemistry simulation, quantum machine learning, and quantum error correction on noisy quantum computers. However, with typical random ansatz or quantum alternating operator ansatz, derived variational quantum algorithms become a black box that cannot be trusted for model interpretation, not to mention deploying as applications in informing critical decisions: the results of these variational parameters are just rotational angles for the quantum gates and have nothing to do with interpretable values that a model can provide directly. In this paper, we construct the first interpretable quantum regression algorithm, in which the quantum state exactly encodes the classical data table and the variational parameters correspond directly to the regression coefficients, which are real numbers by construction, providing a high degree of model interpretability and minimal cost to optimize due to the right expressiveness. We also take advantage of the encoded data structure to reduce the time complexity of computing the regression map. To shorten the circuit depth for nonlinear regression, our algorithm can be extended by building nonlinear features by classical preprocessing as the independent encoded column vectors. Even though the realization of compressed encoding in superconducting qubits has been achieved by the less noisy compressed encoding recently by the authors, we envision potential quantum utilities with multi-qubit gates implemented in neutral cold atoms and ions.</description>

Abstract: We provide three improvements to the product formula implementation of the ground state energy estimation algorithm via Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. These consist of smaller circuit templates for each Hamiltonian term, parallelization of commuting controlled rotations, and more efficient parallel scheduling. These improvements may be regarded separately, and we anticipate that they may be combined with other improvements to the product formula implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently multiple families of spin chain models were found, which have a free fermionic spectrum,even though they are not solvable by a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Instead, the free fermions emerge as a result of a rather intricate construction. In this work we consider the quantum circuit formulation of the problem. We construct circuits using local unitary gates built from the terms in the local Hamiltonians of the respective models, and ask the question: which circuit geometries (sequence of gates) lead to a free fermionic spectrum? Our main example is the 4-fermion model of Fendley, where we construct free fermionic circuits with various geometries. In certain cases we prove the free fermionic nature, while for other geometries we confirm it numerically. Surprisingly, we find that many standard brickwork circuits are not free fermionic, but we identify certain symmetric constructions which are. We also consider a recent generalization of the 4-fermion model and obtain the factorization of its transfer matrix, and subsequently derive a free-fermionic circuit for this case as well.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates quantum obesity (QO), quantum discord (QD), and the quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) for bipartite Gisin states subjected to Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilation of spacetime on the second qubit. These three quantifiers are introduced to characterize quantum correlations beyond entanglement and can also function as entanglement witnesses. Our results demonstrate a monotonic decrease in the physical accessibility of both QD and QO as the dilation parameter increases within the region-I of the second qubit. Conversely, in the anti-particle region, the accessibility of QD and QO stabilizes at finite values of the dilation parameter owing to the influence of the Pauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics, subsequently increasing gradually. Notably, the QSE in the region-I expands as the Dirac field frequency rises and the dilation parameter diminishes, while the opposite trend is observed in the anti-particle region.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Stabilization of Floquet States Using Static Dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet engineering, in which the properties of a quantum system are modified through the application of strong periodic drives, is an indispensable tool in atomic and condensed matter systems. However, it is inevitably limited by intrinsic heating processes. We describe a simple autonomous scheme, which exploits a static coupling between the driven system and a lossy auxiliary, to cool large classes of Floquet systems into desired states. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of non-classical states, such as high photon number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Quantum Subsystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several prior attempts to formulate the Laws of Thermodynamics for a small region within a larger quantum system have led to inconsistencies and unexplained infinities. The entropy and external work, in particular, require careful analysis when partitioning over the various subsystems. In this work, we analyze the thermodynamics of a quantum subsystem driven quasi-statically by external forces. We show that the thermodynamic functions of a quantum subsystem can be defined dynamically in terms of its local spectrum. The external work is found to be intrinsically nonlocal due to the nonlocal character of the underlying quantum states. This nonlocal quantum work can be harnessed in a "quantum lever" to provide up to 100% amplification of the local work done on a quantum subsystem.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected Bell-cat states in a simple spin model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the topological properties of the so-called central spin model that consists of $N$ identical spins coupled to a single distinguishable central spin which arises in physical systems such as circuit-QED and bosonic Josephson junctions coupled to an impurity atom. The model closely corresponds to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model except that the chain of sites in the SSH model is replaced by a chain of states in Fock space specifying the magnetization. We find that the model accommodates topologically protected eigenstates that are `Bell-cat' states consisting of a Schr\"{o}dinger cat state of the $N$ spins that is maximally entangled with the central spin, and show how this state can be adiabatically created and moved along the chain by driving the central spin. The Bell-cat states are visualized by plotting their Wigner function and we explore their robustness against random noise by solving the master equation for the density matrix. We also explain the essential topological difference between identical spins and the excitations of a bosonic mode.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the transition from topology to chaos in a kicked quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work theoretically investigates the transition from topology to chaos in a periodically driven system consisting of a quantum top coupled to a spin-1/2 particle. The system is driven by two alternating interaction kicks per period. For small kick strengths, localized topologically protected bound states exist, and as the kick strengths increase, these states proliferate. However, at large kick strengths they gradually delocalize in stages, eventually becoming random orthonormal vectors as chaos emerges. We identify the delocalization of the bound states as a finite size effect where their proliferation leads to their eventual overlap. This insight allows us to make analytic predictions for the onset and full emergence of chaos which are supported by numerical results of the quasi-energy level spacing ratio and R\'enyi entropy. A dynamical probe is also proposed to distinguish chaotic from regular behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Stochastic Differential Equations: A Schr\"odingerisation Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are known for their potential to achieve up-to-exponential speedup compared to classical computers for certain problems. To exploit the advantages of quantum computers, we propose quantum algorithms for linear stochastic differential equations, utilizing the Schr\"odingerisation method for the corresponding approximate equation by treating the noise term as a (discrete-in-time) forcing term. Our algorithms are applicable to stochastic differential equations with both Gaussian noise and $\alpha$-stable L\'evy noise. The gate complexity of our algorithms exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(d\log(Nd))$ dependence on the dimensions $d$ and sample sizes $N$, where its corresponding classical counterpart requires nearly exponentially larger complexity in scenarios involving large sample sizes. In the Gaussian noise case, we show the strong convergence of first order in the mean square norm for the approximate equations. The algorithms are numerically verified for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, geometric Brownian motions, and one-dimensional L\'evy flights.</description>

      <title>Optimal qubit-mediated quantum heat transfer via noncommuting operators and strong coupling effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat transfer in quantum systems is a current topic of interest due to emerging quantum technologies that attempt to miniaturize engines and examine fundamental aspects of thermodynamics. In this work, we consider heat transfer between two thermal reservoirs in which a central spin degree of freedom mediates the process. Our objective is to identify the system-bath coupling operators that maximize heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling strengths. By employing a Markovian embedding method in the form of the reaction-coordinate mapping, we study numerically heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling energy and for general system-bath coupling operators between the baths and the central qubit system. We find a stark contrast in the conditions required for optimal heat transfer depending on whether the system is weakly or strongly coupled to the heat baths. In the weak-coupling regime, optimal heat transfer requires identical coupling operators that facilitate maximum sequential transport, resonant with the central qubit. In contrast, in the strong-coupling regime, noncommuting system-bath coupling operators between the hot and cold reservoirs are necessary to achieve optimal heat transfer. We further employ the Effective Hamiltonian theory and gain partial analytical insights into the observed phenomena. We discuss the limitations of this approximate method in capturing the behavior of the heat current for noncommuting coupling operators, calling for its future extensions to capture transport properties in systems with general interaction Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Characterizing phase transitions and criticality in non-Hermitian extensions of the XY model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study non-Hermitian extensions of the paradigmatic spin-1/2 XY chain in a magnetic field. Using the mapping of the model to free fermion form, we provide analytical insights into the energy spectrum of the non-Hermitian model and establish an intrinsic connection between the quasienergies and topological invariants. We also use exact diagonalization as a supplementary method to examine the performance of biorthogonal-based expectation values. Our results confirm that the theoretical analysis is consistent with the numerical results, with the extended phase diagram determined via the analytical solution and the critical behavior of the fidelity and entanglement. The entanglement transition goes hand in hand with the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. Like the Hermitian case, we analyze the critical behavior using finite-size scaling. Our results show that non-Hermiticity can induce the system into a new universality class with unusual critical exponent. We also emphasize the ability of the Loschmidt echo to characterize potential phase transitions and introduce the average of the Loschmidt echo to describe phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is argued from several points of view that quantum probabilities might play a role in statistical settings. New approaches toward quantum foundations have postulates that appear to be equally valid in macroscopic settings. One such approach is described here in detail, while one other is briefly sketched. In particular, arguments behind the Born rule, which gives the basis for quantum probabilities, are given. A list of ideas for possible statistical applications of quantum probabilities is provided and discussed. A particular area is machine learning, where there exists substantial literature on links to quantum probability. Here, an idea about model reduction is sketched and is motivated from a quantum probability model. Quantum models can play a role in model reduction, where the partial least squares regression model is a special case. It is shown that for certain experiments, a Bayesian prior given by a quantum probability can be motivated. Quantum decision theory is an emerging discipline that can be motivated by this author's theory of quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Preparing Code States via Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuits: Application to Tetra-Digit Topological Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unified and efficient quantum circuit framework, termed the \emph{Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuit} (SEESQC) to prepare quantum states in code space of topological error-correcting codes. Specifically, we apply SEESQC to prepare code states of Tetra-Digit models -- a broad class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes indexed by a four-digit parameter. These models are not rare but encompass Toric Codes across arbitrary dimensions and subsume the X-cube fracton code as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of generalized entanglement renormalization group, many Tetra-Digit models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. In this work, we first graphically and algebraically demonstrate quantum circuits for computational basis states, before generalizing to broader cases. Central to this framework is a key ingredient termed the \emph{seed-entangler} acting on a small number of qubits termed \textit{seeds}, enabling a systematic scheme to achieve arbitrary code states. Remarkably, the number of available seeds equals the number of logical qubits for the constructed examples, which leaves plenty of room for future investigation in theoretical physics, mathematics and quantum information science. With experimental feasibility via synthetic dimensions in modern quantum simulators, this framework transcends spatial dimensions, bridges liquid and non-liquid states, unifies gapped phases governed by distinct entanglement renormalization group schemes, and offers a pathway toward engineering topological phases and manipulating logical qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this review article we present a comprehensive review of degenerate solutions to the Dirac and Weyl equations, highlighting novel and significant findings. Specifically, we demonstrate that all Weyl particles, and under certain conditions Dirac particles, can occupy the same quantum state under an extensive range of electromagnetic 4-potentials and fields. These fields, which are infinite in number, have been explicitly derived and analysed. Additionally, we establish that Weyl particles can form localized states even in the absence of external electromagnetic fields. Moreover, we show that their localization can be precisely controlled through the application of simple electric fields, offering a tuneable mechanism for manipulating these particles. Building on these insights, we propose an innovative device that utilizes Weyl fermions to control the flow of information at an unprecedented rate of up to 100 petabits per second. This finding has significant implications regarding the development of next-generation electronic and quantum information technologies, as it presents a fundamentally new approach to high-speed data processing and transmission.</description>

Abstract: The Hartree-Fock-Rothaan equations are solved for He-like ions using the iterative self-consistent method. New complete and orthonormal sets of exponential-type orbitals are employed as the basis. These orbitals satisfy the orthonormality condition for quantum numbers with fractional power. They are solutions of a Schrodinger-like differential equation derived by the authors. In a recent study conducted for the calculation of the hydrogen atom energy levels, it has been demonstrated that the fractional formalism of the principal and the angular momentum quantum numbers converges to the 1s level of the ground state energy of hydrogen atom, obtained from the solution of the standard Schrodinger equation. This study examines the effect of fractional values of the quantum numbers for two-electron systems, which is the simplest system with electron correlation effects.</description>

Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT) is crucial for characterizing operations in quantum gates and circuits, however, existing methods face scalability and noise sensitivity challenges. Here, we propose a QPT approach based on universal compilation, which systematically decomposes quantum processes into optimized Kraus operators and Choi matrices. This method utilizes efficient algorithms to improve accuracy while reducing resource requirements. We benchmark our approach through numerical simulations of random unitary gates, demonstrating highly accurate quantum process characterization. Additionally, we apply it to dephasing processes with time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous noise, achieving improved fidelity and robustness. Our work further enables broader applications in quantum error correction and device validation.</description>

Abstract: We consider geometric methods of ``rotating" the toric code in higher dimensions to reduce the qubit count. These geometric methods can be used to prepare higher dimensional toric code states using single shot techniques, and in turn these may be used to prepare entangled logical states such as Bell pairs or GHZ states. This bears some relation to measurement-based quantum computing in a twisted spacetime. We also propose a generalization to more general stabilizer codes, and we present computer analysis of optimal rotations in low dimensions. We present methods to do logical Clifford operations on these codes using crystalline symmetries and surgery, and we present a method for state injection at low noise into stabilizer quantum codes generalizing previous ideas for the two-dimensional toric code.</description>

Abstract: It is known that $\rho^{AB}$ as a bipartite reduced state of the 3-qubit GHZ state is separable, but part $A$ and part $B$ are indeed entangled with each other without tracing out part $C$. Namely, whether a state containing entanglement is always dependent on the global system it lives in. We explore here such entanglement in any $n$-partite system with arbitrary dimensions, $n\geqslant3$, and call it partitewise entanglement (PWE) which contains pairwise entanglement (PE) proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 032420(2024)] as a special case. In particular, we investigate the partitewise entanglement extensibility and give a measure of such extensibility, and from which we find that the reduced state of a genuine entangled state could be any mixed state without pure reduced states, and that the maximal partitewise entanglement extension is its purification. We then propose three classes of the partitewise entanglement measures which are based on the genuine entanglement measure, minimal bipartition measure, and the minimal distance from the partitewise separable states, respectively. The former two methods are far-ranging since all of them are defined by the reduced functions. Consequently, we establish the framework of the resource theory of the partitewise entanglement and the genuine partitewise entanglement for which the free states are the states with pure reduced states.</description>

      <title>Continuous quantum correction on Markovian and Non-Markovian models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate continuous quantum error correction, comparing performance under a Markovian error model to two distinct non-Markovian models. The first non-Markovian model involves an interaction Hamiltonian between the system and an environmental qubit via an X-X coupling, with a "cooling" bath acting on the environment qubit. This model is known to exhibit abrupt transitions between Markovian and non-Markovian behavior. The second non-Markovian model uses the post-Markovian master equation (PMME), which represents the bath correlation through a memory kernel; we consider an exponentially decaying kernel and both underdamped and overdamped dynamics. We systematically compare these non-Markovian error models against the Markovian case and against each other, for a variety of different codes. We start with a single qubit, which can be solved analytically. We then consider the three-qubit repetition code and the five-qubit "perfect" code. In all cases, we find that the fidelity decays more rapidly in the Markovian case than in either non-Markovian model, suggesting that continuous quantum error correction has enhanced performance against non-Markovian noise. We attribute this difference to the presence of a quantum Zeno regime in both non-Markovian models.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Quantum Error Correction with Hypergraph Product Code and Rotated Surface Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a hierarchical quantum error correction (QEC) scheme that concatenates hypergraph product (HGP) codes with rotated surface codes, which is compatible with quantum computers with only nearest-neighbor interactions. The upper layer employs (3,4)-random HGP codes, known for their constant encoding rate and favorable distance scaling, while the lower layer consists of a rotated surface code with distance 5, allowing hardware compatibility through lattice surgery. To address the decoding bottleneck, we utilize a soft-decision decoding strategy that combines belief propagation with ordered statistics (BP-OS) decoding, enhanced by a syndrome-conditioned logical error probability computed via a tailored lookup table for the lower layer. Numerical simulations under a code capacity noise model demonstrate that our hierarchical codes achieve logical error suppression below the threshold. Furthermore, we derive explicit conditions under which the proposed codes surpass surface codes in both qubit efficiency and error rate. In particular, for the size parameter $s \geq 4$ (which corresponds to 16 logical qubits) and the distance $d\geq 25$, our construction outperforms the rotated surface code in practical regimes with physical error rates around or less than $10^{-2}$. These results suggest that concatenated qLDPC-surface architectures offer a scalable and resource-efficient path toward near-term fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24765v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents an intersection of quantum computing and classical machine learning, aiming to use quantum resources to support model training and inference. This paper reviews recent developments in supervised QML, focusing on methods such as variational quantum circuits, quantum neural networks, and quantum kernel methods, along with hybrid quantum-classical workflows. We examine recent experimental studies that show partial indications of quantum advantage and describe current limitations including noise, barren plateaus, scalability issues, and the lack of formal proofs of performance improvement over classical methods. The main contribution is a ten-year outlook (2025-2035) that outlines possible developments in supervised QML, including a roadmap describing conditions under which QML may be used in applied research and enterprise systems over the next decade.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans\"atze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) \textit{a.k.a.} Feed Forward Neural Networks, when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the compact convex set of all bi-partite states of Schmidt number less than or equal to $k$, together with that of $k$-blockpositive matrices of trace one, which play the roles of Schmidt number witnesses. In this note, we look for hyperplanes which support those convex sets and are perpendicular to a one parameter family through the maximally mixed state. We show that this is equivalent to determining the intervals for the dual objects on the one parameter family. We illustrate our results for the one parameter families including Werner states and isotropic states. Through the discussion, we give a simple decomposition of the separable Werner state into the sum of product states.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulation of an All-Optical Toffoli Gate using Soliton Scattering through Asymmetric Potential Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and numerically simulate an all-optical Toffoli (controlled-controlled-NOT) gate based on the scattering of spatial solitons by asymmetric P\"oschl-Teller potential wells. In our scheme, the logical state of the target bit is encoded in the relative spatial ordering of two distinguishable soliton components, while the control bits are represented by the presence or absence of external potential wells. We solve the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations governing the soliton dynamics and systematically scan soliton amplitude and velocity, analyzing reflection and transmission coefficients to identify the operational conditions for Toffoli gate behavior. Our results demonstrate that introducing asymmetry in the potential wells significantly broadens the operational parameter window compared to symmetric configurations. We also investigate the impacts of varying degrees of asymmetry and soliton amplitude on gate performance. Furthermore, we examine the influence of weak inter-component coupling and confirm that it is not essential for gate operation. These findings generalize earlier soliton-based CNOT simulations and support the broader feasibility of classical analog modeling of multi-qubit logic gates in nonlinear optical systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangled two-mode Gaussian states constitute an important building block for continuous variable quantum computing and communication protocols and are thus of high demand for many experiments. In this work, we study such kind of states which are extracted from multimode light generated via type-II parametric down-conversion (PDC) in lossy waveguides. For such states, we demonstrate that the squeezing quantifies entanglement and we construct a measurement basis which results in the maximal bipartite entanglement. We illustrate our findings by numerically solving the spatial master equation for PDC in a Markovian environment. The optimal measurement modes are compared with two widely-used broadband bases: the Mercer-Wolf basis (the first-order coherence basis) and the Williamson-Euler basis.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we describe the status of our experiment aimed at measuring the gravitationally induced phase shift on path-entangled photons. We use a kilometer-scale fiber interferometer whose arms are vertically displaced in the Earth gravitational potential, allowing photons propagating at different heights to accumulate different phases. To date, this is the first experiment to measure this effect on massless particles, thereby experimentally combining general relativity and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When quantum measurements are conducted over spacelike-separated regions of spacetime, a natural and commonly assumed physical postulate, called Einstein causality, asserts that they should commute. In this paper, we provide a generalisation to L\"uders' rule \`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture \`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated (pre)compact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. In the simplistic scenario where the measurements are assumed to be instantaneous, this implies quantum no-signalling for non-selective measurements. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</description>

      <title>Universal coherent atom-molecule oscillations in the dynamics of the unitary Bose gas near a narrow Feshbach resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quench experiments on a unitary Bose gas around a broad Feshbach resonance have led to the discovery of universal dynamics. This universality is manifested in the measured atomic momentum distributions where, asymptotically, a quasi-equilibrated metastable state is found in which both the momentum distribution and the time scales are determined by the particle density. In this paper we present counterpart studies but for the case of a very narrow Feshbach resonance of $^{133}$Cs atoms having a width of 8.3 mG. In dramatic contrast to the behavior reported earlier, a rapid quench of an atomic condensate to unitarity is observed to ultimately lead to coherent oscillations involving dynamically produced condensed and non-condensed molecules and atoms. The same characteristic frequency, determined by the Feshbach coupling, is observed in all types of particles. To understand these quench dynamics and how these different particle species are created, we develop a beyond Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov dynamical framework including a new type of cross correlation between atoms and molecules. This leads to a quantitative consistency with the measured frequency. Our results, which can be applied to the general class of bosonic superfluids associated with narrow Feshbach resonances, establish a new paradigm for universal dynamics dominated by quantum many-body interactions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we studied quantum tunneling of massless and massive particles pertaining to a Schwarzschild black hole in a quintessence background, and explored the consequences emerging from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). For the quintessence scenario, we considered two specific cases of $w$, which is the ratio of the pressure and energy density, namely $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3$. For the GUP, we used a modified Schwarzschild metric and employed a unique choice of contour integration to compute the tunneling amplitudes. An analysis and comparative study of the respective temperature profiles has been made. The energy emission rate has also been analysed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To find a suitable framework for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry \&amp; M.R. Dennis's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f configuration. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO. As the opening chapter in a trilogy, this work connects crystal optics, Fourier optics, and nonlinear optics, while integrating theoretical, computational, and experimental physics, advancing all six domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum simulation and the overall prospective of solving correlated many-electron problems using quantum algorithms, we design a gate-based quantum circuit that emulates the dynamics of the Kondo impurity model. We numerically determine the impurity magnetization, entanglement between impurity and fermionic sites and energy as a function of time (i.e.~circuit depth) for various initial states and find universal long-time dynamics. We complement the numerical simulations for moderate system size with an asymptotically exact analytical solution that is effective in the limit of large system sizes and for starting states corresponding to a filled Fermi sea. This work opens up the perspective of studying the dynamics of electronic quantum many-body states on quantum chips of the NISQ era.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the novel electron beam resist Medusa 84 SiH by Allresist GmbH (Germany) for nanostructuring of single crystal diamond and its effects on the spin properties of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanopillars as prototypes for photonic structures. We find contrast curves comparable to those of resists previously used for this task (Hydrogensilsequioxane FOx). We present a minimum selectivity for diamond etching of 6$\pm$1. Using an adhesion-promoting silicon interlayer enables fabrication yields of up to 98\%. We measure $T_2$ times of up to $\sim$25 $\mu$s before and after processing, demonstrating that the manufactured structures are usable for diamond-based quantum sensing.</description>

Abstract: We pioneer the application of quantum information theory to experimentally distinguish between classes of hadronization models. We adapt the CHSH inequality to the fragmentation of a single parton to hadron pairs, a violation of which would rule out classical dynamics of hadronization altogether. Furthermore, we apply and extend the theory of quantum contextuality and local quantum systems to the neutral polarization of a single spin-1 hadronic system, namely the light constituents of excited Sigma baryons $\Sigma^{*}_{c,b}$ formed in the fragmentation of heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>The cognitive triple-slit experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05497</link>

Abstract: Quantum cognition has made it possible to model human cognitive processes very effectively, revealing numerous parallels between the properties of conceptual entities tested by the human mind and those of microscopic entities tested by measurement apparatuses. The success of quantum cognition has also made it possible to formulate an interpretation of quantum mechanics, called the conceptuality interpretation, which ascribes to quantum entities a conceptual nature similar to that of human concepts. The present work fits into these lines of research by analyzing a cognitive version of single, double, and triple-slit experiments. The data clearly show the formation of the typical interference fringes between the slits as well as the embryos of secondary fringes. Our analysis also shows that while quantum entities and human concepts may share a same conceptual nature, the way they manifest it in specific contexts can be quite different. This is also evident from the significant deviation from zero observed for the Sorkin parameter, indicating the presence of strong irreducible third-order interference contributions in human decision.</description>

      <title>Multi-parameter isospectral Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a given Fokker-Planck equation, a multi-parameter deformed partner Fokker-Planck equation is constructed. This is done by first deleting a set of eigenstates of the original FPE by the multi-step Darboux-Crum transformation, and then reinstating the eigen-energy levels by the reverse Darboux-Crum transformation. Extension to fractional Fokker-Planck equation is briefly discussed. A recent study of the one-parameter isospectral FPE applied to black hole in the thermal potential approach is commented.</description>

      <title>Detection of subsurface structures with a vehicle-based atom gravity gradiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18506</link>

Abstract: High-precision mobile gravity gradiometers are very useful in geodesy and geophysics. Atom gravity gradiometers (AGGs) could be among the most accurate mobile gravity gradiometers but are currently constrained by the trade-off between portability and sensitivity. Here, we present a high-sensitivity mobile AGG featuring an ultra-compact sensor head with a volume of only 94 L. In the laboratory, it achieves a sensitivity of 77 E/$\sqrt{Hz}$ (1 E=1$\times10^{-9}$/s$^2$) and a long-term stability of better than 0.5 E. We integrated the instrument in a minivan, enabling efficient mobile field surveys with excellent maneuverability in confined spaces. Using this vehicular system, we surveyed the gravitational field over a set of subsurface structures within a small wooded area, successfully resolving their structural signatures with a signal-to-noise ratio of 57 and quantifying the water depth in a reservoir with an accuracy of $\pm$0.23 m. Compared with previous observations using a CG-5 gravimeter, the superior spatial resolution inherent in gradiometry is clearly demonstrated. This work paves the way for bring AGGs to practical field applications.</description>

      <title>Resonances of recurrence time of monitored quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recurrence time is the time a process first returns to its initial state. Using quantum walks on a graph, the recurrence time is defined through stroboscopic monitoring of the arrival of the particle to a node of the system. When the time interval between repeated measurements is tuned in such a way that eigenvalues of the unitary become degenerate, the mean recurrence time exhibits resonances. These resonances imply faster mean recurrence times, which were recorded on quantum computers. The resonance broadening is captured by a restart uncertainty relation [R. Yin, Q. Wang, S. Tornow, E. Barkai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122, e2402912121 (2025)]. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we extend our investigation to include the impact of system size on the widened resonances, showing how the connectivity and energy spectrum structure of a system influence the restart uncertainty relation. Breaking the symmetry of the system, for example time-reversal symmetry breaking with a magnetic flux applied to a ring, removes the degeneracy of the eigenvalues of the unitary, hence modifying the mean recurrence time and the widening of the transitions, and this effect is studied in detail. The width of resonances studied here is related to the finite time resolution of relevant experiments on quantum computers, and to the restart paradigm.</description>
