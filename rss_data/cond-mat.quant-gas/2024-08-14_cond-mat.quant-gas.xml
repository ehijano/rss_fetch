      <title>Thermal Decay of Planar Jones-Roberts Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogeneous planar superfluids exhibit a range of low-energy excitations that also appear in highly excited states like superfluid turbulence. In dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensates, the Jones- Roberts soliton family includes vortex dipoles and rarefaction pulses in the low and high velocity regimes, respectively. These excitations carry both energy and linear momentum, making their decay characteristics crucial for understanding superfluid dynamics. In this work, we develop the theory of planar soliton decay due to thermal effects, as described by the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii theory of reservoir interactions. We analyze two distinct damping terms involving transfer between the condensate and the non-condensate reservoir: particle transfer that also involves energy and usually drives condensate growth, and number-conserving energy transfer. We provide analytical treatments for both the low and high velocity regimes and identify conditions under which either mechanism dominates. Our findings indicate that energy damping prevails at high phase space density. These theoretical results are supported by numerical studies covering the entire velocity range from vortex dipole to rarefaction pulse. We use interaction energy to characterize rarefaction pulses, analogous to the distance between vortices in vortex dipoles, offering an experimentally accessible test for finite temperature theory in Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Density-Dependent Gauge Field with Raman Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06777v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the gauge field is an everlasting topic in modern physics. Spin-orbit coupling is a powerful tool in ultracold atomic systems, resulting in an artificial gauge field that can be easily manipulated and observed in a tabletop environment. Combining optical lattices and atom-atom interaction, the artificial gauge field can be made density-dependent. In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with spin-orbit coupling, where a density-dependent gauge field emerges spontaneously in low-energy physics. First, we focus on the two-body quantum walk dynamics and give an interpretation of the phenomena with resonant tunneling. Then, we calculate the mean-field phase diagram using the two-site Gutzwiller ansatz. Two types of superfluid phase and a Mott insulator phase are found. Finally, we discuss the experimental realization protocol with Raman lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum-limited generalized measurement for tunnel-coupled condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient readout of the relevant information is pivotal for quantum simulation experiments. Often only single observables are accessed by performing standard projective measurements. In this work, we implement a generalized measurement scheme based on controlled outcoupling of atoms. This gives us simultaneous access to number imbalance and relative phase in a system of two tunnel-coupled 1D Bose gases, which realize a quantum simulator of the sine-Gordon field theory. We demonstrate that our measurement is quantum limited by accessing number squeezing and show that we can track Josephson oscillation dynamics with the generalized measurements. Finally, we show that the scheme allows the extraction of atoms while maintaining the system's coherent dynamics, which opens up the door to accessing multi-time correlation functions. Our scheme constitutes a step towards accessing quantum properties of the sine-Gordon field theory and, in the future, studying spatially extended systems under continuous monitoring.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dirac fields in an expanding universe: dynamical condensates and particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of particle production for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes is crucial to understand the large-scale structure of a universe from an inflationary epoch. In contrast to the free and fixed-background case, the production of particles with strong interactions and back reaction is not completely understood, especially in situations that require going beyond perturbation theory. In this work, we present advances in this direction by focusing on a self-interacting field theory of Dirac fermions in an expanding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By using a Hamiltonian lattice regularization with continuous conformal time and rescaled fields, this model becomes amenable to either a cold-atom analogue-gravity quantum simulation, or a dynamical variational approach. Leveraging a family of variational fermionic Gaussian states, we investigate how dynamical mass generation and the formation of fermion condensates associated to certain broken symmetries modify some well-known results of the free field theory. In particular, we study how the non-perturbative condensates arise and, more importantly, how their real-time evolution has an impact on particle production. Depending on the Hubble expansion rate, we find an interesting interplay of interactions and particle production, including a non-trivial back reaction on the condensates and a parity-breaking spectrum of produced particles.</description>

      <title>Efficient Local Classical Shadow Tomography with Number Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shadow tomography aims to build a classical description of a quantum state from a sequence of simple random measurements. Physical observables are then reconstructed from the resulting classical shadow. Shadow protocols which use single-body random measurements are simple to implement and capture few-body observables efficiently, but do not apply to systems with fundamental number conservation laws, such as ultracold atoms. We address this shortcoming by proposing and analyzing a new local shadow protocol adapted to such systems. The "All-Pairs" protocol requires one layer of two-body gates and only $\textrm{poly}(V)$ samples to reconstruct arbitrary few body observables. Moreover, by exploiting the permutation symmetry of the protocol, we derive a linear time post-processing algorithm. We provide a proof-of-principle reference implementation and demonstrate the reconstruction of 2- and 4-point functions in a paired Luttinger liquid of hardcore bosons.</description>

      <title>Relaxation and fluctuations of a mass- and dipole-conserving stochastic lattice gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Han et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{132}, 137102 (2024)] have recently introduced a classical stochastic lattice gas model which, in addition to particle conservation, also conserves the particles' dipole moment. Because of its intrinsic nonlinearity this model exhibits unusual macroscopic scaling behaviors, different from those of lattice gases that conserve only the number of particles. Here we investigate some basic relaxation and fluctuation properties of this model at large scales and at long times. These properties crucially depend on whether the total number of particles is infinite or finite. We find similarity solutions, describing relaxation of the dipole-conserving gas (DCG) in several standard settings. A major part of our effort is an extension to this model of the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT), previously developed for lattice gases where only the number of particles is conserved. We apply the MFT to the calculation of the variance of nonequilibrium fluctuations of the excess number of particles on the positive semi-axis when starting from an (either deterministic, or random) constant density at $t=0$. Using the MFT, we also identify the equilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the DCG. Finally, based on these results, we determine the probability distribution of, and the most probable density history leading to, a large deviation in the form of a macroscopic void of a given size in an initially uniform DCG at equilibrium.</description>
