      <title>Jet and jet substructure: ALICE Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets and their substructure in pp collisions offer a unique opportunity to probe various aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), ranging from perturbative QCD (pQCD) tests to studies of non-perturbative phenomena such as hadronization. They also probe the transition between perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. In heavy-ion collisions, jets serve as a novel tool to investigate the microscopic properties of the deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Recently, significant progress has been made in developing jet substructure observables to explore these properties. The ALICE experiment is particularly well-suited for jet measurements due to its high-precision tracking system, which is especially beneficial for detecting low transverse momentum jets. This contribution will highlight recent ALICE measurements of inclusive and semi-inclusive jets, along with various jet substructure observables in pp, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions. The comparisons between data and predictions from Monte Carlo (MC) models as well as analytical calculations will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Refined topology of the N = 20 island of inversion with high precision mass measurements of $^{31-33}$Na and $^{31-35}$Mg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass measurements of $^{31-33}$Na and $^{31-35}$Mg using the TITAN MR-TOF-MS at TRIUMF's ISAC facility are presented, with the uncertainty of the $^{33}$Na mass reduced by over two orders of magnitude. The excellent performance of the MR-TOF-MS has also allowed the discovery of a millisecond isomer in $^{32}$Na. The precision obtained shows that the binding energy of the normally closed N = 20 neutron shell reaches a minimum for $^{32}$Mg but increases significantly for $^{31}$Na, hinting at the possibility of enhanced shell strength toward the unbound $^{28}$O. We compare the results with new ab initio predictions that raise intriguing questions of nuclear structure beyond the dripline.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of quarkonia in vortical quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin alignment of $J/\psi$ with respect to event plane in relativistic heavy ion collisions exhibits a significant signal. We propose a possible mechanism for spin alignment through spin dependent dissociation of quarkonia in a vortical quark-gluon plasma. The spin dependent dissociation is realized through inelastic scattering between constituents of quarkonium and those of quark-gluon plasma polarized by the vorticity. The spin dependent dissociation rate is found to depend on the directions of vorticity, quantization axis, and quark momentum. We implement our results in a dissociation dominated evolution model for quarkonia in the Bjorken flow, finding the spin $0$ state is slightly suppressed compared to the average of the other two, which is consistent with the sign found in experiments. We also find absence of logarithmic enhancement in binding energy in the vortical correction to dissociation rate, which is understood from the requirement that a spin dependent dissociation can only come from quark coupling to a pair of chromomagnetic and chromoelectric field.</description>

      <title>Delta isobar resonance effects on nuclear matrix elements for double and single beta decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for double and single beta decays are crucial for studying neutrino properties beyond and within the standard model. The NMEs consist mainly of the spin isospin components. The delta isobar resonance, which is strongly excited by the qualk spin isospin excitation, is shown to quench the spin isospin NMEs by a coefficient around 0.7. Impact of the delta resonance on neutrino studies in nuclei is discused.</description>

      <title>Insights into the $\mathbf{\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}}$ transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report novel theoretical results for the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition, utilizing a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector$\,\otimes\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) within the Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs) formalism. In this approach, both nucleon, $N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+$, and $\Delta(1232)$'s parity partner, $\Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$, are treated as quark-diquark composites, with their internal structures governed accordingly by a tractable truncation of the Poincar\'e-covariant Faddeev equation. Nonpointlike quark+quark (diquark) correlations within baryons, which are deeply tied to the processes driving hadron mass generation, are inherently dynamic in the sense that they continually break apart and recombine guided by the Faddeev kernel. For the nucleon, isoscalar-scalar and isovector-axial-vector diquarks dominate, while the $\Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ state only includes contributions from isovector-axial-vector diquarks because the SCI-interaction excludes isovector-vector diquarks. Once the Faddeev wave function of the baryons involved in the electromagnetic transition is normalized taking into account that its elastic electric form factor must be one at the on-shell photon point, we compute the transition form factors that describe the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ reaction and, using algebraic relations, derive the corresponding helicity amplitudes. When comparing with experiment, our findings highlight a strong sensitivity of these observables to the internal structure of baryons, offering valuable insights. Although the SCI-framework has obvious limitations, its algebraic simplicity provides analytical predictions that serve as useful benchmarks for guiding more refined studies within QCD-based DSEs frameworks.</description>

      <title>Impact of Tracking Resolutions on $\phi$-Meson Spin Alignment Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of global spin alignment of vector mesons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions can provide unique insights into spin-orbit interactions and vector meson dynamics in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in those collisions. The global spin alignment is measured by the $00^{\rm th}$ coefficient of the spin density matrix, $\rho_{00}$, via the polar angle ($\theta^{*}$) of the decay-daughter momentum in the parent rest frame with respect to the direction of the orbital angular momentum of the collision. Such measurements are affected by the angular and momentum resolutions of the reconstructed tracks in the experiment. Such effects are nontrivial because of kinematic complications caused by the boost to the parent rest frame, and could be important given that the global spin alignment signal is weak. In this paper, we investigate the effects of experimental tracking resolutions on measurements of the $\phi$(1020) meson $\rho_{00}$. We study these effects for two methods of $\rho_{00}$ measurements, the conventional method analyzing the $\phi$-meson yield versus $\cos^2 \theta^*$ and the invariant mass ($m_{\rm inv}$) method utilizing $\langle\cos^2\theta^*\rangle$ versus $m_{\rm inv}$. Using typical resolution values from experiments, we find that the effect of track resolution on $\rho_{00}$ is small, well within typical measurement uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Investigating radial flow-like effects via pseudorapidity and transverse spherocity dependence of particle production in pp collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) like signatures in high multiplicity proton-proton (pp) collisions, have compelled the heavy-ion physics community to re-examine small collision systems for proper baseline studies. Event-shape-based studies in pp collisions have succeeded to a certain extent in identifying the rare events mimicking such heavy-ion-like behaviour. In this study, we incorporate PYTHIA8 and AMPT to study radial flow-like signatures in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV as a function of transverse spherocity and pseudorapidity. The selection of softer events possibly carrying heavy-ion-like features is performed using the transverse spherocity event-shape observable. As the particle production mechanism in midrapidity differs greatly from the forward rapidity, a pseudorapidity-dependent study is meaningful. Keeping ALICE 3 upgrades at the LHC in mind, this study aims to demonstrate the transverse spherocity and pseudorapidity dependence of the mean transverse momentum, particle ratios, and kinetic freezeout parameters in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using PYTHIA8. We observe that the isotropic events show enhanced radial-flow effects in all multiplicity classes, however, the jetty events show signatures of the radial flow-like effects only in high-multiplicity events. For the first time, we show the transverse spherocity and pseudorapidity dependence of partonic modification factor in pp collisions, which clearly shows that by choosing transverse spherocity, one can directly probe the radial flow-like effects in pp collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Subspace-projected multireference covariant density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00691v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Pseudorapidity distributions of charged hadrons in lead-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pseudorapidity ($\eta$) distributions of charged hadrons are measured using data collected at the highest ever nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV for collisions of lead-lead ions. The data were recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2022 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 0.30 $\pm$ 0.03 $\mu$b$^{-1}$. Using the CMS silicon pixel detector, the yields of primary charged hadrons produced in the range $\vert\eta\vert$ $\lt$ 2.6 are reported. The evolution of the midrapidity particle density as a function of collision centrality is also reported. In the 5% most central collisions, the charged-hadron $\eta$ density in the range $\vert\eta\vert$ $\lt$ 0.5 is found to be 2032 $\pm$ 91 (syst), with negligible statistical uncertainty. This result is consistent with an extrapolation from nucleus-nucleus collision data at lower center-of-mass energies. Comparisons are made to various Monte Carlo event generators and to previous measurements of lead-lead and xenon-xenon collisions at similar collision energies. These new data detail the dependence of particle production on the collision energy, initial collision geometry, and the size of the colliding nuclei.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for radiative corrections to charged-current processes II: Axial-vector coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the hadronic structure-dependent radiative corrections to the axial-vector coupling that controls single-nucleon weak charged-current processes -- commonly denoted by $g_A$. We match the Standard Model at the GeV scale onto chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order in the one-nucleon sector, in the presence of electromagnetic and weak interactions. As a result, we provide a representation for the corrections to $g_A$ in terms of infrared finite convolutions of simple kernels with the single-nucleon matrix elements of time-ordered products of two and three quark bilinears (vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar). We discuss strategies to determine the required non-perturbative input from data, lattice-QCD (+QED), and possibly hadronic models. This work paves the way for a precise comparison of the values of the ratio $g_A/g_V$ extracted from experiment and from lattice-QCD, which constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung photon contributions to parton energy loss at high virtuality ($Q^2$) : a perturbative calculation at $O(\alpha_{s} \alpha_{em})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, real photon production scattering rates from jet-medium interactions in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is perturbatively calculated using the higher-twist (HT) formalism. Focus is given towards real photon production from a highly virtual (and highly energetic) quark, taking into account heavy-quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128-170 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as that used in e-A deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernel that goes beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams are classified based on the final state particles, and include four types of scattering kernels at $O(\alpha_{s}\alpha_{em})$ giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon (iii) virtual photon corrections to quark-antiquark pair-production and (iv) virtual photon correction to quark-quark production. The collision-kernel, thus derived, includes full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy-quark mass effects, thus exploring heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions, and the related jet transport coefficients, have a hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.</description>
