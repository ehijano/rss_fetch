      <title>Role of neutron pairing with density-gradient dependence in the semi-microscopic treatment of the inner crust of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the fourth-order extended Thomas-Fermi method with Strutinsky-integral shell and pairing corrections, we calculate the inner crust of neutron stars with the BSk31 functional, whose pairing has two terms: i) a term that is fitted to the results of microscopic calculations on homogeneous nuclear matter (accounting for both medium polarization and self-energy effects) that are more realistic than those of our earlier functionals; ii) an empirical term that is dependent on the density gradient, which permits an excellent fit to nuclear masses. Both proton and neutron pairing are taken into account, the former in the BCS theory and the latter in the local density approximation. We found that the equilibrium value of the proton number $Z$ remains 40 over the entire density range considered, whether or not neutron pairing is included. The new equation of state and the composition are very similar to those of our previously preferred functional, BSk24. However, the predicted neutron pairing fields are quite different. In particular, clusters are found to be impermeable to the neutron superfluid. The implications for the neutron superfluid dynamics are briefly discussed. Since the new pairing is more realistic, the functional BSk31 is better suited for investigating neutron superfluidity in neutron-star crusts.</description>

      <title>On the extraction of fission mode properties from fragment mass distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Fission modes are typically characterised by fragment mass and total kinetic energy centroids, around which a distribution of these variables is observed. These distributions are usually fitted with Gaussian functions.
  Purpose: To investigate how the properties of these ``Gaussian fission modes'' compare with underlying ``theoretical fission modes'' defined from the potential energy surface of the fissioning nuclei.
  Methods: A simple approach, inspired by the scission point model, is introduced to investigate the impact of anharmonicity of the potential along the scission line on Gaussian mode properties. This approach is also used to evaluated an ``effective potential'' from the yields.
  Results: Several Gaussian functions are usually required to fit yields from non-harmonic potentials associated with a unique theoretical mode. Similarly, ``effective fission modes'', defined from the wells of the effective potentials, are sometime very different to the Gaussian modes. For instance, the S1 and S2 Brosa modes contribute to the same effective potential well at scission.
  Conclusions: Gaussian fits are useful to identify the role of shell effects in fission. However, comparisons with theoretical potential energy surfaces are better carried with effective potentials extracted from the yields, assuming that a broad range of excitation energies is available.</description>

      <title>Simulating collectivity in dense baryon matter with multiple fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on construction of a modern multi-fluid approach to heavy-ion collisions at FAIR/BES energies (MUFFIN) and show the reproduction of basic experimental observables in Au-Au collisions in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program. We also show the $p_T$-differential and $p_T$-integrated polarization of (anti-)$\Lambda$ hyperons. In MUFFIN simulations, we observe a strong splitting between polarizations of $\Lambda$ and anti-$\Lambda$. The splitting is driven purely by a finite baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Accurate calculation of low energy scattering phase shifts of charged particles in a harmonic oscillator trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the elastic scattering of two charged particles, we present two methods for numerically solving the generalized Coulomb-corrected BERW formula with high accuracy across the entire energy spectrum. We illustrate these methods using p-alpha scattering, employing a phenomenological p-alpha short-range interaction. Our results reproduce the phase shifts computed with the Numerov method for all l=0 and l=1 channels. We also provide full access to the Python script used to obtain these results, which can be readily applied to a wide range of core-fragment scattering problems in nuclear and atomic physics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Single Inclusive Jet Production: Small-$R$ Resummation at Next-to-Leading Logarithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precision description of jet production plays an important role in many aspects of collider physics. In a recent paper we have presented a new factorization theorem for inclusive small radius jet production. The jet function appearing in our factorization theorem exhibits a non-standard renormalization group evolution, which, starting at next-to-leading logarithm (NLL), differs from previous results in the literature. In this paper we perform a first phenomenological study using our newly developed formalism, applying it to compute the spectrum of small radius jets in $e^+e^-\to J+X$ at NLL. We compare our results with previous predictions, highlighting the numerical impact of previously neglected terms throughout phase space. Our approach can be used for a variety of different collider systems, in particular, $ep$ and $pp$ collisions, with broad applications to the jet substructure program. Most importantly, since our factorization theorem is valid to all orders, the approach developed here will enable NNLL resummation of small radius logarithms in inclusive jet production, extending the precision of jet substructure calculations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of glueballs in Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents preliminary results of the first determination of the energy-momentum tensor form factors of the scalar glueball, referred to as gravitational form factors (GFFs). The calculation has been carried out in lattice Yang-Mills theory at a single lattice spacing. Using variationally optimized operators, the matrix elements are extracted from ratios of three-point functions to two-point functions. The glueball GFFs and their kinematic dependence are compared to those of other hadrons from previous calculations.</description>

      <title>Transverse Energy-Energy Correlator for Vector Boson-Tagged Hadron Production in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transverse energy-energy correlator (TEEC) event-shape observable for back-to-back $\gamma + h$ and $Z + h$ production in both $pp$ and $pA$ collisions. Our study incorporates nuclear modifications into the transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) factorization framework, with resummation up to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, for TEEC as a function of the variable $\tau = \left(1 + \cos{\phi} \right)/2$, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle between the vector boson and the final hadron. We analyze the nuclear modification factor $R_{pA}$ in $p\mathrm{Au}$ collisions at RHIC and $p\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at the LHC. Our results demonstrate that the TEEC observable is a sensitive probe for nuclear modifications in TMD physics. Specifically, the changes in the $\tau$-distribution shape provide insights into transverse momentum broadening effects in large nuclei, while measurements at different rapidities allow us to explore nuclear modifications in the collinear component of the TMD parton distribution functions in nuclei.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spin Polarization of Heavy Quarks in Magnetic Fields and Hot Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions give rise to the formation of both deconfined QCD matter and a strong magnetic field. The spin of heavy quarks is influenced by interactions with the external magnetic field as well as by random scatterings with thermal light partons. The presence of QCD matter comprising charged quarks can extend the lifetime and strength of the magnetic field, thereby enhancing the degree of heavy quark polarization. However, the random scatterings with QCD matter tend to diminish heavy quark polarization. In this study, we utilize the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation to investigate both these contributions. Taking into account the realistic evolutions of medium temperatures and the in-medium magnetic fields at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), we observe that heavy quark polarization is limited by the short lifetime of the magnetic field and the high temperatures of the medium. Furthermore, we explore the mass dependence of quark polarization, revealing that the polarization degree of strange quarks is much larger than that of charm quarks.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear-structure calculations for the description of low-energy neutral-current neutrino scattering off the stable $^{203,205}$Tl isotopes are performed in the context of the nuclear shell model using the model space jj56pn. Cross-section and event-rate calculations focusing on inelastic solar-neutrino scattering off $^{203,205}$Tl are performed. The individual contributions of the various nuclear responses are presented and discussed, and the results are also illustrated in terms of the nuclear recoil energy. Analytical expressions entering the cross sections are given in order to achieve a direct connection with experimental observables.</description>

      <title>Probing QGP droplets with charmonium in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hot medium effects in high-multiplicity proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=13$ TeV via the charmonium probes. The hot medium is described with the hydrodynamic model, while charmonium evolutions in the medium are studied with a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The hot medium dissociation on charmonium is considered with the temperature-dependent complex potential parametrized with the results from lattice QCD calculations. The ratio $\sigma_{\psi(2S)}/\sigma_{J/\psi}$ of $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ production cross sections are calculated and compared with the LHCb experimental data in pp collisions. Our calculations explain the charmonium relative suppression in different transverse momentum and multiplicity bins. The suppression of this ratio is mainly affected by the effects of the deconfined medium. It is less affected by the initial effects before the generation of the heavy quark pair. We suggest this to be a clear signal of the small QGP droplets generated in high multiplicity pp collisions.</description>

Abstract: We have studied the charge and heat transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter using a novel approximation method within the quasiparticle model. Utilizing the novel collision integrals for both the relaxation time approximation (RTA) and the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) models, we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to estimate the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity of the medium. We have investigated the temperature dependence of these transport coefficients. We have also provided a comparison between our findings and those of the standard RTA and standard BGK models. Further, we have explored the temperature dependence of the thermal diffusion constant and the Lorenz number using the novel approaches of the aforesaid models.</description>

      <title>Quantum turbulence, superfluidity, non-Markovian dynamics, and wave function thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum turbulence has been addressed both experimentally (predominantly for superfluid $^4$He and $^3$He) and theoretically, the dynamics of various ensembles of quantized vortices was followed in time only until the vortices decay into phonons. How this ``thermalization'' is achieved is still an unaddressed and thus an unelucidated question. The Unitary Fermi Gas (UFG) is a unique quantum system, which has no classical counterpart and of relevance to neutron stars, cold atoms, condensed matter and nuclear many-body systems. The non-Markovian evolution of an isolated UFG is put in evidence and its entire non-equilibrium evolution can be studied theoretically within a unified theoretical framework. The initial lattice of quantum vortices and anti-vortices evolves through a couple of vortex tangles and excitation of Kelvin waves, where vortices cross and reconnect, until very slowly thermalization sets in.</description>

      <title>Coherent photo- and electroproduction of charmonia on nuclear targets revisited: Green function formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study for the first time the production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral and electron-ion collisions based on a rigorous Green function formalism. Such formalism allows to incorporate properly formation effects (color transparency), as well as the quantum coherence inherent in higher twist shadowing corrections related to the $|Q \bar{Q}\rangle$ Fock component of the photon. The leading twist gluon shadowing associated with multi-gluon photon fluctuations is also included within the same formalism. The later effect represents the dominant source of shadowing at mid rapidities in the LHC kinematic region, while the reduced effect of quark shadowing leads to a significant modification of differential cross sections $d\sigma/dy$ at forward and/or backwards rapidities. Model calculations for $d\sigma/dy$ are in a good agreement with available UPC data on coherent charmonium production at RHIC and the LHC. In addition, we also perform predictions for nuclear effects in the electroproduction of charmonia, which can be verified by new data from electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter and hadronic matter on $f$-mode oscillation of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the possible presence of dark matter (DM) in neutron stars (NSs) and the structural properties of the DM admixed NSs (DMANSs) in one of our recent works \cite{Guha:2024pnn}. The feeble interaction between the fermionic DM ($\chi$) with the hadronic matter is introduced through a dark scalar ($\phi$) and a dark vector ($\xi$) boson as mediators. The allowed range of the mass of the fermionic DM ($m_{\chi}$), for a particular range of DM Fermi momentum ($k_F^{\chi}$), was obtained in the same work \cite{Guha:2024pnn} with respect to the various astrophysical constraints on the structural properties of compact stars viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability. The present work is dedicated to the calculation and study of non-radial oscillation of the DMANSs using Cowling approximation. We particularly investigate the effect of presence of DM on the fundamental ($f$) mode oscillation frequencies of the DMANSs utilizing the previously obtained range of $m_{\chi}$ for four different hadronic models. In this work we thoroughly investigate how the individual and combined effects of $m_{\chi}$ and $k_F^{\chi}$ affect the $f$-mode oscillation frequency. Within the framework of our DMANS models, for a particular value of $k_F^{\chi}$, the range of $f_{max}^{DMANS}$ with respect to the allowed range of $m_{\chi}$, is also obtained in the present work for four different hadronic models. Since in the present era, the 1.4 and 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ NSs are of special interest after the detection of GW170817 and PSR J0740+6620, we particularly investigate, for the four hadronic models, the range of $f_{1.4}^{DMANS}$ and $f_{2.01}^{DMANS}$ with respect to the acceptable range of $m_{\chi}$ corresponding to the range of $k_F^{\chi}$.</description>
