      <title>Derivative-Free Optimization-Empowered Wireless Channel Reconfiguration for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable antennas, including reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), movable antenna (MA), fluid antenna (FA), and other advanced antenna techniques, have been studied extensively in the context of reshaping wireless propagation environments for 6G and beyond wireless communications. Nevertheless, how to reconfigure/optimize the real-time controllable coefficients to achieve a favorable end-to-end wireless channel remains a substantial challenge, as it usually requires accurate modeling of the complex interaction between the reconfigurable devices and the electromagnetic waves, as well as knowledge of implicit channel propagation parameters. In this paper, we introduce a derivative-free optimization (a.k.a., zeroth-order (ZO) optimization) technique to directly optimize reconfigurable coefficients to shape the wireless end-to-end channel, without the need of channel modeling and estimation of the implicit environmental propagation parameters. We present the fundamental principles of ZO optimization and discuss its potential advantages in wireless channel reconfiguration. Two case studies for RIS and movable antenna-enabled single-input single-output (SISO) systems are provided to show the superiority of ZO-based methods as compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we outline promising future research directions and offer concluding insights on derivative-free optimization for reconfigurable antenna technologies.</description>

      <title>Localized kernel method for separation of linear chirps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of separating a superposition of signals into its individual components is a common challenge encountered in various signal processing applications, especially in domains such as audio and radar signals. A previous paper by Chui and Mhaskar proposes a method called Signal Separation Operator (SSO) to find the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of such superpositions where both of these change continuously and slowly over time. In this paper, we amplify and modify this method in order to separate chirp signals in the presence of crossovers, a very low SNR, and discontinuities. We give a theoretical analysis of the behavior of SSO in the presence of noise to examine the relationship between the minimal separation, minimal amplitude, SNR, and sampling frequency. Our method is illustrated with a few examples, and numerical results are reported on a simulated dataset comprising 7 simulated signals.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Transceivers: Integrated Sensing and Communication with Pulsed Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) transceiver featuring a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) and a receiver equipped with a passive electronically scanned array (PESA) and a single digital channel. By utilizing a periodic pulsed signal emitted by a feeder, we introduce at the STAR-RIS a space modulation to illuminate two angular directions observed by the radar receiver, one in each half-space, and a time modulation to distinguish the corresponding echoes from prospective moving targets and embed communication messages. The proposed time modulation employs orthogonal binary codebooks with different trade-offs in transmission and error rates, while having minimal impact on the radar performance, evaluated by probability of detection and root mean square error in the radial velocity estimation.</description>

      <title>Joint Radiation Power, Antenna Position, and Beamforming Optimization for Pinching-Antenna Systems with Motion Power Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have been recently proposed to improve the performance of wireless networks by reconfiguring both the large-scale and small-scale channel conditions. However, existing studies ignore the physical constraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To fill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into account the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact of adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average power consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly optimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit beamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to consider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional degree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and discrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the fact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the channel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To tackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for continuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance enhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and adjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed optimization framework. The benefits of PASS over conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in mitigating the large-scale path loss and inter-user interference is also revealed.</description>

      <title>Track-before-detect in RIS-aided Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study considers a base station equipped with sensing and communication capabilities, which serves a ground user and scans a portion of the sky via a passive reconfigurable intelligent surface. To achieve more favorable system tradeoffs, we utilize a multi-frame radar detector, comprising a detector, a plot-extractor, and a track-before-detect processor. The main idea proposed here is that user spectral efficiency can be enhanced by increasing the number of scans jointly processed by the multi-frame radar detector while maintaining the same sensing performance. A numerical analysis is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution and to evaluate the achievable system tradeoffs.</description>

      <title>Predictive Control over LAWN: Joint Trajectory Design and Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have been envisioned as flexible and transformative platforms for enabling delay-sensitive control applications in Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In this work, we investigate the real-time wireless control over a LAWN system, where an aerial drone is employed to serve multiple mobile automated guided vehicles (AGVs) via finite blocklength (FBL) transmission. Toward this end, we adopt the model predictive control (MPC) to ensure accurate trajectory tracking, while we analyze the communication reliability using the outage probability. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly determine control policy, transmit power allocation, and drone trajectory by accounting for the maximum travel distance and control input constraints. To address the resultant non-convex optimization problem, we first derive the closed-form expression of the outage probability under FBL transmission. Based on this, we reformulate the original problem as a quadratic programming (QP) problem, followed by developing an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Specifically, we employ the projected gradient descent (PGD) method and the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to achieve computationally efficient sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, we thoroughly analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulations and AirSim-based experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to the baseline schemes in terms of control performance.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of range-migrating targets using OTFS signals from LEO satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that utilizes orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulated signals emitted by low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to estimate the parameters of space targets experiencing range migration, henceforth referred to as high-speed targets. Leveraging the specific signal processing performed by OTFS transceivers, we derive a novel input-output model for the echo generated by a high-speed target in scenarios where ideal and rectangular shaping filters are employed. Our findings reveal that the target response exhibits a sparse structure in the delay-Doppler domain, dependent solely upon the initial range and range-rate; notably, range migration causes a spread in the target response, marking a significant departure from previous studies. Utilizing this signal structure, we propose an approximate implementation of the maximum likelihood estimator for the target's initial range, range-rate, and amplitude. The estimation process involves obtaining coarse information on the target response using a block orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm, followed by a refinement step using a bank of matched filters focused on a smaller range and range-rate region. Finally, numerical examples are provided to evaluate the estimation performance.</description>

      <title>When Attention is Beneficial for Learning Wireless Resource Allocation Efficiently?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the use of attention mechanism to leverage the dependency across tokens, Transformers are efficient for natural language processing. By harnessing permutation properties broadly exist in resource allocation policies, each mapping measurable environmental parameters (e.g., channel matrix) to optimized variables (e.g., precoding matrix), graph neural networks (GNNs) are promising for learning these policies efficiently in terms of scalability and generalizability. To reap the benefits of both architectures, there is a recent trend of incorporating attention mechanism with GNNs for learning wireless policies. Nevertheless, is the attention mechanism really needed for resource allocation? In this paper, we strive to answer this question by analyzing the structures of functions defined on sets and numerical algorithms, given that the permutation properties of wireless policies are induced by the involved sets (say user set). In particular, we prove that the permutation equivariant functions on a single set can be recursively expressed by two types of functions: one involves attention, and the other does not. We proceed to re-express the numerical algorithms for optimizing several representative resource allocation problems in recursive forms. We find that when interference (say multi-user or inter-data stream interference) is not reflected in the measurable parameters of a policy, attention needs to be used to model the interference. With the insight, we establish a framework of designing GNNs by aligning with the structures. By taking reconfigurable intelligent surface-aided hybrid precoding as an example, the learning efficiency of the proposed GNN is validated via simulations.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Published Values of Frequency Sampling Filter Transition Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tables of optimal transition coefficients and peak sidelobe level (PSL, in dB) associated with frequency sampling filter (FSF) design were published by Rabiner et al. (Jun 1970), and reproduced, for example, in the book Digital Signal Processing by Proakis and Manolakis (4/e, 2007). A set of values are also given in Appendix H of Understanding Digital Signal Processing} by Lyons (3/e, 2011), but there are significant differences between these two sets. For example, for $N=16$ and BW$=4$, two different transition coefficient values have been reported, viz., $0.38916626$ (Rabiner, et al.) and $0.34918551$ (Lyons). Neither is optimal, for we find the optimum value to be $0.40474097$. The published values of the corresponding PSLs were also found to be incorrect. In this paper we give the optimal values of the transition coefficients and PSL values as estimated by our program for the lowpass and bandpass filters listed in Rabiner et al. and Lyons.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna-Assisted Index Modulation: Channel Modeling, Transceiver Design, and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel pinching-antenna assisted index modulation (PA-IM) scheme is proposed for improving the spectral efficiency without increasing the hardware complexity, where the information bits are conveyed not only by the conventional M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols but also by the indices of pinching antenna (PA) position patterns. To realize the full potential of this scheme, this paper focuses on the comprehensive transceiver design, addressing key challenges in signal detection at the receiver and performance optimization at thetransmitter. First, a comprehensive channel model is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the deterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of wireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading. Next, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is designed, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML performance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) is derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding method is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by jointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the waveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all received signal points. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PA-IM scheme attains a significant performance gain over its conventional counterparts and that the overall BER of the pinching-antenna system is substantially improved by the proposed precoding design.</description>

      <title>AREE-Based Decoupled Design of Hybrid Beamformers in mmWave XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid beamforming has been widely employed in mmWave communications such as vehicular-to-everything (V2X) scenarios, as a compromise between hardware complexity and spectral efficiency. However, the inherent coupling between analog and digital precoders in hybrid array architecture significantly limits the computational and spectral efficiency of existing algorithms. To address this issue, we propose an alternating residual error elimination (AREE) algorithm, which decomposes the hybrid beamforming problem into two low-dimensional subproblems, each exhibiting a favorable matrix structure that enables effective decoupling of analog and digital precoders from the matrix product formulation. These subproblems iteratively eliminate each other's residual errors, driving the original problem toward the optimal hybrid beamforming performance. The proposed initialization ensures rapid convergence, while a low-complexity geometric channel SVD algorithm is developed by transforming the high-dimensional sparse channel into a low-dimensional equivalent, thereby simplifying the derivation of subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate that the AREE algorithm effectively decouples analog and digital precoders with low complexity, achieves fast convergence, and offers higher spectral efficiency than existing beamforming methods.</description>

      <title>DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.</description>

      <title>AI-Empowered Channel Generation for IoV Semantic Communications in Dynamic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) transforms the transportation ecosystem promising pervasive connectivity and data-driven approaches. Deep learning and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly enhance the operation of applications within IoV by facilitating efficient decision-making and predictive capabilities, including intelligent navigation, vehicle safety monitoring, accident prevention, and intelligent traffic management. Nevertheless, efficiently transmitting and processing the massive volumes of data generated by the IoV in real-time remains a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable wireless channel conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a semantic communication framework based on channel perception to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data transmission. The semantic communication model extracts and compresses the information to be transmitted. In addition, the wireless channel is estimated by using a generative diffusion model, which is employed to predict the dynamic channel states, thereby improving the quality of IoV service. In dynamic scenarios, however, the channel estimation performance may be degraded when substantially new scenarios take place, which will adversely affect user experience. To mitigate this limitation, we employ a large model to fine-tune the channel generation model to enhance its adaptability for varying scenarios. The performance and reliability of the proposed framework are evaluated on the two public datasets.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm with the Median Absolute Deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the adaptive ISTA is a successful practical algorithm, few theoretical results exist. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis on the adaptive ISTA with the thresholding strategy of estimating noise level by median absolute deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Matrix Pencil-Based DoA Estimation for Hybrid Receivers in Snapshot-Limited Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02132</link>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to estimate the directions of arrival (DoAs) for hybrid analog/digital (HAD) receivers when the number of snapshots is too small for statistical averaging to be reliable. This goal is achieved in fully-digital receivers by employing the matrix pencil method (MPM). Unfortunately, the MPM cannot be directly applied in HAD receivers because of the entanglement induced by the underlying analog combiners on the output signals. Furthermore, these analog combiners project the received signal onto a low-dimensional space, jeopardizing the reception of signals arriving from particular DoA ranges. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose two approaches to enable the MPM to extract the DoAs in HAD receivers. The two approaches avoid severe attenuation induced by low-dimensional projection by cycling over an exhaustive set of analog combiners, collectively spanning the entire space. The first approach can be applied to both fully-connected (FC) and partially-connected (PC) HADs and relies on the availability of periodic, potentially unknown, signals to disentangle the output of the HAD receiver. The second approach applies to PC-HADs only, and eliminates contingency on periodic signals by exploiting the underlying block diagonal structure. The superiority of the proposed approaches is demonstrated via numerical simulations and comparisons with the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound.</description>

      <title>Experimental Multiport-Network Parameter Estimation and Optimization for Multi-Bit RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-consistent theoretical studies on RIS-parametrized wireless channels use models from multiport-network theory (MNT) to capture mutual-coupling (MC) effects. However, in practice, RIS design and radio environment are partially or completely unknown. We fill a research gap on how to estimate the MNT model parameters in such experimentally relevant scenarios. Our technique efficiently combines closed-form and gradient-descent steps, and it can be applied to multi-bit-programmable RIS elements. We discuss inevitable (but operationally irrelevant) parameter ambiguities. We experimentally validate our technique in an unknown rich-scattering environment parametrized by eight 8-bit-programmable RIS elements of unknown design. We experimentally evaluate the performance of RIS configurations optimized with the estimated MNT model and an MC-unaware cascaded model. While the models differ in accuracy by up to 17 dB, the end-to-end performance differences are small.</description>

      <title>A Late Collaborative Perception Framework for 3D Multi-Object and Multi-Source Association and Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy, they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder practical implementation.  To address this issue, we introduce a novel late collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position, and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models.  Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges, setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.</description>

      <title>MULTI-SCOUT: Multistatic Integrated Sensing and Communications in 5G and Beyond for Moving Target Detection, Positioning, and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are extracted for every target. For a single target, the resulting bistatic delays are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account for time synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.</description>

      <title>Restricted Quasiconvexity Isometry Property for Symmetric $\alpha$-Stable Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a generalization of the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) referred to as the Restricted Quasiconvexity Isometry Property (RQIP) for alpha stable random projections with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. A lower bound on the number of rows for RQIP to hold for random matrices whose entries are drawn from a symmetric $\alpha$-stable ($S\alpha S$) distribution is derived. The proof leverages two key components: a concentration inequality for empirical fractional moments of $S\alpha S$ variables and a covering number bound for sparse $\ell_\alpha$ balls. The resulting sample complexity reflects the polynomial tail behavior of the concentration and reinforces an observation made in the literature that the RIP framework may have to be replaced with other sparse recovery formulations in practice, such as those based on the null space property.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Large Language Model Optimizer for Black-Box Network Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future wireless networks are expected to incorporate diverse services that often lack general mathematical models. To address such black-box network management tasks, the large language model (LLM) optimizer framework, which leverages pretrained LLMs as optimization agents, has recently been promoted as a promising solution. This framework utilizes natural language prompts describing the given optimization problems along with past solutions generated by LLMs themselves. As a result, LLMs can obtain efficient solutions autonomously without knowing the mathematical models of the objective functions. Although the viability of the LLM optimizer (LLMO) framework has been studied in various black-box scenarios, it has so far been limited to numerical simulations. For the first time, this paper establishes a theoretical foundation for the LLMO framework. With careful investigations of LLM inference steps, we can interpret the LLMO procedure as a finite-state Markov chain, and prove the convergence of the framework. Our results are extended to a more advanced multiple LLM architecture, where the impact of multiple LLMs is rigorously verified in terms of the convergence rate. Comprehensive numerical simulations validate our theoretical results and provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the LLMO framework.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Cooperative ISAC Networks for Structural Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of future cellular systems, enabling applications such as intruder detection, monitoring, and tracking using the same infrastructure. However, its potential for structural health monitoring (SHM), which requires the detection of slow and subtle structural changes, remains largely unexplored due to challenges such as multipath interference and the need for ultra-high sensing precision. This study introduces a novel theoretical framework for SHM via ISAC by leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as reference points in collaboration with base stations and users. By dynamically adjusting RIS phases to generate distinct radio signals that suppress background multipath interference, measurement accuracy at these reference points is enhanced. We theoretically analyze RIS-aided collaborative sensing in three-dimensional cellular networks using Fisher information theory, demonstrating how increasing observation time, incorporating additional receivers (even with self-positioning errors), optimizing RIS phases, and refining collaborative node selection can reduce the position error bound to meet SHM's stringent accuracy requirements. Furthermore, we develop a Bayesian inference model to identify structural states and validate damage detection probabilities. Both theoretical and numerical analyses confirm ISAC's capability for millimeter-level deformation detection, highlighting its potential for high-precision SHM applications.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Chip-Scale Meta-Networks with LSPR Routing: A Theoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient chip-scale interconnects are essential for modern microelectronic-photonic systems, supporting high bandwidth and low-latency processing. Traditional wired links face high resistivity and latency, while millimeter-wave wireless solutions suffer from bandwidth congestion and interference. Terahertz (THz) plasmonic communication, based on surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), offers high data rates and broad bandwidth, and is compatible with nanophotonic platforms. This work introduces a Binary Field-Driven Meta-Routing Method supported by a semi-analytical framework that models the tunable interaction between THz plasmonic phenomena and graphene's electromagnetic properties. By modulating graphene's impedance, the method enables dynamic coupling and routing of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) across a meta-network, facilitating real-time beam steering in chip-scale systems. Combining analytical conductivity models, coupled-mode theory, and algorithmic control, the approach enables predictive configuration of LSPR-based steering in reconfigurable graphene metasurfaces. Four meta-pixel antenna configurations Y-MetaRouter, MetaSwitcher, Penta-MetaEmitter, and CP-MetaCore are designed to support unidirectional radiation, bi-directional steering, frequency-driven transitions, and circular polarization, respectively. Chemical potential modulation creates reconfigurable LSPR pathways and virtual SPP channels. A Coupled-Mode Theory for Field-Driven LSPR Meta-Networks is proposed to model current distributions and predict far-field characteristics. Results show strong agreement between theory and full-wave simulations. A point-to-point meta-wireless link is analyzed, demonstrating scalability for low-latency, high-performance THz communication in WiNoC and chiplet applications. System-level metrics confirm feasibility for space-constrained, high-speed interconnects.</description>

      <title>Learning From Crowdsourced Noisy Labels: A Signal Processing Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the primary catalysts fueling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is the availability of massive, curated datasets. A commonly used technique to curate such massive datasets is crowdsourcing, where data are dispatched to multiple annotators. The annotator-produced labels are then fused to serve downstream learning and inference tasks. This annotation process often creates noisy labels due to various reasons, such as the limited expertise, or unreliability of annotators, among others. Therefore, a core objective in crowdsourcing is to develop methods that effectively mitigate the negative impact of such label noise on learning tasks. This feature article introduces advances in learning from noisy crowdsourced labels. The focus is on key crowdsourcing models and their methodological treatments, from classical statistical models to recent deep learning-based approaches, emphasizing analytical insights and algorithmic developments. In particular, this article reviews the connections between signal processing (SP) theory and methods, such as identifiability of tensor and nonnegative matrix factorization, and novel, principled solutions of longstanding challenges in crowdsourcing -- showing how SP perspectives drive the advancements of this field. Furthermore, this article touches upon emerging topics that are critical for developing cutting-edge AI/ML systems, such as crowdsourcing in reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) that are key techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).</description>

      <title>Sensing-Assisted Channel Estimation for Bistatic OFDM ISAC Systems: Framework, Algorithm, and Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we delve into the topic of sensing-assisted communication within ISAC systems. More specifically, a novel sensing-assisted channel estimation scheme is proposed for bistatic orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC systems. A framework of sensing-assisted channel estimator is first developed, integrating a tailored low-complexity sensing algorithm to facilitate real-time channel estimation and decoding. To address the potential sensing errors caused by low-complexity sensing algorithms, a sensing-assisted linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation algorithm is then developed. This algorithm incorporates tolerance factors designed to account for deviations between estimated and true channel parameters, enabling the construction of robust correlation matrices for LMMSE estimation. Additionally, we establish a systematic mechanism for determining these tolerance factors. A comprehensive analysis of the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance and computational complexity is finally conducted, providing valuable insights into the selection of the estimator's parameters. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated by extensive simulations. Compared to existing methods, our proposed scheme demonstrates superior performance, particularly in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions or with large bandwidths, while maintaining low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pinching-antenna system (PASS) introduces new degrees of freedom (DoFs) for physical layer security (PLS) through pinching beamforming. In this paper, a couple of scenarios for secure beamforming for PASS are studied. 1) For the case with a single legitimate user (Bob) and a single eavesdropper (Eve), a closed-form expression for the optimal baseband beamformer is derived. On this basis, a gradient-based method is proposed to optimize the activated positions of pinching antennas (PAs). 2) For the case with multiple Bobs and multiple Eves, a fractional programming (FP)-based block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, termed FP-BCD, is proposed for optimizing the weighted secrecy sum-rate (WSSR). Specifically, a closed-form baseband beamformer is obtained via Lagrange multiplier method. Furthermore, owing to the non-convex objective function exhibiting numerous stationary points, a low-complexity one-dimensional search is used to find a high-quality solution of the PAs' activated locations. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that: i) All proposed algorithms achieve stable convergence within a few iterations, ii) across all considered power ranges, the FP-BCD algorithm outperforms baseline methods using zero-forcing (ZF) and maximal-ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming in terms of the WSSR, and iii) PASS achieves a significantly higher secrecy rate than traditional fixed-antenna systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the exponential growth of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry and a broad range of applications expected to appear in the coming years, the employment of traditional radar systems is becoming increasingly cumbersome for UAV supervision. Motivated by this emerging challenge, this paper investigates the feasibility of employing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems implemented over current and future wireless networks to perform this task. We propose a sensing mechanism based on the synchronization signal block (SSB) in the fifth-generation (5G) standard that performs sensing in a passive bistatic setting. By assuming planar arrays at the sensing nodes and according to the 5G standard, we consider that the SSB signal is sent in a grid of orthogonal beams that are multiplexed in time, with some of them pointing toward a surveillance region where low-altitude drones can be flying. The Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) is derived as the theoretical bound for range and velocity estimation. Our results demonstrate the potential of employing SSB signals for UAV-like target localization at low SNR.</description>

Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) represents an emerging economic paradigm that redefines commercial and social aerial activities. Large artificial intelligence models (LAIMs) offer transformative potential to further enhance the intelligence of LAE services. However, deploying LAIMs in LAE poses several challenges, including the significant gap between their computational/storage demands and the limited onboard resources of LAE entities, the mismatch between lab-trained LAIMs and dynamic physical environments, and the inefficiencies of traditional decoupled designs for sensing, communication, and computation. To address these issues, we first propose a hierarchical system architecture tailored for LAIM deployment and present representative LAE application scenarios. Next, we explore key enabling techniques that facilitate the mutual co-evolution of LAIMs and low-altitude systems, and introduce a task-oriented execution pipeline for scalable and adaptive service delivery. Then, the proposed framework is validated through real-world case studies. Finally, we outline open challenges to inspire future research.</description>

      <title>Effect of Signal Quantization on Performance Measures of a 1st Order One Dimensional Differential Microphone Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical systems, recorded analog signals must be digitized for processing, introducing quantization as a critical aspect of data acquisition. While prior studies have examined quantization effects in various signal processing contexts, its impact on differential microphone arrays (DMAs), particularly in one-dimensional (1D) first-order configurations, remains unexplored. This paper investigates the influence of signal quantization on the performance of first-order 1D-DMAs across various beampatterns. An analytical expression for quantized beamformed output for a first-order 1D-DMA has been formulated. The effect of signal quantization has been studied on array performance measures such as the Beampattern, Directivity Factor (DF), Front-to-Back Ratio (FBR), and suppression depth at null points (SDN). Simulation results reveal that the beampattern shape remains structurally invariant across quantization bit depths, with quantization primarily affecting SDN. DF and FBR remain constant with the varying number of quantization bits. Additionally, SDN is shown to be frequency-independent, however, it increases with increasing quantization bit depths, enhancing interference suppression. The study also examines the effect of steering nulls across the azimuthal range, showing that SDN degrades as the null moves closer to the source look direction (0 degree), indicating reduced interference suppression.</description>

Abstract: Recent developments in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) are laying the groundwork for innovative applications across the healthcare sector. Nanodevices designed to operate within the body, managed remotely via the internet, are envisioned to promptly detect and actuate on potential diseases. In this vision, an inherent challenge arises due to the limited capabilities of individual nanosensors; specifically, nanosensors must communicate with one another to collaborate as a cluster. Aiming to research the boundaries of the clustering capabilities, this survey emphasizes data-driven communication strategies in molecular communication (MC) channels as a means of linking nanosensors. Relying on the flexibility and robustness of machine learning (ML) methods to tackle the dynamic nature of MC channels, the MC research community frequently refers to neural network (NN) architectures. This interdisciplinary research field encompasses various aspects, including the use of NNs to facilitate communication in MC environments, their implementation at the nanoscale, explainable approaches for NNs, and dataset generation for training. Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of fundamental perspectives on recent trends in NN architectures for MC, the feasibility of their implementation at the nanoscale, applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, and the accessibility of datasets along with best practices for their generation. Additionally, we offer open-source code repositories that illustrate NN-based methods to support reproducible research for key MC scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging research challenges, such as robust NN architectures, biologically integrated NN modules, and scalable training strategies.</description>

      <title>KeyNode-Driven Geometry Coding for Real-World Scanned Human Dynamic Mesh Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The compression of real-world scanned 3D human dynamic meshes is an emerging research area, driven by applications such as telepresence, virtual reality, and 3D digital streaming. Unlike synthesized dynamic meshes with fixed topology, scanned dynamic meshes often not only have varying topology across frames but also scan defects such as holes and outliers, increasing the complexity of prediction and compression. Additionally, human meshes often combine rigid and non-rigid motions, making accurate prediction and encoding significantly more difficult compared to objects that exhibit purely rigid motion. To address these challenges, we propose a compression method designed for real-world scanned human dynamic meshes, leveraging embedded key nodes. The temporal motion of each vertex is formulated as a distance-weighted combination of transformations from neighboring key nodes, requiring the transmission of solely the key nodes' transformations. To enhance the quality of the KeyNode-driven prediction, we introduce an octree-based residual coding scheme and a Dual-direction prediction mode, which uses I-frames from both directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, with an average bitrate savings of 58.43% across the evaluated sequences, particularly excelling at low bitrates.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Meet Intelligent Reflecting Surface: Friends or Foes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) are considered promising technologies for the next-generation wireless communication systems due to their shared channel reconfiguration capabilities. This, however, raises a fundamental question: Does the performance gain of MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) still exist in the presence of the IRS? To answer this question, we investigate in this paper an IRS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) MA system, where a multi-MA base station (BS) transmits to multiple single-FPA users. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the active/passive beamforming of the BS/IRS and the MA positions within a one-dimensional transmit region, which is challenging to be optimally solved. To drive essential insights, we first study a simplified case with a single user. Then, we analyze the performance gain of MAs over FPAs in the light-of-sight (LoS) BS-IRS channel and derive the conditions under which this gain becomes more or less significant. In addition, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to solve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization problem in the single-user case by combining the block coordinate descent (BCD) method and the graph-based method. For the general multi-user case, our performance analysis unveils that the performance gain of MAs over FPAs diminishes with typical transmit precoding strategies at the BS under certain conditions. We also propose a high-quality suboptimal solution to the sum-rate maximization problem by applying the AO algorithm that combines the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, manifold optimization method and discrete sampling method. Numerical results validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate that the performance gain of MAs over FPAs may be reduced if the IRS passive beamforming is optimized.</description>

      <title>AI Flow: Perspectives, Scenarios, and Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12479</link>

Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers, and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and communication systems.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Quantized Federated Learning with Diverse Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across multiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its advancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from the unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC) and (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model quantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically addresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility under both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task. In this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a privacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different quantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we introduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously achieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the proposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To address quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization technique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms of privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.</description>

      <title>Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing with Customized Orthogonal Group Channels in Multi-RIS-Assisted Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer the unique capability to reshape the radio environment, thereby simplifying transmission schemes traditionally contingent on channel conditions. Joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) emerges as a low-overhead transmission scheme for multi-user equipment (UE) scenarios, typically requiring complex matrix decomposition to achieve block-diagonalization of the effective channel matrix. In this study, we introduce an innovative JSDM design that leverages RISs to customize channels, thereby streamlining the overall procedures. By strategically positioning RISs at the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) directions of the base station (BS), we establish orthogonal line-of-sight links within the BS-RIS channel, enabling a straightforward pre-beamforming design. Based on UE grouping, we devise reflected beams of the RIS with optimized directions to mitigate inter-group interference in the RISs-UEs channel. An approximation of the channel cross-correlation coefficient is derived and serves as a foundation for the RISs-UEs association, further diminishing inter-group interference. Numerical results substantiate the efficacy of our RIS-customized JSDM in not only achieving effective channel block-diagonalization but also in significantly enhancing the sum spectral efficiency for multi-UE transmissions.</description>
