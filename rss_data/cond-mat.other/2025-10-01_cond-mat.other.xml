      <title>Computable measures of non-Markovianity for Gaussian free fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate measures of non-Markovianity in open quantum systems governed by Gaussian free fermionic dynamics. Standard indicators of non-Markovian behavior, such as the BLP and LFS measures, are revisited in this context. We show that for Gaussian states, trace-based distances -- specifically the Hilbert-Schmidt norm -- and second-order R\'enyi mutual information can be efficiently expressed in terms of two-point correlation functions, enabling practical computation even in systems where the full density matrix is intractable. Crucially, this framework remains valid even when the density matrix of the system is an average over stochastic Gaussian trajectories, yielding a non-Gaussian state. We present efficient numerical protocols based on this structure and demonstrate their feasibility through a small-scale simulation. Our approach opens a scalable path to quantifying non-Markovianity in interacting or measured fermionic systems, with applications in quantum information and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing the Critical Point (CritPt) of AI Reasoning: a Frontier Physics Research Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26574v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular &amp; optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian comb effect in coupled clean and quasiperiodic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study localization properties in a system of non-Hermitian quasiperiodic chain coupled to a uniform chain or clean chain by inter-chain hopping. We find that in the limit of weak inter-chain coupling, such a coupled system exhibits transitions from delocalized to intermediate phase with increase in the non-Hermiticity parameter. However, for stronger inter-chain coupling strengths, the delocalized phase undergoes a transition to localized phase and then to an intermediate phase. Interestingly, the intermediate phase in this case exhibits the non-Hermitian comb effect (NHCE), i.e., the coexistence of localized and extended states rather than being well separated from each other by any mobility edge which is conventional in any intermediate phase. We further show that such a NHCE originates from the isolated site limit of the quasiperiodic chain and provide an analytical explanation supporting the numerical signatures.</description>

      <title>Non-coherent evolution of closed weakly interacting system leads to equidistribution of probabilities of microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14971v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a concept of non-coherent evolution of macroscopic quantum systems. We show that for weakly interacting systems such evolution is a Markovian stochastic process. The transition rates between system states, which characterize the process, are determined by Fermi's golden rule. Such evolution is time-irreversible and leads to the equidistribution of probabilities across every state of the system. Furthermore, we investigate the time dependence of the mean numbers of particles in single-particle states and find that, under the given assumptions, it is governed by the Boltzmann collision integral. The proposed mechanism that transforms time-reversible unitary evolution into time-irreversible stochastic evolution is non-coherence. In the presented theory, the non-coherence is not associated with interaction with a heat bath, but rather with the finite spectral width of quantum states. This understanding of non-coherence is analogous to the one used in wave optics. Thus, we present a novel approach to the famous arrow of time problem.</description>

      <title>Energy density and stress fields in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been an enduring interest and controversy about whether or not one can define physically meaningful energy density and stress fields, $e(\bf{r})$ and $\sigma_{\alpha \beta}(\bf{r})$, since the two forms of the kinetic energy, $\frac{1}{2}|\nabla \Psi|^2$ and $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$, lead to different densities, and analogous issues arise for interactions. This paper considers the ground state of a system of many interacting particles in an external potential, and presents a resolution in steps. 1) For the kinetic energy all effects of exchange and correlation are shown to be unique functions of position $\bf{r}$; all issues of non-uniqueness involve only the density $n(\bf{r})$ and are equivalent to an effective single-particle problem with wavefunction $s(\bf{r}) = \sqrt{n(\bf{r})/N}$. 2) Interactions can be considered as potentials acting on particles or interaction fields, e.g., the Maxwell form in terms of electric fields. In each case, there is a mean field part that is a function of the density and a part due to correlation that is uniquely defined. 3) The final results follow from the nature of energy and stress. Because the energy determines the ground state itself through the variational principle, the kinetic energy must involve $-\frac{1}{2}s\nabla^2 s$ and interactions in terms of potentials. This leads to density functional theory interpreted as energy density $e(\bf{r})$ equilibrated to minimize fluctuations with the same chemical potential at all points $\bf{r}$. However, stress is related to forces, and the only acceptable expressions for the stress field involve the combination $\frac{1}{2}[s\nabla^2 s - |\nabla s|^2]$, and Coulomb interactions in terms of electric fields. Together these results lead to well-defined formulations of energy density and stress fields that are physically motivated and based on a clear set of arguments.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points and beyond of far-from-equilibrium dilute system: ultra-cold Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics driven by the scattering from next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections in the quantum field theory has stationary solutions for the particle distribution characterized as the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points. The dynamics of the spatially homogeneous, isotropic dilute ultra-cold Fermi gas is investigated, and its kinetic equation confirms the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points in the perturbation theory by the quasi-particle assumption, in contrast to the wave turbulence of the weakly coupled ultra-cold Bose gas. In addition, other stationary states are found without the quasi-particle assumption and in a strongly coupled system. These analytical solutions provide chances for future experiments and numerical simulations in search of far-from-equilibrium stationary states of the dilute system.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence Paradox on Low-Symmetry Surfaces of Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-symmetry surfaces of topological semimetals provide access to boundary phenomena hidden on conventional facets, yet systematic studies remain scarce due to experimental challenges and the lack of a general framework for reconciling bulk and surface periodicities. Inspired by experimental observations on the (103) surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi, which reveal an apparent mismatch between the surface Brillouin zone and bulk-projected Weyl points, we establish a least common multiple criterion for surface commensuration. We show that successive bulk Brillouin zones generate laterally shifted replicas that only close after three unit cells, giving rise to a momentum-space moire modulation and thereby resolving the apparent breakdown of bulk-boundary correspondence. Density functional theory slab calculations based on this three-cell supercell, together with Green's function methods that naturally incorporate multiple bulk zones, quantitatively reproduce the experiment. Beyond NdAlSi, the least common multiple framework provides a universal prescription for reconciling bulk and surface states on arbitrary facets, suggesting that overlapping Fermi arcs may hybridize into closed loops and enabling unconventional transport and interference phenomena unique to low-symmetry surfaces, accompanied by emergent moire patterns in momentum space.</description>

      <title>On the magnetic contribution of itinerant electrons to neutron diffraction in the topological antiferromagnet CeAlGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a neutron diffraction study of the magnetic structure of CeAlGe, a candidate topological semimetal that hosts a non-collinear, multi-$\mathbf{k}$ magnetic phase. By measuring both low- and high-momentum-transfer magnetic Bragg peaks within a single experimental setup, we refine a magnetic structure model based solely on localized Ce moments. This model, which differs from that obtained using only high-$Q$ data, quantitatively reproduces the observed intensities, including the $(000)$ zeroth-order magnetic satellites that are especially sensitive to subtle components of the modulation. While a contribution from itinerant electrons to the zeroth satellite cannot be definitively excluded, our analysis reveals no unambiguous evidence for such effects within experimental uncertainty. The refined magnetic structures exhibit topologically nontrivial winding patterns, derived from the fitted magnetic parameters, that support localized, particle-like spin textures with half-integer topological charges. These features provide a natural microscopic origin for the observed topological Hall effect, establishing CeAlGe as a model system where magnetism and topology are intimately linked.</description>
