      <title>Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.</description>

      <title>Classical Criticality via Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing provides a powerful platform for simulating magnetic materials and realizing statistical physics models, presenting a compelling alternative to classical Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate that quantum annealers can accurately reproduce phase diagrams and simulate critical phenomena without suffering from the critical slowing down that often affects classical algorithms. To illustrate this, we study the piled-up dominoes model, which interpolates between the ferromagnetic 2D Ising model and Villain's fully frustrated ``odd model''. We map out its phase diagram and for the first time, employ finite-size scaling and Binder cumulants on a quantum annealer to study critical exponents for thermal phase transitions. Our method achieves systematic temperature control by tuning the energy scale of the Hamiltonian, eliminating the need to adjust the physical temperature of the quantum hardware. This work demonstrates how, through fine-tuning and calibration, a quantum annealer can be employed to apply sophisticated finite-size scaling techniques from statistical mechanics. Our results establish quantum annealers as robust statistical physics simulators, offering a novel pathway for studying phase transitions and critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Relating thermodynamic quantities of convex-hard-body fluids to the body's shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fluid of convex hard particles, characterized by a length scale $\sigma_\text{min}$ and an anisotropy parameter $\epsilon$, we develop a formalism allowing one to relate thermodynamic quantities to the body's shape. In a first step its thermodynamics is reduced to that of spherical particles. The latter have a hard core of diameter $\sigma_\text{min }$ and a soft shell with a thickness $\epsilon \sigma_\text{min}/2$. Besides their hard core repulsion at $\sigma_\text{min }$ they interact by effective entropic forces which will be calculated. Based on this mapping, a second step provides a perturbative method for the systematic calculation of thermodynamic quantities with the shape anisotropy $\epsilon$ as smallness parameter.
  In leading order in $\epsilon $, the equation of state is derived as a functional of the particle's shape. To illustrate these findings, they are applied to a one- and two-dimensional fluid of ellipses and compared with results from different analytical approaches, and our computer simulations. The mapping to spherical particles also implies that any phase transition of spherical particles, e.g., the liquid-hexatic transition, also exists for the nonspherical ones, and shifts linearly with $\epsilon $ for weak shape anisotropy. This is supported by our Monte-Carlo simulation.</description>

      <title>Influence of microscopic parameters on phase behavior of a cell model with Curie-Weiss interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the effect of changing two microscopic parameters in a cell model with Curie-Weiss-type interaction on its phase behavior, namely the cell volume and ratio between repulsion and attraction intensities. The results are based on an exact solution previously derived for this model in the grand canonical ensemble. At sufficiently low temperatures, the cell model exhibits multiple first-order phase transitions. Varying the cell volume and the repulsion-to-attraction ratio, we represent a quantitative comparison of the chemical potential and pressure isotherms, as well as the pressure-temperature and temperature-density phase diagrams. The analysis of provided data shows that altering microscopic parameters does not lead to qualitative changes in the overall phase behavior of the cell model.</description>

      <title>Functional bottlenecks can emerge from non-epistatic underlying traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein fitness landscapes frequently exhibit epistasis, where the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic context in which it occurs, \textit{i.e.}, the rest of the protein sequence. Epistasis increases landscape complexity, often resulting in multiple fitness peaks. In its simplest form, known as global epistasis, fitness is modeled as a non-linear function of an underlying additive trait. In contrast, more complex epistasis arises from a network of (pairwise or many-body) interactions between residues, which cannot be removed by a single non-linear transformation. Recent studies have explored how global and network epistasis contribute to the emergence of functional bottlenecks - fitness landscape topologies where two broad high-fitness basins, representing distinct phenotypes, are separated by a bottleneck that can only be crossed via one or a few mutational paths. Here, we introduce and analyze a simple model of global epistasis with an additive underlying trait. We demonstrate that functional bottlenecks arise with high probability if the model is properly calibrated. Our results underscore the necessity of sufficient heterogeneity in the mutational effects selected by evolution for the emergence of functional bottlenecks. Moreover, we show that the model agrees with experimental findings, at least in small enough combinatorial mutational spaces.</description>

      <title>Pontus-Mpemba effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mpemba effects occur after a sudden quench of control parameters if for ''far'' (or ''hot'') initial states with respect to a final target state, the relaxation time toward the target state is shorter than for ''close'' (or ''cold'') initial states. Following a strategy of fishermen in Pontus described by Aristotle, we introduce the Pontus-Mpemba effect as a two-step protocol which includes the time needed for preparing the system in the ''far'' initial state. For Markovian (classical or quantum) systems coupled to multiple reservoirs, all possible Pontus-Mpemba effects fall into three classes. The theory is applied to open two-state systems where all three classes can be realized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introducing a class of SU(2) invariant quantum unitary circuits generating chiral transport, we examine the role of broken space-reflection and time-reversal symmetries on spin transport properties. Upon adjusting parameters of local unitary gates, the dynamics can be either chaotic or integrable. The latter corresponds to a generalization of the space-time discretized (Trotterized) higher-spin quantum Heisenberg chain. We demonstrate that breaking of space-reflection symmetry results in a drift in the dynamical spin susceptibility. Remarkably, we find a universal drift velocity given by a simple formula which, at zero average magnetization, depends only on the values of SU(2) Casimir invariants associated with local spins. In the integrable case, the drift velocity formula is confirmed analytically based on the exact solution of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, by inspecting the large fluctuations of the time-integrated current between two halves of the system in stationary maximum-entropy states, we demonstrate violation of the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry, implying that such states cannot be regarded as equilibrium ones. We show that the scaled cumulant generating function of the time-integrated current instead obeys a generalized fluctuation relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02524v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of overdamped Brownian particles interacting through soft pairwise potentials on a comb-like structure. Within the linearized Dean-Kawasaki framework, we characterize the particle density fluctuations by computing their one- and two-point correlation functions. For a tracer particle constrained to move along the comb backbone, we determine the spatial correlation profile between its position and the density of surrounding bath particles. Furthermore, we derive the correction to the diffusion coefficient of the tracer due to interactions with other particles, validating our results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>On the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking in liquid hydrogen peroxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular chirality is a key concept in chemistry with implications for the origin of life and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Previous simulations of a chiral molecular model with an energetic bias towards homochiral interactions show a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from a supercritical racemic liquid into a subcritical liquid enriched in one of the two enantiomers. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations in order to test the possible existence of this phenomenon in hydrogen peroxide, the smallest chiral molecule. For this purpose, we study the fluid phase of this substance between 100 K and 1500 K, and from $10^{-4}$ GPa to 1 GPa. We find a glass transition and we suggest that hydrogen bonds play a central role in such behavior. We also test the possibility of observing chiral symmetry breaking by performing both constant temperature and cooling simulations at multiple pressures, and we do not observe the phenomenon. An analysis of the structure of the liquid shows negligible differences between homochiral and heterochiral interactions, supporting the difficulty in observing chiral symmetry breaking. If hydrogen peroxide manifests spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it likely takes place significantly below room temperature and is hidden by other phenomena, such as the glass transition or crystallization. More broadly, our results, and recent experimental observations, suggest that greater molecular complexity is needed for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the liquid phase to occur.</description>

      <title>Further results on the power-law decay of the fraction of the mixed eigenstates in kicked-top model with mixed-type classical phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the Krylov subspace technique to generate the spin coherent states in kicked top model, a prototype model for studying quantum chaos, the accessible system size for studying the Husimi functions of eigenstates can be much larger than that reported in the literature and our previous study Phys. Rev. E 108, 054217 (2023) [arXiv:2308.04824]. In the fully chaotic kicked top, we find that the mean Wehrl entropy localization measure approaches the prediction given by the Circular Unitary Ensemble. In the mixed-type case, we identify mixed eigenstates by the overlap of the Husimi function with regular and chaotic regions in classical compact phase space. Numerically, we show that the fraction of mixed eigenstates scales as $j^{-\zeta}$, a power-law decay as the system size $j$ increases, across nearly two orders of magnitude. This provides supporting evidence for the principle of uniform semiclassical condensation of Husimi functions and the Berry-Robnik picture in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced entanglement and complexity in random constant-depth 2D quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the entanglement structure of states generated by random constant-depth two-dimensional quantum circuits, followed by projective measurements of a subset of sites. By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such post-measurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behaviour had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize non-rigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multi-user quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits, and of contracting tensor networks: First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</description>

      <title>Lattice random walks and quantum A-period conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$, which enumerates classical closed random walks on square and triangular lattices with $N$ steps and a signed area $A$, characterized by the number of moves in each hopping direction. This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</description>

      <title>Spacing ratios in mixed-type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12874</link>

Abstract: The distribution of the consecutive level-spacing ratio is now widely used as a tool to distinguish integrable from chaotic quantum spectra, mostly due to its avoiding of the numerical spectral unfolding. Similar to the use of the Rosenzweig-Porter approach to obtain the Berry-Robnik distribution of level-spacings in mixed-type systems, in this work we extend this approach to derive analytically the distribution of spacing ratios, for random matrices comprised of independent integrable blocks and chaotic blocks. We have numerically confirmed this analytical result using random matrix theory in paradigmatic models such as the quantum kicked rotor and the H\'enon-Heiles system.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a voter model with an evolving number of opinion states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In traditional voter models, opinion dynamics are driven by interactions between individuals, where an individual adopts the opinion of a randomly chosen neighbor. However, these models often fail to capture the emergence of entirely new opinions, which can arise spontaneously in real-world scenarios. Our study introduces a novel element to the classic voter model: the concept of innovation, where individuals have a certain probability of generating new opinions independently of their neighbors' states. This innovation process allows for a more realistic representation of social dynamics, where new opinions can emerge and old ones may fade over time. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we find that the balance between innovation and extinction shapes the number of opinions in the steady state. Specifically, for low innovation rates, the system tends toward near-consensus, while higher innovation rates lead to greater opinion diversity. We also show that network structure influences opinion dynamics, with greater degree heterogeneity reducing the number of opinions in the system.</description>

      <title>Delayed Active Swimmer in a Velocity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled active particles exhibit delayed responses to environmental changes, modulating their propulsion speed through intrinsic sensing and feedback mechanisms. This adaptive behavior fundamentally determines their dynamics and self-organization in active matter systems, with implications for biological microswimmers and engineered microrobots. Here, we investigate active Brownian particles whose propulsion speed is governed by spatially varying activity landscapes, incorporating a temporal delay between environmental sensing and speed adaptation. Through analytical solutions derived for both short-time and long-time delay regimes, we demonstrate that steady-state density and polarization profiles exhibit maxima at characteristic delays. Significantly, we observe that the polarization profile undergoes sign reversal when the swimming distance during the delay time exceeds the characteristic diffusion length, providing a novel mechanism for controlling particle transport without external fields. Our theoretical predictions, validated through experimental observations and numerical simulations, establish time delay as a crucial control parameter for particle transport and organization in active matter systems. These findings provide insights into how biological microorganisms might use response delays to gain navigation advantages and suggest design principles for synthetic microswimmers with programmable responses to heterogeneous environments.</description>
