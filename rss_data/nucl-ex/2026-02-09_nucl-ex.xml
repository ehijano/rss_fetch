      <title>Quasi-elastic scattering for the nuclear ground state structure: An intriguing case of $^{30}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-elastic (QEL) scattering measurements have been performed using the $^{28, 30}$Si projectiles off the $^{90}$Zr target at energies around the Coulomb barrier. Coupled-channels (CC) calculations were carried out in a large parameter space of quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations for the N=Z, $^{28}$Si and N=Z+2, $^{30}$Si nuclei. $^{28}$Si at the N=Z line is observed to be uniquely oblate shaped in its ground state. In contrast, for $^{30}$Si with just two additional neutrons -- oblate, prolate, and spherical CC descriptions are equally compatible with the measurements. To further investigate the nuclear structure evolution with varying neutron number, shell-model calculations were performed. These calculations reveal a sudden change in the nuclear structure aspects at $^{30}$Si in going from $^{28}$Si to $^{30}$Si. Combined reaction and structure analyses consistently indicate that $^{30}$Si does not possess a well-defined intrinsic shape, and it is a potential candidate for ``shape fluctuations" in its ground state.</description>

      <title>Beam Test Performance of AstroPix sensor with 120 GeV protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AstroPix is a high-voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic active pixel sensor (MAPS) developed for precision gamma-ray imaging and spectroscopy in the medium energy regime, as well as for precise shower imaging and tracking in the Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) of the Electron Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) detector at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We present beam test results of the AstroPix v3 sensor using a 120 GeV proton beam at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF), performed as part of the broader experimental campaign for the BIC prototype calorimeter. The sensor's 500 um pixel pitch enabled precise measurement of the beam profile, providing important information for calorimeter performance studies. Using the measured 120 GeV proton data, we measure the energy deposit of minimum ionizing particles and use them to extract the corresponding effective depletion depth.</description>

      <title>CAGE: An Internal Source Scanning Cryostat for HPGe Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of current and future-generation neutrinoless double beta decay experiments relies on the ability to eliminate or reduce extraneous backgrounds. In addition to constructing experiments using radiopure materials and handling in underground laboratories, it is necessary to understand and reduce known backgrounds in data analysis. The Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless double beta Decay is searching for this decay using 76Ge-enriched high-purity germanium detectors submerged in an active liquid argon veto. A significant background in LEGEND is surface events from shallowly-impinging radiation on detector surfaces. In this paper we introduce the Collimated Alphas, Gammas, and Electrons (CAGE) scanning system, an internal-source scanning vacuum cryostat, designed to perform studies of surface events on sensitive surfaces of HPGe in a surface-lab. CAGE features a collimated radionuclide source inside a movable infrared shield that is able to perform precision scans of detector surfaces by utilizing three independent motor stages for source positioning. This allows detailed studies of pulse shapes as a function of source position and incident angle, where defining features can be extracted and exploited for removing surface backgrounds in data analysis in LEGEND. In this paper, we describe CAGE and demonstrate its performance with a commissioning run with 241Am. The commissioning run was completed with the source at normal incidence, and we estimate a beam spot precision of 3.1 mm, which includes positioning uncertainties and the beam-spot size. Using the 59.5 keV gamma population from 241Am, we show that low-energy photon events near the passivated surface feature risetimes that increase with radial distance from the detector center. We suggest a specific metric that can be used to discriminate low-energy gamma backgrounds in LEGEND with similar characteristics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Constraints on the Neutron Star Equation of State with a Smooth Hadron-Quark Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian inference of the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) within a unified framework that incorporates hadronic matter, quark matter, and a smooth hadron--quark crossover. The EOS is constrained using physical consistency filters, gravitational-wave data from GW170817, NICER mass--radius measurements, and hypothetical future high-precision radius data. We find that current observations strongly constrain the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, particularly its slope and curvature, while the highest-density hadronic parameters and quark-matter parameters remain only weakly constrained. The posterior distributions favor a crossover centered at an energy density $\overline{\varepsilon}\sim(4$--$6)\varepsilon_0$ with a width $\Gamma\sim(0.5$--$1.0)\varepsilon_0$, where $\varepsilon_0$ is the energy density of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation. The most probable radius of a canonical neutron star is $R_{1.4}\simeq 11.5-13.0$ km, and the maximum mass is $M_{\rm TOV}\simeq 2.2\,M_\odot$. Overall, present data primarily probe the low-to-intermediate density EOS and provide limited direct sensitivity to quark matter and genuinely high-density physics, highlighting the need for next-generation precision radius measurements.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic geometry in hadron resonance gas model at real and imaginary baryon chemical potential and a simple sufficient condition for quark deconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic geometry of the hadron resonance gas model with (without) excluded volume effects (EVE) of baryons is investigated. The case with imaginary mu, where mu is the baryon chemical potential, is investigated as well as the one with real mu. We calculate the scalar curvature R and use the R=0 criterion to investigate the phase structure in the mu^2-T plane where T is the temperature. The curve on which R=0 continues analytically from the imaginary mu region, where the lattice QCD is feasible, to the real mu one. In the presence of EVE, there are rich phase structures in the large real mu region as well as the Roberge-Weiss like region where mu is imaginary and a singularity appears, while there is no phase structure in the large real $\mu$ region in the absence of EVE. The limitation temperature of the baryon gas is also obtained by using the baryon number fluctuation. The LQCD predicted critical point locates almost on the curve of the limitation temperature we determined. A simple sufficient condition, n_B&gt;1/(2v_B)$, is obtained for the quark deconfinement in the large real mu region, where n_B and v_B are the net baryon number density and the volume of a baryon, respectively.</description>
