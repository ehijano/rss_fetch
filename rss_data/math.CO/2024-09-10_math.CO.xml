      <title>Critical groups in harmonic abelian quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A harmonic cover of graphs $p:\widetilde{X}\to X$ induces a surjective pushforward morphism $p_*:\operatorname{Jac}(\widetilde{X})\to \operatorname{Jac}(X)$ on the critical groups. In the case when $p$ is Galois with abelian Galois group, we compute the order of the kernel of $p_*$, and hence the relationship between the numbers of spanning trees of $\widetilde{X}$ and $X$, in terms of Zaslavsky's bias matroid associated to the cover $p:\widetilde{X}\to X$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of dicirculant digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T_{4p}=\langle a,b\mid a^{2p}=1,a^p=b^2, b^{-1}ab=a^{-1}\rangle$ be the dicyclic group of order $4p$. A Cayley digraph over $T_{4p}$ is called a dicirculant digraph. In this paper, we calculate the number of (connected) dicirculant digraphs of order $4p$ ($p$ prime) up to isomorphism by using the P\'olya Enumeration Theorem. Moreover, we get the number of (connected) dicirculant digraphs of order $4p$ ($p$ prime) and out-degree $k$ for every $k$.</description>

      <title>The Zero Forcing Numbers of Peony Graphs and Web Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of zero forcing involves a dynamic coloring process by which blue vertices cause white vertices to become blue, with the goal of forcing the entire graph blue while choosing as few as possible vertices to be initially blue. Past research in this area has focused on structural arguments, with approaches varying from graph substructures to the interplay between local and global graph structures. This paper explores the use of these structural concepts when determining the zero forcing number of complex classes of graphs, specifically two infinite classes of graphs each defined on multiple parameters.</description>

      <title>Adjacency Labeling Schemes for Small Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph class admits an implicit representation if, for every positive integer $n$, its $n$-vertex graphs have a $O(\log n)$-bit (adjacency) labeling scheme, i.e., their vertices can be labeled by binary strings of length $O(\log n)$ such that the presence of an edge between any pair of vertices can be deduced solely from their labels. The famous Implicit Graph Conjecture posited that every hereditary (i.e., closed under taking induced subgraphs) factorial (i.e., containing $2^{O(n \log n)}$ $n$-vertex graphs) class admits an implicit representation. The conjecture was recently refuted [Hatami and Hatami, FOCS '22], and does not even hold among monotone (i.e., closed under taking subgraphs) factorial classes [Bonnet et al., ICALP '24]. However, monotone small (i.e., containing at most $n! c^n$ many $n$-vertex graphs for some constant $c$) classes do admit implicit representations.
  This motivates the Small Implicit Graph Conjecture: Every hereditary small class admits an $O(\log n)$-bit labeling scheme. We provide evidence supporting the Small Implicit Graph Conjecture. First, we show that every small weakly sparse (i.e., excluding some fixed bipartite complete graph as a subgraph) class has an implicit representation. This is a consequence of the following fact of independent interest proved in the paper: Every weakly sparse small class has bounded expansion (hence, in particular, bounded degeneracy). Second, we show that every hereditary small class admits an $O(\log^3 n)$-bit labeling scheme, which provides a substantial improvement of the best-known polynomial upper bound of $n^{1-\varepsilon}$ on the size of adjacency labeling schemes for such classes. This is a consequence of another fact of independent interest proved in the paper: Every small class has neighborhood complexity $O(n \log n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Babai numbers and Babai $k$-spectra of paths and cycles. We completely determine the Babai numbers of paths $P_n$ for $n&gt;1$ and $1 \leq k \leq n-1$, and the Babai $k$-spectra for $P_n$ when $1 \leq k \leq n/2$. We also completely determine Babai numbers and Babai $k$-spectra of all cycles $C_n$ for $k \in \{1,2\}$ and $n \geq 3$ if $k=1$ and $n &gt; 3$ if $k=2$.</description>

      <title>Bessenrodt--Ono inequalities for $\ell$-tuples of pairwise commuting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group. We consider \begin{equation*} N_{\ell}(n) := \frac{\left\vert Hom\left( \mathbb{Z}^{\ell},S_n\right) \right\vert}{n!} \end{equation*} which also counts the number of $\ell$-tuples $\pi=\left( \pi_1, \ldots, \pi_{\ell}\right) \in S_n^{\ell}$ with $\pi_i \pi_j = \pi_j \pi_i$ for $1 \leq i,j \leq \ell$ scaled by $n!$. A recursion formula, generating function, and Euler product have been discovered by Dey, Wohlfahrt, Bryman and Fulman, and White. Let $a,b, \ell \geq 2$. It is known by Bringman, Franke, and Heim, that the Bessenrodt--Ono inequality \begin{equation*} \Delta_{a,b}^{\ell}:= N_{\ell}(a) \, N_{\ell}(b) - N_{\ell}(a+b) &gt;0 \end{equation*} is valid for $a,b \gg 1$ and by Bessenrodt and Ono that it is valid for $\ell =2$ and $a+b &gt;9$. In this paper we prove that for each pair $(a,b)$ the sign of $\{\Delta_{a,b}^{\ell} \}_{\ell}$ is getting stable. In each case we provide an explicit bound. The numbers $N_{\ell}\left( n\right) $ had been identified by Bryan and Fulman as the $n$-th orbifold characteristics, generalizing work by Macdonald and Hirzebruch--H\"{o}fer concerning the ordinary and string-theoretic Euler characteristics of symmetric products, where $N_2(n)=p(n) $ represents the partition function.</description>

      <title>A Toric Analogue for Greene's Rational Function of a Poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite poset, Greene introduced a rational function obtained by summing certain rational functions over the linear extensions of the poset. This function has interesting interpretations, and for certain families of posets, it simplifies surprisingly. In particular, Greene evaluated this rational function for strongly planar posets in his work on the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula.
  In 2012, Develin, Macauley, and Reiner introduced toric posets, which combinatorially are equivalence classes of posets (or rather acyclic quivers) under the operation of flipping maximum elements into minimum elements and vice versa. In this work, we introduce a toric analogue of Greene's rational function for toric posets, and study its properties. In addition, we use toric posets to show that the Kleiss-Kuijf relations, which appear in scattering amplitudes, are equivalent to a specific instance of Greene's evaluation of his rational function for strongly planar posets. Also in this work, we give an algorithm for finding the set of toric total extensions of a toric poset.</description>

      <title>Skein relations for punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate skein relations in cluster algebras from punctured surfaces, extending the work of \c{C}anak\c{c}i-Schiffler and Musiker-Williams on unpunctured surfaces. Using a combinatorial expansion formula by O\u{g}uz-Yildirim and Pilaud-Reading-Schroll, we provide explicit formulas for these relations. Our approach allows us to detail the $y$-monomials involved and identify that one term has a coefficient of 1. This work shows that the punctured analogues of the bangles and bracelets bases form a spanning set for the cluster algebra from a punctured surface.</description>

      <title>Correlation between residual entropy and spanning tree entropy of ice-type models on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The logarithm of the number of Eulerian orientations, scaled by the number of vertices, is known as the residual entropy in studies of ice-type models on graphs. The spanning tree entropy depends similarly on the number of spanning trees. We demonstrate and investigate a remarkably strong, though non-deterministic, correlation between these two entropies. This leads us to propose a new heuristic estimate for the residual entropy of regular graphs that performs much better than previous heuristics. We also study the expansion properties and residual entropy of random graphs with given degrees.</description>

      <title>Distant digraph domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A {\em $k$-kernel} in a digraph $G$ is a stable set $X$ of vertices such that every vertex of $G$ can be joined from $X$ by a directed path of length at most $k$. We prove three results about $k$-kernels. First, it was conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Sz\'ekely in 1976 that every digraph $G$ with no source has a 2-kernel $|K|$ with $|K|\le |G|/2$. We prove this conjecture when $G$ is a ``split digraph'' (that is, its vertex set can be partitioned into a tournament and a stable set), improving a result of Langlois et al., who proved that every split digraph $G$ with no source has a 2-kernel of size at most $2|G|/3$. Second, the Erd\H{o}s-Sz\'ekely conjecture implies that in every digraph $G$ there is a 2-kernel $K$ such that the union of $K$ and its out-neighbours has size at least $|G|/2$. We prove that this is true if $V(G)$ can be partitioned into a tournament and an acyclic set. Third, in a recent paper, Spiro asked whether, for all $k\ge 3$, every strongly-connected digraph $G$ has a $k$-kernel of size at most about $|G|/(k+1)$. This remains open, but we prove that there is one of size at most about $|G|/(k-1)$.</description>

      <title>On the strong metric dimension of the zero-divisor graph of a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the generalized blow-up of a Boolean lattice $L\cong \textbf{2}^n$ using finite chains is introduced. Also, we compute the strong metric dimension of the zero-divisor graph of the blow-up of a Boolean lattice. These results are applied to calculate the strong metric dimension of the comaximal graph, the comaximal ideal graph, the zero-divisor graph of a reduced ring, and the component graph of a vector space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defant found that the relationship between a sequence of (univariate) classical cumulants and the corresponding sequence of (univariate) free cumulants can be described combinatorially in terms of families of binary plane trees called troupes. Using a generalization of troupes that we call weighted troupes, we generalize this result to allow for multivariate cumulants. Our result also gives a combinatorial description of the corresponding Boolean cumulants. This allows us to answer a question of Defant regarding his troupe transform. We also provide explicit distributions whose cumulants correspond to some specific weighted troupes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note proves that only a linear number of holes in a \v{C}ech complex of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can persist over an interval of constant length. The proof uses a packing argument supported by relating the \v{C}ech complexes with corresponding snap complexes over the cells in a partition of space. The bound also applies to Alpha complexes and Vietoris-Rips complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $\mathcal{A} \subset {[n] \choose n/2}$ with measure bounded away from zero and from one, then the $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-iterated upper shadows of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{A}^c$ intersect in a set of positive measure. This confirms (in a strong form) a conjecture of Friedgut. It can be seen as a stability result for the Kruskal--Katona theorem.</description>

      <title>Brunn-Minkowski type estimates for certain discrete sumsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d,k$ be natural numbers and let $\mathcal{L}_1, \dots, \mathcal{L}_k \in \mathrm{GL}_d(\mathbb{Q})$ be linear transformations such that there are no non-trivial subspaces $U, V \subseteq \mathbb{Q}^d$ of the same dimension satisfying $\mathcal{L}_i(U) \subseteq V$ for every $1 \leq i \leq k$. For every non-empty, finite set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we prove that \[ |\mathcal{L}_1(A) + \dots + \mathcal{L}_k(A) | \geq k^d |A| - O_{d,k}(|A|^{1- \delta}), \] where $\delta &gt;0$ is some absolute constant depending on $d,k$. Building on work of Conlon-Lim, we can show stronger lower bounds when $k$ is even and $\mathcal{L}_1, \dots, \mathcal{L}_k$ satisfy some further incongruence conditions, consequently resolving various cases of a conjecture of Bukh. Moreover, given any $d, k\in \mathbb{N}$ and any finite, non-empty set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ not contained in a translate of some hyperplane, we prove sharp lower bounds for the cardinality of the $k$-fold sumset $kA$ in terms of $d,k$ and $|A|$. This can be seen as a $k$-fold generalisation of Freiman's lemma.</description>

Abstract: A set of vertices of a graph is said to be in general position if no three vertices from the set lie on a common geodesic. Recently Klav\v{z}ar, Rall and Yero generalized this notion by defining a set of vertices to be in general $d$-position if no three vertices from the set lie on a common geodesic of length at most $d$. We generalize this notion further by defining a set of vertices to be in $k$-general $d$-position if no $k$ vertices of the set lie on a common geodesic of length at most $d$. The $k$-general $d$-position number of a graph is the largest cardinality of a $k$-general $d$-position set. We provide upper and lower bounds on the $k$-general $d$-position number of graphs in terms of the $k$-general $d$-position number of certain kinds of subgraphs. We compute the $k$-general $d$-position number of finite paths and cycles. Along the way we establish that the maximally even subsets of cycles, which were introduced in Clough and Douthett's work on music theory, provide the largest possible $k$-general $d$-position sets in $n$-cycles. We generalize Klav\v{z}ar and Manuel's notion of monotone-geodesic labeling to that of $k$-monotone-geodesic labeling in order to calculate the $k$-general $d$-position number of the infinite two-dimensional grid. We also prove a formula for the $k$-general $d$-position number of certain thin finite grids, providing a partial answer to a question asked by Klav\v{z}ar, Rall and Yero.</description>

      <title>A step towards finding the analog of the Four-Color Theorem for $(n,m)$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An \textit{$(n,m)$-graph} $G$ is a graph having both arcs and edges, and its arcs (resp., edges) are labeled using one of the $n$ (resp., $m$) different symbols. An \textit{$(n,m)$-complete graph} $G$ is an $(n,m)$-graph without loops or multiple edges in its underlying graph such that identifying any pair of vertices results in a loop or parallel adjacencies with distinct labels. We show that a planar $(n,m)$-complete graph cannot have more than $3(2n+m)^2+(2n+m)+1$ vertices, for all $(n,m) \neq (0,1)$ and the bound is tight. This answers a naturally fundamental extremal question in the domain of homomorphisms of $(n,m)$-graphs and positively settles a recent conjecture by Bensmail \textit{et al.}~[Graphs and Combinatorics 2017]. Essentially, our result finds the clique number for planar $(n,m)$-graphs, which is a difficult problem except when $(n,m)=(0,1)$, answering a sub-question to finding the chromatic number for the family of planar $(n,m)$-graphs.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Homological Bounds on k-Component Edge Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical framework connecting k-component edge connectivity with spectral graph theory and homology theory to pro vide new insights into the resilience of real-world networks. By extending classical edge connectivity to higher-dimensional simplicial complexes, we derive tight spectral-homological bounds on the minimum number of edges that must be removed to ensure that all remaining components in the graph have size less than k. These bounds relate the spectra of graph and simplicial Laplacians to topological invariants from homology, establishing a multi-dimensional measure of network robustness. Our framework improves the understanding of network resilience in critical systems such as the Western U.S. power grid and European rail network, and we extend our analysis to random graphs and expander graphs to demonstrate the broad applicability of the method. Keywords: k-component edge connectivity, spectral graph theory, homology, simplicial complexes, network resilience, Betti numbers, algebraic connectivity, random graphs, expander graphs, infrastructure systems</description>

      <title>Minimal Matchings for dP3 Cluster Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work [LM17], Tri Lai and the second author studied a family of subgraphs of the dP3 brane tiling, called Aztec castles, whose dimer partition functions provide combinatorial formulas for cluster variables resulting from mutations of the quiver associated with the del Pezzo surface dP3. In our paper, we investigate a variant of the dP3 quiver by considering a second alphabet of variables that breaks the symmetries of the relevant recurrences. This deformation is motivated by the theory of cluster algebras with principal coefficients introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky. Our main result gives an explicit formula extending previously known generating functions for dP3 cluster variables by using Aztec castles and constructing their associated minimal matchings.</description>

Abstract: This paper present the first QUBO formulations for the Snake-in-the-box (SITB) and Coil-in-the-box (CITB) problems. Both formulations are also capable of solving the NP-Hard problems of Maximum induced path and Maximum induced cylce respectively. In the process we also found a new QUBO formulation for the Maximum Common Induced Sub-graph problem. We proved the correctness of our formulations for the SITB, CITB and Maximum Common Sub-graph problem, and tested the formulations of the SITB and CITB in both classical and quantum solvers, being able to get the best solution for up to 5 dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We extend a theorem of the second author on the $L^q$-dimensions of dynamically driven self-similar measures from the real line to arbitrary dimension. Our approach provides a novel, simpler proof even in the one-dimensional case. As consequences, we show that, under mild separation conditions, the $L^q$-dimensions of homogeneous self-similar measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$ take the expected values, and we derive higher rank slicing theorems in the spirit of Furstenberg's slicing conjecture.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Symmetric Polynomials: A Dynamical Point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the (skew) Macdonald and Jack symmetric polynomials as the number of variables grows to infinity. We characterize their limits in terms of certain variational problems. As an intermediate step, we establish a large deviation principle for the $\theta$ analogue of non-intersecting Bernoulli random walks. When $\theta=1$, these walks are equivalent to random Lozenges tilings of strip domains, where the variational principle (with general domains and boundary conditions) has been proven in the seminal work by Cohn, Kenyon, and Propp. Our result gives a new argument of this variational principle, and also extends it to non-intersecting $\theta$-Bernoulli random walks for any $\theta \in (0,\infty)$. Remarkably, the rate functions remain identical, differing only by a factor of $1/\theta$.</description>

      <title>Affine groups as flag-transitive and point-primitive automorphism groups of symmetric designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate symmetric designs admitting a flag-transitive and point-primitive affine automorphism group. We prove that if an automorphism group $G$ of a symmetric $(v,k,\lambda)$ design with $\lambda$ prime is point-primitive of affine type, then $G=2^{6}{:}\mathrm{S}_{6}$ and $(v,k,\lambda)=(16,6,2)$, or $G$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{A\Gamma L}_{1}(q)$ for some odd prime power $q$. In conclusion, we present a classification of flag-transitive and point-primitive symmetric designs with $\lambda$ prime, which says that such an incidence structure is a projective space $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$, it has parameter set $(15,7,3)$, $(7, 4, 2)$, $(11, 5, 2)$, $(11, 6, 2)$, $(16,6,2)$ or $(45, 12, 3)$, or $v=p^d$ where $p$ is an odd prime and the automorphism group is a subgroup of $\mathrm{A\Gamma L}_{1}(q)$.</description>

Abstract: Horospherical Schubert varieties are determined. It is shown that the stabilizer of an arbitrary point in a Schubert variety is a strongly solvable algebraic group. The connectedness of this stabilizer subgroup is discussed. Moreover, a new family of spherical varieties, called doubly spherical varieties, is introduced. It is shown that every nearly toric Schubert variety is doubly spherical.</description>

      <title>A new approach to bipartite stable matching optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a common generalization of previously solved optimization problems concerning bipartite stable matchings, we describe a strongly polynomial network flow based algorithm for computing $\ell$ disjoint stable matchings with minimum total cost. The major observation behind the approach is that stable matchings, as edge sets, can be represented as certain cuts of an associated directed graph. This allows us to use results on disjoint cuts directly to answer questions about disjoint stable matchings. We also provide a construction that represents stable matchings as maximum-size antichains in a partially ordered set (poset), which enables us to apply the theorems of Dilworth, Mirsky, Greene and Kleitman directly to stable matchings. Another consequence of these approaches is a min-max formula for the minimum number of stable matchings covering all stable edges.</description>

      <title>A $\Delta$-evaluation function for column permutation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, a new $\Delta$-evaluation method is introduced for solving a column permutation problem defined on a sparse binary matrix with the consecutive ones property. This problem models various $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problems in graph theory and industrial manufacturing contexts. The computational experiments compare the processing time of the $\Delta$-evaluation method with two other methods used in well-known local search procedures. The study considers a comprehensive set of instances of well-known problems, such as Gate Matrix Layout and Minimization of Open Stacks. The proposed evaluation method is generally competitive and particularly useful for large and dense instances. It can be easily integrated into local search and metaheuristic algorithms to improve solutions without significantly increasing processing time.</description>

Abstract: We employ combinatorial techniques to present an explicit formula for the coefficients in front of Chern classes involving in the Hattori-Stong integrability conditions. We also give an evenness condition for the signature of stably almost-complex manifolds in terms of Chern numbers. As an application, it can be showed that the signature of a $2n$-dimensional stably almost-complex manifold whose possibly nonzero Chern numbers being $c_n$ and $c_ic_{n-i}$ is even, which particularly rules out the existence of such structure on rational projective planes. Some other related results and remarks are also discussed in this article.</description>

      <title>On the expected absorption times of sticky random walks and multiple players war games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent paper by Bhatia, Chin, Mani, and Mossel (2024) defined stochastic processes which aim to model the game of war for two players for $n$ cards. They showed that these models are equivalent to gambler's ruin and therefore have expected termination time of $\Theta(n^2)$. In this paper, we generalize these model to any number of players $m$. We prove for the game with $m$ players is equivalent to a sticky random walk on an $m$-simplex. We show that this implies that the expected termination time is $O(n^2)$. We further provide a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\frac{n^2}{m^2}\right)$. We conjecture that when $m$ divides $n$, and $n &gt; m$ the termination time or the war game and the absorption times of the sticky random walk are in fact $\Theta(n^2)$ uniformly in $m$.</description>

Abstract: Finding the n-th positive square number is easy, as it is simply $n^2$. But how do we find the complementary sequence, i.e. the n-th positive nonsquare number? For this case there is an explicit formula. However, for general constraints on a number, this is harder to find. In this brief note, we study how to compute the n-th integer that does (or does not) satisfy a certain condition. In particular, we consider it as a fixed point problem, relate it to the iterative method of Lambek and Moser, study a bisection approach to this problem and provide a new formula for the n-th non-k-th power.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11506v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we confirm six conjectures on the exact values of some permanents, relating them to the Genocchi numbers of the first and second kinds as well as the Euler numbers. For example, we prove that $$\mathrm{per}\left[\left\lfloor\frac{2j-k}{n}\right\rfloor\right]_{1\le j,k\le n}=2(2^{n+1}-1)B_{n+1},$$ where $B_0,B_1,B_2,\ldots$ are the Bernoulli numbers. We also show that $$ \mathrm{per}\left[\mathrm{sgn}\left(\cos\pi\frac{i+j}{n+1}\right)\right]_{1\le i,j\le n}=\begin{cases} -\sum_{k=0}^m\binom{m}{k}E_{2k+1}&amp;\quad\text{if}\ n=2m+1,\\ \sum_{k=0}^m\binom{m}{k}E_{2k}&amp;\quad\text{if}\ n=2m, \end{cases} $$ where $\mathrm{sgn}(x)$ is the sign function, and $E_0,E_1,E_2,\ldots$ are the Euler (zigzag) numbers.
  In the course of linking the evaluation of these permanents to the aforementioned combinatorial sequences, the classical permutation statistic -- the excedance number, together with several kinds of its variants, plays a central role. Our approach features recurrence relations, bijections, as well as certain elementary operations on matrices that preserve their permanents. Moreover, our proof of the second permanent identity leads to a proof of Bala's conjectural continued fraction formula, and an unexpected permutation interpretation for the $\gamma$-coefficients of the $2$-Eulerian polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We consider the class of directed graphs with $N\geq 1$ edges and without loops shorter than $k$. Using the concept of a labelled graph, we determine graphs from this class that maximize the number of all paths of length $k$. Then we show an $R$-labelled version of this result for semirings $R$ contained in the semiring of non-negative real numbers and containing the semiring of non-negative rational numbers. We end by posing a related open problem concerning the maximal dimension of the path algebra of an acyclic graph with $N\geq1$ edges.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The periodic tiling conjecture asserts that any finite subset of a lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ which tiles that lattice by translations, in fact tiles periodically. In this work we disprove this conjecture for sufficiently large $d$, which also implies a disproof of the corresponding conjecture for Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$. In fact, we also obtain a counterexample in a group of the form $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times G_0$ for some finite abelian $2$-group $G_0$. Our methods rely on encoding a "Sudoku puzzle" whose rows and other non-horizontal lines are constrained to lie in a certain class of "$2$-adically structured functions," in terms of certain functional equations that can be encoded in turn as a single tiling equation, and then demonstrating that solutions to this Sudoku puzzle exist, but are all non-periodic.</description>

      <title>Sharp Ramsey thresholds for large books</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For graphs $G$ and $H$, let $G\to H$ signify that any red/blue edge coloring of $G$ contains a monochromatic $H$. Let $G(N,p)$ be the random graph of order $N$ and edge probability $p$. The Ramsey thresholds for fixed graphs have received most attention. In this paper, we consider the Ramsey thresholds in another angle. In particular, we will consider the sharp Ramsey threshold for the large book graph $B_n^{(k)}$, which consists of $n$ copies of $K_{k+1}$ all sharing a common $K_k$. In particular, for every fixed integer $k\ge 2$ and for any real $c&gt;1$, let $N=c2^k n$. Then for any real $\gamma&gt;0$, \[ \lim_{n\to \infty} \Pr(G(N,p)\to B_n^{(k)})= \left\{ \begin{array}{cl} 0 &amp; \mbox{if $p\le\frac{1}{c^{1/k}}(1-\gamma)$,} \\ 1 &amp; \mbox{if $p\ge\frac{1}{c^{1/k}}(1+\gamma)$}. \end{array} \right. \] This implies that $r(B_n^{(k)},B_n^{(k)})=2^kn+o(n)$, and hence especially extends the work of Conlon (2019) and the follow-up work of Conlon, Fox and Wigderson (2022) on book Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Degree-Kirchhoff, Gutman, and Schultz Indices in Pentagonal Cylinders and M\"{o}bius Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degree-Kirchhoff index of a connected graph is defined as the sum of the reciprocals of the non-zero eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian matrix, each multiplied by the graph's total degree. Several studies have recently obtained explicit formulations for the degree-Kirchhoff index of various kinds of class graphs. This paper presents closed-form formulas for the degree-Kirchhoff index of pentagonal cylinders and M\"{o}bius chains. Additionally, we calculate the Gutman index and Schultz index for these graphs.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraph density. II. Sparse and dense sets in cographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known theorem of R\"odl says that for every graph $H$, and every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists $\delta&gt;0$ such that if $G$ does not contain an induced copy of $H$, then there exists $X\subseteq V(G)$ with $|X|\ge \delta|G|$ such that one of $G[X],\overline{G}[X]$ has edge-density at most $\epsilon$. But how does $\delta$ depend on $\epsilon$? Fox and Sudakov conjectured that the dependence is at most polynomial: that for all $H$ there exists $c&gt;0$ such that for all $\epsilon$ with $0&lt;\epsilon\le 1/2$, R\"odl's theorem holds with $\delta=\epsilon^c$. This conjecture implies the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture, and until now it had not been verified for any non-trivial graphs $H$. Our first result shows that it is true when $H=P_4$. Indeed, in that case we can take $\delta=\epsilon$, and insist that one of $G[X],\overline{G}[X]$ has maximum degree at most $\epsilon^2|G|$).
  Second, we will show that every graph $H$ that can be obtained by substitution from copies of $P_4$ satisfies the Fox-Sudakov conjecture. To prove this, we need to work with a stronger property. Let us say $H$ is {\em viral} if there exists $c&gt;0$ such that for all $\epsilon$ with $0&lt;\epsilon\le 1/2$, if $G$ contains at most $\epsilon^c|G|^{|H|}$ copies of $H$ as induced subgraphs, then there exists $X\subseteq V(G)$ with $|X|\ge \epsilon^c|G|$ such that one of $G[X],\overline{G}[X]$ has edge-density at most $\epsilon$. We will show that $P_4$ is viral, using a ``polynomial $P_4$-removal lemma'' of Alon and Fox. We will also show that the class of viral graphs is closed under vertex-substitution.
  Finally, we give a different strengthening of R\"odl's theorem: we show that if $G$ does not contain an induced copy of $P_4$, then its vertices can be partitioned into at most $480\epsilon^{-4}$ subsets $X$ such that one of $G[X],\overline{G}[X]$ has maximum degree at most $\epsilon|X|$.</description>

      <title>Some exact and asymptotic results for hypergraph Tur\'an problems in $\ell_2$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, the \emph{codegree squared sum} $\text{co}_2(\mathcal{H})$ is the square of the $\ell_2$-norm of the codegree vector of $\mathcal{H}$, and for a family $\mathscr{F}$ of $k$-uniform hypergraphs, the codegree squared extremal number $\text{exco}_2(n, \mathscr{F})$ is the maximum codegree squared sum of a hypergraph on $n$ vertices which does not contain any hypergraph in $\mathscr{F}$. Balogh, Clemen and Lidick\'y recently introduced the codegree squared extremal number and determined it for a number of $3$-uniform hypergraphs, including the complete graphs $K_4^3$ and $K_5^3$.
  In this paper, we give a number of exact or asymptotic results for hypergraph Tur\'an problems in the $\ell_2$-norm, including the first exact results for arbitrary $k$. Namely, we prove a version of the classical Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem for the codegree squared extremal number: if $\mathcal{F} \subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ is intersecting and $n\ge 2k$, then \[\text{co}_2(\mathcal{F}) \le \binom{n-1}{k-1}(1+(n-k+1)(k-1)),\] with equality only for the star for $n &gt; 2k$. Our main tool is an inequality of Bey, which also gives a general upper bound on $\text{exco}_2(n, \mathscr{F})$.
  We also prove versions of the Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture and the $t$-intersecting Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem for the codegree squared extremal number for large $n$, determine the exact codegree squared extremal number of minimal and linear $3$-paths and $3$-cycles, and determine asymptotically the codegree squared extremal number of minimal and linear $s$-paths and $s$-cycles for $s\ge 4$.
  Lastly, we derive a number of exact or asymptotic results for graph Tur\'an-type problems in the $\ell_2$-norm from spectral extremal results for certain fobridden subgraph problems and the well-known Hofmeister's inequality.</description>

      <title>EPPA numbers of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $G$ is a graph, $A$ and $B$ its induced subgraphs, and $f\colon A\to B$ an isomorphism, we say that $f$ is a \emph{partial automorphism} of $G$. In 1992, Hrushovski proved that graphs have the \emph{extension property for partial automorphisms} (\emph{EPPA}, also called the \emph{Hrushovski property}), that is, for every finite graph $G$ there is a finite graph $H$, an \emph{EPPA-witness} for $G$, such that $G$ is an induced subgraph of $H$ and every partial automorphism of $G$ extends to an automorphism of $H$.
  The EPPA number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\mathop{\mathrm{eppa}}\nolimits(G)$, is the smallest number of vertices of an EPPA-witness for $G$, and we put $\mathop{\mathrm{eppa}}\nolimits(n) = \max\{\mathop{\mathrm{eppa}}\nolimits(G) : \lvert G\rvert = n\}$. In this note we review the state of the area, prove several lower bounds (in particular, we show that $\mathop{\mathrm{eppa}}\nolimits(n)\geq \frac{2^n}{\sqrt{n}}$, thereby identifying the correct base of the exponential) and pose many open questions. We also briefly discuss EPPA numbers of hypergraphs, directed graphs, and $K_k$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Stabiliser codes over fields of even order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the natural isomorphism between GF(2^h) and GF(2)^h induces a bijection between stabiliser codes on n quqits with local dimension q=2^h and binary stabiliser codes on hn qubits. This allows us to describe these codes geometrically: a stabiliser code over a field of even order corresponds to a so-called quantum set of symplectic polar spaces. Moreover, equivalent stabiliser codes have a similar geometry, which can be used to prove the uniqueness of a [[4,0,3]]_4 stabiliser code and the nonexistence of both a [[7,1,4]]_4 and an [[8,0,5]]_4 stabiliser code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the differential algebra of polytopes to explain the known remarkable relation of the combinatorics of the associahedra and permutohedra with the compositional and multiplicative inversion of formal power series. This approach allows to single out the associahedra and permutohedra among all graph-associahedra and emphasizes the significance of the differential equations for special sequences of simple polytopes derived earlier by one of the authors. We discuss also the link with the geometry of Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces $\bar M_{0,n}$ and the interpretation of the combinatorics of cyclohedra in relation with the classical Fa\`a di Bruno's formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of integers $A$ and an integer $k$, write $A+k\cdot A$ for the set $\{a+kb:a\in A,b\in A\}$. Hanson and Petridis showed that if $|A+A|\le K|A|$ then $|A+2\cdot A|\le K^{2.95}|A|$. At a presentation of this result, Petridis stated that the highest known value for $\frac{\log(|A+2\cdot A|/|A|)}{\log(|A+A|/|A|)}$ (bounded above by 2.95) was $\frac{\log 4}{\log 3}$. We show that, for all $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exist $A$ and $K$ with $|A+A|\le K|A|$ but with $|A+2\cdot A|\ge K^{2-\epsilon}|A|$.
  Further, we analyse a method of Ruzsa, and generalise it to give continuous analogues of the sizes of sumsets, differences and dilates. We apply this method to a construction of Hennecart, Robert and Yudin to prove that, for all $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists a set $A$ with $|A-A|\ge |A|^{2-\epsilon}$ but with $|A+A|&lt;|A|^{1.7354+\epsilon}$.
  The second author would like to thank E. Papavassilopoulos for useful discussions about how to improve the efficiency of his computer searches.</description>

Abstract: We determine the higher weight spectra of $q$-ary Reed-Muller codes $C_q=RM_q(2,2)$ for all prime powers $q$. This is equivalent to finding the usual weight distributions of all extension codes of $C_q$ over every field extension of $F_q$ of finite degree. To obtain our results we will utilize well-known connections between these weights and properties of the Stanley-Reisner rings of a series of matroids associated to each code $C_q$. In the process, we are able to explicitly determine all the graded Betti numbers of matroids associated to $C_q$ and its elongations.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a graphical map, a new correspondence between circular electrical networks and circular planar split systems. When restricted to the planar circular electrical case, this graphical map finds the split system associated uniquely to the Kalmanson resistance distance of the dual network, matching the induced split system familiar from phylogenetics. This is extended to compactifications of the respective spaces, taking cactus networks to the newly defined compactified split systems. The graphical map preserves both components and cactus structure, allowing an elegant enumeration of induced phylogenetic split systems.</description>

      <title>Components, large and small, are as they should be I: supercritical percolation on regular graphs of growing degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for a regular graph $G$ of growing degree $d$, guaranteeing a phase transition in its random subgraph $G_p$ similar to that of $G(n,p)$ when $p\cdot d\approx 1$. These conditions capture several well-studied graphs, such as (percolation on) the complete graph $K_n$, the binary hypercube $Q^d$, $d$-regular expanders, and random $d$-regular graphs. In particular, this serves as a unified proof for these (and other) cases.
  Suppose that $G$ is a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, with $d=\omega(1)$. Let $\epsilon&gt;0$ be a small constant, and let $p=\frac{1+\epsilon}{d}$. Let $y(\epsilon)$ be the survival probability of a Galton-Watson tree with offspring distribution Po$(1+\epsilon)$. We show that if $G$ satisfies a (very) mild edge expansion requirement, and if one has fairly good control on the expansion of small sets in $G$, then typically the percolated random subgraph $G_p$ contains a unique giant component of asymptotic order $y(\epsilon)n$, and all the other components in $G_p$ are of order $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$.
  We also show that this result is tight, in the sense that if one asks for a slightly weaker control on the expansion of small sets in $G$, then there are $d$-regular graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices, where typically the second largest component is of order $\Omega(d\log (n/d))=\omega(\log n)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $d\ge 3$ be a fixed integer. Let $y:= y(p)$ be the probability that the root of an infinite $d$-regular tree belongs to an infinite cluster after $p$-bond-percolation. We show that for every constants $b,\alpha&gt;0$ and $1&lt;\lambda&lt; d-1$, there exist constants $c,C&gt;0$ such that the following holds. Let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, satisfying that for every $U\subseteq V(G)$ with $|U|\le \frac{n}{2}$, $e(U,U^c)\ge b|U|$ and for every $U\subseteq V(G)$ with $|U|\le \log^Cn$, $e(U)\le (1+c)|U|$. Let $p=\frac{\lambda}{d-1}$. Then, with probability tending to one as $n$ tends to infinity, the largest component $L_1$ in the random subgraph $G_p$ of $G$ satisfies $\left|1-\frac{|L_1|}{yn}\right|\le \alpha$, and all the other components in $G_p$ are of order $O\left(\frac{\lambda\log n}{(\lambda-1)^2}\right)$. This generalises (and improves upon) results for random $d$-regular graphs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the minimum degree threshold of perfect matchings with high discrepancy in $r$-edge-colored $k$-uniform hypergraphs for all $k\geq 3$ and $r\geq 2$, thereby completing the investigation into discrepancies of perfect matchings that has recently attracted significant attention. Our approach identifies this discrepancy threshold with a novel family of multicolored uniform hypergraphs and reveals new phenomena not covered in previous studies. In particular, our results address a question of Balogh, Treglown and Z\'arate-Guer\'en concerning 3-uniform hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>On the existence of Hamiltonian cycles in hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each pair of positive integers $(a,b)$ such that $a \geq 0$ and $b &gt; 1$, the present paper provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of Hamiltonian cycles visiting all the vertices of any $k$-dimensional grid $\{0,1\}^k \subset \mathbb{R}^k$ and whose associated Euclidean distance is equal to $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. Our solution extends previously stated results in fairy chess on the existence of closed Euclidean $(a,b)$-leapers tours for $2 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 2$ chessboards, where the (Euclidean) knight identifies the $(1,2)$-leaper.</description>

      <title>Comparing the $p$-independence number of regular graphs to the $q$-independence number of their line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph, and let $p$, $q$, and $r$ be non-negative integers. A \emph{$p$-independent} set in $G$ is a set of vertices $S \subseteq V(G)$ such that the subgraph induced by $S$ has maximum degree at most $p$. The \emph{$p$-independence number} of $G$, denoted by $\alpha_p(G)$, is the cardinality of a maximum $p$-independent set in $G$. Letting $L(G)$ denote the line graph of $G$. In this paper, motivated by the result $\alpha_0(G) \leq \alpha_0(L(G))$, for every $r$-regular graph with $r \geq 1$ (see~\cite{CaDaPe2020}), we investigate which values of $p$, $q$, and $r$ have the property that $\alpha_p(G) \leq \alpha_q(L(G))$ for all $r$-regular graphs $G$. Triples $(p, q, r)$ having this property are called \emph{valid $\alpha$-triples}. Among the results we prove are : \begin{itemize}
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \geq 0$, $q \geq 3$ , and $r\geq 2$.
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \leq q &lt; 3$ and $r\geq 2$.
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \geq 0$, $q = 2$, and $r$ even.
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \geq 0$, $q = 2$, and $r$ odd with $r \geq \max \Big \{ 3, \frac{17(p+1)}{16}\Big \}$. \end{itemize} We also show a close relation between undetermined possible valid $\alpha$-triples, the Linear Aboricity Conjecture, and the Path-Cover Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Nearly Toric Schubert Varieties of Type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A notion of a nearly toric variety is introduced. The examples of nearly toric varieties in the context of Schubert varieties are discussed. In particular, combinatorial characterizations of the smooth and singular nearly toric Schubert varieties are found. Furthermore, the counts and generating series are determined. Additionally, a connection between Dyck paths and a certain family of nearly toric Schubert varieties is established.</description>

      <title>Complexity and Enumeration in Models of Genome Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01851v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the computational complexity of enumeration in certain genome rearrangement models. We first show that the Pairwise Rearrangement problem in the Single Cut-and-Join model (Bergeron, Medvedev, &amp; Stoye, J. Comput. Biol. 2010) is $\#\textsf{P}$-complete under polynomial-time Turing reductions. Next, we show that in the Single Cut or Join model (Feijao &amp; Meidanis, IEEE ACM Trans. Comp. Biol. Bioinf. 2011), the problem of enumerating all medians ($\#$Median) is logspace-computable ($\textsf{FL}$), improving upon the previous polynomial-time ($\textsf{FP}$) bound of Mikl\'os &amp; Smith (RECOMB 2015).</description>

      <title>Bilateral Bailey lattices and Andrews-Gordon type identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Bailey lattice can be extended to a bilateral version in just a few lines from the bilateral Bailey lemma, using a very simple lemma transforming bilateral Bailey pairs related to $a$ into bilateral Bailey pairs related to $a/q$. Using this lemma and similar ones, we give bilateral versions and simple proofs of other (new and known) Bailey lattices, among which a Bailey lattice of Warnaar and the inverses of Bailey lattices of Lovejoy. As consequences of our bilateral point of view, we derive new $m$-versions of the Andrews-Gordon identities, Bressoud's identities, a new companion to Bressoud's identities, and the Bressoud-G\"ollnitz-Gordon identities. Finally, we give a new elementary proof of another very general identity of Bressoud using one of our Bailey lattices.</description>

      <title>On towers of Isogeny graphs with full level structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p,q,l$ be three distinct prime numbers and let $N$ be a positive integer coprime to $pql$. For an integer $n\ge 0$, we define the directed graph $X_l^q(p^nN)$ whose vertices are given by isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over a finite field of characteristic $q$ equipped with a level $p^nN$ structure. The edges of $X_l^q(p^nN)$ are given by $l$-isogenies. We are interested in when the connected components of $X_l^q(p^nN)$ give rise to a tower of Galois covers as $n$ varies. We show that only in the supersingular case we do get a tower of Galois covers. We also study similar towers of isogeny graphs given by oriented supersingular curves, as introduced by Col\`o-Kohel, enhanced with a level structure.</description>

      <title>Randomisation in the Josephus Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18110v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephus problem is a well--studied elimination problem consisting in determining the position of the survivor after repeated applications of a deterministic rule removing one person at a time from a given group.
  A natural probabilistic variant of this process is introduced in this paper. More precisely, in this variant, the survivor is determined after performing a succession of Bernouilli trials with parameter $p$ designating each time the person to remove. When the number of participants tends to infinity, the main result characterises the limit distribution of the position of the survivor with an increasing degree of precision as the parameter approaches the unbiaised case $p=1/2$. Then, the convergence rate to the position of the survivor is obtained in the form of a Central-Limit Theorem.
  A number of other variants of the suggested probabilistic elimination process are also considered. They each admit a specific limit behavior which, in most cases, is stated in the form of an open problem.</description>

      <title>Constructing heat kernels on infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, edge- and vertex-weighted graph with certain reasonable restrictions. We construct the heat kernel of the associated Laplacian using an adaptation of the parametrix approach due to Minakshisundaram-Pleijel in the setting of Riemannian geometry. This is partly motivated by the wish to relate the heat kernels of a graph and a subgraph, or of a domain and a discretization of it. As an application, assuming that the graph is locally finite, we express the heat kernel $H_G(x,y;t)$ as a Taylor series with the lead term being $a(x,y)t^r$, where $r$ is the combinatorial distance between $x$ and $y$ and $a(x,y)$ depends (explicitly) upon edge and vertex weights. In the case $G$ is the regular $(q+1)$-tree with $q\geq 1$, our construction reproves different explicit formulas due to Chung-Yau and to Chinta-Jorgenson-Karlsson. Assuming uniform boundedness of the combinatorial vertex degree, we show that a dilated Gaussian depending on any distance metric on $G$, which is uniformly bounded from below can be taken as a parametrix in our construction. Our work extends in part the recent articles [LNY21, CJKS23] in that the graphs are infinite and weighted.</description>

      <title>Chessboard and level sets of continuous functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the following result: Let $f \colon I^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ be a continuous function. Then, there exist a point $p \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and a compact subset $S \subset f^{-1}\left[\left\{p\right\}\right]$ which connects some opposite faces of the $n$-dimensional unit cube $I^n$. We give an example that shows it cannot be generalized to path-connected sets. We also provide a discrete version of this result which is inspired by the $n$-dimensional Steinhaus Chessboard Theorem. Additionally, we show that the latter one and the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem are simple consequences of the main result.</description>

      <title>A new lower bound for the density of planar Sets avoiding Unit Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recently published article by G. Ambrus et al. a new upper bound for the density of an unit avoiding, periodic set is given as $0.2470$, the first upper bound $&lt; 1/4$. A construction of Croft 1967 gave a lower bound $\delta_C = 0.22936$ for the density. To this date, no better construction with a higher lower bound has been given. In this article I give a construction planar sets with a higher density than Croft's tortoises. No explicit value for this density is given, it's just shown that Croft's density is a local minima of the density of a here constructed 1-parameter family of planar sets. So the densities are $&gt; \delta_C$.</description>

      <title>The $m$-th Element of a Sidon Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $A=\{a_1,\dots ,a_{|A|}\}\subset \{1,2,\dots ,n\}$ is a Sidon set so that $|A|=n^{1/2}-L^\prime$, then $$a_m = m\cdot n^{1/2} + \mathcal O\left( n^{7/8}\right) + \mathcal O\left(L^{1/2}\cdot n^{3/4}\right)$$ where $L=\max\{0,L^\prime\}$. As an application of this, we give easy proofs of some previously derived results. We proceed on to proving that for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$, we have $$\sum_{a\in S} a = \frac 12 n^{3/2} + \mathcal O \left (n^{11/8} \right )$$ for all $n\le N$ but at most $\mathcal O_{\varepsilon} \left (N^{\frac 35 + \varepsilon} \right )$ exceptions.</description>
