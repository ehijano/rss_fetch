      <title>Synchronization of E. coli bacteria moving in coupled wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization plays a crucial role in the dynamics of living organisms, from fireflies flashing in unison to pacemaker cells that jointly generate heartbeats. Uncovering the mechanism behind these phenomena requires an understanding of individual biological oscillators and the coupling forces between them. Here, we develop a single-cell assay that studies rhythmic behavior in the motility of individual E.coli cells that can be mutually synchronized. Circular microcavities are used to isolate E.coli cells that swim along the cavity wall, resulting in self-sustained oscillations. Upon connecting these cavities by microchannels the bacterial motions can be coupled, yielding nonlinear dynamic synchronization patterns with phase slips. We demonstrate that the coordinated movement observed in coupled E. coli oscillators follows mathematical rules of synchronization which we use to quantify the coupling strength. These findings advance our understanding of motility in confinement, and lay the foundation for engineering desired dynamics in microbial active matter.</description>

      <title>Optimal crawling: from mechanical to chemical actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking inspiration from the crawling motion of biological cells on a substrate, we consider a physical model of self-propulsion where the spatio-temporal driving can involve both, a mechanical actuation by active force couples, and a chemical actuation through controlled mass turnover. We show that the competition and cooperation between these two modalities of active driving can drastically broaden the performance repertoire of the crawler. When the material turnover is slow and the mechanical driving dominates, we find that the highest velocity at a given energetic cost is reached when actuation takes the form of an active force configuration propagating as a traveling wave. As the rate of material turnover increases, and the chemical driving starts to dominate the mechanical one, such a peristalsis-type control progressively loses its efficacy, yielding to a standing wave type driving which involves an interplay between the mechanical and chemical actuation. Our analysis suggests a new paradigm for the optimal design of crawling biomimetic robots where the conventional purely mechanical driving through distributed force actuators is complemented by a distributed chemical control of the material remodeling inside the force-transmitting machinery.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Tension Dynamics Model of Epithelial Convergent Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epithelial tissue elongation by convergent extension is a key motif of animal morphogenesis. On a coarse scale, cell motion resembles laminar fluid flow; yet in contrast to a fluid, epithelial cells adhere to each other and maintain the tissue layer under actively generated internal tension. To resolve this apparent paradox, we formulate a model in which tissue flow in the tension-dominated regime occurs through adiabatic remodeling of force balance in the network of adherens junctions. We propose that the slow dynamics within the manifold of force-balanced configurations is driven by positive feedback on myosin-generated cytoskeletal tension. Shifting force balance within a tension network causes active cell rearrangements (T1 transitions) resulting in net tissue deformation oriented by initial tension anisotropy. Strikingly, we find that the total extent of tissue deformation depends on the initial cellular packing order. T1s degrade this order so that tissue flow is self-limiting. We explain these findings by showing that coordination of T1s depends on coherence in local tension configurations, quantified by a geometric order parameter in tension space. Our model reproduces the salient tissue- and cell-scale features of germ band elongation during Drosophila gastrulation, in particular the slowdown of tissue flow after approximately twofold elongation concomitant with a loss of order in tension configurations. This suggests local cell geometry contains morphogenetic information and yields experimentally testable predictions. Furthermore, defining biologically controlled active tension dynamics on the manifold of force-balanced states may provide a general approach to the description of morphogenetic flow.</description>

      <title>Information gain at the onset of habituation to repeated stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12812v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological and living systems process information across spatiotemporal scales, exhibiting the hallmark ability to constantly modulate their behavior to ever-changing and complex environments. In the presence of repeated stimuli, a distinctive response is the progressive reduction of the activity at both sensory and molecular levels, known as habituation. Here, we solve a minimal microscopic model devoid of biological details to show that habituation is driven by negative feedback provided by a slow storage mechanism. Crucially, an intermediate level of habituation is associated with a steep increase in the information that the system collects on the external input over time. We find that the region characterized both by maximal information gain and by the onset of habituation can be retrieved if the system tunes its parameters to minimize dissipation and maximize information at the same time. We test our dynamical predictions against experimentally recorded neural responses in a zebrafish larva subjected to repeated looming stimulation. Our work makes a fundamental step towards uncovering the core mechanisms that shape habituation in biological systems, elucidating its information-theoretic and functional role.</description>
