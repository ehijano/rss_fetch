      <title>Abstract boundary delay systems and application to network flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness and positivity of solutions to a class of delayed transport equations on a network. The material flow is delayed at the vertices and along the edges. The problem is reformulated as an abstract boundary delay equation, and well-posedness is proved by using the Staffans-Weiss theory. We also establish spectral theory for the associated delay operators and provide conditions for the positivity of the semigroup.</description>

      <title>On the dispersive estimates for the discrete Schr\"odinger equation on a honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete Schr\"odinger equation on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice is a fundamental tight-binding approximation model that describes the propagation of waves on graphene. For free evolution, we first show that the degenerate frequencies of the dispersion relation are completely characterized by three symmetric periodic curves (Theorem 2.1), and that the three curves meet at Dirac points where conical singularities appear (see Figure 2.1). Based on this observation, we prove the $L^1\to L^\infty$ dispersion estimates for the linear flow depending on the frequency localization (Theorem 2.3). Collecting all, we obtain the dispersion estimate with $O(|t|^{-2/3})$ decay as well as Strichartz estimates. As an application, we prove small data scattering for a nonlinear model (Theorem 2.10). The proof of the key dispersion estimates is based on the associated oscillatory integral estimates with degenerate phases and conical singularities at Dirac points. Our proof is direct and uses only elementary methods.</description>

      <title>On the initial-boundary value problem for the 2D partially dissipative Oldroyd-B model: global well-posedness and large time stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the global well-posedness of solutions to the Oldroyd-B model with purely horizontal viscosity and arbitrarily large initial data in two-dimensional settings, including the full space $\mathbb{R}^2$, the partially periodic domain $\mathcal{T}\times\mathbb{R}$ and the fully periodic torus $\mathcal{T}^2$, where $\mathcal{T}$ represents the one-dimensional periodic torus. Our analysis relies on energy methods to derive key {\it a priori} estimates that capture the anisotropic regularization induced by horizontal viscosity. Furthermore, for the cases of spatial domains $\mathcal{T}\times\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathcal{T}^2$, we further investigate the long-time behavior of solutions with small initial data. The compactness along the horizontal direction plays a pivotal role in constructing uniform-in-time estimates, ultimately leading to exponential decay of solutions as $t\to\infty$. This decay mechanism reveals how geometric constraints enhance the dissipation in viscoelastic flows.</description>

      <title>Derivation and Well-Posedness Analysis of the Higher-Order Benjamin-Bona-Mahony Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the derivation and well-posedness of a class of high - order water wave equations, the fifth - order Benjamin - Bona - Mahony (BBM) equation. Low - order models have limitations in describing strong nonlinear and high - frequency dispersion effects. Thus, it is proposed to improve the modeling accuracy of water wave dynamics on long - time scales through high - order correction models. By making small - parameter corrections to the $abcd-$system, then performing approximate estimations, the fifth - order BBM equation is finally derived.For local well - posedness, the equation is first transformed into an equivalent integral equation form. With the help of multilinear estimates and the contraction mapping principle, it is proved that when $s\geq1$, for a given initial value $\eta_{0}\in H^{s}(\mathbb{R})$, the equation has a local solution $\eta \in C([0, T];H^{s})$, and the solution depends continuously on the initial value. Meanwhile, the maximum existence time of the solution and its growth restriction are given.For global well - posedness, when $s\geq2$, through energy estimates and local theory, combined with conservation laws, it is proved that the initial - value problem of the equation is globally well - posed in $H^{s}(\mathbb{R})$. When $1\leq s&lt;2$, the initial value is decomposed into a rough small part and a smooth part, and evolution equations are established respectively. It is proved that the corresponding integral equation is locally well - posed in $H^{2}$ and the solution can be extended, thus concluding that the initial - value problem of the equation is globally well - posed in $H^{s}$.</description>

      <title>Strongly nonlinear age structured equation,time-elapsed model and large delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-elapsed model for neural networks is a nonlinear age structured equationwhere the renewal term describes the network activity and influences the dischargerate, possibly with a delay due to the length of connections.We solve a long standing question, namely that an inhibitory network withoutdelay will converge to a steady state and thus the network is desynchonised. Ourapproach is based on the observation that a non-expansion property holds true.However a non-degeneracy condition is needed and, besides the standard one, weintroduce a new condition based on strict nonlinearity.When a delay is included, and following previous works for Fokker-Planck models,we prove that the network may generate periodic solutions. We introduce a newformalism to establish rigorously this property for large delays.The fundamental contraction property also holds for some other age structuredequations and systems.</description>

      <title>Construction of bubbling solutions of the Brezis-Nirenberg problem in general bounded domains (I): the dimensions 4 and 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Brezis-Nirenberg problem $$ -\Delta u=\lambda u+|u|^{\frac{4}{N-2}}u,\quad\mbox{in}\,\, \Omega,\quad u=0,\quad\mbox{on}\,\, \partial\Omega, $$ where $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$, $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^N$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$ and $N\geq3$. We prove that every eigenvalue of the Laplacian operator $-\Delta$ with the Dirichlet boundary is a concentration value of the Brezis-Nirenberg problem in dimensions $N=4$ and $N=5$ by constructing bubbling solutions with precisely asymptotic profiles via the Ljapunov-Schmidt reduction arguments. Our results suggest that the bubbling phenomenon of the Brezis-Nirenberg problem in dimensions $N=4$ and $N=5$ as the parameter $\lambda$ is close to the eigenvalues are governed by crucial functions related to the eigenfunctions, which has not been observed yet in the literature to our best knowledge. Moreover, as the parameter $\lambda$ is close to the eigenvalues, there are arbitrary number of multi-bump bubbing solutions in dimension $N=4$ while, there are only finitely many number of multi-bump bubbing solutions in dimension $N=5$, which are also new findings to our best knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem $-\Delta u+\lambda u=u^{p-1}$, where $u\in H^1_0(\Omega)$ verifies $\|u\|_{L^2}=m&gt;0$, and $\lambda\in [0,+\infty)$. Here, $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega$ is nonempty and compact. We prove the existence of a solution with a constrained Morse index lower than or equal to $N+1$, both in the case $m$ fixed and $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega$ in a small ball and in the case $\Omega$ fixed and $m$ large.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal equations with kernels of general order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a broad class of nonlinear integro-differential equations with a kernel whose differentiability order is described by a general function $\phi$. This class includes not only the fractional $p$-Laplace equations, but also borderline cases when the fractional order approaches $1$. Under mild assumptions on $\phi$, we establish sharp Sobolev-Poincar\'e type inequalities for the associated Sobolev spaces, which are connected to a question raised by Brezis (Russian Math. Surveys 57:693--708, 2002). Using these inequalities, we prove H\"older regularity and Harnack inequalities for weak solutions to such nonlocal equations. All the estimates in our results remain stable as the associated nonlocal energy functional approaches its local counterpart.</description>

      <title>Three non-zero solutions of a Neumann eigenvalue problems involving the fractional p-Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we establish a multiplicity result for a following class of nonlocal Neumann eigenvalue problems involving the fractional p-Laplacian.
  \begin{align} \begin{cases}
  (-\Delta)^{s}_{p}u + a(x) \abs{u}^{p-2}u =\lambda h(x,u) &amp; \text {in } \Omega,
  \mathcal{N}_{s,p}u=0 &amp; \text {in } \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \overline{\Omega},
  \end{cases}
  \end{align}
  Precisely, we demonstrate the existence of an open interval for positive eigenvalues $\lambda$, for which the problem has at least three non-zero solutions in $W^{s,p}_{\Omega}.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solutions to the system $u_{tt}-u_{xx}+q(x)u=0, x&gt;0,t&gt;0$; $u|_{t=0}=u_t|_{t=0}=0, x&gt;0$; $u|_{x=0}=g(t), t&gt;0$, with a locally summable Hermitian matrix-valued potential $q$ and a $C^{\infty}$-smooth $\mathbb C^n$-valued boundary control $g$ vanishing near the origin. We prove that the solution $u^{g}(\cdot,T)$ is a function from $W^2_1([0,T];\mathbb C^n)$ and that the control operator $W^T:g\mapsto u^g(\cdot,T)$ is an isomorphism in $L_2([0,T];\mathbb C^n)$, and, in the case that $q$ is from $L_2([0,T];\mathbb C^n)$, also an isomorphism in $H^2([0,T];\mathbb C^n)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the green's functions to heat equation with a dynamical boundary condition in the unit ball. We summarise the recent result on the half space as comparison, in which case, the explicit formula of green's function is displayed. For the unit ball case, the green's function is represented with eigenfunctions implicitly. Using the Dirichlet heat kernel, two types of approximate functions are constructed.</description>

      <title>Coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with point interaction: existence and asymptotic behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we deal with the following weakly coupled nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system \begin{align*} \begin{cases} - \Delta_\alpha u + \omega u = |u|^2 u + \beta u |v|^2&amp;\quad \mathrm{in}\ \mathbb{R}^2,\\ - \Delta v + \tilde{\omega} v = |v|^2 v + \beta |u|^2 v&amp;\quad \mathrm{in}\ \mathbb{R}^2, \end{cases} %\tag{$\mathcal{P}_\beta$} \end{align*} where $-\Delta_\alpha$ denotes the Laplacian operator with a point interaction, $\omega$ greater then a suitable positive constant, $\tilde{\omega}&gt;0$, and $\beta\ge 0$. For any $\beta\ge 0$ this system admits the existence of a ground state solution which can have only one nontrivial component or two nontrivial components and which could be regular or singular. We analyse this phenomenon showing how this depends strongly on the parameters. Moreover we study the asymptotic behaviour of ground state solutions whenever $\beta\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on compact product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new local well-posedness results for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations posed on a general product of spheres and tori, by the standard approach of multi-linear Strichartz estimates. To prove these estimates, we establish and utilize multi-linear bounds for the joint spectral projector associated to the Laplace--Beltrami operators on the individual sphere factors of the product manifold. To treat the particular case of the cubic NLS on a product of two spheres at critical regularity, we prove a sharp $L^\infty_xL^p_t$ estimate of the solution to the linear Schr\"odinger equation on the two-torus.</description>

      <title>Linear convective stability of a front superposition with unstable connecting state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study convective stability of a two-front superposition in a reaction-diffusion system. Due to the instability of the connecting equilibrium, long-range semi-strong interaction is expected between the two waves. When restricting to the linear dynamic, we indeed identify that convective stability of superposed waves occurs for fewer propagation speeds than for the corresponding single waves. It reflects the interaction that monostable waves have over long distances. Our method relies on numerical range estimates, that imply time-uniform resolvent bounds.</description>

      <title>On a Cahn-Hilliard equation for the growth and division of chemically active droplets modeling protocells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard model with reaction terms can lead to situations in which no coarsening is taking place and, in contrast, growth and division of droplets occur which all do not grow larger than a certain size. This phenomenon has been suggested as a model for protocells, and a model based on the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation has been formulated. We introduce this equation and show the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Then formally matched asymptotic expansions are used to identify a sharp interface limit using a scaling of the reaction term which becomes singular when the interfacial thickness tends to zero. We compute planar solutions and study their stability under non-planar perturbations. Numerical computations for the suggested model are used to validate the sharp interface asymptotics. In addition, the numerical simulations show that the reaction terms lead to diverse phenomena such as growth and division of droplets in the obtained solutions, as well as the formation of shell-like structures.</description>

      <title>On the fractional diffusion for the linear Boltzmann equation with drift and general cross-section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the hydrodynamic limit for the linear Boltzmann equation, in the case of a heavy tail equilibrium and a cross section which depends on the space variable and which degenerates for large velocities, without symmetry assumptions. For an appropriate time scale, a macroscopic equation with an elliptic operator, which is equivalent to the fractional Laplacian, is obtained. This problem has been addressed in [Mellet, Mischler and Mouhot, ARMA, 2011] for a space-independent cross section, using a Fourier-Laplace transform, where a fractional diffusion equation has been obtained, and revisited in [Mellet, Indiana Univ., 2010] for a space-dependent but a bounded cross section, using the moments method by introducing an auxiliary problem. In this work, we will adapt the latter method to generalize both results.</description>

Abstract: Let X be a projective variety of complex dimension 3 with log terminal singularities. We prove that every singular Kahler metric on X with bounded Nash entropy and Ricci curvature bounded below induces a compact RCD space homeomorphic to the projective variety X itself. In particular, singular Kahler-Einstein spaces of complex dimension 3 with bounded Nash entropy are compact RCD spaces topologically and holomorphically equivalent to the underlying projective variety. Various compactness theorems are also obtained for 3-dimensional projective varieties with bounded Ricci curvature. Such results establish connections among algebraic, geometric and analytic structures of klt singularities from birational geometry and provide abundant examples of RCD spaces from algebraic geometry via complex Monge-Ampere equations.</description>

      <title>An end to end gluing construction for metrics of constant Q-curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We produce many new complete, constant Q-curvature metrics on finitely punctured spheres by gluing together known examples. In our construction we truncate one end of each summand and glue the two summands together "end-to-end," where we've truncated them. We use this construction to show that the unmarked moduli space of solutions with a fixed number of punctures is topologically nontrivial provided the number of punctures is at least four.</description>

      <title>Magnetization control problem for the 2D and 3D evolutionary Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the optimal control of the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation within confined domains in $\mathbb R^n$ for $n= 2, 3.$ We establish the existence of strong solutions for dimensions $n=1, 2, 3$ under suitable growth conditions on the control, and analyze the existence and uniqueness of regular solutions. We formulate the control problem in which only a fixed set of finite magnetic field coils can constitute the external magnetic field (control). We define a cost functional by aiming at minimizing the energy discrepancy between the evolving magnetic moment and the desired state. We demonstrate the existence of an optimal solution pair and employ the classical adjoint problem approach to derive a first-order necessary optimality condition. Given the non-convex nature of the optimal control problem, we derive a second-order sufficient optimality condition using a cone of critical directions. Finally, we prove two crucial results, namely, a global optimality condition and uniqueness of an optimal control.</description>

      <title>On the normal trace space of extended divergence-measure fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the normal trace space associated to extended (measure-valued) divergence-measure fields on the boundary of a set $E \subset \mathbb R^n$, as the Arens-Eells space $\mathrm{AE}(\partial E)$. Such a trace operator is constructed for any Borel set $E$, and under a mild regularity condition, which includes Lipschitz domains, this trace operator is shown to moreover be surjective. This relies in part on a new pointwise description of the Anzellotti pairing $\overline{\nabla \phi \cdot {\boldsymbol F}}$ between a $\mathrm{W}^{1,\infty}$ function $\phi$ and extended divergence-measure field ${\boldsymbol F}$. As an application, we prove extension theorems for divergence-measure fields and divergence-free measures. Results for $\mathrm{L}^1$-fields are also obtained.</description>

      <title>A fast Fourier spectral method for the linearized Boltzmann collision operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fast Fourier spectral method to compute linearized collision operators of the Boltzmann equation for variable hard-sphere gases. While the state-of-the-art method provides a computational cost O(MN^4 log N), with N being the number of modes in each direction and M being the number of quadrature points on a hemisphere, our method reduces the cost to O(N^4 log N), removing the factor M, which could be large in our numerical tests. The method is applied in a numerical solver for the steady-state Boltzmann equation with quadratic collision operators. Numerical experiments for both spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous Boltzmann equations have been carried out to test the accuracy and efficiency of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manifolds endowed with a parabolic geometry in the sense of Cartan come with natural sequences of differential operators and their analysis provide the so called (curved) BGG sequence of {\v C}ap, Slov{\'a}k and Sou{\v c}ek. The sequences involved do not form an elliptic complex in the sense of Atiyah but enjoy similar properties. The proper framework to study these operators is the filtered calculus associated to the natural filtration of the tangent bundle induced by the parabolic geometry. Such analysis was carried over by Dave and Haller in a very general setting. In this article we use their methods associated with the transversal index theory for filtered manifolds developped by the author in a previous paper to derive curved BGG sequences for foliated manifolds with transverse parabolic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model for quasistatic growth of cavities and cracks in two-dimensional nonlinear elasticity. Cavities and cracks are modeled as discrete and compact subsets of a planar domain, respectively, and deformations are defined only outside of cracks. The model accounts for the irreversibility of both processes of cavitation and fracture and it allows for the coalescence of cavities into cracks. Our main result shows the existence of quasistatic evolutions in the case of a finite number of cavities, under an a priori bound on the number of connected components of the cracks.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation by harmonic polynomials for solving the Dirichlet problem of Laplace's equation on a disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation in an open disk. The uniqueness of solutions is ensured by the well-known weak maximum principle. We introduce a novel approach to demonstrate the existence of a solution using harmonic polynomials that converge uniformly to a solution. Specifically, we rigorously derive the convergence rate of the harmonic polynomials and show that smoother boundary data and proximity of the target point to the disk's origin accelerate the convergence. Additionally, we obtain uniform estimates for the derivatives of solutions of arbitrary orders, controlled by $L^1$-boundary data. Notably, the constants in our estimates are significantly improved compared to existing results. Furthermore, we provide an enhanced radius of convergence for Taylor's series of the solution at each point in the open disk.</description>

      <title>The inverse obstacle problem for nonlinear inclusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Monotonocity Principle (MP), stating a monotonic relationship between a material property and a proper corresponding boundary operator, is attracting great interest in the field of inverse problems, because of its fundamental role in developing real time imaging methods. Moreover, under quite general assumptions, a MP for elliptic PDEs with nonlinear coefficients has been established. This MP provided the basis for introducing a new imaging method to deal with the inverse obstacle problem, in the presence of nonlinear anomalies. This constitutes a relevant novelty because there is a general lack of quantitative and physic based imaging method, when nonlinearities are present. The introduction of a MP based imaging method poses a set of fundamental questions regarding the performance of the method in the presence of noise. The main contribution of this work is focused on theoretical aspects and consists in proving that (i) the imaging method is stable and robust with respect to the noise, (ii) the reconstruction approaches monotonically to a well-defined limit, as the noise level approaches to zero, and that (iii) the limit contains the unknown set and is contained in the outer boundary of the unknown set. Results (i) and (ii) come directly from the Monotonicity Principle, while results (iii) requires to prove the so-called Converse of the Monotonicity Principle, a theoretical sults of fundamental relevance to evaluate the ideal (noise-free) performances of the imaging method. The results are provided in a quite general setting for Calder\`on problem, and proved for three wide classes where the nonlinearity of the anomaly can be either bounded from infinity and zero, or bounded from zero only, or bounded by infinity only. These classes of constitutive relationships cover the wide majority of cases encountered in applications.</description>

Abstract: We study the \emph{complex-valued} solutions to the Cauchy problem of the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation on the real line. To study the low-regularity problems, we employ a generalized Fourier-Lebesgue space $\widehat{M}^{s}_{r,q}(\mathbb{R})$ that unifies the modulation spaces and the Fourier-Lebesgue spaces. We then prove sharp local well-posedness results in this space by perturbation arguments using $X^{s,b}$-type spaces. Our results improve the previous one in \cite{GV}.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with $L^2$-critical nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and we look for normalized solutions $(\mu,u)\in {\bf R}\times H^1({\bf R}^N)$ for a given $m&gt;0$ and $N\geq 2$
  \[ -\Delta u + \mu u = g(u)\quad \text{in}\ {\bf R}^N, \qquad
  \frac{1}{2}\int_{{\bf R}^N} u^2 dx = m.
  \] We assume that $g$ has an $L^2$-critical growth, both at the origin and at infinity. That is, for $p=1+\frac{4}{N}$, $g(s)=|s|^{p-1}s +h(s)$, $h(s)=o(|s|^p)$ as $s\sim 0$ and $s\sim\infty$. The $L^2$-critical exponent $p$ is very special for this problem; in the power case $g(s) = |s|^{p-1}s$ a solution exists only for the specific mass $m=m_1$, where $m_1=\frac{1}{2}\int_{{\bf R}^N}\omega_1^2\, dx$ is the mass of a least energy solution $\omega_1$ of $-\Delta \omega+\omega=\omega^p$ in ${\bf R}^N$.
  We prove the existence of a positive solution for $m=m_1$ when $h$ has a sublinear growth at infinity, i.e., $h(s)=o(s)$ as $s\sim\infty$. In contrast, we show non-existence results for $h(s)\not=o(s)$ ($s\sim 0$) under a suitable monotonicity condition.</description>

Furthermore, we demonstrate that this equation defines an infinite-dimensional dynamical system, which possesses a global attractor in $H^{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^n)$.</description>

      <title>Sharp lifespan estimates for semilinear fractional evolution equations with critical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider semilinear wave equation and other second order $\sigma$-evolution equations with different (effective or non-effective) damping mechanisms driven by fractional Laplace operators; in particular, the nonlinear term is the product of a power nonlinearity $|u|^p$ with the critical exponent $p=p_{\mathrm{c}}(n)$ and a modulus of continuity $\mu(|u|)$. We derive a critical condition on the nonlinearity by proving a global in time existence result under the Dini condition on $\mu$ and a blow-up result when $\mu$ does not satisfy the Dini condition. Especially, in this latter case we determine new sharp estimates for the lifespan of local solutions, obtaining coincident upper and lower bounds of the lifespan. In particular, we derive a new sharp estimate for the wave equation with structural damping and classical power nonlinearity $|u|^p$ in the critical case $p=p_c(n)$, not yet determined in previous literature. The proof of the blow-up results and the upper bound estimates of the lifespan require the introduction of new test functions which allows to overcome some new difficulties due to the presence of both non-local differential operators and general nonlinearities.</description>

Abstract: This work establishes the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the fractional diffusion equation $$\frac{\partial^\alpha u}{\partial t^{\alpha}} + K(-\Delta)^{\beta} u - \nabla \cdot (\nabla V u) = f$$ on a $d$-dimensional torus, subject to sufficient conditions on the input parameters. The focus is on fractional orders $\alpha$ and $\beta$ less than 1. The strategy uses a Galerkin method and focuses on the additional complexity that comes from the fractional-order derivatives. Additional Sobolev regularity of the solution is shown. The spectral approach to the existence proof suggests an algorithm to compute explicit solutions numerically, and the regularity results are used to support a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed numerical scheme.</description>

      <title>Sharp stability for critical points of the Sobolev inequality in the absence of bubbling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When $u$ is close to a single Talenti bubble $v$ of the $p$-Sobolev inequality, we show that
  \begin{equation*}
  \|Du-Dv\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)}^{\max\{1,p-1\}}\le C \|-{\rm div}(|Du|^{p-2}Du)-|u|^{p^*-2}u\|_{W^{-1,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)}, \end{equation*} where $C=C(n,p)&gt;0$. This estimate provides a sharp stability estimate for the Struwe-type decomposition in the single bubble case, generalizing the result of Ciraolo, Figalli, and Maggi \cite{CFM2018} (focusing on the case $p=2$) to the arbitrary $p$. Also, in the Sobolev setting, this answers an open problem raised by Zhou and Zou in \cite[Remark 1.17]{ZZ2023}.</description>

We allow the equation coefficients and data to be of distributional type or less regular, having in mind the Dirac delta function and its powers, and we prove that the problem is well-posed in the sense of the concept of very weak solutions. Moreover, we prove the uniqueness in an appropriate sense and the coherence of the very weak solution concept with classical theory.</description>

      <title>Carrot John domains in variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore carrot John domains within variational problems, dividing our examination into two distinct sections. The initial part is dedicated to establishing the lower semicontinuity of the (optimal) John constant concerning Hausdorff convergence for bounded John domains. This result holds promising implications for both shape optimization problems and Techm\"uller theory.
  In the subsequent section, we demonstrate that an unbounded open set satisfying the carrot John condition with a center at $\infty$, appearing in the Mumford-Shah problem, can be covered by a uniformly finite number of unbounded John domains (defined conventionally through cigars). These domains, in particular, support Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequalities.</description>

      <title>Weighted inequalities for sub-monotone functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a set of relations between several quite diverse types of weighted inequalities involving various integral operators and fairly general quasinorm-like functionals which we call sub-monotone. The main result enables one to solve a specific problem by transferring it to another one for which a solution is known. The main result is formulated in a rather surprising generality, involving previously unknown cases, and it works even for some nonlinear operators such as the geometric or harmonic mean operators. Proofs use only elementary means.</description>

      <title>Deep learning methods for stochastic Galerkin approximations of elliptic random PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers stochastic Galerkin approximations of linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with stochastic forcing terms and stochastic diffusion coefficients, that cannot be bounded uniformly away from zero and infinity. A traditional numerical method for solving the resulting high-dimensional coupled system of PDEs is replaced by deep learning techniques. In order to achieve this, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which typically operate on the strong residual of the PDE and can therefore be applied in a wide range of settings, are considered. As a second approach, the Deep Ritz method, which is a neural network that minimizes the Ritz energy functional to find the weak solution, is employed. While the second approach only works in special cases, it overcomes the necessity of testing in variational problems while maintaining mathematical rigor and ensuring the existence of a unique solution. Furthermore, the residual is of a lower differentiation order, reducing the training cost considerably. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on several model problems.</description>
