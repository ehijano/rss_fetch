      <title>Process Mining on Distributed Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major domains such as logistics, healthcare, and smart cities increasingly rely on sensor technologies and distributed infrastructures to monitor complex processes in real time. These developments are transforming the data landscape from discrete, structured records stored in centralized systems to continuous, fine-grained, and heterogeneous event streams collected across distributed environments. As a result, traditional process mining techniques, which assume centralized event logs from enterprise systems, are no longer sufficient. In this paper, we discuss the conceptual and methodological foundations for this emerging field. We identify three key shifts: from offline to online analysis, from centralized to distributed computing, and from event logs to sensor data. These shifts challenge traditional assumptions about process data and call for new approaches that integrate infrastructure, data, and user perspectives. To this end, we define a research agenda that addresses six interconnected fields, each spanning multiple system dimensions. We advocate a principled methodology grounded in algorithm engineering, combining formal modeling with empirical evaluation. This approach enables the development of scalable, privacy-aware, and user-centric process mining techniques suitable for distributed environments. Our synthesis provides a roadmap for advancing process mining beyond its classical setting, toward a more responsive and decentralized paradigm of process intelligence.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Edge-Cloud Continuum: A State-of-Practice Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The edge-cloud continuum has emerged as a transformative paradigm that meets the growing demand for low-latency, scalable, end-to-end service delivery by integrating decentralized edge resources with centralized cloud infrastructures. Driven by the exponential growth of IoT-generated data and the need for real-time responsiveness, this continuum features multi-layered architectures. However, its adoption is hindered by infrastructural challenges, fragmented standards, and limited guidance for developers and researchers. Existing surveys rarely tackle practical implementation or recent industrial advances. This survey closes those gaps from a developer-oriented perspective, introducing a conceptual framework for navigating the edge-cloud continuum. We systematically examine architectural models, performance metrics, and paradigms for computation, communication, and deployment, together with enabling technologies and widely used edge-to-cloud platforms. We also discuss real-world applications in smart cities, healthcare, and Industry 4.0, as well as tools for testing and experimentation. Drawing on academic research and practices of leading cloud providers, this survey serves as a practical guide for developers and a structured reference for researchers, while identifying open challenges and emerging trends that will shape the future of the continuum.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Online Event Downsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras capture scene changes asynchronously on a per-pixel basis, enabling extremely high temporal resolution. However, this advantage comes at the cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this, prior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed heuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead, we propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance through an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be arbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach operates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly from raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we introduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain usable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific adaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally important events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object classification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object detection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining performance under event-budget constraints.</description>

      <title>Zero-Energy RIS-Assisted Communications With Noise Modulation and Interference-Based Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To advance towards carbon-neutrality and improve the limited {performance} of conventional passive wireless communications, in this paper, we investigate the integration of noise modulation with zero-energy reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In particular, the RIS reconfigurable elements (REs) are divided into two groups: one for beamforming the desired signals in reflection mode and another for harvesting energy from interference signals in an absorption mode, providing the power required for RIS operation. Since the harvested energy is a random variable, a random number of REs can beamform the signals, while the remainder blindly reflects them. We present a closed-form solution and a search algorithm for REs allocation, jointly optimizing both the energy harvesting (EH) and communication performance. Considering the repetition coding technique and discrete phase shifts, we derive analytical expressions for the energy constrained success rate, bit error rate, optimal threshold, mutual information, {and energy efficiency}. Numerical and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm and expressions, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed integration over conventional noise-modulation systems. It is shown that by properly allocating the REs, both the EH and communication performance can be improved in low to moderate interference scenarios, while the latter is restricted in the high-interference regime.</description>

      <title>Stacking the Odds: Full-Stack Quantum System Design Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design space exploration (DSE) plays an important role in optimising quantum circuit execution by systematically evaluating different configurations of compilation strategies and hardware settings. In this work, we study the impact of layout methods, qubit routing techniques, compiler optimization levels, and hardware-specific properties, including noise characteristics, topological structures, connectivity densities, and device sizes. By traversing these dimensions, we aim to understand how compilation choices interact with hardware features. A central question in our study is whether carefully selected device parameters and mapping strategies, including initial layouts and routing heuristics, can mitigate hardware-induced errors beyond standard error mitigation methods. Our results show that choosing the right software strategies (e.g., layout and routing) and tailoring hardware properties (e.g., reducing noise or leveraging connectivity) significantly enhances the fidelity of quantum circuit executions. We provide performance estimates using metrics such as circuit depth, gate count, and expected fidelity. These findings highlight the value of hardware-software co-design, especially as quantum systems scale and move toward error-corrected computing. Our simulations, though noisy, include quantum error correction (QEC) scenarios, revealing similar sensitivities to layout and connectivity. This suggests that co-design principles will be vital for integrating QEC in future devices. Overall, we offer practical guidance for co-optimizing mapping, routing, and hardware configuration in real-world quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Evolving Hard Maximum Cut Instances for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, such as the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), have become increasingly popular, offering promising avenues for employing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices to address challenging combinatorial optimization tasks like the maximum cut problem. In this study, we utilize an evolutionary algorithm equipped with a unique fitness function. This approach targets hard maximum cut instances within the latent space of a Graph Autoencoder, identifying those that pose significant challenges or are particularly tractable for RQAOA, in contrast to the classic Goemans and Williamson algorithm. Our findings not only delineate the distinct capabilities and limitations of each algorithm but also expand our understanding of RQAOA's operational limits. Furthermore, the diverse set of graphs we have generated serves as a crucial benchmarking asset, emphasizing the need for more advanced algorithms to tackle combinatorial optimization challenges. Additionally, our results pave the way for new avenues in graph generation research, offering exciting opportunities for future explorations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Connectivity for Ising Machines: Dense to Sparse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, hardware implementations of Ising machines have emerged as a viable alternative to quantum computing for solving hard optimization problems among other applications. Unlike quantum hardware, dense connectivity can be achieved in classical systems. However, we show that dense connectivity leads to severe frequency slowdowns and interconnect congestion scaling unfavorably with system sizes. As a scalable solution, we propose a systematic sparsification method for dense graphs by introducing copy nodes to limit the number of neighbors per graph node. In addition to solving interconnect congestion, this approach enables constant frequency scaling where all spins in a network can be updated in constant time. On the other hand, sparsification introduces new difficulties, such as constraint-breaking between copied spins and increased convergence times to solve optimization problems, especially if exact ground states are sought. Relaxing the exact solution requirements, we find that the overheads in convergence times are milder. We demonstrate these ideas by designing probabilistic bit Ising machines using ASAP7 (a predictive 7nm FinFET technology model) process design kits as well as Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based implementations. Finally, we show how formulating problems in naturally sparse networks (e.g., by invertible logic) sidesteps challenges introduced by sparsification methods. Our results are applicable to a broad family of Ising machines using different hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic in-memory computing using magnetic topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have been proven effective for essential quantum computation tasks such as quantum error correction and quantum control. Efficient hardware implementation of these algorithms at cryogenic temperatures is essential. Here, we utilize magnetic topological insulators as memristors (termed magnetic topological memristors) and introduce a cryogenic in-memory computing scheme based on the coexistence of the chiral edge state and the topological surface state. The memristive switching and reading of the giant anomalous Hall effect exhibit high energy efficiency, high stability, and low stochasticity. We achieve high accuracy in a proof-of-concept classification task using four magnetic topological memristors. Furthermore, our algorithm-level and circuit-level simulations of large-scale neural networks demonstrate software-level accuracy and lower energy consumption for image recognition and quantum state preparation compared with existing magnetic memristor and CMOS technologies. Our results not only showcase a new application of chiral edge states but also may inspire further topological quantum physics-based novel computing schemes.</description>

      <title>Student Perspectives on the Benefits and Risks of AI in Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of chatbots equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) in educational settings has increased in recent years, showing potential to support teaching and learning. However, the adoption of these technologies has raised concerns about their impact on academic integrity, students' ability to problem-solve independently, and potential underlying biases. To better understand students' perspectives and experiences with these tools, a survey was conducted at a large public university in the United States. Through thematic analysis, 262 undergraduate students' responses regarding their perceived benefits and risks of AI chatbots in education were identified and categorized into themes.
  The results discuss several benefits identified by the students, with feedback and study support, instruction capabilities, and access to information being the most cited. Their primary concerns included risks to academic integrity, accuracy of information, loss of critical thinking skills, the potential development of overreliance, and ethical considerations such as data privacy, system bias, environmental impact, and preservation of human elements in education.
  While student perceptions align with previously discussed benefits and risks of AI in education, they show heightened concerns about distinguishing between human and AI generated work - particularly in cases where authentic work is flagged as AI-generated. To address students' concerns, institutions can establish clear policies regarding AI use and develop curriculum around AI literacy. With these in place, practitioners can effectively develop and implement educational systems that leverage AI's potential in areas such as immediate feedback and personalized learning support. This approach can enhance the quality of students' educational experiences while preserving the integrity of the learning process with AI.</description>

      <title>X-Driver: Explainable Autonomous Driving with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has advanced significantly, offering benefits such as system simplicity and stronger driving performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings than conventional pipelines. However, existing frameworks still suffer from low success rates in closed-loop evaluations, highlighting their limitations in real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce X-Driver, a unified multi-modal large language models(MLLMs) framework designed for closed-loop autonomous driving, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and autoregressive modeling to enhance perception and decision-making. We validate X-Driver across multiple autonomous driving tasks using public benchmarks in CARLA simulation environment, including Bench2Drive[6]. Our experimental results demonstrate superior closed-loop performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) while improving the interpretability of driving decisions. These findings underscore the importance of structured reasoning in end-to-end driving and establish X-Driver as a strong baseline for future research in closed-loop autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of Transaction Conflicts in Ethereum and Solana for Parallel Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of historical data across two popular blockchain networks: Ethereum and Solana. Our study focuses on two key aspects: transaction conflicts and the maximum theoretical parallelism within historical blocks. We aim to quantify the degree of transaction parallelism and assess how effectively it can be exploited by systematically examining block-level characteristics, both within individual blocks and across different historical periods. In particular, this study is the first of its kind to leverage historical transactional workloads to evaluate transactional conflict patterns. By offering a structured approach to analyzing these conflicts, our research provides valuable insights and an empirical basis for developing more efficient parallel execution techniques for smart contracts in the Ethereum and Solana virtual machines. Our empirical analysis reveals that historical Ethereum blocks frequently achieve high independence, over 50\% in more than 50\% of blocks, while Solana historical blocks contain longer conflict chains, comprising $\sim$59\% of the block size compared to $\sim$18\% in Ethereum, reflecting fundamentally different parallel execution dynamics.</description>
