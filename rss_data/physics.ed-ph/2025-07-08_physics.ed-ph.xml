      <title>Computational thinking in the teaching of Stellar Astrophysics: Analysis 4 from a teaching intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study designs, implements, and evaluates a teaching strategy based on computational thinking (CT) 27 to strengthen the teaching of stellar astrophysics in secondary education. Thirty-one 11th-grade students 28 from the Escuela Normal Superior Leonor \'Alvarez Pinz\'on (Tunja, Colombia) were worked with using an 29 action research approach. The methodology combined documentary analysis and practical application 30 through a teaching sequence of four workshops, integrating CT skills such as abstraction, decomposition, 31 and algorithmic thinking in experimental activities and computational modeling. The evaluation, based on 32 rubrics and performance matrices, showed improvements in the structuring of thinking and conceptual 33 understanding of astrophysical phenomena. The results suggest that CP facilitates the teaching of physics 34 by promoting active and structured learning. It is recommended that the strategy be replicated in different 35 educational contexts to validate its applicability and optimize its impact.</description>

      <title>NotebookLM: An LLM with RAG for active learning and collaborative tutoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores NotebookLM, a Google Gemini powered AI platform that integrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as a collaborative physics tutor, an area of research that is developing quickly. In our implementation, NotebookLM was configured as an AI physics collaborative tutor to support students in solving conceptually oriented physics problems using a collaborative, Socratic approach. When deployed as a collaborative tutor, the system restricts student interaction to a chat only interface, promoting controlled and guided engagement. By grounding its responses in teacher provided source documents, NotebookLM helps mitigate one of the major shortcomings of standard large language models--hallucinations--thereby ensuring more traceable and reliable answers. Our experiments demonstrate NotebookLM's potential as a low cost, easily implemented RAG based tool for personalized and traceable AI assisted physics learning in diverse educational settings. Furthermore, NotebookLM also functions as a valuable study tool for both teachers and students by generating targeted questions, study guides, and supplementary materials that enhance both classroom instruction and independent research. While limitations remain, particularly regarding legal restrictions, the current text only mode of interaction, and the intrinsic reliability challenges of statistical models, this work presents a promising example of a grounded AI application in physics education.</description>
