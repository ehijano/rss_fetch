      <title>Johnson homomorphisms and the second rational cohomology of handlebody Torelli groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two Torelli subgroups of the handlebody group. The group $HI_{g,p}^b$ is the subgroup of the handlebody group acting trivially on the first homology of the boundary surface, and $H_B I_{g,p}^b$ is the subgroup of the handlebody group acting trivially on the first homology of the handlebody. Using the symplectic representation and the Johnson homomorphisms for the Torelli subgroups of the mapping class group and of $\operatorname{Aut}(F_g)$, we define abelian quotients of these handlebody Torelli groups. In terms of the representation theory of the special linear group, we describe cup products of two classes in the first rational cohomology groups of $HI_{g,p}^b$ and $H_B I_{g,p}^b$ obtained by the rational duals of these abelian quotients.</description>

      <title>A trace pairing and Elliott invariant for groupoid homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an \'{e}tale groupoid, we define a pairing between the Crainic-Moerdijk groupoid homology and the simplex of invariant Borel probability measures on the base space. The main novelty here is that the groupoid need not have totally disconnected base space, and thus the pairing can give more refined information than the measures of clopen subsets of the base space.
  Our principal motivation is $C^*$-algebra theory. The Elliott invariant of a $C^*$-algebra is defined in terms of $K$-theory and traces; it is fundamental in the long-running program to classify simple $C^*$-algebras (satisfying additional necessary conditions). We use our pairing to define a groupoid Elliott invariant, and show that for many interesting groupoids it agrees with the $C^*$-algebraic Elliott invariant of the groupoid $C^*$-algebra: this includes irrational rotation algebras and the $C^*$-algebras arising from orbit breaking constructions studied by the first listed author, Putnam, and Strung. These results can be thought of as establishing a refinement of Matui's HK conjecture for the relevant groupoids.</description>

      <title>G-kernels and Crossed Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework based on topological crossed modules for various lifting obstructions for $\Gamma$-kernels. It allows us to identify actions, cocycle actions and $\Gamma$-kernels up to their natural equivalence relations with cohomology sets. The obstructions then appear as boundary maps in corresponding exact sequences. Since topological crossed modules are topological $2$-groups (in the categorical sense), they have classifying spaces, which come with a natural transformation from the cohomology to a homotopy set. For the crossed module that gives cocycle actions we prove a weak equivalence of the classifying space of the crossed module with one from bundle theory. In case the algebra is strongly self-absorbing we show that the homotopy set is a group and that the above natural transformation is a group isomorphism on an appropriate restriction of the cohomology set.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence invariance of formal category theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a result of equivalence invariance of formal category theory for statements that can be expressed within an equipment. To do this, we exploit Henry and Bardomiano Mart\'inez's link between Makkai's FOLDS (first order logic with dependent sorts) and abstract homotopy theory. In the process, we construct a model structure on the category DblCat of double categories and double functors, whose trivial fibrations are the double functors that are surjective on objects, full on horizontal and vertical morphisms, and fully faithful on squares, and whose fibrant objects are the equipments.</description>

      <title>Expected Complexity of Persistence Barcode Computation via Matrix Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02125v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic complexity of computing the persistence barcode of a randomly generated filtration. We provide a general technique to bound the expected complexity of reducing the boundary matrix in terms of the density of its reduced form. We apply this technique finding upper bounds for the average fill-in (number of non-zero entries) of the boundary matrix on \v{C}ech, Vietoris--Rips and Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi filtrations after matrix reduction, thus obtaining bounds on the expected complexity of the barcode computation. Our method is based on previous results on the expected Betti numbers of the corresponding complexes. Our fill-in bounds for \v{C}ech and Vietoris--Rips complexes are asymptotically tight up to a logarithmic factor. In particular, both our fill-in and computation bounds are better than the worst-case estimates. We also provide an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi filtration realising the worst-case fill-in and computation.</description>

      <title>Higher Segal spaces and partial groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The d-Segal conditions of Dyckerhoff and Kapranov are exactness properties for simplicial objects based on the geometry of cyclic polytopes in d-dimensional Euclidean space. 2-Segal spaces are also known as decomposition spaces, and most activity has focused on this case. We study the interplay of these conditions with the partial groups of Chermak, a class of symmetric simplicial sets. The d-Segal conditions simplify for symmetric simplicial objects, and take a particularly explicit form for partial groups. We show partial groups provide a rich class of d-Segal sets for d &gt; 2, by undertaking a systematic study of the "degree" of a partial group X, namely the smallest nonnegative integer k such that X is 2k-Segal. We develop effective tools to explicitly compute the degree based on the discrete geometry of actions of partial groups, which we define and study. Applying these tools involves solving Helly-type problems for abstract closure spaces. We carry out degree computations in concrete settings, including for the punctured Weyl groups introduced here, where we find that the degree is closely related to the maximal dimension of an abelian subalgebra of the associated semisimple Lie algebra.</description>
