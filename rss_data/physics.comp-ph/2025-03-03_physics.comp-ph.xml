      <title>Ultrafast Heterogeneous Melting of Metals under Extreme Non-equilibrium States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme electron-ion nonequilibrium states created by ultrafast laser excitation challenge conventional melting paradigms. Through neural network-enhanced multiscale simulations of tungsten and gold nanofilms, we identify electronic pressure relaxation as a critical driver of heterogeneous phase transformations. Subpicosecond uniaxial expansion generates density decrease that enable surface-initiated melting far below equilibrium melting temperatures. This ultrafast heterogeneous melting propagates at 2500 m/s-tenfold faster than thermal mechanisms-with characteristic stationary diffraction peak splitting distinguishing it from thermal expansion dynamics. While tungsten shows pressure-driven solid-solid transitions, gold exhibits complete room-temperature amorphization under electronic stress. These results establish hot-electron-mediated lattice destabilization as a universal pathway for laser-induced structural transformations, providing new insights for interpreting time-resolved experiments and controlling laser-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Long-Range Interactions via the Multipole Expansion into Ground and Excited-State Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating long-range interactions remains a significant challenge for molecular machine learning potentials due to the need to accurately capture interactions over large spatial regions. In this work, we introduce FieldMACE, an extension of the message-passing atomic cluster expansion (MACE) architecture that integrates the multipole expansion to model long-range interactions more efficiently. By incorporating the multipole expansion, FieldMACE effectively captures environmental and long-range effects in both ground and excited states. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate its superior performance in predictions and computational efficiency compared to previous architectures, as well as its ability to accurately simulate nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics. Furthermore, transfer learning from foundational models enhances data efficiency, making FieldMACE a scalable, robust, and transferable framework for large-scale molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Advancing excited-state simulations for TADF emitters: An eXtended Tight-Binding framework for high-throughput screening and design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computationally efficient framework for predicting the excited-state properties of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, integrating extended tight-binding (\xtb), simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximation (\stda), and simplified time-dependent density functional theory (\stddft) methods. Benchmarking against Tamm-Dancoff approximation (noted full \tda) demonstrates that this approach accurately captures key photophysical properties, including singlet-triplet energy gaps, excitation energies, and fluorescence spectra, in both vacuum and solvent environments, while achieving over 99\% reduction in computational cost. We analyze a series of representative TADF emitters, revealing a strong correlation between the torsional angle between donor and acceptor units and the solvent-induced redshift in the emission spectrum. This work highlights the potential of semi-empirical methods for high-throughput screening of TADF materials and provides valuable insights for designing next-generation optoelectronic devices. The multi-objective function is one of a kind, and it further enhances our results with an original solution. While acknowledging the limitations of semi-empirical methods for highly complex systems, we outline promising future directions, including hybrid computational approaches and integration with machine learning techniques, to further improve predictive accuracy and accelerate the discovery of advanced functional materials.</description>

      <title>Variational Transformer Ansatz for the Density Operator of Steady States in Dissipative Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformer architecture, known for capturing long-range dependencies and intricate patterns, has extended beyond natural language processing. Recently, it has attracted significant attention in quantum information and condensed matter physics. In this work, we propose the transformer density operator ansatz for determining the steady states of dissipative quantum many-body systems. By vectorizing the density operator as a many-body state in a doubled Hilbert space, the transformer encodes the amplitude and phase of the state's coefficients, with its parameters serving as variational variables. Our design preserves translation invariance while leveraging attention mechanisms to capture diverse long-range correlations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerically calculating the steady states of dissipative Ising and Heisenberg spin chain models, showing that our method achieves excellent accuracy in predicting steady states.</description>

      <title>PFD: Automatically Generating Machine Learning Force Fields from Universal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal force fields generalizable across the periodic table represent a new trend in computational materials science. However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD, which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences.</description>

      <title>Kinetic energy density functional based on electron distribution on the energy coordinate to describe covalent bond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of kinetic energy functional (KEF) is known as one of the most difficult subjects in the electronic density functional theory (DFT). In particular, the sound description of chemical bonds using a KEF is a matter of great significance in the field of theoretical physics and chemistry. It can be readily confirmed that the famous Thomas-Fermi (TF) model or the TF model corrected with a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) fails to realize the bound state of a covalent bond in general. In this work, a new kinetic energy functional is developed on the basis of the novel density functional theory (J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 51, 055102, 2018) that utilizes the electron distribution on the energy coordinate as the fundamental variable. It is demonstrated for an H$_2$ molecule that the bound state can be realized by the KEF by virtue of the property of the electron density on the energy coordinate. The mechanism underlying the formation of the bound state is the same as that for the realization of the static correlation in the exchange energy described with the new DFT. We also developed a method termed potential gradient method to make a correction to the TF model instead of the GGA approach.</description>

      <title>Parametric-ROM of Structures with Varying Geometry using Direct Parameterization of Invariant Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for parametric reduction in FEM, where geometry is controlled by a parameter without altering material properties or stress states. The inverse determinant in the weak form is expanded as a power series, with explicit expressions for the zeroth and first-order terms. External forcing and parameter dependence are incorporated into an enlarged autonomous system, reduced via the direct parameterization of invariant manifolds method and homological equations. The parameter is treated as an additional variable with trivial dynamics, isolated for inclusion in the ROM. This approach enables efficient parametric studies and advances reduced-order modeling in structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Granular Material Flow: Discrete Element Method and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare two widely used Lagrangian approaches for modeling granular materials: the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). DEM models individual particle interactions, while SPH treats granular materials as a continuum using constitutive rheological models. In particular, we employ the Drucker Prager viscoplastic model for SPH. By examining key parameters unique to each method, such as the coefficient of restitution in DEM and the dilatancy angle in SPH, we assess their influence on two dimensional soil collapse predictions against experimental results. While DEM requires computationally expensive parameter calibration, SPH benefits from a continuum scale rheological model, allowing most parameters to be directly determined from laboratory measurements and requiring significantly fewer particles. However, despite its computational efficiency, viscoplastic SPH struggles to capture complex granular flow behaviors observed in DEM, particularly in rotating drum simulations. In contrast, DEM offers greater versatility, accommodating a broader range of flow patterns while maintaining a relatively simple model formulation. These findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each method, aiding the selection of appropriate modeling techniques for granular flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Raman Signatures of Single Point Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Quantum Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point defects in solid-state quantum systems are vital for enabling single-photon emission at specific wavelengths, making their precise identification essential for advancing applications in quantum technologies. However, pinpointing the microscopic origins of these defects remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Raman spectroscopy as a robust strategy for defect identification. Using density functional theory, we systematically characterize the Raman signatures of 100 defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spanning periodic groups III to VI, encompassing around 30,000 phonon modes. Our findings reveal that the local atomic environment plays a pivotal role in shaping the Raman lineshape, enabling the narrowing of potential defect candidates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can differentiate defects based on their spin and charge states as well as strain-induced variations, implying the versatility of this approach. Therefore, this study not only provides a comprehensive theoretical database of Raman spectra for hBN defects but also establishes a novel experiment framework for using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to identify point defects. More broadly, our approach offers a universal method for defect identification in any quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Flexible Tuning of Asymmetric Near-field Radiative Thermal Transistor by Utilizing Distinct Phase Change Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) play a pivotal role in the development of advanced thermal devices due to their reversible phase transitions, which drastically modify their thermal and optical properties. In this study, we present an effective dynamic thermal transistor with an asymmetric design that employs distinct PCMs, vanadium dioxide (VO2) and germanium antimony telluride (GST), on either side of the gate terminal, which is the center of the control unit of the near-field thermal transistor. This asymmetry introduces unique thermal modulation capabilities, taking control of thermal radiation in the near-field regime. VO2 transitions from an insulating to a metallic state, while GST undergoes a reversible switch between amorphous (aGST) and crystalline (cGST) phases, each inducing substantial changes in thermal transport properties. By strategically combining these materials, the transistor exhibits enhanced functionality, dynamically switching between states of absorbing and releasing heat by tuning the temperature of gate. This gate terminal not only enables active and efficient thermal management but also provides effective opportunities for manipulating heat flow in radiative thermal circuits. Our findings highlight the potential of such asymmetrically structured thermal transistors in advancing applications across microelectronics, high-speed data processing, and sustainable energy systems, where precise and responsive thermal control is critical for performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Exactly energy-momentum-conserving stochastic differential equations and algorithms for nonlinear Landau-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coulomb collision is a fundamental diffusion process in plasmas that can be described by the Landau-Fokker-Planck (LFP) equation or the stochastic differential equation (SDE). While energy and momentum are conserved exactly in the LFP equation, they are conserved only on average by the conventional corresponding SDEs, suggesting that the underlying stochastic process may not be well-defined by such SDEs. In this study, we derive new SDEs with exact energy-momentum conservation for the Coulomb collision by factorizing the collective effect of field particles into individual particles and enforcing Newton's third law. These SDEs, when interpreted in the Stratonovich sense, have a particularly simple form that represents pure diffusion between particles without drag. Numerical algorithms that preserve discrete conservation laws are developed and benchmarked in various relaxation processes. Techniques to reduce computational complexity are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Monte Carlo Event Generation for Neutrino-Nucleus Exclusive Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions need to incorporate sophisticated nuclear models to achieve greater predictive precision. However, the computational complexity of these advanced models often limits their practicality for experimental analyses. To address this challenge, we introduce a new Monte Carlo method utilizing Normalizing Flows to generate surrogate cross sections that closely approximate those of the original model while significantly reducing computational overhead. As a case study, we built a Monte Carlo event generator for the neutrino-nucleus cross section model developed by the Ghent group. This model employs a Hartree-Fock procedure to establish a quantum mechanical framework in which both the bound and scattering nucleon states are solutions to the mean-field nuclear potential. The surrogate cross sections generated by our method demonstrate excellent accuracy with a relative effective sample size of more than $98.4 \%$, providing a computationally efficient alternative to traditional Monte Carlo sampling methods for differential cross sections.</description>

      <title>Computation of Magnetohydrodynamic Equilibria with Voigt Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first numerical investigation of using Voigt regularization as a method for obtaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria without the assumption of nested magnetic flux surfaces. Voigt regularization modifies the MHD dynamics by introducing additional terms that vanish in the infinite-time limit, allowing for magnetic reconnection and the formation of magnetic islands, which can overlap and produce field-line chaos. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through numerical solutions of two-dimensional ideal and resistive test problems. Our results show that Voigt regularization can significantly accelerate the convergence to solutions in resistive MHD problems, while also highlighting challenges in applying the method to ideal MHD systems. This research opens up new possibilities for developing more efficient and robust MHD equilibrium solvers, which could contribute to the design and optimization of future fusion devices.</description>
