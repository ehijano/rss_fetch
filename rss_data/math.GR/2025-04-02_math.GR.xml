      <title>Gromov's Conjecture for Product of Baumslag-Solitar groups and some other One-relator groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Baumslag-Solitar groups are virtually 2-avoidable, that is, they admit finite index subgroup whose first homology is devoid of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ summand. We also prove virtual 2-avoidability for some other classes of one-relator groups, which generalizes non-orientable surface groups. This along with result from a previous paper confirms Gromov's Conjecture about macroscopic dimension of universal cover of PSC manifolds, for all closed oriented spin manifolds whose fundamental group is product of Baumslag-Solitar groups, the one-relator groups under consideration.</description>

      <title>Stable reflection length in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce stable reflection length in Coxeter groups, as a way to study the asymptotic behaviour of reflection length. This creates connections to other well-studied stable length functions in groups, namely stable commutator length and stable torsion length. As an application, we give a complete characterisation of elements whose reflection length is unbounded on powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of finitely generated infinite periodic groups. The basic example is a 2-group, called the tetrahedron group. We generalize the construction by suggesting a family of infinite finitely generated dice groups. We provide weak conditions under which dice groups are periodic, where orders of elements are products involving finitely many given primes.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric stability of the Brunn--Minkowski inequality in compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a stability result for the recently established Brunn--Minkowski inequality in compact simple Lie groups. Namely, we prove that if two compact subsets $A, B$ of a compact simple Lie group $G$ satisfy
  $$ \mu(AB)^{1/d'} \leq (1 + \epsilon)\left(\mu(A)^{1/d'} + \mu(B)^{1/d'}\right)$$
  where $AB$ is the Minkowski product $\{ab : a \in A, b \in B\}$, $d'$ denotes the minimal codimension of a proper closed subgroup and $\mu$ is a Haar measure, then $A$ and $B$ must approximately look like neighbourhoods of a proper subgroup $H$ of codimension $d'$, with an error that depends quantitatively on $d', \epsilon$ and the ratio $\frac{\mu(A)}{\mu(B)}$. This result implies an improved error rate in the Brunn--Minkowski inequality in compact simple Lie groups
  $$\mu(AB)^{\frac{1}{d'}} \geq (1-C\mu(A)^{\frac{2}{d'}})\left(\mu(A)^{\frac{1}{d'}} + \mu(B)^{\frac{1}{d'}}\right) $$
  sharp, up to the constant $C$ which depends on $d'$ and $\frac{\mu(A)}{\mu(B)}$ alone.
  Our approach builds upon an earlier paper of the author proving the Brunn--Minkowski inequality, and stability in the case $A=B$. We employ a combinatorial multi-scale analysis and study so-called density functions. Additionally, the asymmetry between $A$ and $B$ introduces new challenges, requiring the use of non-abelian Fourier theory and stability results for the Pr\'ekopa--Leindler inequality.</description>

      <title>On finite groups whose power graphs satisfy certain connectivity conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a graph $\Gamma$. A set $ S $ of vertices in $\Gamma$ is called a {cyclic vertex cutset} of $\Gamma$ if $\Gamma - S$ is disconnected and has at least two components containing cycles. If $\Gamma$ has a cyclic vertex cutset, then it is said to be {cyclically separable}. The {cyclic vertex connectivity} is the minimum cardinality of a cyclic vertex cutset of $\Gamma$. The power graph $\mathcal{P}(G)$ of a group $G$ is the undirected simple graph with vertex set $G$ and two distinct vertices are adjacent if one of them is a positive power of the other. If $G$ is a cyclic, dihedral, or dicyclic group, we determine the order of $G$ such that $\mathcal{P}(G)$ is cyclically separable. Then we characterize the equality of vertex connectivity and cyclic vertex connectivity of $\mathcal{P}(G)$ in terms of the order of $G$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we determine all inequivalent irreducible rational matrix representations of groups of order $p^5$, where $p$ is an odd prime.

      <title>Subgroup induction property for branch groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.13310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subgroup induction property is a property of self-similar groups acting on rooted trees introduced by Grigorchuk and Wilson in 2003 that appears to have strong implications on the structure of the groups possessing it. It was for example used in the proof that the first Grigorchuk group as well as the Gupta-Sidki 3-group are subgroup separable (locally extended residually finite) or to describe their finitely generated subgroups as well as their weakly maximal subgroups. However, until now, there were only two known examples of groups with this property, namely the first Grigorchuk group and the Gupta-Sidki 3-group.
  The aim of this article is twofold. First, we investigate various consequences of the subgroup induction property for branch groups, a particularly interesting class of self-similar groups. Notably, we show that finitely generated branch groups with the subgroup induction property must be torsion, just infinite and subgroup separable, and we establish conditions under which all their maximal subgroups are of finite index and all their weakly maximal subgroups are closed in the profinite topology. Then, we show that every torsion GGS group has the subgroup induction property, hence providing the first infinite family of examples of groups with this property.</description>

      <title>Action of automorphisms of pure braid groups on homotopy groups of two-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the Moore complex of the Delta-group structure related to the pure braid groups and introduced by Berrick, Cohen, Wong, and Wu. We prove that the cycle and the boundary groups are invariant under all automorphisms of the pure braid groups, and thereby, we extend the results of Li and Wu on the reflection automorphism. We conclude that there is an induced action of all automorphisms of the pure braid groups on the homotopy groups of the two-sphere. Besides, we compute this action for a small number of strands.</description>

      <title>Twisted conjugacy in dihedral Artin groups I: Torus Knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an alternative solution to a result by Juh\'{a}sz that the twisted conjugacy problem for odd dihedral Artin groups is solvable, that is, groups with presentation $G(m) = \langle a,b \; | \; _{m}(a,b) = {}_{m}(b,a) \rangle$, where $m\geq 3$ is odd, and $_{m}(a,b)$ is the word $abab \dots$ of length $m$, is solvable. Our solution provides an implementable linear time algorithm, by considering an alternative group presentation to that of a torus knot group, and working with geodesic normal forms. An application of this result is that the conjugacy problem is solvable in extensions of odd dihedral Artin groups.</description>

      <title>Forbidden subgraphs on conjugacy class graphs of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01305v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. The \textit{commuting/nilpotent/solvable conjugacy class graph} ($\Gamma_{CCC}(G)$, $\Gamma_{NCC}(G)$, or $\Gamma_{SCC}(G)$) is a simple graph whose vertex set consists of all non-central conjugacy classes of $G$. Two vertices $x^G$ and $y^G$ are adjacent if and only if there exist elements $a \in x^G$ and $b \in y^G$ such that $\langle a, b \rangle$ forms an abelian, nilpotent, or solvable subgroup of $G$, respectively.\par
  In this paper, we mainly investigate cographs (it is $P_4$-free), chordal graphs (it is $C_n$-free $\forall \ n\ge 4$ ), split graphs (it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to $C_4,\ C_5$, and $2K_2$), threshold graphs (it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to $P_4$, $C_4,\ C_5$, and $2K_2$), and claw-free graphs (it contains no vertex with three pairwise non-adjacent neighbours) in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs in $\Gamma_{CCC}(G)$/ $\Gamma_{NCC}(G)$/$\Gamma_{SCC}(G)$.\par
  We provide a complete classification of these properties for EPPO groups, groups of order $pq$, and nilpotent groups. Additionally, we characterize the induced subgraphs in the commuting conjugacy class graph for symmetric and alternating groups. For solvable groups such as dihedral, dicyclic, and generalized dihedral groups, we establish complete results. Moreover, we fully characterize the graphs for the Mathieu groups $M_{11}$, $M_{12}$, and $M_{22}$, as well as certain minimal simple groups such as Suzuki groups and $\mathrm{PSL}(3,3)$. For other minimal simple groups, such as $\mathrm{PSL}(2,2^p)$, $\mathrm{PSL}(2,3^p)$, and $\mathrm{PSL}(2,p)$ (where $p &gt; 3$ and $5 \mid p^2 + 1$), we demonstrate that the solvable conjugacy class graph is always a cograph.
  Finally, we present several open problems, highlighting further directions for research in this area.</description>

      <title>Braid groups of J-reflection groups and associated classical and dual Garside structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The family of $J$-reflection groups can be seen as a combinatorial generalisation of irreducible rank two complex reflection groups and was introduced by the author in a previous article. In this article, we define the braid groups associated to $J$-reflection groups, which coincide with the complex braid group when the $J$-reflection group is finite. We show that the isomorphism type of the braid groups only depend on the reflection isomorphism types of the corresponding $J$-reflection groups. Moreover, we show that these braid groups are always abstractly isomorphic to circular groups. At the same time, we show that the center of the braid groups is cyclic and sent onto the center of the corresponding $J$-reflection groups under the natural quotient. Finally, we exhibit two Garside structures for each braid group of $J$-reflection group. These structures generalise the classical and dual Garside structures (when defined) of rank two irreducible complex reflection groups. In particular, the dual Garside structure of $J$-reflection groups provides candidates for dual monoids associated to the irreducible complex reflection groups of rank two which do not already have one.</description>

      <title>Generic Properties of Hitchin Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a split real form of a complex simple adjoint group whose Weyl group contains $-1$, let $\lambda$ be the Jordan projection of $G$, and let $S$ be a closed orientable surface of genus at least 2. For a $G$-Hitchin representation $\rho$, we define the set $J(\rho):=\{\lambda(\rho(x))\,|\,x\in\pi_1(S)\setminus \{1\}\}$. Choose any hyperplane $H$ in the maximal abelian subalgebra of the Lie algebra of $G$. Our main result shows that, for a generic $G$-Hitchin representation $\rho$, we have $J(\rho)\cap H=\emptyset$. As an application, we prove that generic orbifold Hitchin representations are strongly dense. This extends the result of Long, Reid, and Wolff for the Hitchin representations of surface groups. Our theorem also shows that the split real forms of many simple adjoint Lie groups contain strongly dense orbifold fundamental groups, partially generalizing the work of Breuillard, Guralnick, and Larsen.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a $k$-punctured, $k \geq 0$, closed connected orientable surface of genus $g \geq 2$. We show that the character variety of the $(Q^+, Q^-)$-Anosov irreducible representations, resp. the character variety of the $(P^+, P^-)$-Anosov Zariski dense representations of $\Gamma$ into $\SL(n , \C)$, $n \geq 2$, is a complex manifold of complex dimension \hbox{$(2g+k-2)(n^2-1)$}. For $\Gamma=\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$, we also show that these character varieties are holomorphic symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of links we call torus necklaces for which the link groups are precisely the braid groups of generalised $J$-reflection groups. Moreover, this correspondence exhibits the meridians of the aforementioned link groups as braid reflections. In particular, this construction generalises to all irreducible rank two complex reflection groups a well-known correspondence between some rank two complex braid groups and some torus knot groups. In addition, as abstract groups, we show that the family of link groups associated to Seifert links coincides with the family of circular groups. This shows that every time a link group has a non-trivial center, it is a Garside group.</description>
