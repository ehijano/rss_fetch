      <title>Robust optimal consumption, investment and reinsurance for recursive preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a robust optimal consumption, investment, and reinsurance problem for an insurer with Epstein-Zin recursive preferences operating under model uncertainty. The insurer's surplus follows the diffusion approximation of the Cram\'er-Lundberg model, and the insurer can purchase proportional reinsurance. Model ambiguity is characterised by a class of equivalent probability measures, and the insurer, being ambiguity-averse, aims to maximise utility under the worst-case scenario. By solving the associated coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE), we derive closed-form solutions for the optimal strategies and the value function. Our analysis reveals how ambiguity aversion, risk aversion, and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) influence the optimal policies. Numerical experiments illustrate the effects of key parameters, showing that optimal consumption decreases with higher risk aversion and EIS, while investment and reinsurance strategies are co-dependent on both financial and insurance market parameters, even without correlation. This study provides a comprehensive framework for insurers to manage capital allocation and risk transfer under deep uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Noise induced Stability of a Mean-Field model of Systemic Risk with uncertain robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model for systemic risk comprising of a system of diffusion processes, interacting through their empirical mean. Each process is subject to a confining double-well potential with some uncertainty in the coefficients, corresponding to fluctuations in height of the potential barrier seperating the two wells. This is equivalent to studying a single McKean-Vlasov SDE with explicit dependence on its moments and, novelly, independently varying additive and multiplicative noise. Such non-linear SDEs are known to possess two phases: stable (ordered) and unstable (disordered). When the potential is purely bistable, the phase changes from stable to unstable when noise intensity is increased past a critical threshold. With the recent advances, it will be shown that the behaviour here is far richer: indeed, depending on the interpretation of the stochastic integral, the system exhibits phase changes that cannot occur in any regime where there is no uncertainty in the potential. Strikingly, this allows for the phenomenon of noise induced stability; situations where more noise can reduce the risk of system failure.</description>

      <title>PELVE from a regulatory perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under Solvency II, the Value-at-Risk (VaR) is applied, although there is broad consensus that the Expected Shortfall (ES) constitutes a more appropriate measure. Moving towards ES would necessitate specifying the corresponding ES level. The recently introduced Probability Equivalent Level of VaR and ES (PELVE) determines this by requiring that ES equals the prescribed VaR for a given future payoff, reflecting the situation of an individual insurer. We incorporate the regulator's perspective by proposing PELVE-inspired methods for multiple insurers. We analyze existence and uniqueness of the resulting ES levels, derive expressions for elliptically distributed payoffs and establish limit results for multivariate regularly distributed payoffs. A case study highlights that the choice of method is crucial when payoffs arise from different distribution families. Moreover, we recommend specific methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal payoff under Bregman-Wasserstein divergence constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study optimal payoff choice for an expected utility maximizer under the constraint that their payoff is not allowed to deviate ``too much'' from a given benchmark. We solve this problem when the deviation is assessed via a Bregman-Wasserstein (BW) divergence, generated by a convex function $\phi$. Unlike the Wasserstein distance (i.e., when $\phi(x)=x^2$) the inherent asymmetry of the BW divergence makes it possible to penalize positive deviations different than negative ones. As a main contribution, we provide the optimal payoff in this setting. Numerical examples illustrate that the choice of $\phi$ allow to better align the payoff choice with the objectives of investors.</description>
