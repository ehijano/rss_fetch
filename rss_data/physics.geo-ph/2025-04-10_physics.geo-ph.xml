      <title>SeparationPINN: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Seismic P- and S-Wave Mode Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate separation of P- and S-waves is essential for multi-component seismic data processing, as it helps eliminate interference between wave modes during imaging or inversion, which leads to high-accuracy results. Traditional methods for separating P- and S-waves rely on the Christoffel equation to compute the polarization direction of the waves in the wavenumber domain, which is computationally expensive. Although machine learning has been employed to improve the computational efficiency of the separation process, most methods still require supervised learning with labeled data, which is often unavailable for field data. To address this limitation, we propose a wavefield separation technique based on the physics-informed neural network (PINN). This unsupervised machine learning approach is applicable to unlabeled data. Furthermore, the trained PINN model provides a mesh-free numerical solution that effectively captures wavefield features at multiple scales. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed PINN-based separation method can accurately separate P- and S-waves in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media.</description>

      <title>Is the atmospheric river operating at a self-organized criticality state?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are essential components of the global hydrological cycle, with profound implications for water resources, extreme weather events, and climate dynamics. Yet, the statistical organization and underlying physical mechanisms of AR intensity and evolution remain poorly understood. Here we apply methods from statistical physics to analyze the full life cycle of ARs and identify universal signatures of self-organized criticality (SOC). We demonstrate that AR morphology exhibits nontrivial fractal geometry, while AR event sizes, quantified via integrated water vapor transport, follow robust power-law distributions, displaying finite-size scaling. These scaling behaviors persist under warming scenarios, suggesting that ARs operate near a critical state as emergent, self-regulating systems. Concurrently, we observe a systematic poleward migration and intensification of ARs, linked to thermodynamic amplification and dynamical reorganization. Our findings establish a statistical physics framework for ARs, linking critical phenomena to the spatiotemporal structure of extreme events in a warming climate.</description>

      <title>A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Emulating Computationally Expensive Postfire Debris Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional physics-based models of geophysical flows, such as debris flows and landslides that pose significant risks to human lives and infrastructure are computationally expensive, limiting their utility for large-scale parameter sweeps, uncertainty quantification, inversions or real-time applications. This study presents an efficient alternative, a deep learning-based surrogate model built using a modified U-Net architecture to predict the dynamics of runoff-generated debris flows across diverse terrain based on data from physics based simulations. The study area is divided into smaller patches for localized predictions using a patch-predict-stitch methodology (complemented by limited global data to accelerate training). The patches are then combined to reconstruct spatially continuous flow maps, ensuring scalability for large domains. To enable fast training using limited expensive simulations, the deep learning model was trained on data from an ensemble of physics based simulations using parameters generated via Latin Hypercube Sampling and validated on unseen parameter sets and terrain, achieving maximum pointwise errors below 10% and robust generalization. Uncertainty quantification using Monte Carlo methods are enabled using the validated surrogate, which can facilitate probabilistic hazard assessments. This study highlights the potential of deep learning surrogates as powerful tools for geophysical flow analysis, enabling computationally efficient and reliable probabilistic hazard map predictions.</description>
