      <title>Building Network Digital Twins Part II: Real-Time Adaptive PID for Enhanced State Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we evolve towards more heterogeneous and cutting-edge mobile networks, Network Digital Twins (NDTs) are proving to be a promising paradigm in solving challenges faced by network operators, as they give a possibility of replicating the physical network operations and testing scenarios separately without interfering with the live network. However, with mobile networks becoming increasingly dynamic and heterogeneous due to massive device connectivity, replicating traffic and having NDTs synchronized in real-time with the physical network remains a challenge, thus necessitating the need to develop real-time adaptive mechanisms to bridge this gap. In this part II of our work, we implement a novel framework that integrates an adaptive Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to dynamically improve synchronization. Additionally, through an interactive user interface, results of our enhanced approach demonstrate an improvement in real-time traffic synchronization.</description>

      <title>Neurotremor: A wearable Supportive Device for Supporting Upper Limb Muscle Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sensor-fused wearable assistance prototype for upper-limb function (triceps brachii and extensor pollicis brevis) is presented. The device integrates surface electromyography (sEMG), an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and flex/force sensors on an M5StickC plus an ESP32-S3 compute hub. Signals are band-pass and notch filtered; features (RMS, MAV, zero-crossings, and 4-12 Hz tremor-band power) are computed in 250 ms windows and fed to an INT8 TensorFlow Lite Micro model. Control commands are bounded by a control-barrier-function safety envelope and delivered within game-based tasks with lightweight personalization. In a pilot technical feasibility evaluation with healthy volunteers (n = 12) performing three ADL-oriented tasks, tremor prominence decreased (Delta TI = -0.092, 95% CI [-0.102, -0.079]), range of motion increased (+12.65%, 95% CI [+8.43, +13.89]), repetitions rose (+2.99 min^-1, 95% CI [+2.61, +3.35]), and the EMG median-frequency slope became less negative (Delta = +0.100 Hz/min, 95% CI [+0.083, +0.127]). The sensing-to-assist loop ran at 100 Hz with 8.7 ms median on-device latency, 100% session completion, and 0 device-related adverse events. These results demonstrate technical feasibility of embedded, sensor-fused assistance for upper-limb function; formal patient studies under IRB oversight are planned.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Solving Sudoku Puzzles and the MaxCut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian -- incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability, and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.</description>

      <title>Toward Metaphor-Fluid Conversation Design for Voice User Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metaphors play a critical role in shaping user experiences with Voice User Interfaces (VUIs), yet existing designs often rely on static, human-centric metaphors that fail to adapt to diverse contexts and user needs. This paper introduces Metaphor-Fluid Design, a novel approach that dynamically adjusts metaphorical representations based on conversational use-contexts. We compare this approach to a Default VUI, which characterizes the present implementation of commercial VUIs commonly designed around the persona of an assistant, offering a uniform interaction style across contexts. In Study 1 (N=130), metaphors were mapped to four key use-contexts-commands, information seeking, sociality, and error recovery-along the dimensions of formality and hierarchy, revealing distinct preferences for task-specific metaphorical designs. Study 2 (N=91) evaluates a Metaphor-Fluid VUI against a Default VUI, showing that the Metaphor-Fluid VUI enhances perceived intention to adopt, enjoyment, and likability by aligning better with user expectations for different contexts. However, individual differences in metaphor preferences highlight the need for personalization. These findings challenge the one-size-fits-all paradigm of VUI design and demonstrate the potential of Metaphor-Fluid Design to create more adaptive and engaging human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>Privacy Risks and Preservation Methods in Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a pillar of Trustworthy AI and aims to bring transparency in complex models that are opaque by nature. Despite the benefits of incorporating explanations in models, an urgent need is found in addressing the privacy concerns of providing this additional information to end users. In this article, we conduct a scoping review of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy and explainability. Using the standard methodology for scoping review, we extracted 57 articles from 1,943 studies published from January 2019 to December 2024. The review addresses 3 research questions to present readers with more understanding of the topic: (1) what are the privacy risks of releasing explanations in AI systems? (2) what current methods have researchers employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems? (3) what constitutes a privacy preserving explanation? Based on the knowledge synthesized from the selected studies, we categorize the privacy risks and preservation methods in XAI and propose the characteristics of privacy preserving explanations to aid researchers and practitioners in understanding the requirements of XAI that is privacy compliant. Lastly, we identify the challenges in balancing privacy with other system desiderata and provide recommendations for achieving privacy preserving XAI. We expect that this review will shed light on the complex relationship of privacy and explainability, both being the fundamental principles of Trustworthy AI.</description>

      <title>Generative diffusion model surrogates for mechanistic agent-based biological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological systems.</description>
