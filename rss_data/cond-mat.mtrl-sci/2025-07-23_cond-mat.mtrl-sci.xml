      <title>Modifying electronic and structural properties of 2D van der Waals materials via cavity quantum vacuum fluctuations: A first-principles QEDFT study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structuring the photon density of states and light-matter coupling in optical cavities has emerged as a promising approach to modifying the equilibrium properties of materials through strong light-matter interactions. In this article, we employ state-of-the-art quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT) to study the modifications of the electronic and structural properties of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials by the cavity vacuum field fluctuations. We find that cavity photons modify the electronic density through localization along the photon polarization directions, a universal effect observed for all the 2D materials studied here. This modification of the electronic structure tunes the material properties, such as the shifting of energy valleys in monolayer h-BN and 2H-MoS$_2$, enabling tunable band gaps. Also, it tunes the interlayer spacing in bilayer 2H-MoS$_2$ and T$_\text{d}$-MoTe$_2$, allowing for adjustable ferroelectric, nonlinear Hall effect, and optical properties, as a function of light-matter coupling strength. Our findings open an avenue for engineering a broad range of 2D layered quantum materials by tuning vdW interactions through fluctuating cavity photon fields.</description>

      <title>Thermophysical and Mechanical Properties Prediction of Rear-earth High-entropy Pyrochlore Based on Deep-learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy pyrochlore oxides possess ultra-low thermal conductivity and excellent high-temperature phase stability, making them promising candidate for next-generation thermal barrier coating (TBC) materials. However, reliable predictive models for such complex and disordered systems remain challenging. Ab initio methods, although accurate in describing anharmonic phonon-phonon interactions, struggle to capture the strong inherent phonon-disorder scattering in high-entropy systems. Moreover, the limited simulation cell size, hundreds of atoms, cannot fully represent the configurational complexity of high-entropy phases. On the other hand, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations lack accurate and transferable interatomic potentials, particularly in multi-component systems like high-entropy ceramics. In this work, we employed Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics (DPMD) to predict the thermophysical and mechanical properties of rare-earth high-entropy pyrochlore oxide system. The deep-potential (DP) model is trained on a limited dataset from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations, enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with on-the-fly potential evaluations. This model not only achieves high accuracy in reproducing ab initio results but also demonstrates strong generalizability, making it applicable to medium-entropy ceramics containing the same constituent elements. Our study successfully develops a deep potential model for rare-earth pyrochlore systems and demonstrates that the deep-learning-based potential method offers a powerful computational approach for designing high-entropy TBC materials.</description>

      <title>A Novel Discovery of Negative Thermal Expansion in Rare-earth Pyrochlore through Anion Order-Disorder Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report for the first time the occurrence and investigation of the negative thermal expansion (NTE) effect in rare-earth pyrochlores. It is found that the NTE originates from the migration of oxygen anions from 48f sites to 8b sites, where one-twelfth of the original anions gradually occupy half of the available oxygen vacancies. This initial rapid transition leads to the distortion and rotation of polyhedral units, effectively contracting the lattice and manifesting as macroscopic NTE. The transition is sensitive to external isotropic pressure, where increasing pressure delays the onset of anion migration. This study deepens our understanding of NTE in complex oxides and demonstrates the utility of deep learning potentials for exploring intricate structural behaviors.</description>

      <title>Fast 4D-STEM-based phase mapping for amorphous and mixed materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All materials are made from atoms arranged either in repeating (crystalline) or in random (amorphous) structures. Diffraction measurements probe average distances between atoms and/or planes of atoms. A transmission electron microscope in scanning mode (STEM) can collect spatially resolved 2-dimensional diffraction data, effectively creating a 4-dimensional (4D) hyperspectral dataset (4D-STEM). Interpretation strategies for such 4D data are well-developed for crystalline materials, because their diffraction spectra show intense peaks, allowing for effective phase and crystal orientation mapping at the nanoscale. Yet, because of the continuous nature of the diffraction data for amorphous and mixed materials, it is challenging to separate different amorphous contributions. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) allows separation of 4D-STEM data into components with interpretable diffraction signatures and intensity maps, independent of the structure. However, NMF is a non-convex optimization problem and scales ~ O(nmk) with n the number of positions probed, m the number of diffraction features and k the number of components, making analysis of large 4D datasets inaccessible. Here, we apply QB decomposition as a preprocessing step for NMF (Randomized NMF or RNMF) to achieve scaling independent of the largest data dimension (~O(nk)), opening the door for NMF analysis of 4D-STEM data. We demonstrate our approach by mapping a thin TiO$_2$ layer on top of SiO$_2$, and a LiNi$_{0.6}$Co$_{0.2}$Mn$_{0.2}$O$_{2}$ (NMC) - Li$_{10}$GeP$_2$S$_{12}$ (LGPS) mixed crystalline-amorphous battery interface, illustrating strengths and limitations of using RNMF for structure-independent phase mapping in 4D-STEM experiments.</description>

      <title>Tunable spin-wave nonreciprocity in ferrimagnetic domain-wall channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonreciprocal propagation of spin waves (SWs) offers opportunities for developing novel functional magnonic logic devices, where controllability is crucial for magnetic signal processing. Domain walls act as natural waveguides due to their magnetic configuration, offering a platform for the in-depth investigation of nonreciprocal SW propagation and its manipulation. In this work, we theoretically and numerically investigate the tunable spin-wave nonreciprocity in ferrimagnetic domain-wall channels under the influence of an external field. It is revealed that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) exerts dual control over both nonreciprocal spin-wave propagation and spin-splitting phenomena. Moreover, SW nonreciprocity is magnetically tunable, with its sign reversibly switched by inverting the applied field direction, while preserving the host spin configuration. The orientation of the magnetic field can selectively stabilize or destabilize the domain wall structure, offering precise control over spin-wave nonreciprocity. Ultimately, we demonstrate a controllable SW transmission scheme via external magnetic field modulation, providing critical insights for the design of future magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and Weak Magnetism in the Insulating Distorted Perovskite Antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GdFeO$_3$-type perovskite antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$, calculated here to be altermagnetic for all three typical collinear antiferromagnetic orders, was suggested early on to be a Slater-type insulator, due in large part to its continuous metal-insulator transition and its small energy gap. Below the N\'eel temperature, the gap opens along with ``weak magnetism'', accompanied by a discontinuity in the magnetic susceptibility. Most other properties remain continuous. Without explicit correlation in the band structure calculation, and neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC), already a gap opens. Inclusion of a modest on-site Coulomb repulsion ($U\sim$ 1 eV) is sufficient to eliminate a SOC-induced small band overlap, reproducing the experimentally observed gap of several tens meV as reported earlier. This evidence supports the viewpoint that NaOsO$_3$ lies in an unusual crossover region between Slater and Mott insulator. The unreported altermagnetism in NaOsO$_3$ is demonstrated and its consequences are considered. The origin of the very weak magnetism has been investigated using a combination of {\it ab initio} calculations and symmetry analysis of the magnetic space group, confirming the origin lying in the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-orbit coupling buttressed by altermagnetic order. After determining the easy axis, our calculation leads to an Os spin canting angle of about 3$^{\circ}$, accounting for the observed weak magnetism and the resulting discontinuity in the susceptibility. The altermagnetism spin-split bands (up to $\sim$100 meV) result in a chiral-split magnon spectrum in both acoustic and optical modes in the THz range, and lead to significant anomalous Hall conductivity upon hole doping.</description>

      <title>Group-I lead oxide X2PbO3 (X=Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) glass-like materials for energy applications: A hybrid-DFT study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pb-based compounds have garnered considerable theoretical and experimental attention due to their promising potential in energy-related applications. In this study, we explore the glass-like alkali metal lead oxides X2PbO3 (X=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and assess their suitability for piezoelectric and thermoelectric applications. First-principles calculations were performed using hybrid density functional theory (DFT), incorporating B3LYP, HSE06, and PBE0 functionals. Among these, PBE0 is identified as the most accurate, yielding lattice parameters in close agreement with experimental data. Structural stability was confirmed through evaluation of thermal, mechanical, and formation energies. For the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase Cmc21-X2PbO3 (X=K, Rb, Cs), piezoelectric constants were computed via both the numerical Berry phase (BP) method and the analytical Coupled Perturbed Hartree-Fock/Kohn-Sham (CPHF/KS) formalism. Notably, Cs2PbO3 exhibited a piezoelectric coefficient of e33 = 0.60 C m-2 (CPHF/KS), while K2PbO3 showed e32 = -0.51 Cm-2 (BP). Thermoelectric properties were investigated using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory within the rigid band approximation. The calculated thermoelectric performance reveals promising figures of merit (ZT), ranging from 0.3 to 0.63, suggesting these materials are applicable as future thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Mechanically and electrically switchable triferroic altermagnet in a pentagonal FeO2 monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional multiferroics promise low-power, multifunctional devices, yet the intrinsic coexistence and mutual control of three coupled ferroic orders in a single layer remains elusive. Here, we identify pentagonal monolayer FeO$_2$ as an intrinsic triferroic altermagnet where ferroelectric (FE), ferroelastic (FA), and altermagnetic (AM) orders coexist and are tightly coupled, accompanied by a competing antiferroelectric (AFE) phase using first-principles calculations. The sole presence of glide mirror $M_x$ symmetry in a FeO$_2$ sublayer, with the breaking of four-fold rotation $C_{4z}$ symmetry, induces in-plane vector ferroelectricity and twin-related ferroelastic strains. Both FE and AFE phases break combined parity - time symmetry and display sizable altermagnetic spin splitting with N\'eel temperatures over 200~K. Electric-field-induced rotation of the FE polarization reverses the sign of the spin splitting, while in-plane uniaxial strain triggers ferroelastic switching that simultaneously rotates the FE polarization vector by $90^\circ$ and reverses the AM state. These electric-field- and strain-mediated pathways interlink six distinct polarization states that can be selected purely by electric fields and/or mechanical strain. This work extends intrinsic triferroicity to pentagonal monolayers and outlines a symmetry-based route toward mechanically and electrically configurable altermagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Role of temperature oscillation in growth of large-grain CdZnTe single crystal by traveling heater method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-nucleation in CdZnTe crystal growth remains a significant challenge, despite numerous attempts to achieve large-grain single crystals by restricting multi-nucleation during growth process using the traveling heater method. In this study, we present a novel approach to achieve large-grain CdZnTe single crystals by introducing temperature oscillations above the crystallization temperature during the growth process. This method effectively suppresses secondary nucleation and promotes the preferential selection of a single grain during early stage of growth as well as along the growth axis, by reducing multi-nucleation. By adjusting the amplitude and the number of temperature oscillations, we have successfully grown CdZnTe single crystals with dimensions of 20 mm in diameter and 60 mm in length. The resulting crystals exhibited excellent compositional homogeneity, with a nearly constant resistivity of ~ 10^9 Ohm-cm and Te inclusions smaller than 15 microns along the growth axis. Additionally, the crystal elements were of detector grade achieving an energy resolution of 4.5% for gamma radiation at 662 keV from a 137Cs source in a quasi-hemispherical geometry. This study highlights the critical role of temperature oscillations in controlling secondary nucleation and promoting the formation of large-grain single crystals.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Impact of Single-Vacancy Defects on Electronic Properties of Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While defects are generally considered to be unavoidable in experiments, engineering them is also a way of manipulating the physical properties of materials. In this study, the role of periodically arranged single vacancy defects in graphene is studied using the tight-binding method. Our numerical results show that single vacancy (SV) defects can exhibit predictable electronic behavior when they reside on the same sublattices (SS), following the armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) electronic band structure depending on the spacing between SVs. AGNRs are known to their tunable electronic band gap. However, when they are located on different sublattices (DS), the interaction between the defect-induced states becomes strong and can introduce anisotropy into the electronic band structure, demonstrating that the relative position of the SVs can also act as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the electronic properties. Interestingly, the behavior is independent of the density of SVs; for a system fully defected with SVs, the electronic properties depend heavily on the sublattices involved. The results provide a novel insight into sublattice-based defect engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrochiral materials with an achiral-to-chiral phase transition and switchable chirality have unique application opportunities, enabling control of the angular momentum of circularly polarized lattice vibrations (chiral phonons) and chirality-related electronic phenomena. Materials that fall into this class are, however, extremely rare, and often accompanied by other types of ferroic order that interfere with the ferrochiral responses. In this work, we demonstrate ferrochirality in two tetragonal tungsten bronzes, K4Bi2Nb10O30 and Rb4Bi2Nb10O30. Using high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy, we solve the incommensurately modulated and chiral structures. Temperature dependent X-ray powder diffraction reveals that both materials undergo an achiral-to-chiral phase transition from P4/mbm to P4212(00{\gamma})q00. The chirality originates from a cooperative helical displacement of Bi3+ atoms perpendicular to the c direction and represents the primary order parameter. As a secondary effect of the ferrochiral order, a spatially varying piezoelectric response is observed, consistent with the polycrystalline nature of the investigated materials. Through invariant analysis, an external electric-strain-field coupling with the piezoelectricity is proposed as a conjugate field for switching chirality, establishing tetragonal tungsten bronzes as a versatile playground for the emergent field of ferrochirality.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Electric Field on the Anisotropic Dispersion of the Flexocoupling Induced Phonons and Ferrons in Van der Waals Ferrielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As has been shown recently, the influence of the flexoelectric coupling (shortly "flexocoupling") on the fluctuations of electric polarization and elastic strains can lead to the principal changes of the dispersion law of soft optical and acoustic phonons (shortly "flexophonons") and ferrons (shortly "flexoferrons") in van der Waals ferrielectrics. Analytical results, derived in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, revealed that the dispersion of flexophonons and flexoferrons is strongly anisotropic and should depend on the magnitude and direction of applied electric field. In this work we study the influence of applied electric field on the anisotropic dispersion of the flexophonons and flexophonons in a uniaxial van der Waals ferrielectric CuInP2S6. We reveal that the frequency of acoustic flexophonons and flexoferrons tends to zero at nonzero wavevectors under increase of applied electric field. We relate the changes with a possible appearance of a spatially modulated incommensurate polar phase induced by the flexocoupling in external field. The critical strength of flexocoupling is determined by the magnitude of electric field and direction of the wavevector. This allows us to propose a method for estimating the strength of flexocoupling in van der Waals ferrielectrics, providing that the frequency of the acoustic flexophonon is zeroing at the threshold value of the electric field. Since the flexoelectric coefficients are poorly known in van der Waals ferrielectrics, obtained analytical results can be useful for their flexo-engineering.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen modes in KDP under pressure from ab initio calculation and inelastic neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the phonon triplet in the region of OH-stretching modes in hydrogen-bonded materials is often explained by the interplay of OH-stretching modes and combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes. In order to elucidate the both contributions in KDP, we compare the pressure dependence of the OH-bending and stretching modes from ab initio calculation and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The ab initio calculation predicts a hardening of OH-bending modes and a softening of OH-stretching modes with pressure. At the same time, INS measurements in the region of OH-stretching modes indicate a hardening of the phonon triplet together with the bending modes. This means that this triplet in INS measurements is mainly due to combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes, while the intensity of OH-stretching modes appears to be relatively low.

      <title>Sliding multiferrocity in van der Waals layered CrI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding magnetoelectric coupling in emerging van der Waals multiferroics is crucial for developing atomically thin spintronic devices. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of magnetoelectric coupling in orthorhombic CrI$_2$. Monte Carlo simulations based on DFT-calculated magnetic exchange interactions suggest a proper-screw helimagnetic ground state with a N\'{e}el temperature consistent with experimental observations. A ferroelectric switching pathway driven by interlayer sliding is predicted, featuring a low switching energy barrier and out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization. To quantitatively characterize the magnetoelectric effect in orthorhombic CrI$_2$ and its microscopic origin, we evaluate the spin-driven polarization using the paramagnetic phase as a reference alongside the magnetoelectric tensor method. The extracted spin-driven polarization aligns along the $z$-axis, with its origin dominated by the exchange-striction mechanism. Although in-plane components of the total polarization in the bulk vanish due to global symmetry constraints, each CrI$_2$ single layer exhibits local electric polarization along the $x$ direction, arising from the generalized spin-current mechanism, which couples spin chirality to the electric polarization. As a result, we further predict that a proper-screw helimagnetic state may persist in monolayer CrI$_2$, with its charity reversable by switching the in-plane electric polarization through applying external electric field, providing another promising candidate for electrical control of two-dimensional multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Atomistic modeling of uranium monocarbide with a machine learning interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium monocarbide (UC) is an advanced ceramic fuel candidate due to its superior uranium density and thermal conductivity compared to traditional fuels. To accurately model UC at reactor operating conditions, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using an active learning procedure to generate a comprehensive training dataset capturing diverse atomic configurations. The resulting MLIP predicts structural, elastic, thermophysical properties, defect formation energies, and diffusion behaviors, aligning well with experimental and theoretical benchmarks. This work significantly advances computational methods to explore UC, enabling efficient large-scale and long-time molecular dynamics simulations essential for reactor fuel qualification.</description>

      <title>Interaction between Rydberg Excitons in Cuprous Oxide Revealed through Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experimental and theoretical investigations of interacting excitons of the yellow series in cuprous oxide (Cu$_2$O) with principal quantum numbers up to $n=7$ by means of second harmonic generation (SHG). Using picosecond pulsed laser excitation up to 10 GW/cm$^2$ peak intensity we observe a pronounced change of the spectra with increasing pump laser intensity: an energetic shift to lower absolute energies and a spectral broadening, while the absolute intensity for low powers scales with the square of the pump power, but saturates at higher powers. Concomitant with SHG we determined the density of the excitons excited by the ps pulse by measuring the two-photon absorption directly. This allows to derive quantitative values for the exciton-exciton interaction. Surprisingly, the results disagree both in magnitude and scaling with principal quantum number with those calculated by state-of-the art atomic-like van der Waals interaction theory. As a possible screening by an electron-hole plasma created by three-photon absorption into blue and violet band states could be ruled out, our results point toward fundamental differences between excitons and atoms.</description>

      <title>Design Principles and Identification of Birefringent Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Birefringence ($\Delta n$) is the dependence of the refractive index of a material on the polarization of light travelling through it. Birefringent materials are used as polarizers, waveplates, and for novel light-matter coupling. While several birefringent materials exist, only a handful of them show large $\Delta n$ &gt; 0.3, and are primarily limited to the infrared region. The variation of $\Delta n$ across diverse materials classes and strategies to achieve highly birefringent materials with transparency covering different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum are missing. We have calculated the $\Delta n$ of 967 non-cubic, formable crystals having vastly different structures, polyhedral connectivity and chemical compositions. From this set of compounds, we have screened highly birefringent crystals ($\Delta n$ greater than 0.3) having transparency in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The screened compounds belong to several families such as A3'MN3, AMO2, AN3, and A'N6 (A = Li, Na, K; A'= Ca, Sr, Ba; M = V, Nb, Ta). By analyzing the electronic structures of these compounds, we have distilled rules to enable the design of crystals with large $\Delta n$.</description>

      <title>Giant Spin-to-Charge Conversion by Tailoring Magnetically Proximitized Topological Dirac Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While ferromagnet and topological material bilayers are widely studied to obtain efficient spin charge conversion via topological surface states (TSS), the influence of the magnetic proximity effect (MPE) on the TSS evolution and conversion efficiency remains poorly understood. In this study, we experimentally probe and reveal the behavior of spin momentum locked TSS through spin pumping measurements in heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic Fe and the topological Dirac semimetal alpha Sn. As the alpha Sn thickness (tSn) increases from 9 to 35 nm, the Gilbert damping constant of the Fe layer exhibits a pronounced peak at tSn = 25 nm, followed by a decrease at greater thicknesses. Our rigorous theoretical analysis, combining analytical modeling and first principles calculations, attributes this behavior to the TSS disappearance at the Fe and alpha Sn interface and exchange gap opening on the opposite surface, both induced by the long range MPE and its influence on the spin charge conversion efficiency. At tSn = 25 nm, we demonstrate highly efficient spin charge conversion with an inverse Edelstein length of 3.14 nm, the highest value reported at room temperature for ferromagnet and topological material bilayers. These findings underscore the critical role of tuning TSS properties under MPE for advancing topological materials in spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of Group-V Impurities on the Electronic Properties of Germanium Detectors: An Insight from First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outstanding properties of high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors, such as excellent energy resolution, high energy sensitivity, and a low background-to-signal ratio, make them essential and ideal candidates for detecting particle signatures in nuclear processes such as neutrino-less double beta decay. However, the presence of defects and impurities in HPGe crystals can lead to charge trapping, which affects carrier mobility and results in significant energy resolution degradation. In this work, we employ density functional theory with a hybrid functional to study the energetics of possible point defects in Ge. Our findings indicate that n-type group-V impurities, such as phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), and antimony (Sb), form more readily in Ge compared to nitrogen (N), Ge vacancies, and Ge interstitials. Unlike N dopants, which yield deep trap states, P, As, and Sb create shallow traps close to the conduction band edge of Ge. Furthermore, we predict that n-type defects can condense into defect complexes with Ge vacancies. These vacancy-impurity complexes form deep traps in Ge, similar to Ge vacancies, suggesting that both vacancies and vacancy-impurity complexes contribute to charge trapping in these detectors, thereby diminishing their performance.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Nano-imaging and Spectroscopy of Phase Coexistence in a Wide-Bandgap Semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide bandgap semiconductors with high room temperature mobilities are promising materials for high-power electronics. Stannate films provide wide bandgaps and optical transparency, although electron-phonon scattering can limit mobilities. In SrSnO3, epitaxial strain engineering stabilizes a high-mobility tetragonal phase at room temperature, resulting in a threefold increase in electron mobility among doped films. However, strain relaxation in thicker films leads to nanotextured coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases with unclear implications for optoelectronic performance. The observed nanoscale phase coexistence demands nano-spectroscopy to supply spatial resolution beyond conventional, diffraction-limited microscopy. With nano-infrared spectroscopy, we provide a comprehensive analysis of phase coexistence in SrSnO3 over a broad energy range, distinguishing inhomogeneous phonon and plasma responses arising from structural and electronic domains. We establish Nanoscale Imaging and Spectroscopy with Machine-learning Assistance (NISMA) to map nanotextured phases and quantify their distinct optical responses through a robust quantitative analysis, which can be applied to a broad array of complex oxide materials.</description>

      <title>Exact downfolding and its perturbative approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Miniband Structure of Graphene Moir\'e Superlattices via Gate-dependent Terahertz Photocurrent Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices formed at the interface between stacked two-dimensional atomic crystals offer limitless opportunities to design materials with widely tunable properties and engineer intriguing quantum phases of matter. However, despite progress, precise probing of the electronic states and tantalizingly complex band textures of these systems remain challenging. Here, we present gate-dependent terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy as a robust technique to detect, explore and quantify intricate electronic properties in graphene moir\'e superlattices. Specifically, using terahertz light at different frequencies, we demonstrate distinct photocurrent regimes evidencing the presence of avoided band crossings and tiny (~1-20 meV) inversion-breaking global and local energy gaps in the miniband structure of minimally twisted graphene and hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures, key information that is inaccessible by conventional electrical or optical techniques. In the off-resonance regime, when the radiation energy is smaller than the gap values, enhanced zero-bias responsivities arise in the system due to the lower Fermi velocities and specific valley degeneracies of the charge carriers subjected to moir\'e superlattice potentials. In stark contrast, above-gap excitations give rise to bulk photocurrents -- intriguing optoelectronic responses related to the geometric Berry phase of the constituting electronic minibands. Besides their fundamental importance, these results place moir\'e superlattices as promising material platforms for advanced, sensitive and low-noise terahertz detection applications.</description>

Abstract: Origami, the traditional paper-folding art, has inspired the modern design of numerous flexible structures in science and engineering. In particular, origami structures with different physical properties have been studied and utilized for various applications. More recently, several deterministic and stochastic approaches have been developed for controlling the rigidity or softness of the Miura-ori structures. However, the rigidity control of other origami structures is much less understood. In this work, we study the rigidity control of general origami structures via enforcing or relaxing the planarity condition of their polygonal facets. Specifically, by performing numerical simulations on a large variety of origami structures with different facet selection rules, we systematically analyze how the geometry and topology of different origami structures affect their degrees of freedom (DOF). We also propose a hypergeometric model based on the selection process to derive theoretical bounds for the probabilistic properties of the rigidity change, which allows us to identify key origami structural variables that theoretically govern the DOF evolution and thereby the critical rigidity percolation transition in general origami structures. Moreover, we develop a simple unified model that describes the relationship between the critical percolation density, the origami facet geometry, and the facet selection rules, which enables efficient prediction of the critical transition density for high-resolution origami structures. Altogether, our work highlights the intricate similarities and differences in the rigidity control of general origami structures, shedding light on the design of flexible mechanical metamaterials for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Mott Criticality as the Confinement Transition of a Pseudogap-Mott Metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Mott insulation involves the localization of itinerant electrons due to strong local repulsion. Upon doping, a pseudogap (PG) phase emerges - marked by selective gapping of the Fermi surface without conventional symmetry breaking in spin or charge channels. A key challenge is understanding how quasiparticle breakdown in the Fermi liquid gives rise to this enigmatic state, and how it connects to both the Mott insulating and superconducting phases. Here, we develop a renormalization-based construction of strongly correlated lattice models that captures the emergence of the pseudogap phase and its transition to a Mott insulator. Applying a many-body tiling scheme to the fixed-point impurity model uncovers a lattice model with electron interactions and Kondo physics. At half-filling, the interplay between Kondo screening and bath charge fluctuations in the impurity model leads to Fermi liquid breakdown. This reveals a pseudogap phase characterized by a non-Fermi liquid (the Mott metal) residing on nodal arcs, gapped antinodal regions of the Fermi surface, and an anomalous scaling of the electronic scattering rate with frequency. The eventual confinement of holon-doublon excitations of this exotic metal obtains a continuous transition into the Mott insulator. Our results identify the pseudogap as a distinct long-range entangled quantum phase, and offer a new route to Mott criticality beyond the paradigm of local quantum criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the glass transition, the characteristic relaxation time (e.g., the alpha-relaxation time in dielectric spectroscopy) of a glass-former exhibits a strongly super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, as compared to the classical Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures. A comprehensive description of both regions thus requires five parameters. Here, we demonstrate that many glass-formers exhibit a universal scaling, with only two material-specific parameters setting the timescale and the temperature scale; the other three being universal constants. Furthermore, we show that the master curve can be described by the recently developed two-state, two-(time) scale (TS2) theory (Soft Matter 2020, 16, 810) and regress the universal TS2 parameters. We also show the connection between the TS2 model and the Hall-Wolynes elastic relaxation theory.</description>

      <title>Application of new conformal cooling layouts to the green injection molding of complex slender polymeric parts with high dimensional specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eliminating warpage in injection molded polymeric parts is one of the most important problems in the injection molding industry today. This situation is critical in geometries that are particularly susceptible to warping due to their geometric features, and this occurs with topologies of great length and slenderness with high changes in thickness. These features are, in these special geometries, impossible to manufacture with traditional technologies to meet the dimensional and sustainable requirements of the industry. This paper presents an innovative green conformal cooling system that is specifically designed for parts with slender geometric shapes that are highly susceptible to warping. Additionally, the work presented by the authors investigates the importance of using highly conductive inserts made of steel alloys in combination with the use of additively manufactured conformal channels for reducing influential parameters, such as warpage, cooling time, and residual stresses in the complex manufacturing of long and slender parts. The results of this real industrial case study indicated that the use of conformal cooling layouts decreased the cycle time by 175.1 s 66% below the current cooling time; the temperature gradient by 78.5% specifically, 18.16 C; the residual stress by 39.78 MPa or 81.88%; and the warpage by 6.9 mm or 90.5%. In this way, it was possible to achieve a final warping in the complex geometry studied of 0.72 mm, which was under the maximum value required at the industrial level of 1 mm. The resulting values obtained by the researchers present a turning point from which the manufacturing and sustainability in the injection molding of said plastic geometries is possible, and they take into account that the geometric manufacturing features analyzed will present a great demand in the coming years in the auto parts manufacturing industry.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Learning of Magnetic Frustration in Artificial Spin Ice from Magnetic Force Microscopy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of microscopic images with atomic resolution facilitate the development of machine learning methods to identify and analyze subtle physical phenomena embedded within the images. In this work, microscopic images of honeycomb lattice spin-ice samples serve as datasets from which we automate the calculation of net magnetic moments and directional orientations of spin-ice configurations. In the first stage of our workflow, machine learning models are trained to accurately predict magnetic moments and directions within spin-ice structures. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an emergent unsupervised deep learning technique, are employed to generate high-quality synthetic magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images and extract latent feature representations, thereby reducing experimental and segmentation errors. The second stage of proposed methodology enables precise identification and prediction of frustrated vertices and nanomagnetic segments, effectively correlating structural and functional aspects of microscopic images. This facilitates the design of optimized spin-ice configurations with controlled frustration patterns, enabling potential on-demand synthesis.</description>

      <title>Mutual control of critical temperature, residual resistance ratio, stress, and roughness for sputtered Nb films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting single quantum logic integrated circuits traditionally exploit magnetron sputtered niobium thin films on silicon oxide substrates. The sputtering depends on multiple process parameters, which dramatically affect mechanical, electrical, and cryogenic properties of Nb thin films. In this work, we focus on the comprehensive relationship study between 200-nm Nb film characteristics and their intrinsic stress. It is shown that there is a critical value of the working pressure pcritical at the fixed sputtering power above which stress in the film relaxes whereas the film properties degrade significantly. Below pcritical one can control intrinsic stress in the wide range from -400 MPa to +600 MPa maintaining perfect film surface with a 0.8 nm roughness (Rq), electrical resistivity less than 20 uOhm*cm, critical superconducting transition temperature above 8.9 K and residual resistance ratio over 6.4. We suggest a modified kinetic model to predict Nb films stress with the linear dependence of high-energy parameters on the working pressure replaced with an exponential one, which allowed reduction of the approximation error from 20 to 8%.</description>

      <title>Graphene-hBN interlayer interactions from quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and structural properties of graphene-based devices. In this work, we employ quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to study the interlayer interactions and stacking-fault energy (SFE) between graphene and hBN. We generated QMC energies for several rigid bilayer stacking configurations and fitted these data to the Kolmogorov-Crespi type interlayer potential (ILP) model. Our QMC-derived potential offers a more reliable alternative to conventional density functional theory methods, which are prone to errors in predicting properties in van der Waals materials. This study enables highly accurate predictions of structural and electronic properties in graphene hBN heterostructures. The resulting ILP-QMC potential is made available for further use in simulating complex systems, such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) on hBN.</description>

      <title>Dislocation saturation in slip rate driven processes and initial microstructure effects for large plastic deformation of crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02413v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dislocation-density-based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructural changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip-rate-driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. We point out the existence of saturation dislocation densities and the essential role of initial dislocation density in distinguishing between hardening and softening responses. Since the initial microstructure, modeled through the dislocation density, could be related to the size or the sample preparation process, implicit size-dependent effects can also be inferred. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>SLIDE: Automated Identification and Quantification of Grain Boundary Sliding and Opening in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grain Boundary (GB) deformation mechanisms such as Sliding (GBS) and Opening (GBO) are prevalent in alloys at high homologous temperatures but are hard to capture quantitatively. We propose an automated procedure to quantify 3D GB deformations at the nanoscale, using a combination of precisely aligned Digital Image Correlation (DIC), electron backscatter diffraction, optical profilometry, and in-beam secondary electron maps. The framework, named Sliding identification by Local Integration of Displacements across Edges (SLIDE), (i) distinguishes GBS from GBO, (ii) computes the datapoint-wise measured in-plane displacement gradient tensor (from DIC), (iii) projects this data onto the theoretical GBS tensor to reject near-GB plasticity/elasticity/noise, and (iv) adds the out-of-plane step from optical profilometry to yield the local 3D GBS/GBO vector; automatically repeated for each $\sim$50nm-long GB segment. SLIDE is validated on a virtual experiment of discrete 3D sliding, and successfully applied to Zn-coated steel experiments, yielding quantitative GBS/GBO activity maps.</description>

      <title>Permeation and thermal desorption model of hydrogen in steel: a sensitivity analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a fully physical model of the hydrogen diffusion and trapping kinetics in metals, integrating permeation and thermal desorption within a unified framework. Based on the McNabb and Foster approach, it requires only binding energy and number density of trap sites. It correctly reproduces the physics of the system and the results of the analytical solutions of the permeation kinetics. It is also capable of reproducing thermal desorption spectra with considerable accuracy. The sensitivity analysis has elucidated the relationships among the processing conditions and the parameters commonly used to characterize permeation and thermal desorption experiments. An equation empirically derived from the simulation results, expressing the dependence of time lag in desorption on specimen thickness, number density of occupied trap sites, and cathodic concentration, is proposed. In summary, the model represents a valuable tool in supporting the interpretation and rationalization of experiments also from a quantitative viewpoint.</description>

Abstract: Predicting accurate band gaps and optical properties of lower-dimensional materials, including two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials and their heterostructures, remains a challenge within density functional theory (DFT) due to their unique screening compared to their bulk counterparts. Additionally, accurate treatment of the dielectric response is crucial for developing and applying screened-exchange dielectric-dependent range-separated hybrid functionals (SE-DD-RSH) for vdW materials. In this work, we introduce a SE-DD-RSH functional to the 2D vdW materials like MoS2, WS2, hBN, black phosphorus (BP), and \b{eta}-InSe. By accounting for in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric responses, our method achieves accuracy comparable to advanced many-body techniques like G0 W0 and BSE@G0 W0 at a lower computational cost. We demonstrate improved band gap predictions and optical absorption spectra for both bulk and layered structures, including some heterostructures like MoS2/WS2 . This approach offers a practical and precise tool for exploring electronic and optical phenomena in 2D materials, paving the way for efficient computational studies of layered systems.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-Induced Magnetoelectricity in Twisted Bilayer NiI2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a promising route for multiferroic engineering, yet modeling large-scale moir\'e superlattices remains challenging. Leveraging a newly developed SpinGNN++ framework that effectively handles spin-lattice coupled systems, we develop a comprehensive interatomic machine learning (ML) potential and apply it to twisted bilayer NiI2 (TBN). Structural relaxation introduces moir\'e-periodic "bumps" that modulate the interlayer spacing by about 0.55~\AA{} and in-plane ionic shifts up to 0.48~\AA{}. Concurrently, our ML potential, which faithfully captures all key spin interactions, produces reliable magnetic configurations; combined with the generalized KNB mechanism, it yields accurate spin-driven polarization. For twist angles 1.89^{\circ} \leq \theta \leq 2.45^{\circ}, both mechanisms become prominent, yielding rich polarization textures that combine ionic out-of-plane dipoles with purely electronic in-plane domains. In the rigid (unrelaxed) bilayer, skyrmions are absent; lattice relaxation is essential for generating polar-magnetic topologies. In contrast, near {\theta} \approx 60^{\circ}, stacking-dependent ferroelectric displacements dominate, giving rise to polar meron-antimeron networks. These results reveal cooperative ionic and spin-driven ferroelectricity in TBN, positioning twisted vdW magnets as adaptable platforms for tunable multiferroic devices.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic splitting of magnons in hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnons have been intensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on Bravais lattices, particularly triangular and square lattices, where the first two magnon gaps are topologically trivial and do not support topological edge states (TESs). Meanwhile, the third gap can host TESs, which may be trivialized through field-induced topological phase transitions (TPTs), enabling controlled magnonic edge transport. However, the magnon topology in non-Bravais spin lattices remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate the influence of the honeycomb lattice structure on magnon band topology and associated TESs in FM SkXs, employing realistic parameters for monolayer CrI$_3$ and CrBr$_3$. We reveal unique magnonic topological features arising specifically from the honeycomb lattice. Characteristic magnon modes, such as elliptical and triangular distortion modes, acquire nontrivial Chern numbers, contrasting their trivial counterparts in triangular-based SkXs. Moreover, the second magnon gap in honeycomb-based SkXs consistently hosts TESs at low magnetic fields, unlike triangular SkXs. These TESs can be trivialized above a critical magnetic field. Conversely, the third gap is generally trivial at higher magnetic fields but becomes topological at low fields only when the SkX periodicity falls below a critical threshold dependent on Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) strength and magnetic anisotropy. Our study further demonstrates a rich magnonic topological phase diagram accessible by magnetic fields, potentially enabling selective control of low-energy chiral edge modes. These findings underscore the pivotal role of lattice geometry in shaping the topology of magnons in noncollinear spin textures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the technologically important issue of the spin orientation on a correlated magnetic surface and how to manipulate it. We consider a prototypical strongly correlated system, NiO, and show that a single particle approach with anisotropic hoppings, or even a many-electron model with a scalar Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ fails to explain the strain driven spin reorientation transition (SRT). We set up a model treating both anisotropic single particle effects and orbital-dependent, full multipole electron-electron interaction effects at the same footing. Within this model, predictive power to explain the observed SRT is regained and the results indicate the novel possibility of using an electric field to control SRT in magnetic films grown on piezoelectric substrates.</description>
