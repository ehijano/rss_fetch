      <title>Enhancing Power Flow Estimation with Topology-Aware Gated Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and scalable surrogate models for AC power flow are essential for real-time grid monitoring, contingency analysis, and decision support in increasingly dynamic and inverter-dominated power systems. However, most existing surrogates fall short of practical deployment due to their limited capacity to capture long-range nonlinear dependencies in meshed transmission networks and their weak enforcement of physical laws. These models often require extensive hyperparameter tuning, exhibit poor generalization under topology changes or large load swings, and typically do not quantify uncertainty or scale well beyond a few hundred buses. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a \textit{gated graph neural network (GGNN)} surrogate for AC power-flow estimation under topological uncertainty. The model is trained across multiple IEEE benchmark networks of varying size and complexity, each incorporating randomized line contingencies and up to 40\% load variation. To improve robustness and generalization, we explore both conventional supervised learning and physics-informed self-supervised training strategies. Comparative evaluations show that the proposed GGNN consistently outperforms prior GNN-based surrogates, achieving predictions closely aligned with Newton--Raphson solutions. By embedding operational constraints directly into the architecture and loss function, the model ensures physical consistency and delivers a lightweight, accurate, and scalable tool for real-time grid operations.</description>

      <title>A robust and adaptive MPC formulation for Gaussian process models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust and adaptive model predictive control (MPC) framework for uncertain nonlinear systems affected by bounded disturbances and unmodeled nonlinearities. We use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to learn the uncertain dynamics based on noisy measurements, including those collected during system operation. As a key contribution, we derive robust predictions for GP models using contraction metrics, which are incorporated in the MPC formulation. The proposed design guarantees recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction and convergence to a reference state, with high probability. We provide a numerical example of a planar quadrotor subject to difficult-to-model ground effects, which highlights significant improvements achieved through the proposed robust prediction method and through online learning.</description>

      <title>Optimality Loss Minimization in Distributed Control with Application to District Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel partitioning method designed to minimize control performance degradation resulting from partitioning a system for distributed control while maintaining the computational benefits of these methods. A game-theoretic performance metric, the modified Price of Anarchy, is introduced and is used in a generalizable partitioning metric to quantify optimality losses in a distributed controller. By finding the partition that minimizes the partitioning metric, the best-performing distributed control design is chosen. The presented partitioning metric is control-design agnostic, making it broadly applicable to many control design problems. In this paper, the developed metric is used to minimize the performance losses in the distributed control of a demand-flexible District Heating Network. The final distributed controller is provably feasible and stable. In simulation, this novel partitioning performed similarly to the centralized controller, increasing overall heat losses by only 1.9%, as compared to a similarly-sized baseline partition, which resulted in a 22% increase in losses.</description>

      <title>Beyond Interval MDPs: Tight and Efficient Abstractions of Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the general problem of control synthesis for continuous-space, discrete-time stochastic systems with probabilistic guarantees via finite abstractions. While established methods exist, they often trade off accuracy for tractability. We propose a unified abstraction framework that improves both the tightness of probabilistic guarantees and computational efficiency. First, we introduce multi-interval MDPs (MI-MDPs), a generalization of interval-valued MDPs (IMDPs), which allows multiple, possibly overlapping clusters of successor states. This results in tighter abstractions but with increased computational complexity. To mitigate this, we further propose a generalized form of MDPs with set-valued transition probabilities (SMDPs), which model transitions as a fixed probability to a state cluster, followed by a non-deterministic choice within the cluster, as a sound abstraction. We show that control synthesis for MI-MDPs reduces to robust dynamic programming via linear optimization, while SMDPs admit even more efficient synthesis algorithms that avoid linear programming altogether. Theoretically, we prove that, given the partitioning of the state and disturbance spaces, both MI-MDPs and SMDPs yield tighter probabilistic guarantees than IMDPs, and that SMDPs are tighter than MI-MDPs. Extensive experiments across several benchmarks validate our theoretical results and demonstrate that SMDPs achieve favorable trade-offs among tightness, memory usage, and computation time.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Satellite-Ground Deployments for Web3 DID: System Design and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging Web3 has great potential to provide worldwide decentralized services powered by global-range data-driven networks in the future. To ensure the security of Web3 services among diverse user entities, a decentralized identity (DID) system is essential. Especially, a user's access request to Web3 services can be treated as a DID transaction within the blockchain, executed through a consensus mechanism. However, a critical implementation issue arises in the current Web3, i.e., how to deploy network nodes to serve users on a global scale. To address this issue, emerging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems, such as Starlink, offer a promising solution. With their global coverage and high reliability, these communication satellites can complement terrestrial networks as Web3 deployment infrastructures. In this case, this paper develops three hybrid satellite-ground modes to deploy the blockchain-enabled DID system for Web3 users. Three modes integrate ground nodes and satellites to provide flexible and continuous DID services for worldwide users. Meanwhile, to evaluate the effectiveness of the present hybrid deployment modes, we analyze the complete DID consensus performance of blockchain on three hybrid satellite-ground modes. Moreover, we conduct numerical and simulation experiments to verify the effectiveness of three hybrid satellite-ground modes. The impacts of various system parameters are thoroughly analyzed, providing valuable insights for implementing the worldwide Web3 DID system in real-world network environments.</description>

      <title>Grid-Connected, Data-Driven Inverter Control, Theory to Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-connected inverter control is challenging to implement due to the difficulty of obtaining and maintaining an accurate grid model. Direct Data-Driven Predictive Control provides a model-free alternative to traditional model-based control methods. This paper describes how the recently-proposed Transient Predictive Control (TPC) can be used for real-world, plug-and-play inverter control. The following hypotheses were tested: 1) The TPC algorithm can be run online using standard hardware, and 2) TPC, which is derived using Linear Time-Invariant assumptions, is effective for grid-connected inverter control, which is a nonlinear and time-varying system. Experiments conducted on a two-converter benchtop setup and at the CoSES Laboratory on a 25 kVA converter connected to the Munich grid support these hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Indoor thermal comfort management: A Bayesian machine-learning approach to data denoising and dynamics prediction of HVAC systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal management of a building's microclimate to satisfy the occupants' needs and objectives in terms of comfort, energy efficiency, and costs is particularly challenging. This complexity arises from the non-linear, time-dependent interactions among all the variables of the control problem and the changing internal and external constraints. Focusing on the accurate modeling of the indoor temperature, we propose a data-driven approach to address this challenge. We account for thermal inertia, non-linear effects, small perturbations of the indoor climate dynamics caused by ventilation and weather variations, as well as for the stochastic nature of the control system due to the observed noise in the input signal. Since the prohibitive cost of quality data acquisition and processing limits the implementation of data-driven approaches for real-life problems, we applied a method that merges several Bayesian machine learning and deep learning architectures that are suitable for predicting complex system dynamics, while relaxing the dataset quality requirements. Our framework includes a built-in deep Kalman filter, which makes it deployable even with low-accuracy temperature sensors. It achieves state-of-the-art performance, best performing with a 150-minute prediction horizon with an RMSE of 0.2455, an MAE of 0.162, and an $R^2$ of 0.926. The model's performance remains consistent even when exposed to highly noisy data. Finally, we show how our approach can be extended to other applications including demand response event duration prediction and equipment failure detection.</description>

      <title>The Bias of Subspace-based Data-Driven Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper quantifies and addresses the bias of subspace-based Data-Driven Predictive Control (DDPC) for linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems. The primary focus is the bias that arises when the training data is gathered with a feedback controller in closed-loop with the system. First, the closed-loop bias of Subspace Predictive Control is quantified using the training data innovations. Next, the bias of direct, subspace-based DDPC methods DeePC and $\gamma$-DDPC is shown to consist of two parts--the Subspace Bias, which arises from closed-loop data, and an Optimism Bias, which arises from DeePC/$\gamma$-DDPC's "optimistic" adjustment of the output trajectory. We show that, unlike subspace-based DDPC methods, Transient Predictive Control does not suffer from Subspace Bias or Optimism Bias. Double integrator experiments demonstrate that Subspace and Optimism Bias are responsible for poor reference tracking by the subspace-based DDPC methods.</description>

      <title>Robust feedback-based quantum optimization: analysis of coherent control errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feedback-based Algorithm for Quantum Optimization (FALQON) is a Lyapunov inspired quantum algorithm proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we examine the robustness of FALQON against coherent control errors, a class of multiplicative errors that affect the control input. We show that the algorithm is asymptotically robust with respect to systematic errors, and we derive robustness bounds for independent errors. Finally, we propose a robust version of FALQON which minimizes a regularized Lyapunov function. Our theoretical results are supported through simulations.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Prescribed-Time Control Framework via Koopman Operator and Adaptive Backstepping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving rapid and time-deterministic stabilization for complex systems characterized by strong nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties presents a significant challenge. Traditional model-based control relies on precise system models, whereas purely data-driven methods often lack formal stability guarantees, limiting their applicability in safety-critical systems. This paper proposes a novel control framework that synergistically integrates data-driven modeling with model-based control. The framework first employs the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (EDMDc) to identify a high-dimensional Koopman linear model and quantify its bounded uncertainty from data. Subsequently, a novel Prescribed-Time Adaptive Backstepping (PTAB) controller is synthesized based on this data-driven model. The design leverages the structural advantages of Koopman linearization to systematically handle model errors and circumvent the "explosion of complexity" issue inherent in traditional backstepping. The proposed controller is validated through simulations on the classic Van der Pol oscillator. The results demonstrate that the controller can precisely stabilize the system states to a small neighborhood of the origin within a user-prescribed time, regardless of the initial conditions, while ensuring the boundedness of all closed-loop signals. This research successfully combines the flexibility of data-driven approaches with the rigor of Lyapunov-based analysis. It provides a high-performance control strategy with quantifiable performance and pre-assignable settling time for nonlinear systems, showcasing its great potential for controlling complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observer-Based Distributed Model Predictive Control for String-Stable Multi-vehicle Systems with Markovian Switching Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Switching communication topologies can cause instability in vehicle platoons, as vehicle information may be lost during the dynamic switching process. This highlights the need to design a controller capable of maintaining the stability of vehicle platoons under dynamically changing topologies. However, capturing the dynamic characteristics of switching topologies and obtaining complete vehicle information for controller design while ensuring stability remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an observer-based distributed model predictive control (DMPC) method for vehicle platoons under directed Markovian switching topologies. Considering the stochastic nature of the switching topologies, we model the directed switching communication topologies using a continuous-time Markov chain. To obtain the leader vehicle's information for controller design, we develop a fully distributed adaptive observer that can quickly adapt to the randomly switching topologies, ensuring that the observed information is not affected by the dynamic topology switches. Additionally, a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the mean-square stability of the observer. Furthermore, we construct the DMPC terminal update law based on the observer and formulate a string stability constraint based on the observed information. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method can reduce tracking errors while ensuring string stability.</description>

      <title>A formal specification of the desired software behaviour of the Princess Marijke lock complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Princess Marijke lock complex is a large lock and water-protection installation in the Netherlands between the river Rhine and the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal -- a large waterway connecting the Rhine to the port of Amsterdam. The lock complex consists of two independent locks and a moveable flood-protection barrier. Ensuring safe control of the lock complex is of utmost importance to guarantee both flood-protection and reliable ship operations. This paper gives a precise, formal description of the software control of the lock complex in less than 400 lines of mCRL2 code. This description can act as a blueprint on how the software of this lock complex needs to be constructed. Moreover, using model checking, 53 software requirements are shown to be valid, ensuring that the formal description of the behaviour is correct with regard to these properties and is unlikely to contain mistakes and oversights.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Model Predictive Controller to manage epidemics: The case of SARS-CoV-2 in Mauritius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the benefits of implementing a systematic approach to social isolation policies during epidemics. We develop a mixed integer data-driven model predictive control (MPC) scheme based on an SIHRD model which is identified from available data. The case of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (also known as COVID-19) in Mauritius is used as a reference point with data obtained during the period December 2021 to May 2022. The isolation scheme is designed with the control decision variable taking a finite set of values corresponding to the desired level of isolation. The control input is further restricted to shifting between levels only after a minimum amount of time. The simulation results validate our design, showing that the need for hospitalisation remains within the capacity of the health centres, with the number of deaths considerably reduced by raising the level of isolation for short periods of time with negligible social and economic impact. We also show that the introduction of additional isolation levels results in a smoother containment approach with a considerably reduced hospitalisation burden.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Gradient Descent Algorithms are Small-Disturbance Input-to-State Stable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the robustness of gradient descent algorithms under perturbations. The concept of small-disturbance input-to-state stability (ISS) for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems is introduced, along with its Lyapunov characterization. The conventional linear Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition is then extended to a nonlinear version, and it is shown that the gradient descent algorithm is small-disturbance ISS provided the objective function satisfies the generalized nonlinear PL condition. This small-disturbance ISS property guarantees that the gradient descent algorithm converges to a small neighborhood of the optimum under sufficiently small perturbations. As a direct application of the developed framework, we demonstrate that the LQR cost satisfies the generalized nonlinear PL condition, thereby establishing that the policy gradient algorithm for LQR is small-disturbance ISS. Additionally, other popular policy gradient algorithms, including natural policy gradient and Gauss-Newton method, are also proven to be small-disturbance ISS.</description>

Abstract: Simulators are useful tools for testing automated driving controllers. Vehicle-in-the-loop (ViL) tests and digital twins (DTs) are widely used simulation technologies to facilitate the smooth deployment of controllers to physical vehicles. However, conventional ViL tests rely on full-size vehicles, requiring large space and high expenses. Also, physical-model-based DT suffers from the reality gap caused by modeling imprecision. This paper develops a comprehensive and practical simulator for testing automated driving controllers enhanced by scaled physical cars and AI-powered DT models. The scaled cars allow for saving space and expenses of simulation tests. The AI-powered DT models ensure superior simulation fidelity. Moreover, the simulator integrates well with off-the-shelf software and control algorithms, making it easy to extend. We use a filtered control benchmark with formal safety guarantees to showcase the capability of the simulator in validating automated driving controllers. Experimental studies are performed to showcase the efficacy of the simulator, implying its great potential in validating control solutions for autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic.</description>

      <title>Joint Radiation Power, Antenna Position, and Beamforming Optimization for Pinching-Antenna Systems with Motion Power Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have been recently proposed to improve the performance of wireless networks by reconfiguring both the large-scale and small-scale channel conditions. However, existing studies ignore the physical constraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To fill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into account the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact of adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average power consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly optimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit beamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to consider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional degree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and discrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the fact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the channel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To tackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for continuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance enhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and adjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed optimization framework. The benefits of PASS over conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in mitigating the large-scale path loss and inter-user interference is also revealed.</description>

      <title>Green Ammonia: A Techno-Economic Supply Chain Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Green ammonia is emerging as a strategic intermediary within green energy supply chains, serving effectively as both an industrial commodity and hydrogen carrier. This study provides a techno-economic analysis of green ammonia supply chains, comparing cost-effective pathways from global production to European consumers, and evaluates ammonia alongside alternative hydrogen carriers. Gaseous hydrogen consistently remains the most economical import option for Europe, though ammonia holds a narrowing cost advantage over liquid hydrogen (from 16 % in 2030 to 10 % by 2040). Competitive ammonia suppliers, notably Morocco, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates, benefit from low renewable energy costs, with significant price reductions expected by 2040, driven by falling costs for electricity, electrolysers, and conversion technologies. Optimal transport modes vary by consumer demand and distance: trucks are ideal for low demands at all distances, rail for medium ranges, and pipelines for high-demand scenarios. By 2040, ammonia will primarily serve direct-use applications, as hydrogen consumers increasingly shift to direct hydrogen supplies. Policymakers should prioritize pipeline infrastructure for hydrogen distribution, cautiously invest in ammonia's short- to medium-term infrastructure advantages, and limit long-term reliance on ammonia as a hydrogen carrier to mitigate stranded asset risks.</description>

      <title>MISC: Minimal Intervention Shared Control with Guaranteed Safety under Non-Convex Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shared control combines human intention with autonomous decision-making, from low-level safety overrides to high-level task guidance, enabling systems that adapt to users while ensuring safety and performance. This enhances task effectiveness and user experience across domains such as assistive robotics, teleoperation, and autonomous driving. However, existing shared control methods, based on e.g. Model Predictive Control, Control Barrier Functions, or learning-based control, struggle with feasibility, scalability, or safety guarantees, particularly since the user input is unpredictable.
  To address these challenges, we propose an assistive controller framework based on Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates an offline-computed Control Invariant Set, enabling online computation of control actions that ensure feasibility, strict constraint satisfaction, and minimal override of user intent. Moreover, the framework can accommodate structured class of non-convex constraints, which are common in real-world scenarios. We validate the approach through a large-scale user study with 66 participants--one of the most extensive in shared control research--using a computer game environment to assess task load, trust, and perceived control, in addition to performance. The results show consistent improvements across all these aspects without compromising safety and user intent.</description>

      <title>Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks for Enhanced Electric Motor Fault Diagnosis Using Vibration and Acoustic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model. While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33% for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in induction motor condition monitoring.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization for Coordinated Long-Term and Short-Term Isolated Microgrid Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-anticipatory long-short-term coordinated dispatch framework for isolated microgrid with hybrid short-long-duration energy storages (LDES). We introduce a convex hull approximation model for nonconvex LDES electrochemical dynamics, facilitating computational tractability and accuracy. To address temporal coupling in SoC dynamics and long-term contracts, we generate hindsight-optimal state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories of LDES and netloads for offline training. In the online stage, we employ kernel regression to dynamically update the SoC reference and propose an adaptive online convex optimization (OCO) algorithm with SoC reference tracking and expert tracking to mitigate myopia and enable adaptive step-size optimization. We rigorously prove that both long-term and short-term policies achieve sublinear regret bounds over time, which improves with more regression scenarios, stronger tracking penalties, and finer convex approximations. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing costs by 73.4%, eliminating load loss via reference tracking, and achieving an additional 2.4% cost saving via the OCO algorithm. These benefits scale up with longer LDES durations, and the method demonstrates resilience to poor forecasts and unexpected system faults.</description>

      <title>MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Fine-tuning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens. To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose $\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/MOTIF, respectively.</description>

      <title>Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Adaptive State-Feedback Control for Inter-Area Oscillation Damping with Continuous Eigenvalue Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling inter-area oscillation (IAO) across wide areas is crucial for the stability of modern power systems. Recent advances in deep learning, combined with the extensive deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) and generator sensors, have catalyzed the development of data-driven IAO damping controllers. In this paper, a novel IAO damping control framework is presented by modeling the control problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solving it through deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The DRL-based controller is trained in the state space with continuous eigenvalue configurations. To optimize control performance and cost-efficiency, only a subset of generators, identified by global participation factors, are selected for control. In addition, a switching control strategy (SCS) is introduced that effectively integrates the DRL-based controller with power system stabilizers (PSSs) to enhance overall performance. The simulation results on the IEEE 39-bus New England power system show that the proposed method outperforms two benchmark methods regarding the transient response. The DRL-based controller trained on the linear state-space environment can be directly tested in the nonlinear differential-algebraic environment. The robustness of the proposed method against communication delays has been thoroughly investigated.</description>

      <title>Identifying Systems with Symmetries using Equivariant Autoregressive Reservoir Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09511v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation reported in this document focuses on identifying systems with symmetries using equivariant autoregressive reservoir computers. General results in structured matrix approximation theory are presented, exploring a two-fold approach. Firstly, a comprehensive examination of generic symmetry-preserving nonlinear time delay embedding is conducted. This involves analyzing time series data sampled from an equivariant system under study. Secondly, sparse least-squares methods are applied to discern approximate representations of the output coupling matrices. These matrices play a critical role in determining the nonlinear autoregressive representation of an equivariant system. The structural characteristics of these matrices are dictated by the set of symmetries inherent in the system. The document outlines prototypical algorithms derived from the described techniques, offering insight into their practical applications. Emphasis is placed on the significant improvement on structured identification precision when compared to classical reservoir computing methods for the simulation of equivariant dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Vibration-based damage detection of a trainer jet via multiple input tangential interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibration-based damage detection relies on identifying modal parameters, such as natural frequencies and mode shapes, to be used as structural integrity indicators. However, traditional comparisons of these parameters are often ambiguous in complex systems, complicating damage detection and assessment. The modified total modal assurance criterion (MTMAC), a metric well-known in the field of finite element model updating, is extended to address this challenge and is proposed as a metric for damage identification and severity assessment. To support the requirement for precise and robust modal identification of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), the improved Loewner Framework (iLF), known for its reliability and computational performance, is pioneeringly employed within SHM. Since the MTMAC is proposed solely as a damage identification and severity assessment metric, the coordinate modal assurance criterion (COMAC), also a well-established tool, but for damage localisation using mode shapes, is used for completeness. The iLF SHM capabilities are validated through comparisons with traditional methods, including least-squares complex exponential (LSCE) and stochastic subspace identification with canonical variate analysis (SSI-CVA) on a numerical case study of a cantilever beam. Furthermore, the MTMAC is validated against the traditional vibration-based approach, which involves directly comparing natural frequencies and mode shapes. Finally, an experimental dataset from a BAE Systems Hawk T1A trainer jet ground vibration tests is used to demonstrate the iLF and MTMAC capabilities on real-life, real-size SHM problem, showing their effectiveness in detecting and assessing damage.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Koopman Model Predictive Control of Simple Serial Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximating nonlinear systems as linear ones is a common workaround to apply control tools tailored for linear systems. This motivates our present work where we developed a data-driven model predictive controller (MPC) based on the Koopman operator framework, allowing the embedding of nonlinear dynamics in a higher dimensional, but linear function space. The controller, termed adaptive Koopman model predictive control (KMPC), uses online closed-loop feedback to learn and incrementally update a linear representation of nonlinear system dynamics, without the prior knowledge of a model. Adaptive KMPC differs from most other Koopman-based control frameworks that aim to identify high-validity-range models in advance and then enter closed-loop control without further model adaptations. To validate the controller, trajectory tracking experiments are conducted with 1R and 2R robots under force disturbances and changing model parameters. We compare the controller to classical linearization MPC and Koopman-based MPC without model updates, denoted static KMPC. The results show that adaptive KMPC can, opposed to static KMPC, generalize over unforeseen force disturbances and can, opposed to linearization MPC, handle varying dynamic parameters, while using a small set of basis functions to approximate the Koopman operator.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Sim-to-real Gap: A Control Framework for Imitation Learning of Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the computational challenges of Model Predictive Control (MPC), recent research has studied using imitation learning to approximate the MPC to a computationally efficient Deep Neural Network (DNN). However, this introduces a common issue in learning-based control, the simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap, and Domain Randomization (DR) has been widely used to mitigate this gap by introducing perturbations in the source domain. However, DR inevitably leads to low data collection efficiency and an overly conservative control strategy. This study proposes a new control framework that addresses this issue from a control perspective inspired by Robust Tube MPC. The framework ensures the DNN operates in the same environment as the source domain, handling the sim-to-real gap with great data collection efficiency. Moreover, a parameter governor is introduced to address the DNN's inability to adapt to variations in model parameters, enabling the system to satisfy MPC constraints more robustly under changing conditions. The proposed framework was validated through two case studies: cart-pole control and vehicle collision avoidance control, which analyzed the principles of the proposed framework in detail and demonstrated its application to a vehicle control case.</description>

      <title>Vertiport Terminal Scheduling and Throughput Analysis for Multiple Surface Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles are gaining traction in both the delivery drone market and passenger transportation, driving the development of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems. UAM seeks to alleviate road congestion in dense urban areas by leveraging urban airspace. To handle UAM traffic, vertiport terminals (vertiminals) play a critical role in supporting VTOL vehicle operations such as take-offs, landings, taxiing, passenger boarding, refueling or charging, and maintenance. Efficient scheduling algorithms are essential to manage these operations and optimize vertiminal throughput while ensuring safety protocols. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft, which rely on runways for take-off and climbing in fixed directions, VTOL vehicles can utilize multiple surface directions for climbing and approach. This flexibility necessitates specialized scheduling methods. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to holistically optimize vertiminal operations, including taxiing, climbing (or approach) using multiple directions, and turnaround at gates. The proposed MILP reduces delays by up to 50%. Additionally, we derive equations to compute upper bounds of the throughput capacity of vertiminals, considering its core elements: the TLOF pad system, taxiway system, and gate system. Our results demonstrate that the MILP achieves throughput levels consistent with the theoretical maximum derived from these equations. We also validate our framework through a case study using a well-established vertiminal topology from the literature. Our MILP can be used to find the optimal configuration of vertiminal. This dual approach, MILP and throughput analysis, allows for comprehensive capacity analysis without requiring simulations while enabling efficient scheduling through the MILP formulation.</description>
