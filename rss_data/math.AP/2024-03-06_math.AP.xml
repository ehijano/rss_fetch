      <title>Modified scattering operator for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with time-decaying harmonic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with a time-decaying harmonic potential. The nonlinearity is gauge-invariant of the long-range critical order. In [24] and [22], it is proved that the equation admits a nontrivial solution that behaves like a free solution with a logarithmic phase correction in the frameworks of both the final state problem and the initial value problem. Furthermore, a modified scattering operator has been established in the case without the potential in [15]. In this paper, we construct a modified scattering operator for our equation by utilizing a generator of the Galilean transformation. Moreover, we remove a restriction for the coefficient of the potential which is required in [22].</description>

Abstract: After different variables and functions changes, the generalized dispersal problem, recalled in (1) below and considered in part I, see Labbas, Maingot and Thorel [14], leads us to consider, to study and to invert the sum of linear operators (4) below in a suitable Banach space by using two strategies: namely the theory of sums of operators in Banach spaces as developed by Da Prato-Grisvard [4] and successfully improved by Dore-Venni [5].</description>

      <title>Reverse inequalities for quasi-Riesz transform on the Vicsek cable system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the study of so-called ``reverse Riesz'' inequalities and suitable variants in the context of some fractal-like cable systems. It was already proved by L. Chen, T. Coulhon, J. Feneuil and the second author that, in the Vicsek cable system, the inequality $\left\Vert \Delta^{1/2}f\right\Vert_p\lesssim \left\Vert \nabla f\right\Vert_p$ is false for all $p\in [1,2)$. Following a recent joint paper by the two authors and M. Yang, we examine the validity of ``reverse quasi-Riesz'' inequalities, of the form $\left\Vert \Delta^{\gamma}e^{-\Delta}f\right\Vert_p\lesssim \left\Vert \nabla f\right\Vert_p$, in the (unbounded) Vicsek cable system, for $p\in (1,+\infty)$ and $\gamma&gt;0$. These reverse inequalities are strongly related to the problem of $L^p$ boundedness of the operators $\nabla e^{-\Delta}\Delta^{-\varepsilon}$, the so-called ``quasi-Riesz transforms'' (at infinity), introduced by L. Chen in her PhD thesis. Our main result is an almost complete characterization of the sets of $\gamma\in (0,1)$ and $p\in (1,+\infty)$ such that the reverse quasi-Riesz inequality holds in the Vicsek cable system. It remains an open question to investigate reverse quasi-Riesz inequalities for other cable systems, or for manifolds built out of these.</description>

      <title>Napoleonic triangles on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As is well-known, numerical experiments show that Napoleon's Theorem for planar triangles does not extend to a similar statement for triangles on the unit sphere $S^2$. Spherical triangles for which an extension of Napoleon's Theorem holds are called ``Napoleonic'', and until now the only known examples have been equilateral. In this paper we determine all Napoleonic spherical triangles, including a class corresponding to points on a 2-dimensional ellipsoid, whose Napoleonisations are all congruent. Other new classes of examples are also found, according to different versions of Napoleon's Theorem for the sphere. The classification follows from successive simplifications of a complicated original algebraic condition, exploiting geometric symmetries and algebraic factorisations.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of stabilization in the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin method for linear anisotropic elastic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work concerns the implementation of the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to solve the linear anisotropic elastic equation in the frequency domain. First-order formulation with the compliance tensor and Voigt notation are employed to provide a compact description of the discretized problem and flexibility with highly heterogeneous media. We further focus on the question of optimal choice of stabilization in the definition of HDG numerical traces. For this purpose, we construct a hybridized Godunov-upwind flux for anisotropic elasticity possessing three distinct wavespeeds. This stabilization removes the need to choose scaling factors, contrary to identity and Kelvin-Christoffel based stabilizations which are popular choices in literature. We carry out comparisons among these families for isotropic and anisotropic material, with constant background and highly heterogeneous ones, in two and three dimensions. They establish the optimality of the Godunov stabilization which can be used as a reference choice for generic material and different types of waves.</description>

      <title>Two models forsandpile growth in weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study $\infty$-Laplacian type diffusion equations in weighted graphs obtained as limit as $p\to \infty$ to two types of $p$-Laplacian evolution equations in such graphs. We propose these diffusion equations, that are governed by the subdifferential of a convex energy functionals associated to the indicator function of the set $$K^G_{\infty}:= \left\{ u \in L^2(V, \nu_G) \ : \ \vert u(y) - u(x) \vert \leq 1 \ \ \hbox{if} \ \ x \sim y \right\}$$ and the set $$K^w_{\infty}:= \left\{ u \in L^2(V, \nu_G) \ : \ \vert u(y) - u(x) \vert \leq \sqrt{w_{xy}} \ \ \hbox{if} \ \ x \sim y \right\}$$ as models for sandpile growth in weighted graphs. Moreover, we also analyse the collapse of the initial condition when it does not belong to the stable sets $K^G_{\infty}$ or $K^w_{\infty}$ by means of an abstract result given in~\cite{BEG}. We give an interpretation of the limit problems in terms of Monge-Kantorovich mass transport theory. Finally, we give some explicit solutions of simple examples that illustrate the dynamics of the sandpile growing or collapsing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider refined geometric characterizations of weak $p$-quasiconformal mappings $\varphi:\Omega\to\widetilde{\Omega}$, where $\Omega$ and $\widetilde{\Omega}$ are domains in $\mathbb R^n$. We prove that mappings with the bounded on the set $\Omega\setminus S$, where a set $S$ has $\sigma$-finite $(n-1)$-measure, geometric $p$-dilatation, are $W^1_{p,\loc}$-- mappings and generate bounded composition operators on Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>An elliptic problem in dimension N with a varying drift term bounded in $L^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to study the asymptotic behavior of a sequence of linear elliptic equations with a varying drift term, whose coefficients are just bounded in $L^N(\Omega)$, with $N$ the dimension of the space. It is known that there exists a unique solution for each of these problems in the Sobolev space $H^1_0(\Omega)$. However, because the operators are not coercive, there is no uniform estimate of the solutions in this space. We use some estimates in \cite{boc1}, and a regularization obtained by adding a small nonlinear first order term, to pass to the limit in these problems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions with subordinate variables for solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in a periodic domain with the force decaying in time. Although the force has a certain coherent decay, as time tends to infinity, it can be too complicated for the previous theory of asymptotic expansions to be applicable. To deal with this issue, we systematically develop a new theory of asymptotic expansions containing the so-called subordinate variables which can be defined recursively. We apply it to obtain an asymptotic expansion for any Leray-Hopf weak solutions. The expansion, in fact, is constructed explicitly and the impact of the subordinate variables can be clearly specified. The complexifications of the Gevrey-Sobolev spaces, and of the Stokes and bilinear operators of the Navier-Stokes equations are utilized to facilitate such a construction.</description>

      <title>The Amplitude Equation for the Space-Fractional Swift-Hohenberg Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-local reaction-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) involving the fractional Laplacian have arisen in a wide variety of applications. One common tool to analyse the dynamics of classical local PDEs near instability is to derive local amplitude/modulation approximations, which provide local normal forms classifying a wide variety of pattern-formation phenomena. In this work, we study amplitude equations for the space-fractional Swift-Hohenberg equation. The Swift-Hohenberg equation is a basic model problem motivated by pattern formation in fluid dynamics and has served as one of the main PDEs to develop general techniques to derive amplitude equations. We prove that there exists near the first bifurcation point an approximation by a (real) Ginzburg-Landau equation. Interestingly, this Ginzburg-Landau equation is a local PDE, which provides a rigorous justification of the physical conjecture that suitably localized unstable modes can out-compete superdiffusion and re-localize a PDE near instability. Our main technical contributions are to provide a suitable function space setting for the approximation problem, and to then bound the residual between the original PDE and its amplitude equation.</description>

      <title>Concentration-compactness via profile decomposition for systems of coupled Schr\"{o}dinger equations of Hamiltonian type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse Hamiltonian-type systems of second-order elliptic PDE invariant under a non-compact group and, consequently, involve a lack of compactness of the Sobolev embedding. We show that the loss of compactness can be compensated by using a concentration-compactness principle via weak profile decomposition for bounded Palais-Smale sequences in Banach spaces. Our analysis to prove the existence of ground states involves a reduction by the inversion method of the system to a fourth-order equation combined with a variational principle of a minimax nature. Among other results, including regularity and a Pohozaev-type identity, we also prove the non-existence of weak solutions for a class of Lane-Emden systems.</description>

      <title>Minimal Surface Equation and Bernstein Property on RCD spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if $(X,d,m)$ is an RCD(K,N) space and $u \in W^{1,1}_{loc}(X)$ is a solution of the minimal surface equation, then $u$ is harmonic on its graph (which has a natural metric measure space structure). If K=0 this allows to obtain an Harnack inequality for $u$, which in turn implies the Bernstein property, meaning that any positive solution to the minimal surface equation must be constant. As an application, we obtain oscillation estimates and a Bernstein Theorem for minimal graphs in products $M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a smooth manifold (possibly weighted and with boundary) with non-negative Ricci curvature</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present short proofs of integrated local energy decay estimates on Schwarzschild, extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, and Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes. The proofs employ novel global physical space multipliers, which, besides their remarkable simplicity, (a) are directly derivable from the geodesic flow, (b) do not require decomposition into spherical harmonics, and (c) whose boundary terms can be controlled by the conserved $T$-energy alone. We also elaborate on the intimate connection between the multipliers of the present paper and the globally good commutators introduced by the first two authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New classes of conditionally integrable systems of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations are introduced. They are obtained by extending a well known nonclassical symmetry of a scalar partial differential equation to a vector equation. New exact solutions of nonlinear predator-prey systems, related to the diffusive Lotka-Volterra system, are constructed. An infinite dimensional class of exact solutions is made available. Unlike in the standard Lotka-Volterra system, in the absence of predators, the prey population has a finite carrying capacity, as in the Fisher equation.</description>

      <title>On dynamics of gasless combustion in slowly varying periodic media: periodic fronts, their stability and propagation-extinction-diffusion-reignition pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a classical model of gasless combustion in a one dimensional formulation under the assumption of ignition temperature kinetics. We study the propagation of flame fronts in this model when the initial distribution of the solid fuel is a spatially periodic function that varies on a large scale. It is shown that in certain parametric regimes the model supports periodic traveling fronts. An accurate asymptotic formula for the velocity of the flame front is derived and studied. The stability of periodic fronts is also explored, and a critical condition in terms of parameters of the problem is derived. It is also shown that the instability of periodic fronts, in a certain parametric regimes, results in a propagation-extinction-diffusion-reignition pattern which is studied numerically.</description>

      <title>Concavity Properties of Solutions of Elliptic Equations under Conformal Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet problem for the weighted Schr\"odinger operator \[-\Delta u +Vu = \lambda \rho u,\] where $\rho$ is a positive weighting function and $V$ is a potential. Such equations appear naturally in conformal geometry and in the composite membrane problem. Our primary goal is to establish concavity estimates for the principle eigenfunction with respect to conformal connections. Doing so, we obtain new bounds on the fundamental gap problem, which is the difference between the first and second eigenvalues. In particular, we partially resolve a conjecture of Nguyen, Stancu and Wei [IMRN 2022] on the fundamental gap of horoconvex domains. In addition, we obtain a power convexity estimate for solutions to the torsion problem in spherical geometry on convex domains which are not too large.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the existence, uniqueness, and maximal regularity estimates of solutions to homogeneous initial value problems involving time-measurable pseudo-differential operators within the framework of weighted mixed norm Lebesgue spaces. The class of temporal weights in our regularity estimates contains Muckenhoupt's class, and the initial data is in weighted Besov spaces with variable order.</description>

      <title>Error estimates for the highly efficient and energy stable schemes for the 2D/3D two-phase MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly focus on the rigorous convergence analysis for two fully decoupled, unconditional energy stable methods of the two-phase magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model, which described in our previous work \cite{2022Highly}. The two methods consist of semi-implicit stabilization method/invariant energy quadratization (IEQ) method \cite{2019EfficientCHEN, Yang2016Linear, Yang2017Efficient, 2019EfficientYANG} for the phase field system, the pressure projection correction method for the saddle point MHD system, the exquisite implicit-explicit treatments for nonlinear coupled terms, which leads to only require solving a sequence of small elliptic equations at each time step. As far as we know, it's the first time to establish the optimal convergence analysis of fully decoupled and unconditional energy stable methods for multi-physics nonlinear two-phase MHD model. In addition, several numerical examples are showed to test the accuracy and stability of the presented methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the wave equation with variable coefficients and boundary damping and supercritical source terms. The goal of this work is devoted to prove the local and global existence, and classify decay rate of energy depending on the growth near zero on the damping term. Moreover, we prove the blow-up of the weak solution with positive initial energy as well as nonpositive initial energy.</description>

      <title>Phenotype divergence and cooperation in isogenic multicellularity and in cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the mathematical modelling of two of the main mechanisms which pushed forward the emergence of multicellularity: phenotype divergence in cell differentiation, and between-cell cooperation. In line with the atavistic theory of cancer, this disease being specific of multicellular animals, we set special emphasis on how both mechanisms appear to be reversed, however not totally impaired, rather hijacked, in tumour cell populations. Two settings are considered: the completely innovating, tinkering, situation of the emergence of multicellularity in the evolution of species, which we assume to be constrained by external pressure on the cell populations, and the completely planned-in the body plan-situation of the physiological construction of a developing multicellular animal from the zygote, or of bet hedging in tumours, assumed to be of clonal formation, although the body plan is largely-but not completely-lost in its constituting cells. We show how cancer impacts these two settings and we sketch mathematical models for them. We present here our contribution to the question at stake with a background from biology, from mathematics, and from philosophy of science.</description>

Abstract: The momentum ray transform $I_m^k$ integrates a rank $m$ symmetric tensor field $f$ on $\mathbb R^n$ over lines with the weight $t^k$, $I_m^kf(x,\xi)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty t^k\langle f(x+t\xi),\xi^m\rangle\,\mathrm{d}t$. We compute the normal operator $N_m^k=(I_m^k){}^*I_m^k$ and present an inversion formula recovering a rank $m$ tensor field $f$ from the data $(N_m^0f,\dots,N_m^mf)$.</description>

      <title>Differential Energy Equalities for Weak Solutions to the Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new results for general weak solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the three-dimensional torus, without using the strong energy inequality or other regularity assumptions. Specifically, we prove two types of differential energy equalities, in which $(d/dt)\lVert u\rVert^2$ is replaced by $2\langle \partial_t u,u\rangle$ and $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}(d/dt)\lVert u_N\rVert^2$, where the $u_N$ are projections of the original weak solution $u$. We also provide a new characterization of Leray-Hopf solutions, as weak solutions having a version for which the energy is monotonically decreasing. In order to prove these results, we first prove that both $\partial_t u$ and $\Delta u$ are in $L^{4/3}(\epsilon, T; L^{6/5})$, results that were previously known only for Leray-Hopf weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Noise through an additional variable for mean field games master equation on finite state space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical study of the well-posedness of master equation on finite state space involving terms modelling common noise. In this setting, the solution of the master equation depends on an additional variable modelling the value of a stochastic process impacting all players. Using technique from viscosity solutions, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of a Lipschitz continuous solution on any time interval. Under some structural assumptions, we are even able to treat cases in which the dynamics of this stochastic process depend on the state of the game.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider a class of evolution operators with coefficients depending on time and space variables $(t,x) \in \mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{R}^n$, where $\mathbb{T}$ is the one-dimensional torus and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for their global solvability in (time-periodic) Gelfand-Shilov spaces. The argument of the proof is based on a characterization of these spaces in terms of the eigenfunction expansions given by a fixed self-adjoint, globally elliptic differential operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the orbital stability of the 1-soliton solution for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation under perturbations in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$.

      <title>Normalized solutions of quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations with a general nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with solutions of the following quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations \begin{eqnarray*} -{\mathrm{div}}\left(\varphi^{2}(u) \nabla u\right)+\varphi(u) \varphi^{\prime}(u)|\nabla u|^{2}+\lambda u=f(u), \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^{N} \end{eqnarray*} with prescribed mass $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}} u^{2} \mathrm{d}x=c, $$ where $N\ge 3, c&gt;0$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ appears as the Lagrange multiplier and $\varphi\in C ^{1}(\mathbb{R} ,\mathbb{R}^{+})$. The nonlinearity $f \in C\left ( \mathbb{R}, \, \mathbb{R} \right )$ is allowed to be mass-subcritical, mass-critical and mass-supercritical at origin and infinity. Via a dual approach, the fixed point index and a global branch approach, we establish the existence of normalized solutions to the problem above. The results extend previous results by L. Jeanjean, J. J. Zhang and X.X. Zhong to the quasilinear case.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of self-gravitating massive fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:1712.10045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the global evolution problem for Einstein's field equations in the near-Minkowski regime and study the long-time dynamics of a massive scalar field evolving under its own gravitational field. We establish the existence of a globally hyperbolic Cauchy development associated with any initial data set that is sufficiently close to a data set in Minkowski spacetime. In addition to applying to massive fields, our theory allows us to cover metrics with slow decay in space. The strategy of proof, proposed here and referred to as the Euclidean-Hyperboloidal Foliation Method, applies, more generally, to nonlinear systems of coupled wave and Klein-Gordon equations. It is based on a spacetime foliation defined by merging together asymptotically Euclidean hypersurfaces (covering spacelike infinity) and asymptotically hyperboloidal hypersurfaces (covering timelike infinity). A transition domain (reaching null infinity) limited by two asymptotic light cones is introduced in order to realize this merging. On the one hand, we exhibit a boost-rotation hierarchy property (as we call it) which is associated with Minkowski's Killing fields and is enjoyed by commutators of curved wave operators and, on the other hand, we exhibit a metric hierarchy property (as we call it) enjoyed by components of Einstein's field equations in frames associated with our Euclidean-hyperboloidal foliation. The core of the argument is, on the one hand, the derivation of novel integral and pointwise estimates which lead us to almost sharp decay properties (at timelike, null, and spacelike infinity) and, on the other hand, the control of the (quasi-linear and semi-linear) coupling between the geometric and matter parts of the Einstein equations.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of a scheme to obtain approximate weak solutions to the (inviscid) Burgers equation in conservation and Hamilton-Jacobi form, treated as degenerate elliptic problems. We show different variants recover non-unique weak solutions as appropriate, and also specific constructive approaches to recover the corresponding entropy solutions.</description>
