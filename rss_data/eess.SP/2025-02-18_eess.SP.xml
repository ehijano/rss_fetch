      <title>PainDECOG: Machine Learning-Based Identification of Pain Biomarkers from sEEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a systematic machine-learning approach for classifying acute pain from raw electrophysiological signals. We address binary and ternary classification tasks, leveraging Power-In-Band (PIB) and signal coherence as distinguishing features. Our method evaluates the effectiveness of traditional machine learning algorithms on a manually curated electrophysiological dataset obtained from intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), offering valuable insights into model performance for pain detection. Furthermore, we identify critical electrode pairings associated with acute pain, providing a clearer understanding of the neural markers that differentiate pain states. This work highlights the potential of targeted feature engineering in advancing pain classification, setting the stage for future enhancements in real-time and personalized pain assessment tools. Additionally, these findings have promising applications in neuromodulation and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), where adaptive and closed-loop systems could leverage identified pain markers to modulate pain-related brain regions more precisely, offering improved therapeutic options for chronic pain management</description>

      <title>Blind Massive MIMO for Dense IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the downlink communication challenges in heavy-load Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks supported by frequency-division-duplexing (FDD) millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The excessive overhead required for obtaining channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is essential to achieve high spectral efficiency through conventional massive MIMO techniques; however, it hinders the deployment of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and leads to significant energy expenditure, particularly in dense IoT networks. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative CSIT-Free MIMO precoding method, referred to as CIRculant information Classification via Linear Estimation (CIRCLE). Our major contribution is the design of a CSIT-independent (or deterministic) precoding, which is constructed by leveraging the circulant permutation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. This design enables interference-free signal combining at the IoT devices. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed CIRCLE method.</description>

      <title>Robust Multidimensional Graph Neural Networks for Signal Processing in Wireless Communications with Edge-Graph Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal processing is crucial for satisfying the high data rate requirements of future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. However, the rapid growth of wireless networks has brought about massive data traffic, which hinders the application of traditional optimization theory-based algorithms. Meanwhile, traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) focus on compressing inputs onto vertices to update representations, which often leads to their inability to effectively distinguish input features and severely weakens performance. In this context, designing efficient signal processing frameworks becomes imperative. Moreover, actual scenarios are susceptible to multipath interference and noise, resulting in specific differences between the received and actual information. To address these challenges, this paper incorporates multidimensional graph neural networks (MDGNNs) with edge-graph information bottleneck (EGIB) to design a robust framework for signal processing. Specifically, MDGNNs utilize hyper-edges instead of vertices to update representations to avoid indistinguishable features and reduce information loss, while EGIB encourages providing minimal sufficient information about outputs to avoid aggregation of irrelevant information. We numerically demonstrate that compared with existing frameworks, the proposed frameworks achieve excellent performance in terms of spectrum efficiency (SE) and network overhead under multiple signal processing tasks. Remarkably, as the interference noise increases, the SE performance of the proposed frameworks gradually stabilizes. This reveals the proposed frameworks have excellent robustness in interference prone environments, especially in wireless policies related to channel matrices.</description>

      <title>DT4ECG: A Dual-Task Learning Framework for ECG-Based Human Identity Recognition and Human Activity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces DT4ECG, an innovative dual-task learning framework for Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based human identity recognition and activity detection. The framework employs a robust one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) backbone integrated with residual blocks to extract discriminative ECG features. To enhance feature representation, we propose a novel Sequence Channel Attention (SCA) mechanism, which combines channel-wise and sequential context attention to prioritize informative features across both temporal and channel dimensions. Furthermore, to address gradient imbalance in multi-task learning, we integrate GradNorm, a technique that dynamically adjusts loss weights based on gradient magnitudes, ensuring balanced training across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, achieving accuracy rates of 99.12% in ID classification and 90.11% in activity classification. These findings underscore the potential of the DT4ECG framework in enhancing security and user experience across various applications such as fitness monitoring and personalized healthcare, thereby presenting a transformative approach to integrating ECG-based biometrics in everyday technologies.</description>

      <title>Improved VMD Based Remote Heartbeat Estimation Utilizing 60GHz mmWave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an improved VMD based signal decomposition methodology for non-contact heartbeat estimation using millimeterwave (mmWave) radar. Specifically, we first analyze the signal model of the mmWave radar system. The Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) integrated with the Newton-Raphson-based optimizer (NRBO) algorithm are sequentially utilized for cardiac mechanic signal (CMS) reconstruction. The estimation accuracy is enhanced by adaptively optimizing the VMD parameters including intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and penalty factor. Eventually, the experimental results of 18 subjects validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with three commonly used baselines.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Power of Complex-Valued Transformers in Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) in wireless communication tasks has received growing attention for their ability to provide natural and effective representation of complex-valued signals and data. However, existing studies typically employ complex-valued versions of simple neural network architectures. Not only they merely scratch the surface of the extensive range of modern deep learning techniques, theoretical understanding of the superior performance of CVNNs is missing. To this end, this paper aims to fill both the theoretical and practice gap of employing CVNNs in wireless communications. In particular, we provide a comprehensive description on the various operations in CVNNs and theoretically prove that the CVNN requires fewer layers than the real-valued counterpart to achieve a given approximation error of a continuous function. Furthermore, to advance CVNNs in the field of wireless communications, this paper focuses on the transformer model, which represents a more sophisticated deep learning architecture and has been shown to have excellent performance in wireless communications but only in its real-valued form. In this aspect, we propose a fundamental paradigm of complex-valued transformers for wireless communications. Leveraging this structure, we develop customized complex-valued transformers for three representative applications in wireless communications: channel estimation, user activity detection, and precoding design. These applications utilize transformers with varying levels of sophistication and span a variety of tasks, ranging from regression to classification, supervised to unsupervised learning, and specific module design to end-to-end design. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the complex-valued transformers for the above three applications compared to other traditional real-valued neural network-based methods.</description>

      <title>Robust correlation measures for informative frequency band selection in heavy-tailed vibration signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibration signals are commonly used to detect local damage in rotating machinery. However, raw signals are often noisy, particularly in crusher machines, where the technological process (falling pieces of rock) generates random impulses that complicate detection. To address this, signal pre-filtering (extracting the informative frequency band from noise-affected signals) is necessary. This paper proposes an algorithm for processing vibration signals from a bearing used in an ore crusher. Selecting informative frequency bands (IFBs) in the presence of impulsive noise is notably challenging. The approach employs correlation maps to detect cyclic behavior within specific frequency bands in the time-frequency domain (spectrogram), enabling the identification of IFBs. Robust correlation measures and median filtering are applied to enhance the correlation maps and improve the final IFB selection. Signal segmentation and the use of averaged results for IFB selection are also highlighted. The proposed trimmed and quadrant correlations are compablack with the Pearson and Kendall correlations using simulated signal, real vibration signal from crusher in mining industry and acoustic signal measublack on the test rig. Furthermore, the results of real vibration analyses are compablack with established IFB selectors, including the spectral kurtosis, the alpha selector and the conditional variance-based selector.</description>

      <title>Non-negative tensor factorization-based dependence map analysis for local damage detection in presence of non-Gaussian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-frequency map (TFM) is frequently used in condition monitoring, necessitating further processing to select an informative frequency band (IFB) or directly detect damage. However, selecting an IFB is challenging due to the complexity of spectral structures, non-Gaussian disturbances, and overlapping fault signatures in vibration signals. Additionally, dynamic operating conditions and low signal-to-noise ratio further complicate the identification of relevant features that indicate damage. To solve this problem, the present work proposes a novel method for informative band selection and local damage detection in rolling element bearings, utilizing non-negative tensor factorization (NTF)-based dependence map analysis. The recently introduced concept of the dependence map is leveraged, with a set of these maps being factorized to separate informative components from non-informative ones. Dependence maps provide valuable information on the auto-similarity of spectral content, while NTF, a powerful tool commonly used in image processing for feature extraction, enhances this process. The combination of these methods allows for the extraction of IFBs, forming the basis for local damage detection. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated using both synthetic and real vibration signals corrupted with non-Gaussian disturbances.</description>

      <title>Set-Based Position Ambiguity Reduction Method for Zonotope Shadow Matching in Urban Areas Using Estimated Multipath Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In urban areas, the quality of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals deteriorates, leading to reduced positioning accuracy. To address this issue, 3D-mapping-aided (3DMA) techniques, such as shadow matching and zonotope shadow matching (ZSM), have been proposed. However, these methods can introduce a problem known as multi-modal position ambiguity, making it challenging to select the exact mode in which the receiver is located. Accurately selecting the correct mode is essential for improving positioning accuracy. A previous study proposed a method that uses satellite-pseudorange consistency (SPC), calculated from pseudorange measurements, to select the mode containing the receiver. This method achieved a mode selection accuracy of approximately 78%. To further enhance accuracy, the study utilized pseudorange measurements collected at multiple timesteps from a fixed location and a trained line-of-sight (LOS) classifier. However, in practice, collecting data at multiple timesteps from the same location in dynamic environments is challenging. Moreover, the performance of the trained LOS classifier heavily depends on the surrounding environment, leading to low reliability. In this study, we propose a method that estimates and corrects multipath errors based on the mode distribution obtained from the output of ZSM and extract an enhanced SPC using the corrected pseudorange measurements. This enables high mode selection accuracy using only single-timestep pseudorange measurements, without requiring a trained LOS classifier.</description>

      <title>Numerical Differentiation-based Electrophysiology-Aware Adaptive ResNet for Inverse ECG Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiographic imaging aims to noninvasively reconstruct the electrical dynamic patterns on the heart surface from body-surface ECG measurements, aiding the mechanistic study of cardiac function. At the core of ECGI lies the inverse ECG problem, a mathematically ill-conditioned challenge where small body measurement errors or noise can lead to significant inaccuracies in the reconstructed heart-surface potentials. %Leveraging a well-developed electrophysiological (EP) model, our previous study developed an EP-informed deep learning framework, demonstrating promising effectiveness in improving cardiac map predictions. To improve the accuracy of ECGI and ensure that cardiac predictions adhere to established physical principles, recent advances have incorporated well-established electrophysiology (EP) laws into their model formulations. However, traditional EP-informed models encounter significant challenges, including overfitting to EP constraints, limitations in network scalability, and suboptimal initialization. These issues compromise prediction accuracy and stability, hindering their effectiveness in practical applications. This highlights the need for an advanced data analytic and predictive tool to achieve reliable cardiac electrodynamic restoration. Here, we present a Numerical Differentiation-based Electrophysiology-Aware Adaptive Residual neural Network (EAND-ARN) for robust inverse ECG modeling. Our method employs numerical differentiation to compute the spatiotemporal derivative, enabling EP constraints to be applied across a local spatiotemporal region, thereby strengthening the overall EP enforcement. Additionally, we design an adaptive residual network to improve gradient flow, enhancing predictive accuracy and mitigating issues with poor initialization. Experimental results show that EAND-ARN significantly outperforms existing methods in current practice.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Design for Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in millimeter wave is a key enabler for next-generation networks, which leverages large bandwidth and extensive antenna arrays, benefiting both communication and sensing functionalities. The associated high costs can be mitigated by adopting a hybrid beamforming structure. However, the well-studied monostatic ISAC systems face challenges related to full-duplex operation. To address this issue, this paper focuses on a three-dimensional bistatic configuration that requires only half-duplex base stations. To intuitively evaluate the error bound of bistatic sensing using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms, we propose a positioning scheme that combines angle-of-arrival and time-of-arrival estimation, deriving the closed-form expression of the position error bound (PEB). Using this PEB, we develop two hybrid beamforming algorithms for joint waveform design, aimed at maximizing achievable spectral efficiency (SE) while ensuring a predefined PEB threshold. The first algorithm leverages a Riemannian trust-region approach, achieving superior performance in terms of global optima and convergence speed compared to conventional gradient-based methods, but with higher complexity. In contrast, the second algorithm, which employs orthogonal matching pursuit, offers a more computationally efficient solution, delivering reasonable SE while maintaining the PEB constraint. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs.</description>

      <title>Statistical and Deterministic RCS Characterization for ISAC Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we perform a statistical analysis of the radar cross section (RCS) for various test targets in an indoor factory at \(25\)-\(28\) GHz, with the goal of formulating parameters that may be used for target identification and other sensing applications for future wireless systems. The analysis is conducted based on measurements in monostatic and bistatic configurations for bistatic angles of \(20^\circ\), \(40^\circ\), and \(60^\circ\), which are functions of transmitter-receiver (T-R) and target positions, via accurate \(3\)dB beamwidth of \(10^\circ\) in both azimuth and elevation planes. The test targets include unmanned aerial vehicles, an autonomous mobile robot, and a robotic arm. We utilize parametric statistical distributions to fit the measured RCS data. The analysis reveals that the \textit{lognormal and gamma distributions} are effective in modeling the RCS of the test targets over different reflecting points of the target itself, i.e. when target is in motion. Additionally, we provide a framework for evaluating the deterministic bistatic RCS of a rectangular sheet of laminated wood, due to its widespread use in indoor hotspot environments. Novel deterministic and statistical RCS models are evaluated, incorporating dependencies on the bistatic angle, T-R distance (\(2\)m -\(10\)m) and the target. The results demonstrate that some proposed RCS models accurately fit the measured data, highlighting their applicability in bistatic configurations.</description>

      <title>Uniform Resampling vs. Image Blur: Aliasing Approximation via Isotropic Gaussian Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key approximations to range simulation is downscaling the image, dictated by the natural trigonometric relationships that arise due to long-distance viewing. It is well-known that standard downsampling applied to an image without prior low-pass filtering leads to a type of signal distortion called $aliasing$. In this study, we aim at modeling the distortion due to aliasing and show that a downsampled/upsampled image after an interpolation process can be very well approximated through the application of isotropic Gaussian low-pass filtering to the original image. In other words, the distortion due to aliasing can approximately be generated by low-pass filtering the image with a carefully determined cut-off frequency. We have found that the standard deviation of the isotropic Gaussian kernel $\sigma$ and the reduction factor $m$ (also called downsampling ratio) satisfy an approximate $m \approx 2 \sigma$ relationship. We provide both theoretical and practical arguments using two relatively small face datasets (Chicago DB, LRFID) as well as TinyImageNet to corroborate this empirically observed relationship.</description>

      <title>Training Channel Selection for Learning-based 1-bit Precoding in Massive MU-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based algorithms have gained great popularity in communications since they often outperform even carefully engineered solutions by learning from training samples. In this paper, we show that the selection of appropriate training examples can be important for the performance of such learning-based algorithms. In particular, we consider non-linear 1-bit precoding for massive multi-user MIMO systems using the C2PO algorithm. While previous works have already shown the advantages of learning critical coefficients of this algorithm, we demonstrate that straightforward selection of training samples that follow the channel model distribution does not necessarily lead to the best result. Instead, we provide a strategy to generate training data based on the specific properties of the algorithm, which significantly improves its error floor performance.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Covert Transmission and mmWave ISAC for Secure IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the synergy of physical layer covert transmission and millimeter wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) to improve the performance, and enable secure internet of things (IoT) systems. Specifically, we employ a physical layer covert transmission as a prism, which can achieve simultaneously transmitting confidential signals to a covert communication user equipment (UE) in the presence of a warden and regular communication UEs. We design the transmit beamforming to guarantee information transmission security, communication quality-of-service (QoS) and sensing accuracy. By considering two different beamforming architectures, i.e., fully digital beamforming (FDBF) and hybrid beamforming (HBF), an optimal design method and a low-cost beamforming scheme are proposed to address the corresponding problems, respectively. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FDBF/HBF algorithms compared with traditional algorithms in terms of information transmission security, communication QoS and target detection performance.</description>

      <title>A method for signal components identification in acoustic signal with non-Gaussian background noise using clustering of data in time-frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for fault detection in vibration/acoustic signals contaminated with non-Gaussian noise, specifically addressing the challenge of random impulsive and wideband disturbances in industrial measurements. While damage detection in Gaussian noise environments is well understood, high-amplitude non-cyclic impulsive disturbances arising from random aspects of industrial processes, such as non-uniform operations and random impacts, pose significant analytical challenges. The proposed method analyzes the distribution densities of spectral vectors derived from spectrograms. It considers a simple additive model consisting of the signal of interest (SOI) and Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise. Using the density-based spatial clustering algorithm (DBSCAN), the method isolates distinct classes of spectral vectors from the spectrogram, effectively separating different signal behaviors and extracting fault-related information. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated using an envelope spectrum-based indicator (ENVSI) and successfully demonstrated on real signals from an industrial machine with a faulty bearing.</description>

      <title>Signal-adapted decomposition of graph signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of signals defined on complex topologies modeled by graphs is a topic of increasing interest. Signal decomposition plays a crucial role in the representation and processing of such information, in particular, to process graph signals based on notions of scale (e.g., coarse to fine). The graph spectrum is more irregular than for conventional domains; i.e., it is influenced by graph topology, and, therefore, assumptions about spectral representations of graph signals are not easy to make. Here, we propose a tight frame design that is adapted to the graph Laplacian spectral content of given classes of graph signals. The design is based on using the ensemble energy spectral density, a notion of spectral content of given signal sets that we determine either directly using the graph Fourier transform or indirectly through a polynomial-based approximation scheme. The approximation scheme has the benefit that (i) it does not require eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix making the method feasible for large graphs, and (ii) it leads to a smooth estimate of the spectral content. A prototype system of spectral kernels each capturing an equal amount of energy is initially defined and subsequently warped using the signal set's ensemble energy spectral density such that the resulting subbands each capture an equal amount of ensemble energy. This approach accounts at the same time for graph topology and signal features, and it provides a meaningful interpretation of subbands in terms of coarse-to-fine representations. We also show how more simplified designs of signal-adapted decomposition of graph signals can be adopted based on ensemble energy estimates. We show the application of proposed methods on the Minnesota road graph and three different designs of brain graphs derived from neuroimaging data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AESA technology enables RF systems to not only perform various radar, communication and electronic warfare tasks on a single aperture, but even to execute multiple tasks concurrently. These capabilities increase system complexity and require intelligent or cognitive resource management. This paper introduces such a resource management framework based on quality of service based resource allocation and Monte Carlo tree search allowing for optimal system usage and profound decision-making. Furthermore, we present experimental verification in a complex application scenario.</description>

      <title>A MIMO Wireless Channel Foundation Model via CIR-CSI Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, self-supervised learning has demonstrated superior generalization capabilities by leveraging large-scale unlabeled datasets for pretraining, which is especially critical for wireless communication models to adapt to a variety of scenarios. This paper innovatively treats Channel State Information (CSI) and Channel Impulse Response (CIR) as naturally aligned multi-modal data and proposes the first MIMO wireless channel foundation model, named CSI-CLIP. By effectively capturing the joint representations of both CIR and CSI, CSI-CLIP exhibits remarkable adaptability across scenarios and robust feature extraction capabilities. Experimental results show that in positioning task, CSI-CLIP reduces the mean error distance by 22%; in beam management task, it increases accuracy by 1% compared to traditional supervised methods, as well as in the channel identification task. These improvements not only highlight the potential and value of CSI-CLIP in integrating sensing and communication but also demonstrate its significant advantages over existing techniques. Moreover, viewing CSI and CIR as multi-modal pairs and contrastive learning for wireless channel foundation model open up new research directions in the domain of MIMO wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Inception networks, Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning in EEG-based photosensitivity diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosensitivity refers to a neurophysiological condition in which the brain generates epileptic discharges known as Photoparoxysmal Responses (PPR) in response to light flashes.In severe cases, these PPR can lead to epileptic seizures. The standardized diagnostic procedure for this condition is called Intermittent Photic Stimulation. During this procedure, the patient is exposed to a flashing light, aiming to trigger these epileptic reactions while preventing their full development. Meanwhile, brain activity is monitored using Electroencephalography, which is visually analyzed by clinical staff to identify these responses. Hence, the automatic detection of PPR becomes a highly unbalanced problem that has been barely studied in the literature due to photosensitivity's low prevalence. This research tackles this problem and proposes using Inception-based Deep Learning (DL) neural networks that, together with transfer learning, are trained in epilepsy seizure detection and tuned in the PPR automatic detection task. A Data Augmentation (DA) technique is also applied to balance the available data set, evaluating its effects on the DL models. The proposal outperformed state-of-the-art solutions in the literature, achieving higher ratios on standard performance metrics, and with DA significantly improving the Sensitivity without affecting Accuracy and Specificity. This project is currently being developed with patients from Burgos University Hospital, Spain</description>

      <title>WeVibe: Weight Change Estimation Through Audio-Induced Shelf Vibrations In Autonomous Stores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weight change estimation is crucial in various applications, particularly for detecting pick-up and put-back actions when people interact with the shelf while shopping in autonomous stores. Moreover, accurate weight change estimation allows autonomous stores to automatically identify items being picked up or put back, ensuring precise cost estimation. However, the conventional approach of estimating weight changes requires specialized weight-sensing shelves, which are densely deployed weight scales, incurring intensive sensor consumption and high costs. Prior works explored the vibration-based weight sensing method, but they failed when the location of weight change varies.
  In response to these limitations, we made the following contributions: (1) We propose WeVibe, a first item weight change estimation system through active shelf vibration sensing. The main intuition of the system is that the weight placed on the shelf influences the dynamic vibration response of the shelf, thus altering the shelf vibration patterns. (2) We model a physics-informed relationship between the shelf vibration response and item weight across multiple locations on the shelf based on structural dynamics theory. This relationship is linear and allows easy training of a weight estimation model at a new location without heavy data collection. (3) We evaluate our system on a gondola shelf organized as the real-store settings. WeVibe achieved a mean absolute error down to 38.07g and a standard deviation of 31.2g with one sensor and 10% samples from three weight classes on estimating weight change from 0g to 450g, which can be leveraged for differentiating items with more than 100g differences.</description>

      <title>BS-Breath: Respiration Sensing with Cell-free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of respiration pattern estimation utilizing a communication-centric cellfree massive MIMO OFDM Base Station (BS). The sensing target is typically positioned near the User Equipment (UE), which transmits uplink pilots to the BS. Our results demonstrate the potential of massive MIMO systems for accurate and reliable vital sign estimation. Initially, we adopt a single antenna sensing solution that combines multiple subcarriers and a breathing projection to align the 2D complex breathing pattern to a single displacement dimension. Then, Weighted Antenna Combining (WAC) aggregates the 1D breathing signals from multiple antennas. The results demonstrate that the combination of space-frequency resources specifically in terms of subcarriers and antennas yields higher accuracy than using only a single antenna or subcarrier. Our results significantly improved respiration estimation accuracy by using multiple subcarriers and antennas. With WAC, we achieved an average correlation of 0.8 with ground truth data, compared to 0.6 for single antenna or subcarrier methods, a 0.2 correlation increase. Moreover, the system produced perfect breathing rate estimates. These findings suggest that the limited bandwidth (18 MHz in the testbed) can be effectively compensated by utilizing spatial resources, such as distributed antennas.</description>

      <title>Musical Score Following using Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Musical score following is the real-time mapping of a performance to corresponding locations in a musical score. Score following can be used in a variety of applications including automatic page turning and real-time accompaniment. This report presents a novel approach for score following motivated by Wilson and Adams's 2013 paper, which introduces Spectral Mixture (SM) kernels for Gaussian Process (GP) regression. Since the SM kernel is derived from a Mixture of Gaussians in the frequency domain, it is particularly suitable for modelling the superposed power spectra of musical notes, in which energy is concentrated at multiples of the fundamental frequency of each note. Our score follower begins by using a GP to statistically infer the musical notes played during 800-sample 'audioframes' (~18 ms) of solo piano music. These predictions are then used in a duration-dependent Hidden Markov Model to predict the most likely score positions in real time. Our two-stage approach achieves successful score following not only on four-part hymns arranged for keyboard, but also on pieces for the violin, oboe, and flute. This showcases the powerful and flexible nature of GPs for statistical inference on musical audio signals. Given the success of this project, we contribute to the literature a first proof of concept of the application of GPs in score following, and more broadly, in online Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks. This project also contributes a working score follower product that renders score position in real time using an adapted open-source user interface. Areas for future work include improving accuracy on repeated notes and during heavy use of sustain pedal, adapting to minor deviations from the score, and modelling multi-instrument works.</description>

      <title>Multi-view 3D surface reconstruction from SAR images by inverse rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction of a scene from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images mainly relies on interferometric measurements, which involve strict constraints on the acquisition process. These last years, progress in deep learning has significantly advanced 3D reconstruction from multiple views in optical imaging, mainly through reconstruction-by-synthesis approaches pioneered by Neural Radiance Fields. In this paper, we propose a new inverse rendering method for 3D reconstruction from unconstrained SAR images, drawing inspiration from optical approaches. First, we introduce a new simplified differentiable SAR rendering model, able to synthesize images from a digital elevation model and a radar backscattering coefficients map. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to fit the height and appearance of a given radar scene from a few SAR views. Finally, we demonstrate the surface reconstruction capabilities of our method on synthetic SAR images produced by ONERA's physically-based EMPRISE simulator. Our method showcases the potential of exploiting geometric disparities in SAR images and paves the way for multi-sensor data fusion.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerically-stable parallel-in-time linear Kalman smoother. The smoother uses a novel highly-parallel QR factorization for a class of structured sparse matrices for state estimation, and an adaptation of the SelInv selective-inversion algorithm to evaluate the covariance matrices of estimated states. Our implementation of the new algorithm, using the Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library, scales well on both Intel and ARM multi-core servers, achieving speedups of up to 47x on 64 cores. The algorithm performs more arithmetic than sequential smoothers; consequently it is 1.8x to 2.5x slower on a single core. The new algorithm is faster and scales better than the parallel Kalman smoother proposed by S\"arkk\"a and Garc\'{\i}a-Fern\'andez in 2021.</description>

      <title>Token Communications: A Unified Framework for Cross-modal Context-aware Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a unified framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. We demonstrate the corresponding TokCom benefits in a GenSC setup for image, leveraging cross-modal context information, which increases the bandwidth efficiency by 70.8% with negligible loss of semantic/perceptual quality. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Wearable-based Fair and Accurate Pain Assessment Using Multi-Attribute Fairness Loss in Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of diverse health data, such as IoT (Internet of Things), EHR (Electronic Health Record), and clinical surveys, with scalable AI(Artificial Intelligence) has enabled the identification of physical, behavioral, and psycho-social indicators of pain. However, the adoption of AI in clinical pain evaluation is hindered by challenges like personalization and fairness. Many AI models, including machine and deep learning, exhibit biases, discriminating against specific groups based on gender or ethnicity, causing skepticism among medical professionals about their reliability. This paper proposes a Multi-attribute Fairness Loss (MAFL) based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to account for protected attributes in data, ensuring fair pain status predictions while minimizing disparities between privileged and unprivileged groups. We evaluate whether a balance between accuracy and fairness is achievable by comparing the proposed model with existing mitigation methods. Our findings indicate that the model performs favorably against state-of-the-art techniques. Using the NIH All-Of-US dataset, comprising data from 868 individuals over 1500 days, we demonstrate our model's effectiveness, achieving accuracy rates between 75% and 85%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a number of applications in signal processing, we study the following question. Given samples of a multidimensional signal of the form \begin{align*} f(\bs\ell)=\sum_{k=1}^K a_k\exp(-i\langle \bs\ell, \w_k\rangle), \\ \w_1,\cdots,\w_k\in\mathbb{R}^q, \ \bs\ell\in \ZZ^q, \ |\bs\ell| &lt;n, \end{align*} determine the values of the number $K$ of components, and the parameters $a_k$ and $\w_k$'s. We develop an algorithm to recuperate these quantities accurately using only a subsample of size $\O(qn)$ of this data. For this purpose, we use a novel localized kernel method to identify the parameters, including the number $K$ of signals. Our method is easy to implement, and is shown to be stable under a very low SNR range. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our resulting algorithm using 2 and 3 dimensional examples from the literature, and show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art techniques including Prony based, MUSIC and ESPRIT approaches.</description>

Abstract: In order to bolster future wireless networks, there has been a great deal of interest in non-terrestrial networks, especially aerial platforms including high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). These platforms can integrate advanced technologies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In this regard, this paper proposes a multi-layer network architecture consisting of HAPS and UAV, where the former acts as a HAPS super macro base station (HAPS-SMBS), while the latter serves as a relay node for the ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The UAV is equipped with active transmissive RIS, which is a novel technology with promising benefits. We also utilize multiple-input single-output (MISO) technology, i.e., multiple antennas at the HAPS-SMBS and a single antenna at the IoT devices. Additionally, we consider NOMA as the multiple access technology as well as the existence of hardware impairments as a practical limitation. We compare the proposed system model with various scenarios, all involving the HAPS-SMBS and RIS-equipped UAV relay combination, but with different types of RIS, antenna configurations, and access technologies. Sum rate and energy efficiency are used as performance metrics, and the findings demonstrate that, in comparison to all benchmarks, the proposed system yields significant performance gains. Moreover, hardware impairment limits the system performance at high transmit power levels.</description>

      <title>Real-time Deformation Correction in Additively Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays</title>

Abstract: Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $&lt;1.25^\circ$. The silicon based array processing part occupying only 2.58 mm$^2$ area and 83 mW power per tile.</description>

      <title>Analog Beamforming Aided by Full-Dimension One-Bit Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of analog beamforming at the receiver in millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, aided by full digital chains featuring 1-bit ADCs. We advocate utilizing these full digital chains to facilitate rapid channel estimation and beam acquisition for subsequent communication, even without prior knowledge of the training pilots. To balance energy consumption and implementation costs, we opt for 1-bit ADCs. We propose a two-stage maximum likelihood (ML)-based algorithm to estimate angles of arrival (AoAs) and facilitate the design of analog beamforming to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We validate our proposed beamforming schemes in narrowband coherent channels through synthetic testing and in wideband coherent channels, particularly under the 3GPP clustered-delay-line (CDL)-C channel model.</description>

      <title>CBraMod: A Criss-Cross Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjq-learning/CBraMod.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to the linear filtering and smoothing problem and demonstrate its applicability to nonlinear filtering. For the linear case, our main theorem provides an explicit expression for the conditional distribution of the hidden process given the observations, leading to a novel derivation of the linear filtering and smoothing equations.

      <title>LoRa Fine Synchronization with Two-Pass Time and Frequency Offset Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LoRa is currently one of the most widely used low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies. The physical layer leverages a chirp spread spectrum modulation to achieve long-range communication with low power consumption. Synchronization at long distances is a challenging task as the spread signal can lie multiple orders of magnitude below the thermal noise floor. Multiple research works have proposed synchronization algorithms for LoRa under different hardware impairments. However, the impact of sampling frequency offset (SFO) has mostly either been ignored or tracked only during the data phase, but it often harms synchronization. In this work, we extend existing synchronization algorithms for LoRa to estimate and compensate SFO already in the preamble and show that this early compensation has a critical impact on the estimation of other impairments such as carrier frequency offset and sampling time offset. Therefore it is critical to recover long-range signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is a powerful and versatile physical layer multiple access technique that generalizes and has better interference management capabilities than 5G-based Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA). It is also a rapidly maturing technology, all of which makes it a natural successor to SDMA in 6G. In this article, we describe RSMA's suitability for 6G by presenting: i) link and system level simulations of RSMA's performance gains over SDMA in realistic environments, and (ii) pioneering experimental results that demonstrate RSMA's gains over SDMA for key use cases like enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBb), and Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC). We also comment on the status of standardization activities for RSMA.</description>

      <title>Graph Learning Across Data Silos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06662v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring graph topology from smooth graph signals in a novel but practical scenario where data are located in distributed clients and prohibited from leaving local clients due to factors such as privacy concerns. The main difficulty in this task is how to exploit the potentially heterogeneous data of all clients under data silos. To this end, we first propose an auto-weighted multiple graph learning model to jointly learn a personalized graph for each local client and a single consensus graph for all clients. The personalized graphs match local data distributions, thereby mitigating data heterogeneity, while the consensus graph captures the global information. Moreover, the model can automatically assign appropriate contribution weights to local graphs based on their similarity to the consensus graph. We next devise a tailored algorithm to solve the induced problem, where all raw data are processed locally without leaving clients. Theoretically, we establish a provable estimation error bound and convergence analysis for the proposed model and algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments on synthetic and real data are carried out, and the results illustrate that our approach can learn graphs effectively in the target scenario.</description>

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised beamforming neural network (BNN) and a supervised reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) convolutional neural network (CNN) to optimize transmit beamforming and RIS coefficients of multi-input single-output (MISO) downlink with RIS assistance. To avoid frequent beam updates, the proposed BNN and RIS CNN are based on slow-changing channel covariances and are different from most other neural networks that utilize channel instances. Numerical simulations show that the proposed BNN with RIS CNN can achieve much higher sum rates than zeroforcing beamforming with waterfilling power allocation does, especially for systems with higher load, and reduces computation time.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Rich Feedback HARQ for Energy-Efficient Uplink Short Packet Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The trade-off between reliability, latency, and energy efficiency is a central problem in communication systems. Advanced hybrid automated repeat request (HARQ) techniques reduce retransmissions required for reliable communication but incur high computational costs. Strict energy constraints apply mainly to devices, while the access point receiving their packets is usually connected to the electrical grid. Therefore, moving the computational complexity from the transmitter to the receiver may provide a way to improve this trade-off. We propose the reinforcement-based adaptive feedback (RAF) scheme, a departure from traditional single-bit feedback HARQ, introducing adaptive rich feedback where the receiver requests the coded retransmission of specific symbols. Simulation results show that RAF achieves a better trade-off between energy efficiency, reliability, and latency, compared to existing HARQ solutions. Our RAF scheme can easily adapt to different modulation schemes and can also generalize to different channel statistics.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication and Sensing in OTFS-based UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of accurately localizing $N$ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in 3D space where the UAVs are part of a swarm and communicate with each other through orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulated signals. The OTFS communication system operates in the delay-Doppler domain and can simultaneously provide range and velocity information about the scatterers in the channels at no additional cost. Each receiving UAV estimates the multipath wireless channel on each link formed by the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission and by the single reflections from the remaining $N-2$ UAVs. The estimated channel delay profiles are communicated to an edge server to estimate the location and velocity of the UAVs from the relative echo delay (RED) measurements between the LoS and the non-LoS paths. To accurately obtain such estimations, we propose a solution called Turbo Iterative Positioning (TIP), initialized by a belief-propagation approach. Enabling a full cold start (no prior knowledge of initial positions), the belief propagation first provides a map associating each echo to a reflecting UAV. The localization of the $N$ UAVs is then derived by iteratively alternating a gradient descent optimization and a refinement of the association maps between UAVs and echos. Given that the OTFS receivers also acquire the Doppler shifts of each path, the UAV's velocities can be sensed jointly with communication. Our numerical results, obtained also using real-world traces, show how the multipath links are beneficial to achieving very accurate position and velocity for all UAVs, even with a limited delay-Doppler resolution. The robustness of our scheme is proven by its performance approaching the Cramer-Rao bound.</description>

      <title>Wideband Relative Transfer Function (RTF) Estimation Exploiting Frequency Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on estimating relative transfer functions (RTFs) for beamforming applications. Traditional methods often assume that spectra are uncorrelated, an assumption that is often violated in practical scenarios due to factors such as time-domain windowing or the non-stationary nature of signals, as observed in speech. To overcome these limitations, we propose an RTF estimation technique that leverages spectral and spatial correlations through subspace analysis. Additionally, we derive Cram\'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for the RTF estimation task, providing theoretical insights into the achievable estimation accuracy. These bounds reveal that channel estimation can be performed more accurately if the noise or the target signal exhibits spectral correlations. Experiments with both real and synthetic data show that our technique outperforms the narrowband maximum-likelihood estimator, known as covariance whitening (CW), when the target exhibits spectral correlations. Although the proposed algorithm generally achieves accuracy close to the theoretical bound, there is potential for further improvement, especially in scenarios with highly spectrally correlated noise. While channel estimation has various applications, we demonstrate the method using a minimum variance distortionless (MVDR) beamformer for multichannel speech enhancement. A free Python implementation is also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an algorithm for downlink (DL) channel covariance matrix (CCM) estimation for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with base station (BS) possessing a uniform linear array (ULA) antenna structure. We consider a setting where the UL CCM is mapped to DL CCM by a mapping function. We first present a theoretical error analysis of learning a nonlinear embedding by constructing a mapping function, which points to the importance of the Lipschitz regularity of the mapping function for achieving high estimation performance. Then, based on the theoretical ground, we propose a representation learning algorithm as a solution for the estimation problem, where Gaussian RBF kernel interpolators are chosen to map UL CCMs to their DL counterparts. The proposed algorithm is based on the optimization of an objective function that fits a regression model between the DL CCM and UL CCM samples in the training dataset and preserves the local geometric structure of the data in the UL CCM space, while explicitly regulating the Lipschitz continuity of the mapping function in light of our theoretical findings. The proposed algorithm surpasses benchmark methods in terms of three error metrics as shown by simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel dataset for multi-robot activity recognition (MRAR) using two robotic arms integrating WiFi channel state information (CSI), video, and audio data. This multimodal dataset utilizes signals of opportunity, leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure to provide detailed indoor environmental sensing without additional sensor deployment. Data were collected using two Franka Emika robotic arms, complemented by three cameras, three WiFi sniffers to collect CSI, and three microphones capturing distinct yet complementary audio data streams. The combination of CSI, visual, and auditory data can enhance robustness and accuracy in MRAR. This comprehensive dataset enables a holistic understanding of robotic environments, facilitating advanced autonomous operations that mimic human-like perception and interaction. By repurposing ubiquitous WiFi signals for environmental sensing, this dataset offers significant potential aiming to advance robotic perception and autonomous systems. It provides a valuable resource for developing sophisticated decision-making and adaptive capabilities in dynamic environments.</description>

Abstract: Human sensing, which employs various sensors and advanced deep learning technologies to accurately capture and interpret human body information, has significantly impacted fields like public security and robotics. However, current human sensing primarily depends on modalities such as cameras and LiDAR, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Furthermore, existing multi-modal fusion solutions are typically designed for fixed modality combinations, requiring extensive retraining when modalities are added or removed for diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modality-invariant foundation model for all modalities, X-Fi, to address this issue. X-Fi enables the independent or combinatory use of sensor modalities without additional training by utilizing a transformer structure to accommodate variable input sizes and incorporating a novel "X-fusion" mechanism to preserve modality-specific features during multimodal integration. This approach not only enhances adaptability but also facilitates the learning of complementary features across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets, employing six distinct modalities, demonstrate that X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation (HPE) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. The findings indicate that our proposed model can efficiently support a wide range of human sensing applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution of scalable, multimodal sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Adaptive NAD: Online and Self-adaptive Unsupervised Network Anomaly Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised the risks of cyber threats, thus developing Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) that can adapt to evolving or new attacks is critical. Previous studies primarily focused on offline unsupervised learning methods to safeguard ADSs, which is not applicable in practical real-world applications. Besides, most of them strongly rely on assumptions of known legitimates and fail to satisfy the interpretable requirements in security applications, creating barriers to the adoption in practice. In this paper, we design Adaptive NAD, a general framework to improve and interpret online unsupervised anomaly detection in security domains. An interpretable two-layer anomaly detection strategy is proposed to generate reliable high-confidence pseudo-labels. Then, an online learning scheme is introduced to update Adaptive NAD by a novel threshold calculation technique to adapt to new threats. Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive NAD achieves more than 5.4%, 23.0%, and 3.2% improvements in SPAUC compared with state-of-the-art solutions on the CIC-Darknet2020, CIC-DoHBrw-2020, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively.

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Multi-User Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal beamforming design for multi-user continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems is proposed. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), the beamformer for CAPA is a continuous function rather than a discrete vector or matrix, rendering beamforming optimization a non-convex integral-based functional programming. To address this challenging issue, the closed-form optimal structure of the CAPA beamformer is first derived for maximizing generic system utility functions, by addressing the inversion of continuous functions and using the Lagrangian duality and the calculus of variations. The derived optimal structure is a linear combination of the continuous channel responses for CAPA, with the linear weights determined by the channel correlations. As a further advance, a monotonic optimization method is proposed for obtaining globally optimal CAPA beamforming based on the derived optimal structure. More particularly, a closed-form fixed-point iteration is proposed to obtain the globally optimal solution to the power minimization problem for CAPA beamforming. Furthermore, based on the optimal structure, the low-complexity maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) designs for CAPA beamforming are derived. It is theoretically proved that: 1) the MRT and ZF designs are asymptotically optimal in low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, respectively, and 2) the MMSE design is optimal for signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) maximization. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and reveal that: i) CAPA achieves significant communication performance gain over SPDA, and ii) the MMSE design achieves nearly optimal performance in most cases, while the MRT and ZF designs achieve nearly optimal performance in specific cases</description>

      <title>Gaussian multi-target filtering with target dynamics driven by a stochastic differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes multi-target filtering algorithms in which target dynamics are given in continuous time and measurements are obtained at discrete time instants. In particular, targets appear according to a Poisson point process (PPP) in time with a given Gaussian spatial distribution, targets move according to a general time-invariant linear stochastic differential equation, and the life span of each target is modelled with an exponential distribution. For this multi-target dynamic model, we derive the distribution of the set of new born targets and calculate closed-form expressions for the best fitting mean and covariance of each target at its time of birth by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence via moment matching. This yields a novel Gaussian continuous-discrete Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter, and its approximations based on Poisson multi-Bernoulli and probability hypothesis density filtering. These continuous-discrete multi-target filters are also extended to target dynamics driven by nonlinear stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Discrete Speech Tokens: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has established discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm for speech representation. These tokens, characterized by their discrete, compact, and concise nature, are not only advantageous for efficient transmission and storage, but also inherently compatible with the language modeling framework, enabling seamless integration of speech into text-dominated LLM architectures. Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: acoustic tokens and semantic tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches. This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types. Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens.</description>
