      <title>On minimal shapes and topological invariants in hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the set of finite shapes with minimal perimeter on hyperbolic lattices given by regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane whose tiles are regular $p$-gons meeting at vertices of degree $q$, with $1/p+1/q&lt;\frac{1}{2}$. The main tool is a layer decomposition due to Rietman--Nienhuis--Oitmaa and Moran, which allows us to prove convergence towards the Cheeger constant when these shapes exhaust the lattice. Furthermore, we apply a celebrated result of Floyd--Plotnick, which will allow us to compute the Euler characteristic for these graphs in terms of certain growth functions and the number of $n$-sized animals on those lattices.</description>

      <title>There are finitely many $5$-vertex-critical $(P_6,\text{bull})$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in $4$-colouring algorithms for graphs that do not contain an induced path on $6$ vertices nor an induced bull, i.e., the graph with vertex set $\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4,v_5\}$ and edge set $\{v_1v_2,v_2v_3,v_3v_4,v_2v_5,v_3v_5\}$. Such graphs are referred to as $(P_6,\text{bull})$-free graphs. A graph $G$ is \emph{$k$-vertex-critical} if $\chi(G)=k$, and every proper induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ has $\chi(H)&lt;k$. In the current paper, we investigate the structure of $5$-vertex-critical $(P_6,\text{bull})$-free graphs and show that there are only finitely many such graphs, thereby answering a question of Maffray and Pastor. A direct corollary of this is that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if a $(P_6,\text{bull})$-free graph is $4$-colourable such that this algorithm can also provide a certificate that can be verified in polynomial time and serves as a proof of 4-colourability or non-4-colourability.</description>

      <title>A Covering Pursuit Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the `Covering' pursuit game on a graph, a robber and a set of cops play alternately, with the cops each moving to an adjacent vertex (or not moving) and the robber moving to a vertex at distance at most 2 from his current vertex. The aim of the cops is to ensure that, after every one of their turns, there is a cop at the same vertex as the robber. How few cops are needed?
  Our main aim in this paper is to consider this problem for the two-dimensional grid $[n]^2$. Bollob\'{a}s and Leader asked if the number of cops needed is $o(n^2)$. We answer this question by showing that $n^{1.999}$ cops suffice. We also consider some applications. In particular we study the game `Catching a Fast Robber', concerning the number of cops needed to catch a fast robber of speed $s$ on the two-dimensional grid $[n]^2$. We improve the bounds proved by Balister, Bollob\'{a}s, Narayanan and Shaw for this game.</description>

      <title>Connectivity versus Lin-Lu-Yau curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the interaction between connectivity and Lin-Lu-Yau curvature of graphs systematically. The intuition is that connected graphs with large Lin-Lu-Yau curvature also have large connectivity, and vice versa. We prove that the connectivity of a connected graph is lower bounded by the product of its minimum degree and its Lin-Lu-Yau curvature. On the other hand, if the connectivity of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is at least $\frac{n-1}{2}$, then $G$ has positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature. Moreover, the bound $\frac{n-1}{2}$ here is optimal. Furthermore, we prove that the edge-connectivity is equal to the minimum vertex degree for any connected graph with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature. As applications, we estimate or determine the connectivity and edge-connectivity of an amply regular graph with parameters $(d,\alpha,\beta)$ such that $1\neq \beta\geq \alpha$.</description>

      <title>Density Measures for Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent successes of large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of theoretical research into language generation. A recent line of work proposes an abstract view, called language generation in the limit, where generation is seen as a game between an adversary and an algorithm: the adversary generates strings from an unknown language $K$, chosen from a countable collection of candidate languages, and after seeing a finite set of these strings, the algorithm must generate new strings from $K$ that it has not seen before. This formalism highlights a key tension: the trade-off between validity (the algorithm should only produce strings from the language) and breadth (it should be able to produce many strings from the language). This trade-off is central in applied language generation as well, where it appears as a balance between hallucination (generating invalid utterances) and mode collapse (generating only a restricted set of outputs). Despite its importance, this trade-off has been challenging to study quantitatively. We develop ways to quantify this trade-off by formalizing breadth using measures of density. Existing algorithms for language generation in the limit produce output sets that can have zero density in the true language, and this important failure of breadth might seem unavoidable. We show, however, that such a failure is not necessary: we provide an algorithm for language generation in the limit whose outputs have strictly positive density in $K$. We also study the internal representations built by these algorithms, specifically the sequence of hypothesized candidate languages they consider, and show that achieving the strongest form of breadth may require oscillating indefinitely between high- and low-density representations. Our analysis introduces a novel topology on language families, with notions of convergence and limit points playing a key role.</description>

      <title>A new intersection condition in extremal set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a family $\mathcal{F}$ $(3,2,\ell)$-intersecting if $|A \cap B|+|B \cap C|+|C \cap A| \geq \ell$ for all $A$, $B$, $C \in \mathcal{F}$. We try to look for the maximum size of such a family $\mathcal{F}$ in case when $\mathcal{F} \subset {[n] \choose k}$ or $\mathcal{F} \subset 2^{[n]}$. In the uniform case we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is $(3,2,2)$-intersecting, then $\vert \mathcal{F} \vert \leq {n+1 \choose k-1}+{n \choose k-2}$ and if $\mathcal{F}$ is $(3,2,3)$-intersecting, then $|\mathcal{F}| \leq {n \choose k-1} + 2 {n \choose k-3} + 3 {n-1 \choose k-3}$. For the lower bound we construct a $(3,2,\ell)$-intersecting family and we show that this bound is sharp when $\ell=2$ or $3$ and $n$ is sufficiently large compared to $k$. In the non-uniform case we give an upper bound for a $(3,2,n-x)$-intersecting family, when $n$ is sufficiently large compared to $x$.</description>

      <title>Noncrossing arc diagrams of type B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncrossing arc diagrams are combinatorial models for permutations that encode information about lattice congruences of the weak order and about the associated discrete geometry. In this paper, we consider two related, analogous models for signed permutations. One model features centrally symmetric noncrossing arc diagrams, while the other features their quotients modulo the central symmetry. We demonstrate the utility of the models by applying them to various questions about lattice quotients of the weak order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a weighted digraph without loops $V$, the arc weights of which can be obtained from an undirected graph with loops ${\sf P}$ according to the rule $v_{ij}=p_{ij}-p_{ii}$, the properties are studied. An effective algorithm for constructing directed trees of minimum weight and an algorithm for constructing spanning directed forests of minimum weight are proposed.</description>

      <title>Extreme Points of Base Polytope of Submodular Set Functions and Limit for Quotient Convergent Graph Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submodular set functions are of great importance in mathematics and theoretical computer science, serving as fundamental tools in optimization, combinatorics, and economics due to their natural properties and wide-ranging applications. In 2023, Lov\'asz systematically extended the theory of submodular set functions from finite sets to general set algebras and proposed several open problems about the behavior of submodular functions in infinite settings, including the characterization of extreme points of the base polytope of submodular set functions.
  We characterize conditions under which the extreme points of the base polytope of a submodular function are restricting measures with respect to its majorizing measure. Applying this result, we characterize the core of increasing subadditive non-atomic games and provide a positive answer to a question of Krist\'of B\'erzi, M\'arton Borb\'enyi, L\'aszl\'o Lov\'asz and L\'aszl\'o M\'arton T\'oth regarding the rank function for graphing's cycle matroid.
  Furthermore, building on the limit theory for set functions, we prove that the limit of convergent sequence of bounded-degree graphs' cycle matroids can be represented as the cycle matroid of a graphing, analogous to the completeness result for local-global convergence.</description>

Abstract: A proper coloring of vertices of a graph is equitable if the sizes of any two color classes differ by at most 1. Such colorings have many applications and are interesting by themselves. In this paper, we discuss the state of art and unsolved problems on equitable coloring and its list versions.</description>

      <title>Avoidance of vincular patterns by flattened derangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of avoiding a single vincular pattern of length three by derangements in the flattened sense and find explicit formulas for the generating functions enumerating members of each corresponding avoidance class according to the number of cycles. We make frequent use of the kernel method in solving the functional equations that arise which are satisfied by these (ordinary) generating functions. In the case of avoiding 23-1, which is equivalent to 32-1 in the flattened sense, it is more convenient to consider the exponential generating function instead due to the form of the recurrence. This leads to an explicit expression for the distribution of the number of cycles in terms of Stirling numbers of the second kind and the determinant of a certain tridiagonal matrix. Finally, the cases of 3-12 and 3-21 are perhaps the most difficult of all, and here we make use of a pair of auxiliary statistics in order to find a system of recurrences that enumerate each avoidance class.</description>

      <title>On minimal nonperfectly divisible fork-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14863v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fork is a graph obtained from $K_{1,3}$ (usually called claw) by subdividing an edge once. A graph is perfectly divisible if for each of its induced subgraph $H$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B]) &lt; \omega(H)$. In this paper, we prove that the perfect divisibility of fork-free graphs is equivalent to that of claw-free graphs. We also prove that, for $F\in \{P_7, P_6\cup K_1\}$, each (fork, $F$)-free graph $G$ is perfectly divisible and hence $\chi(G)\leq \binom{\omega(G)+1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Sombor Spectrum of Super Graphs defined on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a simple graph $A$ on a group $G$ and an equivalence relation $B$ on $G$, the $B$ super $A$ graph is defined as a simple graph, whose vertex set is $G$ and two vertices $g$, $h$ are adjacent if either they are in the same equivalence class or there exist $g^{\prime} \in[g]$ and $h^{\prime} \in[h]$ such that $g^{\prime}$ and $h^{\prime}$ are adjacent in $A$. In the literature, the $B$ super $A$ graphs have been investigated by considering $A$ to be either power graph, enhanced power graph, or commuting graph and $B$ to be an equality, order or conjugacy relation. In this paper, we investigate the Sombor spectrums of these $B$ super $A$ graphs for certain non-abelian groups, viz. the dihedral group, generalized quaternion group and the semidihedral group, respectively.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for online size Ramsey numbers for paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$, an online Ramsey game is played on the edge set of $K_\mathbb{N}$. In every round Builder selects an edge and Painter colors it red or blue. Builder is trying to force Painter to create a red copy of $H_1$ or a blue copy of $H_2$ as soon as possible, while Painter's goal is the opposite. The online (size) Ramsey number $\tilde{r}(H_1,H_2)$ is the smallest number of rounds in the game provided Builder and Painter play optimally. Let $v(G)$ be the number of vertices in the graph $G$ and $v_1(G)$ be the number of vertices of degree 1 in $G$. We prove that if $G$ has no isolated vertices, then $\tilde{r}(P_7,G)\ge 8v(G)/5-v_1(G)$, $\tilde{r}(P_8,G)\ge 18v(G)/11-v_1(G)$ and $\tilde{r}(P_9,G)\ge 5v(G)/3-v_1(G)$. In particular $\tilde{r}(P_9,P_n)\ge 5n/3-2,$ which with known upper bound implies $\lim_{n\to\infty} \tilde{r}(P_9,P_n)/n=5/3.$ We also show that for any fixed $k$, $\lim_{n\to\infty} \tilde{r}(P_k,P_n)/n$ exists.</description>

      <title>On Hamiltonicity and Perfect Codes in Non-Cyclic Graphs of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \( G \) be a finite non-cyclic group. Define \( \mathrm{Cyc}(G) \) as the set of all elements \( a \in G \) such that for any $b\in G$, the subgroup \( \langle a, b \rangle \) is cyclic. The \emph{non-cyclic graph} $\Gamma(G)$ of \( G \) is a simple undirected graph with vertex set \( G \setminus \mathrm{Cyc}(G) \), where two distinct vertices \( x \) and \( y \) are adjacent if the subgroup \( \langle x, y \rangle \) is not cyclic. An independent subset $C$ of the vertex set of a graph $\Gamma$ is called a perfect code of $\Gamma$ if every vertex of $V(\Gamma)\setminus C$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $C$. A subset \( T \) of the vertex set a graph \( \Gamma \) is said to be a \emph{total perfect code} if every vertex of \( \Gamma \) is adjacent to exactly one vertex in \( T \). In this paper, we prove that the graph $\Gamma(G)$ is Hamiltonian for any finite non-cyclic nilpotent group $G$. Also, we characterize all finite groups such that their non-cyclic graphs admit a perfect code. Finally, we prove that for a non-cyclic nilpotent group $G$, the non-cyclic graph $\Gamma(G)$ does not admit total perfect code.</description>

      <title>Explicit Lossless Vertex Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the first construction of explicit constant-degree lossless vertex expanders. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and sufficiently large $d$, we give an explicit construction of an infinite family of $d$-regular graphs where every small set $S$ of vertices has $(1-\varepsilon)d|S|$ neighbors (which implies $(1-2\varepsilon)d|S|$ unique-neighbors). Our results also extend naturally to construct biregular bipartite graphs of any constant imbalance, where small sets on each side have strong expansion guarantees. The graphs we construct admit a free group action, and hence realize new families of quantum LDPC codes of Lin and M. Hsieh with a linear time decoding algorithm.
  Our construction is based on taking an appropriate product of a constant-sized lossless expander with a base graph constructed from Ramanujan Cayley cubical complexes.</description>

      <title>Bisections of graphs under degree constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding {\it bisections} (i.e., balanced bipartitions) in graphs. We prove the following two results for {\it all} graphs $G$: (1). $G$ has a bisection where each vertex $v$ has at least $(1/4 - o(1))d_G(v)$ neighbors in its own part; (2). $G$ also has a bisection where each vertex $v$ has at least $(1/4 - o(1))d_G(v)$ neighbors in the opposite part. These results are asymptotically optimal up to a factor of $1/2$, aligning with what is expected from random constructions, and provide the first systematic understanding of bisections in general graphs under degree constraints. As a consequence, we establish for the first time the existence of a function $f(k)$ such that for any $k\geq 1$, every graph with minimum degree at least $f(k)$ admits a bisection where every vertex has at least $k$ neighbors in its own part, as well as a bisection where every vertex has at least $k$ neighbors in the opposite part.
  Using a more general setting, we further show that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there exist $c_\varepsilon, c'_\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that any graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $c_\varepsilon k$ (respectively, $c'_\varepsilon k$) admits a bisection satisfying: every vertex has at least $k$ neighbors in its own part (respectively, in the opposite part), and at least $(1 - \varepsilon)|V(G)|$ vertices have at least $k$ neighbors in the opposite part (respectively, in their own part). These results extend and strengthen classical graph partitioning theorems of Erd\H{o}s, Thomassen, and K\"{u}hn-Osthus, while additionally satisfying the bisection requirement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topology of the (path) configuration spaces and the (path) independence complexes for digraphs as well as their underlying graphs. We prove some canonical embeddings from the (path) independence complexes of the underlying graphs to the (path) independence complexes of the digraphs as well as some canonical embeddings between the (path) independence complexes induced by strong totally geodesic immersions of (di)graphs. We apply the path complexes and the path homology to the path independence complexes of (di)graphs. As by-products, we give some consequences about the Shannon capacities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, for positive integers $n,a_1, a_2, a_3$ satisfying $a_1+a_2+a_3 = n-1$, it holds that any bipartite graph $G$ which is the union of three perfect matchings $M_1$, $M_2$, and $M_3$ on $2n$ vertices contains a matching $M$ such that $|M\cap M_i| =a_i$ for $i= 1,2,$ and $3$. The bound $n-1$ on the sum is best possible in general. Our result verifies the multiplicity extension of the Ryser-Brualdi-Stein Conjecture, proposed recently by Anastos, Fabian, M\"uyesser, and Szab\'o, for three colors.</description>

      <title>A universal threshold for geometric embeddings of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is geometrically embeddable into a normed space $X$ when there is a mapping $\zeta: V\to X$ such that $\|\zeta(v)-\zeta(w)\|_X\leqslant 1$ if and only if $\{v,w\}\in E$, for all distinct $v,w\in V$. Our result is the following universal threshold for the embeddability of trees. Let $\Delta \geqslant 3$, and let $N$ be sufficiently large in terms of $\Delta$. Every $N$--vertex tree of maximal degree at most $\Delta$ is embeddable into any normed space of dimension at least $64\,\frac{\log N}{\log\log N}$, and complete trees are non-embeddable into any normed space of dimension less than $\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{\log N}{\log\log N}$. In striking contrast, spectral expanders and random graphs are known to be non-embeddable in sublogarithmic dimension. Our result is based on a randomized embedding whose analysis utilizes the recent breakthroughs on Bourgain's slicing problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a definition of ``equivariant quasisymmetry'' for polynomials in two sets of variables. Using this definition we define quasisymmetric generalizations of the theory of double Schur and double Schubert polynomials that we call double fundamental polynomials and double forest polynomials, where the subset of ``noncrossing partitions'' plays the role of $S_n$. In subsequent work we will show this combinatorics is governed by a new geometric construction we call the ``quasisymmetric flag variety'' which plays the same role for equivariant quasisymmetry as the usual flag variety plays in the classical story.</description>

      <title>Sunflowers and Ramsey problems for restricted intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremal problems on set systems with restricted intersections have been an important part of combinatorics in the last 70 year. In this paper, we study the following Ramsey version of these problems. Given a set $L\subseteq \{0,\dots,k-1\}$ and a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-element sets which does not contain a sunflower with $m$ petals whose kernel size is in $L$, how large a subfamily of $\mathcal{F}$ can we find in which no pair has intersection size in $L$? We give matching upper and lower bounds, determining the dependence on $m$ for all $k$ and $L$. This problem also finds applications in quantum computing.
  As an application of our techniques, we also obtain a variant of F\"uredi's celebrated semilattice lemma, which is a key tool in the powerful delta-system method. We prove that one cannot remove the double-exponential dependency on the uniformity in F\"uredi's result, however, we provide an alternative with significantly better, single-exponential dependency on the parameters, which is still strong enough for most applications of the delta-system method.</description>

      <title>Progress on Self Identifying Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of an identifying code for a graph was introduced by Karpovsky, Chakrabarty, and Levitin in 1998 as the problem of covering the vertices of a graph such that we can uniquely identify any vertex in the graph by examining the vertices that cover it. An application of an identifying code would be to detect a faulty processor in a multiprocessor system. In 2020, a variation of identify code called "self-identifying code" was introduced by Junnila and Laihonen, which simplifies the task of locating the malfunctioning processor. In this paper, we continue to explore self-identifying codes. In particular, we prove the problem of determining the minimum cardinality of a self-identifying code for an arbitrary graph is NP-complete and we investigate minimum-sized self-identifying code in several classes of graphs, including cubic graphs and infinite grids.</description>

      <title>Maker-Maker games of rank 4 are PSPACE-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Maker-Maker convention of positional games is played on a hypergraph whose edges are interpreted as winning sets. Two players take turns picking a previously unpicked vertex, aiming at being first to pick all the vertices of some edge. Optimal play can only lead to a first player win or a draw, and deciding between the two is known to be PSPACE-complete even for 6-uniform hypergraphs. We establish PSPACE-completeness for hypergraphs of rank 4. As an intermediary, we use the recently introduced achievement positional games, a more general convention in which each player has their own winning sets (blue and red). We show that deciding whether the blue player has a winning strategy as the first player is PSPACE-complete even with blue edges of size 2 or 3 and pairwise disjoint red edges of size 2. The result for hypergraphs of rank 4 in the Maker-Maker convention follows as a simple corollary.</description>

      <title>Convergence Laws for Extensions of First-Order Logic with Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14270v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many standard models of random structure, first-order logic sentences exhibit a convergence phenomenon on random inputs. The most well-known example is for random graphs with constant edge probability, where the probabilities of first-order sentences converge to 0 or 1. In other cases, such as certain ``sparse random graph'' models, the probabilities of sentences converge, although not necessarily to 0 or 1. In this work we deal with extensions of first-order logic with aggregate operators, variations of averaging. These logics will consist of real-valued terms, and we allow arbitrary Lipschitz functions to be used as ``connectives''. We show that some of the well-known convergence laws extend to this setting.</description>

      <title>On the action of the cactus group on the set of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns for orthogonal Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to define a natural action of the cactus group on the set of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns for orthogonal Lie algebras. These Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns are meant to index the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis in the irreducible representations of the orthogonal Lie algebra $\mathfrak{o}_N$ with respect to the chain of nested orthogonal Lie algebras $\mathfrak{o}_N \supset \mathfrak{o}_{N-1} \supset \ldots \supset \mathfrak{o}_3$. Using the Howe duality between $O_N$ and $\mathfrak{o}_{2n}$, we realize some representations of $\mathfrak{o}_N$ as multiplicity spaces inside the tensor power of the spinor representation $(\Lambda \mathbb{C}^{n})^{\otimes N}$. There is a natural choice of the basis inside the multiplicity space, which agrees with the decomposition of $(\Lambda \mathbb{C}^{n})^{\otimes N}$ into simple $\mathfrak{o}_{2n}$-modules. We call such basis principal. The action of the cactus group $C_N$ by the crystal commutors on the crystal arising from $(\Lambda \mathbb{C}^{n})^{\otimes N}$ induces the action of $C_N$ on the set indexing the principal basis inside the multiplicity space. We call this set regular cell tables. Regular cell tables are the analog of semi-standard Young tables. There is a natural bijection between a specific subset of semi-standard Young tables and regular cell tables. In this paper, we establish a natural bijection between the principal basis and the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis and, therefore, define an action of the cactus group on the set Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns.</description>

      <title>Goldbach Conjecture: Violation Probability and Generalization to Prime-like Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the distribution of primes among integers, we establish an upper bound for the probability $\mathbb{P}_n$ that the Goldbach conjecture fails. Assuming the conjecture holds true for all even number less than $2N$, we prove this probability is less than $e^{-N^\alpha}$, where $ \alpha = 1 - \frac{2\ln\ln N}{\ln N}$.
  For large $N$, this probability becomes vanishingly small, effectively precluding the existence of counterexamples in practice. If $N =4 \times 10^{18}$, the probability of a counterexample is less than $e^{-10^{15}}$. Our approach fundamentally depends on the distributional properties of primes rather than their primality per se. This perspective enables a natural generalization of the conjecture to non-prime subsets of integers that exhibit similar distributional characteristics. As a concrete example, we construct new subsets by applying random $\pm 1$ shifts to primes, which preserve the essential prime-like distributional properties. Computational verification confirms that this generalized Goldbach conjecture holds for all even integers up to $2 \times 10^{8}$ within these modified subsets.</description>

      <title>Tropical Abel-Jacobi theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To a compact tropical variety of arbitrary dimension, we associate a collection of intermediate Jacobians defined in terms of tropical homology and tropical monodromy. We then develop an Abel-Jacobi theory in the tropical setting by defining functorial Abel-Jacobi maps. We introduce, in particular, tropical Albanese varieties and formulate obstructions to algebraic equivalence of tropical cycles. In dimension 1, we show that this recovers the existing Abel-Jacobi theory for tropical curves.
  As an application, we consider the Ceresa class of a tropical curve which is defined as the image of the Ceresa cycle in an appropriate intermediate Jacobian under the Abel-Jacobi map. We give an explicit formula for this class entirely in terms of the combinatorics of the tropical curve.</description>

Abstract: A variant of the well-known Set Covering Problem is studied in this paper, where subsets of a collection have to be selected, and pairwise conflicts among subsets of items exist. The selection of each subset has a cost, and the inclusion of conflicting subsets is associated with a penalty to be paid. The problem, which can be used to model real applications, looks for a selection of subsets that cover the original collection, while minimizing the sum of covering and penalty costs. In this paper we consider a compact mixed integer linear program and we solve it with an open-source solver. Computational results on the benchmark instances commonly used in the literature of the problem are reported. The results indicate that the new approach we propose is capable of good results, both in terms of lower and upper bounds, although not matching the state-of-the-art on average. The new approach was, however, able to improve 9 best-known heuristic solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give a complete classification of silted algebras for the quiver $\overrightarrow{\mathbb{A}}_{n}$ of type $\mathbb{A}_{n}$ with linear orientation and for the quiver obtained from $\overrightarrow{\mathbb{A}}_{n}$ by reversing the arrow at the unique source. Based on the classification, we also compute the number of silted algebras for these two quivers.</description>

      <title>Ramsey expansions of metrically homogeneous graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:1707.02612v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Ramsey expansions, the coherent extension property for partial isometries (EPPA), and the existence of a stationary independence relation for all classes of metrically homogeneous graphs from Cherlin's catalogue. We show that, with the exception of tree-like graphs, all metric spaces in the catalogue have precompact Ramsey expansions (or lifts) with the expansion property. With two exceptions we can also characterise the existence of a stationary independence relation and coherent EPPA.
  Our results are a contribution to Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes and can be seen as empirical evidence of the recent convergence in techniques employed to establish the Ramsey property, the expansion property, EPPA and the existence of a stationary independence relation. At the heart of our proof is a canonical way of completing edge-labelled graphs to metric spaces in Cherlin's classes. The existence of such a ``completion algorithm'' then allows us to apply several strong results in the areas that imply EPPA or the Ramsey property.
  The main results have numerous consequences for the automorphism groups of the Fraisse limits of the classes. As corollaries, we prove amenability, unique ergodicity, existence of universal minimal flows, ample generics, small index property, 21-Bergman property and Serre's property (FA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intersection data of a hyperplane arrangement is described by a geometric lattice, or equivalently a simple matroid. There is a rich interplay between this combinatorial structure and the topology of the arrangement complement. In this paper, we characterize the combinatorial structure underlying an abelian arrangement (such as a toric or elliptic arrangement) by defining a class of geometric posets and a generalization of matroids called matroid schemes. The intersection data of an abelian arrangement is encoded in a geometric poset, and we prove that a geometric poset is equivalent to a simple matroid scheme. We lay foundations for the theory of matroid schemes, discussing rank, flats, and independence. We also extend the definition of the Tutte polynomial to this setting and prove that it satisfies a deletion-contraction recurrence.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study some class of cellular automata (CA) preserving modulo-recursive, stability by reflection and richness called stable cellular automata (SCA). After applying these automata on Sturmian words, we establish some combinatorial properties of these new words. Next, the classical and palindromic complexity functions of these words are also determined. Finally, we show that these words are $2$-balanced and we establish their abelian complexity function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently there has been growing interest in discrete homotopies and homotopies of graphs beyond treating graphs as 1-dimensional simplicial spaces. One such type of homotopy is $\times$-homotopy. Recent work by Chih-Scull has developed a homotopy category, a fundamental group for graphs under this homotopy, and a way of computing covers of graphs that lift homotopy via this fundamental group. In this paper, we compute the fundamental groups of all Hamming graphs, show that they are direct products of cyclic groups, and use this result to describe some $\times$-homotopy covers of Hamming graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dichromatic number of a digraph $D$ is the smallest $k$ such that $D$ can be partitioned into $k$ acyclic subdigraphs, and the dichromatic number of an undirected graph is the maximum dichromatic number over all its orientations. Extending a well-known result of Lov\'{a}sz, we show that the dichromatic number of the Kneser graph $KG(n,k)$ is $\Theta(n-2k+2)$ and that the dichromatic number of the Borsuk graph $BG(n+1,a)$ is $n+2$ if $a$ is large enough. We then study the list version of the dichromatic number. We show that, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $2\leq k\leq n^{1/2-\varepsilon}$, the list dichromatic number of $KG(n,k)$ is $\Theta(n\ln n)$. This extends a recent result of Bulankina and Kupavskii on the list chromatic number of $KG(n,k)$, where the same behaviour was observed. We also show that for any $\rho&gt;3$, $r\geq 2$ and $m\geq\max\{\ln^{\rho}r,2\}$, the list dichromatic number of the complete $r$-partite graph with $m$ vertices in each part is $\Theta(r\ln m)$, extending a classical result of Alon. Finally, we give a directed analogue of Sabidussi's theorem on the chromatic number of graph products.</description>

      <title>On the Ehrhart Theory of Generalized Symmetric Edge Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetric edge polytope (SEP) of a (finite, undirected) graph is a centrally symmetric lattice polytope whose vertices are defined by the edges of the graph. SEPs have been studied extensively in the past twenty years. Recently, T\'othm\'er\'esz and, independently, D'Al\'i, Juhnke-Kubitzke, and Koch generalized the definition of an SEP to regular matroids, which are the matroids that can be represented by totally unimodular matrices. Generalized SEPs are known to have symmetric Ehrhart $h^*$-polynomials, and Ohsugi and Tsuchiya conjectured that (ordinary) SEPs have nonnegative $\gamma$-vectors.
  In this article, we use combinatorial and Gr\"obner basis techniques to extend additional known properties of SEPs to generalized SEPs. Along the way, we show that generalized SEPs are not necessarily $\gamma$-nonnegative by providing explicit examples. We prove that the polytopes we construct are ``nearly'' $\gamma$-nonnegative in the sense that, by deleting exactly two elements from the matroid, one obtains SEPs for graphs that are $\gamma$-nonnegative. This provides further evidence that Ohsugi and Tsuchiya's conjecture holds in the ordinary case.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a multi-partite version of the Erd\H{o}s--Stone theorem. Given integers $r&lt;k$ and $t\ge 1$, let $\text{ex}_k(n, K_{r+1}(t))$ be the maximum number of edges of $K_{r+1}(t)$-free $k$-partite graphs with $n$ vertices in each part, where $K_{r+1}(t)$ is the complete $(r+1)$-partite graph with $t$ vertices in each part. We determine the exact value of $\text{ex}_k(n, K_{r+1}(t))$ for $t\le 3$, $r&lt;k\le 2r$ and sufficiently large $n$. We also characterize all extremal graphs for $r, k$ such that $r$ divides $k$, analogous to a result of Erd\H os and Simonovits on forbidding $K_{r+1}(t)$ in general graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{S}_h$ denote a sphere with $h$ holes. Given a triangulation $G$ of a surface $\mathbb{M}$, we consider the question of when $G$ contains a spanning subgraph $H$ such that $H$ is a triangulated $\mathbb{S}_h$. We give a new short proof of a theorem of Nevo and Tarabykin that every triangulation $G$ of the torus contains a spanning subgraph which is a triangulated cylinder. For arbitrary surfaces, we prove that every high facewidth triangulation of a surface with $h$ handles contains a spanning subgraph which is a triangulated $\mathbb{S}_{2h}$. We also prove that for every $0 \leq g' &lt; g$ and $w \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists a triangulation of facewidth at least $w$ of a surface of Euler genus $g$ that does not have a spanning subgraph which is a triangulated $\mathbb{S}_{g'}$. Our results are motivated by, and have applications for, rigidity questions in the plane.</description>

      <title>Matchings in matroids over abelian groups, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of matchings originated in group theory to address a linear algebra problem related to canonical forms for symmetric tensors. In an abelian group $(G,+)$, a matching is a bijection $f: A \to B$ between two finite subsets $A$ and $B$ of $G$ such that $a + f(a) \notin A$ for all $a \in A$. A group $G$ has the matching property if, for every two finite subsets $A, B \subset G$ of the same size with $0 \notin B$, there exists a matching from $A$ to $B$. In prior work [5], matroid analogues of results concerning matchings in groups were introduced and established. This paper serves as a sequel, extending that line of inquiry by investigating sparse paving, panhandle, and Schubert matroids through the lens of matchability. While some proofs draw upon earlier findings on the matchability of sparse paving matroids, the paper is designed to be self-contained and accessible without reference to the preceding sequel. Our approach combines tools from both matroid theory and additive number theory.</description>

      <title>Diameter Constraints in 2-distance Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any finite, simple graph $G = (V,E)$, its $2$-distance graph $G_2$ is a graph having the same vertex set $V$ where two vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance is $2$ in $G$. Connectivity and diameter properties of these graphs have been well studied. For example, it has been shown that if ${\rm diam}(G) = k \geq 3$ then $\lceil \frac{1}{2} k \rceil \leq {\rm diam}(G_2)$, and that this bound is sharp. In this paper, we prove that ${\rm diam}(G_2) = \infty$ (that is, $G_2$ is disconnected) or otherwise ${\rm diam}(G_2) \leq k + 2$. In addition, we show that this inequality is sharp for any even $k$, a result that we verify for some higher orders through judicious use of a \textsc{sat} solver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a $k$-edge-coloured graph and let $n$ be a positive integer. What is the maximum number of copies of $H$ in a $k$-edge-coloured complete graph on $n$ vertices? This paper studies the case $k=2$, which we call the semi-inducibility problem. This problem is a generalisation of the inducibility problem of Pippenger and Golumbic which is solved only for some small graphs and limited families of graphs. We prove sharp or almost sharp results for alternating walks, for alternating cycles of length divisible by 4, and for 4-cycles of every colour pattern.
  Liu, Mubayi and Reiher asked whether there is a graph $F$ for which the binomial random graph is an asymptotically extremal graph in the inducibility problem over all graphs of a given edge density. This was recently answered in a strong negative sense by Jain, Michelen and Wei. In contrast, we find a \emph{quantum} graph $Q$ with positive coefficients and an interval of edge densities for which the only extremal graphs are quasirandom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define generalized de Bruijn words as those words having a Burrows-Wheeler transform that is a concatenation of permutations of the alphabet. We show that generalized de Bruijn words are in 1-to-1 correspondence with Hamiltonian cycles in the generalized de Bruijn graphs introduced in the early '80s in the context of network design. When the size of the alphabet is a prime $p$, we define invertible necklaces as those whose BWT-matrix is non-singular. We show that invertible necklaces of length $n$ correspond to normal bases of the finite field $F_{p^n}$, and that they form an Abelian group isomorphic to the Reutenauer group $RG_p^n$. Using known results in abstract algebra, we can make a bridge between generalized de Bruijn words and invertible necklaces. In particular, we highlight a correspondence between binary de Bruijn words of order $d+1$, binary necklaces of length $2^{d}$ having an odd number of $1$'s, invertible BWT matrices of size $2^{d}\times 2^{d}$, and normal bases of the finite field $F_{2^{2^{d}}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide first a categorical exploration of, and then completion of the mapping of the relationships among, three fundamental perspectives on binary relations: as the incidence matrices of hypergraphs, as the formal contexts of concept lattices, and as specifying topological cosheaves of simplicial (Dowker) complexes on simplicial (Dowker) complexes. We provide an integrative, functorial framework combining previously known with three new results: 1) given a binary relation, there are order isomorphisms among the bounded edge order of the intersection complexes of its dual hypergraphs and its concept lattice; 2) the concept lattice of a context is an isomorphism invariant of the Dowker cosheaf (of abstract simplicial complexes) of that context; and 3) a novel Dowker cosheaf (of chain complexes) of a relation is an isomorphism invariant of the concept lattice of the context that generalizes Dowker's original homological result. We illustrate these concepts throughout with a running example, and demonstrate relationships to past results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1992, Wagner proved that the Hadamard product of two totally positive lower triangular Toeplitz matrices is totally positive. In this work, we strengthen this result by establishing total monomial positivity for the Hadamard product of Jacobi--Trudi matrices. In particular, we resolve a conjecture of Sokal concerning the Hadamard square of Jacobi--Trudi matrices. Moreover, we provide a manifestly positive Schur expansion for the Hadamard square of Jacobi--Trudi matrices indexed by ribbons. In addition, we construct a corresponding representation, offering a representation-theoretic proof of the Schur positivity.</description>

Abstract: Plane triangulations with all vertices of degree $3$ or $6$ are enumerated.
  A plane triangulation is said to be akempic if it has a $4$-colouring such that no two adjacent triangles have the same three colours and this colouring is not Kempe equivalent to any other colouring. Mohar (1985 and 1987) characterized and enumerated akempic triangulations with all vertices of degree $3$ or $6$. We give a new characterization of the akempic triangulations and a new proof of the Mohar enumeration theorem.</description>

      <title>Extremal independence in discrete random systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.04917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{X}(n) \in \mathbb{R}^d$ be a sequence of random vectors, where $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $d = d(n)$. Under certain weakly dependence conditions, we prove that the distribution of the maximal component of $\mathbf{X}$ and the distribution of the maximum of their independent copies are asymptotically equivalent. Our result on extremal independence relies on new lower and upper bounds for the probability that none of a given finite set of events occurs. As applications, we obtain the distribution of various extremal characteristics of random discrete structures such as maximum codegree in binomial random hypergraphs and the maximum number of cliques sharing a given vertex in binomial random graphs. We also generalise Berman-type conditions for a sequence of Gaussian random vectors to possess the extremal independence property.</description>

      <title>Principal Specialization of Monomial Symmetric Polynomials and Group Determinants of Cyclic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the principal specialization of monomial symmetric polynomials and investigate the special values of these polynomials at the point $$ \zeta_{(n,k)} := ( 1, \zeta_n, \zeta_n^2, \dots, \zeta_n^{kn-1} ), $$ where \(\zeta_n\) is a primitive \(n\)th root of unity. We give explicit formulas for several special values. Also, we show that these special values naturally appear as the coefficients in the expansion of the $k$th power of the circulant determinant of order $n$ (the group determinant of the cyclic group of order $n$). These results extend Ore's results for $k = 1$. Furthermore, we determine the number of terms in the $k$th power of the group permanent of the cyclic group of order $n$. This extends Brualdi and Newman's result for $k = 1$.</description>

      <title>Interlacing Polynomial Method for Matrix Approximation via Generalized Column and Row Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into the spectral norm aspect of the Generalized Column and Row Subset Selection (GCRSS) problem. Given a target matrix $\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, the objective of GCRSS is to select a column submatrix $\mathbf{B}_{:,S}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ from the source matrix $\mathbf{B}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d_B}$ and a row submatrix $\mathbf{C}_{R,:}\in\mathbb{R}^{r\times d}$ from the source matrix $\mathbf{C}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_C\times d}$, such that the residual matrix $(\mathbf{I}_n-\mathbf{B}_{:,S}\mathbf{B}_{:,S}^{\dagger})\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{I}_d-\mathbf{C}_{R,:}^{\dagger} \mathbf{C}_{R,:})$ has a small spectral norm. By employing the method of interlacing polynomials, we show that the smallest possible spectral norm of a residual matrix can be bounded by the largest root of a related expected characteristic polynomial. A deterministic polynomial time algorithm is provided for the spectral norm case of the GCRSS problem. We next focus on two specific GCRSS scenarios: the Generalized Column Subset Selection (GCSS) problem ($r=0$), and the submatrix selection problem ($\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{C}=\mathbf{I}_d$). In the GCSS scenario, we connect the expected characteristic polynomials to the convolution of multi-affine polynomials, leading to the derivation of the first provable reconstruction bound on the spectral norm of a residual matrix. In the submatrix selection scenario, we show that for any sufficiently small $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and any square matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, there exist two subsets $S\subset [d]$ and $R\subset [d]$ of sizes $O(d\cdot \varepsilon^2)$ such that $\Vert\mathbf{A}_{S,R}\Vert_2\leq \varepsilon\cdot \Vert\mathbf{A}\Vert_2$.</description>

      <title>On combinatorial properties of Gruenberg--Kegel graphs of finite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $G$ is a finite group, then the spectrum $\omega(G)$ is the set of all element orders of $G$. The prime spectrum $\pi(G)$ is the set of all primes belonging to $\omega(G)$. A simple graph $\Gamma(G)$ whose vertex set is $\pi(G)$ and in which two distinct vertices $r$ and $s$ are adjacent if and only if $rs \in \omega(G)$ is called the Gruenberg-Kegel graph or the prime graph of $G$.
  In this paper, we prove that if $G$ is a group of even order, then the set of vertices which are non-adjacent to $2$ in $\Gamma(G)$ form a union of cliques. Moreover, we decide when a strongly regular graph is isomorphic to the Gruenberg-Kegel graph of a finite group. Besides this, we prove that a complete bipartite graph with each part of size at least $3$ can not be isomorphic to the Gruenberg-Kegel graph of a finite group.</description>

      <title>Realizing trees of configurations in thin sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\phi(x,y)$ be a continuous function, smooth away from the diagonal, such that, for some $\alpha&gt;0$, the associated generalized Radon transforms \begin{equation} \label{Radon} R_t^{\phi}f(x)=\int_{\phi(x,y)=t} f(y) \psi(y) d\sigma_{x,t}(y) \end{equation} map $L^2({\mathbb R}^d) \to L^2_{\alpha}({\mathbb R}^d)$ for all $t&gt;0$. Let $E$ be a compact subset of ${\mathbb R}^d$ for some $d \ge 2$, and suppose that the Hausdorff dimension of $E$ is $&gt;d-\alpha$. We show that any tree graph $T$ on $k+1$ ($k \ge 1$) vertices is \new{stably} realizable in $E$, in the sense that \new{for each $t$ in some open interval} there exist distinct $x^1, x^2, \dots, x^{k+1} \in E$ %and $t&gt;0$ such that the $\phi$-distance $\phi(x^i, x^j)=t$ for all pairs $(i,j)$ corresponding to the edges of $T$.
  We extend this result to trees whose edges are prescribed by more complicated point configurations, such as congruence classes of triangles.

      <title>Low-Degree Polynomials Are Good Extractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that random low-degree polynomials (over $\mathbb{F}_2$) are unbiased, in an extremely general sense. That is, we show that random low-degree polynomials are good randomness extractors for a wide class of distributions. Prior to our work, such results were only known for the small families of (1) uniform sources, (2) affine sources, and (3) local sources. We significantly generalize these results, and prove the following.
  1. Low-degree polynomials extract from small families. We show that a random low-degree polynomial is a good low-error extractor for any small family of sources. In particular, we improve the positive result of Alrabiah, Chattopadhyay, Goodman, Li, and Ribeiro (ICALP 2022) for local sources, and give new results for polynomial and variety sources via a single unified approach.
  2. Low-degree polynomials extract from sumset sources. We show that a random low-degree polynomial is a good extractor for sumset sources, which are the most general large family of sources (capturing independent sources, interleaved sources, small-space sources, and more). Formally, for any even $d$, we show that a random degree $d$ polynomial is an $\varepsilon$-error extractor for $n$-bit sumset sources with min-entropy $k=O(d(n/\varepsilon^2)^{2/d})$. This is nearly tight in the polynomial error regime.
  Our results on sumset extractors imply new complexity separations for linear ROBPs, and the tools that go into its proof may be of independent interest. The two main tools we use are a new structural result on sumset-punctured Reed-Muller codes, paired with a novel type of reduction between extractors. Using the new structural result, we obtain new limits on the power of sumset extractors, strengthening and generalizing the impossibility results of Chattopadhyay, Goodman, and Gurumukhani (ITCS 2024).</description>

      <title>A skew Specht perspective of RoCK blocks and cuspidal systems for KLR algebras in affine type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cuspidal systems parameterize KLR algebra representations via root partitions $\pi$, where simple modules $L(\pi)$ arise as heads of proper standard modules. Working in affine type A with an arbitrary convex preorder, we construct explicit skew diagrams $\zeta(\pi)$ such that the skew Specht module $S^{\zeta(\pi)}$ has simple head $L(\pi)$ and a filtration by proper standard modules. A key ingredient in this construction is the development of `core-truncation' functors, which take module categories of level one RoCK blocks to the category of imaginary semicuspidal KLR modules. Every simple imaginary semicuspidal module arises in the image of these functors. This result stems from an in-depth study of the combinatorial interplay between cuspidal systems and RoCK cyclotomic KLR algebras, in which we characterize core blocks and RoCK blocks in arbitrary level via cuspidal tiling properties of multipartitions in these blocks.</description>

      <title>Pentagonal number recurrence relations for $p(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit Euler's partition function recurrence, which asserts, for integers $n\geq 1,$ that $$ p(n)=p(n-1)+p(n-2)-p(n-5)-p(n-7)+\dots = \sum_{k\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}} (-1)^{k+1} p(n-\omega(k)), $$ where $\omega(m):=(3m^2+m)/2$ is the $m$th pentagonal number. We prove that this classical result is the $\nu=0$ case of an infinite family of ``pentagonal number'' recurrences. For each $\nu\geq 0,$ we prove for positive $n$ that
  $$ p(n)=\frac{1}{g_{\nu}(n,0)}\left(\alpha_{\nu}\cdot \sigma_{2\nu-1}(n)+ \mathrm{Tr}_{2\nu}(n) +\sum_{k\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}} (-1)^{k+1} g_{\nu}(n,k)\cdot p(n-\omega(k))\right), $$ where $\sigma_{2\nu-1}(n)$ is a divisor function, $\mathrm{Tr}_{2\nu}(n)$ is the $n$th weight $2\nu$ Hecke trace of values of special twisted quadratic Dirichlet series, and each $g_{\nu}(n,k)$ is a polynomial in $n$ and $k.$ The $\nu=6$ case can be viewed as a partition theoretic formula for Ramanujan's tau-function, as we have $$ \mathrm{Tr}_{12}(n)=-\frac{33108590592}{691}\cdot \tau(n). $$</description>

      <title>Complexity of approximate conflict-free, linearly-ordered, and nonmonochromatic hypergraph colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction problems, we establish complexity classifications of three natural variants of hypergraph colourings: standard nonmonochromatic colourings, conflict-free colourings, and linearly-ordered colourings.
  Firstly, we show that finding an $\ell$-colouring of a $k$-colourable $r$-uniform hypergraph is NP-hard for all constant $2\leq k\leq \ell$ and $r\geq 3$. This provides a shorter proof of a celebrated result by Dinur et al. [FOCS'02/Combinatorica'05].
  Secondly, we show that finding an $\ell$-conflict-free colouring of an $r$-uniform hypergraph that admits a $k$-conflict-free colouring is NP-hard for all constant $3\leq k\leq\ell$ and $r\geq 4$, except for $r=4$ and $k=2$ (and any $\ell$); this case is solvable in polynomial time. The case of $r=3$ is the standard nonmonochromatic colouring, and the case of $r=2$ is the notoriously difficult open problem of approximate graph colouring.
  Thirdly, we show that finding an $\ell$-linearly-ordered colouring of an $r$-uniform hypergraph that admits a $k$-linearly-ordered colouring is NP-hard for all constant $3\leq k\leq\ell$ and $r\geq 4$, thus improving on the results of Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'y [ICALP'22/ACM TocT'23].</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish a Ratner-type equidistribution theorem for orbits on homogeneous spaces associated with $2$-nilpotent locally compact Polish groups under the action of a countable discrete abelian group. We apply this result to establish the existence of triple restricted sumsets in subsets of positive density in arbitrary countable discrete abelian groups, subject to a necessary finiteness condition.</description>

Abstract: We reduce the problem of counting self-avoiding walks in the square lattice to a problem of counting the number of integral points in multidimensional domains. We obtain an asymptotic estimate of the number of self-avoiding walks of length $n$ in the square lattice. This new formalism gives a natural and unified setting in order to study the properties of the number of self-avoiding walks in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ of any dimension $d\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>On Refined Vogel's universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In accordance with P. Vogel, a set of algebra structures in Chern-Simons theory can be made universal, independent of a particular family of simple Lie algebras. In particular, this means that various quantities in the adjoint representations of these simple Lie algebras such as dimensions and quantum dimensions, Racah coefficients, etc. are simple rational functions of two parameters on Vogel's plane, giving three lines associated with $sl$, $so/sp$ and exceptional algebras correspondingly. By analyzing the partition function of refined of Chern-Simons theory, it was suggested earlier that the refinement may preserve the universality for simply laced algebras. Here we support this conjecture by analysing the Macdonald dimensions, i.e. values of Macdonald polynomials at $q^\rho$, where $\rho$ is the Weyl vector: there is a universality formula that describes these dimensions for the simply laced algebras as a function on the Vogel's plane.</description>
