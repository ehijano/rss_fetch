      <title>The Arens-Michael envelope of a solvable Lie algebra is a homological epimorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Arens-Michael envelope of the universal enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional complex Lie algebra is a homological epimorphism if and only if the Lie algebra is solvable. The necessity was proved by Pirkovskii in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 134, 2621--2631, 2006]. We prove the sufficiency.</description>

      <title>Computing Borel complexity of some geometrical properties in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Borel complexity of some classes of Banach spaces such as different versions of diameter two properties, spaces satisfying the Daugavet equation or spaces with an octahedral norm. In most of the above cases our computation is even optimal, which completes the research done during the last years around this topic for isomorphism classes of Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Quasi-contractivity, Stability and convergence of WCT operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we characterize quasi-contraction, stable and convergent weighted conditional type (WCT) operators on $L^p(\mu)$. Indeed we provide equivalent conditions for quasi-contraction WCT operators. Also, we prove that convergence, uniformly stability, strongly stability and weakly stability of WCT operators are equivalent. Finally we provided some concrete examples to illustrate our main results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Riemann--Liouville analytic semigroup. In particular, we completely characterize the membership to the Schatten class $S^r$ on $L^2(0,1)$, as well as the membership to the class of nuclear operators on $L^p(0,1)$, $p\geq 1$, and the membership to the ideal of absolutely $r$-summing operators for any $r\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>The density of Gabor systems in expansible locally compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the reproducing properties of Gabor systems within the context of expansible groups. These properties are established in terms of density conditions. The concept of density that we employ mirrors the well-known Beurling density defined in Euclidean space, which is made possible due to the expansive structure. Along the way, for groups with an open and compact subgroup, we demonstrate that modulation spaces are continuously embedded in Wiener spaces. Utilizing this result, we derive the Bessel condition of Gabor systems. Additionally, we construct Gabor orthonormal bases with arbitrarily small or large densities, enabling us to conclude that a Comparison Theorem, such as the one proven to be valid in the Euclidean case, cannot hold in this context. Finally, we establish that Gabor frames possess the Homogeneous Approximation Property.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of Krylov subspaces and applications to unbounded self-adjoint operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the inherent structural properties of Krylov subspaces, in particular for the self-adjoint class of operators, and how they relate with the important phenomenon of `Krylov solvability' of linear inverse problems. Owing to the complexity of the problem in the unbounded setting, recently developed perturbative techniques are used that exploit the use of the weak topology on $\mathcal{H}$. We also make a strong connection between the approximative properties of the Krylov subspace and the famous Hamburger problem of moments, in particular the determinacy condition.</description>

      <title>On the small scale nonlinear theory of operator spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the small scale geometry of operator spaces. The authors have previously shown that a map between operator spaces which is completely coarse (that is, the sequence of its amplifications is equi-coarse) must be $\mathbb R$-linear. We obtain a generalization of the aforementioned result to completely coarse maps defined on the unit ball of an operator space. By relaxing the condition to a small scale one, we prove that there are many non-linear examples of maps which are completely Lipshitz in small scale. We define a geometric parameter for homogeneous Hilbertian operator spaces which imposes restrictions on the existence of such maps.</description>

      <title>Roman Domination on Graphings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of domination, called Roman domination, where we must assign to each vertex one of the labels 0, 1, or 2 and require that every vertex with label 0 has a neighbour with label 2. We study the problem of finding a low-cost Roman dominating function on Lebesgue-measurable graphings, that is, on infinite graphs whose vertices are the points of a probability space. We provide a framework to tackle optimisation problems in the measurable combinatorial setting. In particular, we fully answer the Roman domination problem on irrational cycle graphs, a specific type of graphing on the space $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ where an irrational number ${\alpha}$ is given and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance is ${\alpha}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.01372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note is motivated by the article of Bamerni, Kadets and Kili\c{c}man [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 435 (2), 1812--1815 (2016)]. We consider the remaining problem which claims that if $A$ is a dense subset of a finite dimensional space $X$, then there is a nontrivial subspace $M$ of $X$ such that $A\cap M$ is dense in $M$. We show that the above problem has a negative answer when $X=\mathbb{K}^{n}$ ($\mathbb{K}= \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) for every $n\geq 2$.</description>

Abstract: We show that a vector-valued Kahn--Kalai--Linial inequality holds in every Banach space of Rademacher type 2. We also show that for any nondecreasing function $h\geq 0$ with $0&lt;\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{h(t)}{t^{2}}\mathrm{dt}&lt;\infty$ we have the inequality \begin{align*}
  \|f - \mathbb{E}f\|_2 \leq 12 \, T_{2}(X) \left(\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{h(t)}{t^{2}} \mathrm{dt} \right)^{1/2}
  \, \left(\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\|D_j f\|^{2}_2}{h\left( \log \frac{\|D_j f\|_2}{\|D_j f\|_1} \right)}\right)^{1/2} \end{align*} for all $f :\{-1,1\}^{n} \to X$ and all $n\geq 1$, where $X$ is a normed space and $T_{2}(X)$ is the associated type 2 constant.</description>

      <title>New tensor products of C*-algebras and characterization of type I C*-algebras as rigidly symmetric C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct several new classes of bifunctors $(A,B)\mapsto A\otimes_{\alpha} B$, where $A\otimes_\alpha B$ is a cross norm completion of $A\odot B$ for each pair of C*-algebras $A$ and $B$. For the first class of bifunctors considered $(A,B)\mapsto A\otimes_p B$ ($1\leq p\leq\infty$), $A\otimes_p B$ is a Banach algebra cross-norm completion of $A\odot B$ constructed in a fashion similar to $p$-pseudofunctions of a locally compact group. We also consider $\otimes_{p,q}$ for H\"older conjugate $p,q\in [1,\infty]$ -- a Banach $*$-algebra analogue of the tensor product $\otimes_p$. By taking enveloping C*-algebras of $A\otimes_{p,q} B$, we arrive at a third bifunctor $(A,B)\mapsto A\otimes_{\mathrm C^*_{p,q}} B$ where the resulting algebra $A\otimes_{\mathrm C^*_{p,q}} B$ is a C*-algebra.
  For groups belonging to a large class of non-amenable discrete groups possessing both the rapid decay and Haagerup property, we show that the tensor products $\mathrm C^*_{\mathrm r}(G_1)\otimes_{\mathrm C^*_{p,q}}\mathrm C^*_{\mathrm r}(G_2)$ coincide with a Brown-Guentner type C*-completion of $\mathrm \ell^1(G_1\times G_2)$ and conclude that if $2\leq p'&lt;p\leq\infty$, then the canonical quotient map $\mathrm C^*_{\mathrm r}(G)\otimes_{\mathrm C^*_{p,q}}\mathrm C^*_{\mathrm r}(G)\to \mathrm C^*_{\mathrm r}(G)\otimes_{\mathrm C^*_{p',q'}}\mathrm C^*_{\mathrm r}(G)$ is not injective.
  A Banach $*$-algebra $A$ is \emph{rigidly symmetric} if $A\otimes_{\gamma} B$ is symmetric for every C*-algebra $B$. A theorem of Kugler asserts that every type I C*-algebra is rigidly symmetric. Leveraging our new constructions, we establish the converse of Kugler's theorem by showing for C*-algebras $A$ and $B$ that $A\otimes_{\gamma}B$ is symmetric if and only if $A$ or $B$ is type I.</description>

      <title>Approximation Theory, Computing, and Deep Learning on the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of approximating functions in infinite-dimensional spaces from finite samples is widely regarded as formidable. In this study, we delve into the challenging problem of the numerical approximation of Sobolev-smooth functions defined on probability spaces. Our particular focus centers on the Wasserstein distance function, which serves as a relevant example. In contrast to the existing body of literature focused on approximating efficiently pointwise evaluations, we chart a new course to define functional approximants by adopting three machine learning-based approaches: 1. Solving a finite number of optimal transport problems and computing the corresponding Wasserstein potentials. 2. Employing empirical risk minimization with Tikhonov regularization in Wasserstein Sobolev spaces. 3. Addressing the problem through the saddle point formulation that characterizes the weak form of the Tikhonov functional's Euler-Lagrange equation. As a theoretical contribution, we furnish explicit and quantitative bounds on generalization errors for each of these solutions. In the proofs, we leverage the theory of metric Sobolev spaces and we combine it with techniques of optimal transport, variational calculus, and large deviation bounds. In our numerical implementation, we harness appropriately designed neural networks to serve as basis functions. These networks undergo training using diverse methodologies. This approach allows us to obtain approximating functions that can be rapidly evaluated after training. Consequently, our constructive solutions significantly enhance at equal accuracy the evaluation speed, surpassing that of state-of-the-art methods by several orders of magnitude.</description>
