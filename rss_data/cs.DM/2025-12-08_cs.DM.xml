      <title>Universality of asymptotic graph homomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Shannon capacity of graphs, introduced by Shannon in 1956 to model zero-error communication, asks for determining the rate of growth of independent sets in strong powers of graphs. Much is still unknown about this parameter, for instance whether it is computable. Recent work has established a dual characterization of the Shannon capacity in terms of the asymptotic spectrum of graphs. A core step in this duality theory is to shift focus from Shannon capacity itself to studying the asymptotic relations between graphs, that is, the asymptotic cohomomorphisms. Towards understanding the structure of Shannon capacity, we study the "combinatorial complexity" of asymptotic cohomomorphism. As our main result, we prove that the asymptotic cohomomorphism order is universal for all countable preorders. That is, we prove that any countable preorder can be order-embedded into the asymptotic cohomomorphism order (i.e. appears as a suborder). Previously this was only known for (non-asymptotic) cohomomorphism. Our proof is based on techniques from asymptotic spectrum duality and convex structure of the asymptotic spectrum of graphs. Our approach in fact leads to a new proof of the universality of (non-asymptotic) cohomomorphism.</description>

      <title>On the Word-Representability of 5-Regular Circulant Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G = (V, E)$ is word-representable if there exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V$ such that, for any two distinct vertices $x, y \in V$, $xy \in E$ if and only if $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$. Two letters $x$ and $y$ are said to alternate in $w$ if, after removing all other letters from $w$, the resulting word is of the form $xyxy\dots$ or $yxyx\dots$ (of even or odd length). For a given set $R = \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_k\}$ of jump elements, an undirected circulant graph $C_n(R)$ on $n$ vertices has vertex set $\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ and edge set $ E = \left\{ \{i,j\} \;\middle|\; |i - j| \bmod n \in \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_k\} \right\}, $ where $0 &lt; r_1 &lt; r_2 &lt; \dots &lt; r_k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$. Recently, Kitaev and Pyatkin proved that every 4-regular circulant graph is word-representable. Srinivasan and Hariharasubramanian further investigated circulant graphs and obtained bounds on the representation number for $k$-regular circulant graphs with $2 \le k \le 4$. In addition to these positive results, their work also presents examples of non-word-representable circulant graphs. In this work, we study word-representability and the representation number of 5-regular circulant graphs via techniques from elementary number theory and group theory, as well as graph coloring, graph factorization and morphisms.</description>

      <title>Finding happiness by evolutionary algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20934v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent line of research concerns the problem of soft happy colouring (SHC), which requires that a partially coloured graph be extended to a complete colouring to maximise local agreements, so that as many vertices as possible end up surrounded by enough same-coloured neighbours. It is already known that SHC is NP-hard, and its solutions have a direct relationship with the community structure of networks; thus, it has immense applications in security and resilience. Past studies have shown that local search approaches can be fast and effective to an extent on the SHC; however, they often get stuck in local optima. Regarding the related problem of maximising happy vertices, evolutionary approaches have been proven effective; hence, this study develops a customised memetic algorithm that is a hybrid of genetic algorithms and local search. The experimental evaluation on a range of graphs in the stochastic block model shows that the memetic algorithm can achieve excellent results in search for an optimised solution to SHC compared to the local search approaches and standard genetic algorithms. Moreover, learning and evolution in the memetic algorithm allow diversification of solutions generated by fast, effective local search approaches, which prove superior for the challenging problem of community detection.</description>

      <title>Pinwheel Scheduling with Real Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a sequence of tasks, each with a positive integer period, the pinwheel scheduling problem involves finding a valid schedule in the sense that the schedule performs one task per day and each task is performed at least once every consecutive days of its period. It had been conjectured by Chan and Chin in 1993 that there exists a valid schedule for any sequence of tasks with density, the sum of the reciprocals of each period, at most $\frac{5}{6}$. Recently, Kawamura settled this conjecture affirmatively. In this paper we consider an extended version with real periods proposed by Kawamura, in which a valid schedule must perform each task $i$ having a real period~$a_{i}$ at least $l$ times in any consecutive $\lceil l a_{i} \rceil$ days for all positive integer $l$. We show that any sequence of tasks such that the periods take three distinct real values and the density is at most $\frac{5}{6}$ admits a valid schedule. We hereby conjecture that the conjecture of Chan and Chin is true also for real periods.</description>

      <title>On Supports for graphs of bounded genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,\mathcal{E})$ be a hypergraph. A support is a graph $Q$ on $X$ such that for each $E\in\mathcal{E}$, the subgraph of $Q$ induced on the elements in $E$ is connected. We consider the problem of constructing a support for hypergraphs defined by connected subgraphs of a host graph. For a graph $G=(V,E)$, let $\mathcal{H}$ be a set of connected subgraphs of $G$. Let the vertices of $G$ be partitioned into two sets the \emph{terminals} $\mathbf{b}(V)$ and the \emph{non-terminals} $\mathbf{r}(V)$. We define a hypergraph on $\mathbf{b}(V)$, where each $H\in\mathcal{H}$ defines a hyperedge consisting of the vertices of $\mathbf{b}(V)$ in $H$.
  We also consider the problem of constructing a support for the \emph{dual hypergraph} - a hypergraph on $\mathcal{H}$ where each $v\in \mathbf{b}(V)$ defines a hyperedge consisting of the subgraphs in $\mathcal{H}$ containing $v$. In fact, we construct supports for a common generalization of the primal and dual settings called the \emph{intersection hypergraph}.
  As our main result, we show that if the host graph $G$ has bounded genus and the subgraphs in $\mathcal{H}$ satisfy a condition of being \emph{cross-free}, then there exists a support that also has bounded genus. Our results are a generalization of the results of Raman and Ray (Rajiv Raman, Saurabh Ray: Constructing Planar Support for Non-Piercing Regions. Discret. Comput. Geom. 64(3): 1098-1122 (2020)).
  Our techniques imply a unified analysis for packing and covering problems for hypergraphs defined on surfaces of bounded genus. We also describe applications of our results for hypergraph colorings.</description>

      <title>On Modular Edge Colourings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k\geq 2$, let $\chi'_k(G)$ denote the minimum number of colours required to colour the edges of $G$ such that, in each colour class, the subgraph induced by the edges of that colour has all non-zero degrees congruent to $1$ modulo $k$. In 1992, Pyber proved that $\chi'_2(G) \leq 4$ for every graph $G$, and posed the question of whether $\chi'_k(G)$ can be bounded solely in terms of $k$ for every $k\geq 3$. This question was answered in 1997 by Scott, who showed that $\chi'_k(G)\leq5k^2\log k$, and further asked whether $\chi'_k(G) = O(k)$. Recently, Botler, Colucci, and Kohayakawa (2023) answered Scott's question affirmatively proving that $\chi'_k(G) \leq 198k - 101$, and conjectured that the multiplicative constant could be reduced to $1$. A step towards this latter conjecture was made in 2024 by Nweit and Yang, who improved the bound to $\chi'_k(G) \leq 177k - 93$. In this paper, we further improve the multiplicative constant to $9$. More specifically, we prove that there is a function $f\in o(k)$ for which $\chi'_k(G) \leq 7k + f(k)$ if $k$ is odd, and $\chi'_k(G) \leq 9k + f(k)$ if $k$ is even. In doing so, we prove that $\chi'_k(G) \leq k + O(d)$ for every $d$-degenerate graph $G$, which plays a central role in our proof.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Talagrand's Creating Large Sets Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Talagrand conjectured that if a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ over $X = \{ 1,2,\cdots, N \}$ is of large measure, then constant times of unions of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ will cover a large portion of the power set of $X$. This conjecture is a central open problem at the intersection of combinatorics and probability theory, and was described by Talagrand as a personal favorite. This paper provides a proof confirming this conjecture.</description>
