      <title>Preliminary analysis of the annual component of the polar motion over 180-year data interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents preliminary results of studying variations in the annual component in the Earth's polar motion. For this purpose, a signal with an annual period was extracted, firstly, from the series of pole coordinates of the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), and secondly, from the combined series of Pulkovo latitude variations for 1840--2017. For this purpose, one-dimensional and multidimensional singular spectrum analysis was used. The Hilbert transform was used to calculate the change in the amplitude and phase of the annual oscillation over time. As a result, it turned out that over an interval of about 180 years, an almost monotonic increase in the amplitude of the annual oscillation from $\approx$60~mas to $\approx$90~mas and an almost monotonic phase shift of $\approx$45$^\circ$ are observed. A correlation was also found between the amplitude of the annual component and the difference in average temperatures from November to March in the northern and southern hemispheres.</description>

      <title>Geological Everything Model 3D: A Promptable Foundation Model for Unified and Zero-Shot Subsurface Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody delineation, and property modeling. By bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated, promptable reasoning system.

      <title>Guided Unconditional and Conditional Generative Models for Super-Resolution and Inference of Quasi-Geostrophic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typically, numerical simulations of the ocean, weather, and climate are coarse, and observations are sparse and gappy. In this work, we apply four generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process score. The other two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and observation data. We consider eight test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and quantification of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors. We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength. Results show that SDEdit generates unphysical fields, while DPS generates reasonable reconstructions at low computational cost but with smoothed fine-scale features. Both conditional approaches require re-training, but they reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with observations, and possess the correct statistics such as energy spectra. Further, their mean model errors are highly correlated with and predictable from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the trade-offs between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment in geophysical inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium distribution of the liquid phase in an unsaturated granular material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an unsaturated granular material, the spatial distribution of the liquid phase results from the competition between gravity and capillary forces. We show that, in the funicular regime, it can be described by a Boltzmann law, with static disorder playing the role of thermal agitation. We propose an approach based on a Langevin equation to derive this distribution, and compare our predictions with conductivity measurements giving the local water content as a function of height in a wet granular medium. We show that experimental data obtained with samples of different polydispersities collapse on a single master curve consistent with our model.</description>

      <title>Sub-Neptunes Are Drier Than They Seem: Rethinking the Origins of Water-Rich Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent claims of biosignature gases in sub-Neptune atmospheres have renewed interest in water-rich sub-Neptunes with surface oceans, often referred to as Hycean planets. These planets are hypothesized to form beyond the snow line, accreting large amounts of H$_2$O &gt;10 wt%) before migrating inward. However, current interior models often neglect chemical equilibration between primordial atmospheres and molten interiors. Here, we compute global chemical equilibrium states for a synthetic population of sub-Neptunes with magma oceans. Although many initially accrete 5-30 wt% water, interior-atmosphere interactions destroy most of it, reducing final H$_2$O mass fractions to below 1.5 wt%. As a result, none meet the threshold for Hycean planets. Despite that, we find H$_2$O-dominated atmospheres exclusively on planets that accreted the least ice. These planets form inside the snow line, are depleted in carbon and hydrogen, and develop small envelopes with envelope mass fractions below 1%, dominated by endogenic water. In contrast, planets formed beyond the snow line accrete more volatiles, but their water is largely converted to H$_2$ gas or sequestered into the interior, resulting in low atmospheric H$_2$O mass fractions. Most H$_2$O-rich envelopes are also fully miscible with H$_2$, making a separate water layer unlikely. Our results topple the conventional link between ice accretion and water-rich atmospheres, showing instead that H$_2$O-dominated envelopes emerge through chemical equilibration in hydrogen-poor planets formed inside the snow line.</description>

      <title>Geological and Well prior assisted full waveform inversion using conditional diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) often faces challenges due to inadequate seismic observations, resulting in band-limited and geologically inaccurate inversion results. Incorporating prior information from potential velocity distributions, well-log information, and our geological knowledge and expectations can significantly improve FWI convergence to a realistic model. While diffusion-regularized FWI has shown improved performance compared to conventional FWI by incorporating the velocity distribution prior, it can benefit even more by incorporating well-log information and other geological knowledge priors. To leverage this fact, we propose a geological class and well-information prior-assisted FWI using conditional diffusion models. This method seamlessly integrates multi-modal information into FWI, simultaneously achieving data fitting and universal geologic and geophysics prior matching, which is often not achieved with traditional regularization methods. Specifically, we propose to combine conditional diffusion models with FWI, where we integrate well-log data and geological class conditions into these conditional diffusion models using classifier-free guidance for multi-modal prior matching beyond the original velocity distribution prior. Numerical experiments on the OpenFWI datasets and field marine data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional FWI and the unconditional diffusion-regularized FWI.</description>
