      <title>Soft cells, Kelvin's foam and the minimal surface of Schwarz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article we introduced a new class of shapes, called \emph{soft cells} which fill space as \emph{soft tilings} without gaps and overlaps while minimizing the number of sharp corners. We defined the \textit{edge bending algorithm} deforming a polyhedral tiling into a soft tiling and we proved that by this algorithm an infinite class of polyhedral tilings can be smoothly deformed into soft tilings. Using the algorithm we constructed the soft versions of all Dirichlet-Voronoi cells associated with point lattices in two and three dimensions; for brevity we will refer to the soft cells produced by the edge bending algorithm as the \textit{standard} soft cells. Here we show that the edge bending algorithm has at least one alternative which is specific to one particular polyhedral tiling. By using the Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling based on the $bcc$ lattice, we demonstrate a new type of soft cell which is non-standard, i.e. it can not be produced by the universal edge bending algorithm and it shows a marked difference compared to the standard soft cell with identical combinatorial properties. We use the new, tiling-specific algorithm to construct a one parameter family of space-filling cells, the end members of which are soft cells and one member of which is the Kelvin cell. By using the same, tiling-specific algorithm we point out the connection of the new, non-standard soft cells to Schwarz minimal surfaces. Our findings indicate that soft cells may be identified by algorithms which are specific for the tiling. Also, results show that not only soft cells themselves, but also the geometric constructions resulting in soft cells could be of immediate interest when studying natural shapes.</description>

      <title>Online Hitting Sets for Disks of Bounded Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present algorithms for the online minimum hitting set problem: Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane and a sequence of geometric objects that arrive one-by-one, we need to maintain a hitting set at all times. For disks of radii in the interval $[1,M]$, we present a $O(\log M \log n)$-competitive algorithm. This result generalizes from disks to positive homothets of any convex body in the plane with scaling factors in the interval $[1,M]$. As a main technical tool, we reduce the problem to the online hitting set problem for integer points and bottomless rectangles. Specifically, we present an $O(\log N)$-competitive algorithm for the variant where $P$ is a set of integer points in an $N\times N$ box, and the geometric objects are bottomless rectangles.</description>

      <title>A free lunch: manifolds of positive reach can be smoothed without decreasing the reach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assumptions on the reach are crucial for ensuring the correctness of many geometric and topological algorithms, including triangulation, manifold reconstruction and learning, homotopy reconstruction, and methods for estimating curvature or reach. However, these assumptions are often coupled with the requirement that the manifold be smooth, typically at least C^2 .In this paper, we prove that any manifold with positive reach can be approximated arbitrarily well by a C^$\infty$ manifold without significantly reducing the reach, by employing techniques from differential topology -partitions of unity and smoothing using convolution kernels. This result implies that nearly all theorems established for C^2 manifolds with a certain reach naturally extend to manifolds with the same reach, even if they are not C^2 , for free!</description>

      <title>Manifolds of positive reach, differentiability, tangent variation, and attaining the reach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contains three main results. Firstly, we give an elementary proof of the following statement: Let $M$ be a (closed, in both the geometrical and topological sense of the word) topological manifold embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$. If $M$ has positive reach, then M can locally be written as the graph of a $C^{1,1}$ from the tangent space to the normal space. Conversely if $M$ can locally written as the graph of a $C^{1,1}$ function from the tangent space to the normal space, then $M$ has positive reach. The result was hinted at by Federer when he introduced the reach, and proved by Lytchak. Lytchak's proof relies heavily CAT(k)-theory. The proof presented here uses only basic results on homology. Secondly, we give optimal Lipschitz-constants for the derivative, in other words we give an optimal bound for the angle between tangent spaces in term of the distance between the points. This improves earlier results, that were either suboptimal or assumed that the manifold was $C^2$. Thirdly, we generalize a result by Aamari et al. which explains the how the reach is attained from the smooth setting to general sets of positive reach.</description>

      <title>Super-Polynomial Growth of the Generalized Persistence Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Persistence Diagram (GPD) for multi-parameter persistence naturally extends the classical notion of persistence diagram for one-parameter persistence. However, unlike its classical counterpart, computing the GPD remains a significant challenge. The main hurdle is that, while the GPD is defined as the M\"obius inversion of the Generalized Rank Invariant (GRI), computing the GRI is intractable due to the formidable size of its domain, i.e., the set of all connected and convex subsets in a finite grid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. This computational intractability suggests seeking alternative approaches to computing the GPD.
  In order to study the complexity associated to computing the GPD, it is useful to consider its classical one-parameter counterpart, where for a filtration of a simplicial complex with $n$ simplices, its persistence diagram contains at most $n$ points. This observation leads to the question: 'Given a $d$-parameter simplicial filtration, could the cardinality of its GPD (specifically, the support of the GPD) also be bounded by a polynomial in the number of simplices in the filtration?' This is the case for $d=1$, where we compute the persistence diagram directly at the simplicial filtration level. If this were also the case for $d\geq2$, it might be possible to compute the GPD directly and much more efficiently without relying on the GRI.
  We show that the answer to the question above is negative, demonstrating the inherent difficulty of computing the GPD. More specifically, we construct a sequence of $d$-parameter simplicial filtrations where the cardinalities of their GPDs are not bounded by any polynomial in the the number of simplices. Furthermore, we show that several commonly used methods for constructing multi-parameter filtrations can give rise to such "wild" filtrations.</description>

      <title>A Subquadratic Time Approximation Algorithm for Individually Fair k-Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $k$-center problem in the context of individual fairness. Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in a metric space and $r_x$ be the distance between $x \in P$ and its $\lceil n/k \rceil$-th nearest neighbor. The problem asks to optimize the $k$-center objective under the constraint that, for every point $x$, there is a center within distance $r_x$. We give bicriteria $(\beta,\gamma)$-approximation algorithms that compute clusterings such that every point $x \in P$ has a center within distance $\beta r_x$ and the clustering cost is at most $\gamma$ times the optimal cost. Our main contributions are a deterministic $O(n^2+ kn \log n)$ time $(2,2)$-approximation algorithm and a randomized $O(nk\log(n/\delta)+k^2/\varepsilon)$ time $(10,2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm, where $\delta$ denotes the failure probability. For the latter, we develop a randomized sampling procedure to compute constant factor approximations for the values $r_x$ for all $x\in P$ in subquadratic time; we believe this procedure to be of independent interest within the context of individual fairness.</description>

      <title>Covering points by hyperplanes and related problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb R^d$, for any $d\ge 2$, a hyperplane $h$ is called $k$-rich with respect to $P$ if it contains at least $k$ points of $P$. Answering and generalizing a question asked by Peyman Afshani, we show that if the number of $k$-rich hyperplanes in $\mathbb R^d$, $d \geq 3$, is at least $\Omega(n^d/k^\alpha + n/k)$, with a sufficiently large constant of proportionality and with $d\le \alpha &lt; 2d-1$, then there exists a $(d-2)$-flat that contains $\Omega(k^{(2d-1-\alpha)/(d-1)})$ points of $P$. We also present upper bound constructions that give instances in which the above lower bound is tight. An extension of our analysis yields similar lower bounds for $k$-rich spheres or $k$-rich flats.</description>

      <title>$k$-dimensional transversals for fat convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a fractional Helly theorem for $k$-flats intersecting fat convex sets. A family $\mathcal{F}$ of sets is said to be $\rho$-fat if every set in the family contains a ball and is contained in a ball such that the ratio of the radii of these balls is bounded by $\rho$. We prove that for every dimension $d$ and positive reals $\rho$ and $\alpha$ there exists a positive $\beta=\beta(d,\rho, \alpha)$ such that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a finite family of $\rho$-fat convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and an $\alpha$-fraction of the $(k+2)$-size subfamilies from $\mathcal{F}$ can be hit by a $k$-flat, then there is a $k$-flat that intersects at least a $\beta$-fraction of the sets of $\mathcal{F}$. We prove spherical and colorful variants of the above results and prove a $(p,k+2)$-theorem for $k$-flats intersecting balls.</description>

      <title>Mixup Barcodes: Quantifying Geometric-Topological Interactions between Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine standard persistent homology with image persistent homology to define a novel way of characterizing shapes and interactions between them. In particular, we introduce: (1) a mixup barcode, which captures geometric-topological interactions (mixup) between two point sets in arbitrary dimension; (2) simple summary statistics, total mixup and total percentage mixup, which quantify the complexity of the interactions as a single number; (3) a software tool for playing with the above.
  As a proof of concept, we apply this tool to a problem arising from machine learning. In particular, we study the disentanglement in embeddings of different classes. The results suggest that topological mixup is a useful method for characterizing interactions for low and high-dimensional data. Compared to the typical usage of persistent homology, the new tool is sensitive to the geometric locations of the topological features, which is often desirable.</description>
