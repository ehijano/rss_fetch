      <title>GesturePrint: Enabling User Identification for mmWave-based Gesture Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has been exploited for gesture recognition. However, existing mmWave-based gesture recognition methods cannot identify different users, which is important for ubiquitous gesture interaction in many applications. In this paper, we propose GesturePrint, which is the first to achieve gesture recognition and gesture-based user identification using a commodity mmWave radar sensor. GesturePrint features an effective pipeline that enables the gesture recognition system to identify users at a minor additional cost. By introducing an efficient signal preprocessing stage and a network architecture GesIDNet, which employs an attention-based multilevel feature fusion mechanism, GesturePrint effectively extracts unique gesture features for gesture recognition and personalized motion pattern features for user identification. We implement GesturePrint and collect data from 17 participants performing 15 gestures in a meeting room and an office, respectively. GesturePrint achieves a gesture recognition accuracy (GRA) of 98.87% with a user identification accuracy (UIA) of 99.78% in the meeting room, and 98.22% GRA with 99.26% UIA in the office. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and a new gesture dataset show GesturePrint's superior performance in enabling effective user identification for gesture recognition systems.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Relying on Reflection Pattern Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose reflection pattern modulation-aided reconfigurable intelligent surface (RPM-RIS)-assisted cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) schemes for green uplink transmission. In our RPM-RIS-assisted CF-mMIMO system, extra information is conveyed by the indices of the active RIS blocks, exploiting the joint benefits of both RIS-assisted CF-mMIMO transmission and RPM. Since only part of the RIS blocks are active, our proposed architecture strikes a flexible energy \emph{vs.} spectral efficiency (SE) trade-off. We commence with introducing the system model by considering spatially correlated channels. Moreover, we conceive a channel estimation scheme subject to the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) constraint, yielding sufficient information for the subsequent signal processing steps. Then, upon exploiting a so-called large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) scheme, the uplink signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is derived based on the RIS ON/OFF statistics, where both maximum ratio (MR) and local minimum mean-square error (L-MMSE) combiners are considered. By invoking the MR combiner, the closed-form expression of the uplink SE is formulated based only on the channel statistics. Furthermore, we derive the total energy efficiency (EE) of our proposed RPM-RIS-assisted CF-mMIMO system. Additionally, we propose a chaotic sequence-based adaptive particle swarm optimization (CSA-PSO) algorithm to maximize the total EE by designing the RIS phase shifts. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RPM-RIS-assisted CF-mMIMO architecture strikes an attractive SE \emph{vs.} EE trade-off, while the CSA-PSO algorithm is capable of attaining a significant EE performance gain compared to conventional solutions.</description>

      <title>Trustworthiness for an Ultra-Wideband Localization Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trustworthiness assessment is an essential step to assure that interdependent systems perform critical functions as anticipated, even under adverse conditions. In this paper, a holistic trustworthiness assessment framework for ultra-wideband self-localization is proposed, including attributes of reliability, security, privacy, and resilience. Our goal is to provide guidance for evaluating a system's trustworthiness based on objective evidence, so-called trustworthiness indicators. These indicators are carefully selected through the threat analysis of the particular system. Our approach guarantees that the resulting trustworthiness indicators correspond to chosen real-world threats. Moreover, experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. While the framework is tailored for this specific use case, the process itself serves as a versatile template, which can be used in other applications in the domains of the Internet of Things or cyber-physical systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Fractal UCA Based OAM for Highly Efficient Orthogonal Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based radio vortex transmission presents a promising opportunity for increasing the capacity of wireless communication in correlated channels due to its inherent orthogonality among different OAM modes. One of the most popular schemes for high-efficient OAM transmission is the digital baseband associated with uniform circular array (UCA) based transceiver. However, the periodicity of complex-exponential feed makes the maximum number of orthogonal signals carried by multiple OAM modes generally restricted to the array-element number of UCA antenna, which poses an open question of how to employ more OAM modes given a fixed number of array elements. Furthermore, signals modulated with high-order OAM modes are difficult to be captured by the receiver due to their serious divergence as propagating in free space, thus severely limiting the capacity of radio vortex communications. To overcome the above challenges, in this paper based on the partly element-overlapped fractal geometry layout and effectively using low-order OAM modes, we propose the quasi-fractal UCA (QF-UCA) antenna based OAM multiplexing transmission. We perform the two-dimension OAM modulation (TOM) and demodulation (TOD) schemes with the orthogonal OAM mode number exceeding the array-element number, which is beyond the traditional concept of multiple antennas based wireless communications. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can achieve more number of orthogonal multiplexing streams than the maximum number of orthogonal multiplexing corresponding to traditional multiple antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communications with Explicit Semantic Bases: Model, Architecture, and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demands for massive data transmission pose great challenges to communication systems. Compared to traditional communication systems that focus on the accurate reconstruction of bit sequences, semantic communications (SemComs), which aim to successfully deliver information connotation, have been regarded as the key technology for next-generation communication systems. Most current SemCom systems focus on an E2E trained neural network (NN) for semantic extraction and interpretation, regarding the parameters of the NN as the implicit synchronized background knowledge. However, the implicit knowledge base (KB)-based architectures lack interpretability and flexibility, which limits the performance of SemComs. In this article, we propose a SemCom architecture that employs explicit semantic bases (Sebs), which serve as the basic units to describe semantic information. In specific, the mathematical model of Sebs is first proposed to build explicit KB. Then, the Seb-based SemCom architecture is proposed, consisting of a communication mode and a KB update mode to enable the evolution of communication systems. Specifically, the modules of Sem-codec and channel codec are dedicatedly designed, with the assistance of explicit KB for efficient and robust transmission of semantics. Moreover, unequal error protection is strategically implemented, considering the intent of communications and the importance of Sebs, thereby ensuring reliability of critical semantics. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed Seb-based SemCom architecture, a case study focusing on an image transmission task is conducted. Simulations show that the proposed Seb-based SemComs outperforms state-of-art works in LPIPS by over 20% under varying communication intents, with more robust performance under fluctuating channel conditions, indicating the flexible and robust transmission of the proposed Seb-based SemComs.</description>

      <title>Joint SIM Configuration and Power Allocation for Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-assisted MU-MISO Systems with TD3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) emerges as an innovative technology with the ability to directly manipulate electromagnetic (EM) wave signals, drawing parallels to the operational principles of artificial neural networks (ANN). Leveraging its structure for direct EM signal processing alongside its low-power consumption, SIM holds promise for enhancing system performance within wireless communication systems. In this paper, we focus on SIM-assisted multi-user multi-input and single-output (MU-MISO) system downlink scenarios in the transmitter. We proposed a joint optimization method for SIM phase shift configuration and antenna power allocation based on the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm to efficiently improve the sum rate. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms both deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and alternating optimization (AO) algorithms. Furthermore, increasing the number of meta-atoms per layer of the SIM is always beneficial. However, continuously increasing the number of layers of SIM does not lead to sustained performance improvement.</description>

      <title>Quantum Support Vector Machine-Based Classification of GPS Signal Reception Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) plays a critical role in navigation by utilizing satellite signals, but its accuracy in urban environments is often compromised by signal obstructions. Previous research has categorized GPS reception conditions into line-of-sight (LOS), non-line-of-sight (NLOS), and LOS+NLOS scenarios to enhance accuracy. This paper introduces a novel approach using quantum support vector machines (QSVM) with a ZZ feature map and fidelity quantum kernel to classify urban GPS signal reception conditions, comparing its performance against classical SVM methods. While classical SVM has been previously explored for this purpose, our study is the first to apply QSVM to this classification task. We conducted experiments using datasets from two distinct urban locations to train and evaluate SVM and QSVM models. Our results demonstrate that QSVM achieves superior classification accuracy compared to classical SVM for urban GPS signal datasets. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of appropriately scaling raw data when utilizing QSVM.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enabled Symbiotic Radio Systems: An Opportunity for Mutualism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a new movable antenna (MA) enabled symbiotic radio (SR) system that leverages the movement of MAs to maximize both the primary and secondary rates, thereby promoting their mutualism. Specifically, the primary transmitter (PT) equipped with MAs utilizes a maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming scheme to ensure the highest primary rate at the primary user (PU). Concurrently, the backscatter device (BD) establishes the secondary transmission by overlaying onto the primary signal. The utilization of MAs aims to enhance the secondary rate by optimizing the positions of MAs to improve the beam gain at the BD. Accordingly, the beam gains for both MA and fixed-position antenna (FPA) scenarios are analyzed, confirming the effectiveness of the MA scheme in achieving the highest primary and secondary rates. Numerical results verity the superiority of our proposed MA enabled scheme.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on EEG-Based Emotion Recognition: A Graph-Based Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to other modalities, electroencephalogram (EEG) based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most focused tasks in affective computing. The nature of emotions is a physiological and psychological state change in response to brain region connectivity, making emotion recognition focus more on the dependency between brain regions instead of specific brain regions. A significant trend is the application of graphs to encapsulate such dependency as dynamic functional connections between nodes across temporal and spatial dimensions. Concurrently, the neuroscientific underpinnings behind this dependency endow the application of graphs in this field with a distinctive significance. However, there is neither a comprehensive review nor a tutorial for constructing emotion-relevant graphs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of graph-related methods in this field from a methodological perspective. We propose a unified framework for graph applications in this field and categorize these methods on this basis. Finally, based on previous studies, we also present several open challenges and future directions in this field.</description>

      <title>CoFAR Clutter Estimation using Covariance-Free Bayesian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cognitive fully adaptive radar (CoFAR) adapts its behavior on its own within a short period of time in response to changes in the target environment. For the CoFAR to function properly, it is critical to understand its operating environment through estimation of the clutter channel impulse response (CCIR). In general, CCIR is sparse but prior works either ignore it or estimate the CCIR by imposing sparsity as an explicit constraint in their optimization problem. In this paper, contrary to these studies, we develop covariance-free Bayesian learning (CoFBL) techniques for estimating sparse CCIR in a CoFAR system. In particular, we consider a multiple measurement vector scenario and estimate a simultaneously sparse (row sparse) CCIR matrix. Our CoFBL framework reduces the complexity of conventional sparse Bayesian learning through the use of the diagonal element estimation rule and conjugate gradient descent algorithm. We show that the framework is applicable to various forms of CCIR sparsity models: group, joint, and joint-cum-group. We evaluate our method through numerical experiments on a data set generated using RFView, a high-fidelity modeling and simulation tool. We derive Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds for the various considered scenarios to benchmark the performance of our algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the proposed CoFBL-based approaches perform better than the existing popular approaches such as multiple focal underdetermined system solver and simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit.</description>

      <title>Optical RISs Improve the Secret Key Rate of Free-Space QKD in HAP-to-UAV Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) are proposed for employment on building rooftops to facilitate free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) between high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and low-altitude platforms (LAPs). Due to practical constraints, the communication terminals can only be positioned beneath the LAPs, preventing direct upward links to HAPs. By deploying ORISs on rooftops to reflect the beam arriving from HAPs towards LAPs from below, reliable HAP-to-LAP links can be established. To accurately characterize the optical beam propagation, we develop an analytical channel model based on extended Huygens-Fresnel principles for representing both the atmospheric turbulence effects and the hovering fluctuations of LAPs. This model facilitates adaptive ORIS beam-width control through linear, quadratic, and focusing phase shifts, which are capable of effectively mitigating the detrimental effects of beam broadening and pointing errors (PE). Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the information-theoretic bound of the QKD secret key rate (SKR) of the HAP-to-LAP links. Our findings demonstrate that quadratic phase shifts enhance the SKR at high HAP-ORIS zenith angles or mild PE conditions by narrowing the beam to optimal sizes. By contrast, linear phase shifts are advantageous at low HAP-ORIS zenith angles under moderate-to-high PE by diverging the beam to mitigate LAP fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Inferring directed spectral information flow between mixed-frequency time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying directed spectral information flow between multivariate time series is important for many applications in finance, climate, geophysics and neuroscience. Spectral Granger causality (SGC) is a prediction-based measure characterizing directed information flow at specific oscillatory frequencies. However, traditional vector autoregressive (VAR) approaches are insufficient to assess SGC when time series have mixed frequencies (MF) or are coupled by nonlinearity. Here we propose a time-frequency canonical correlation analysis approach ("MF-TFCCA") to assess the strength and driving frequency of spectral information flow. We validate the approach with intensive computer simulations on MF time series under various interaction conditions and assess statistical significance of the estimate with surrogate data. We further apply MF-TFCCA to real-life finance, climate and neuroscience data. Our analysis framework provides an exploratory and computationally efficient approach to quantify directed information flow between MF time series in the presence of complex and nonlinear interactions.</description>

      <title>Prototyping and Experimental Results for ISAC-based Channel Knowledge Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a novel approach for achieving environment-aware communication and sensing. This paper presents an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-based CKM prototype system, demonstrating the mutualistic relationship between ISAC and CKM. The system consists of an ISAC base station (BS), a user equipment (UE), and a server. By using a shared orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform over the millimeter wave (mmWave) band, the ISAC BS is able to communicate with the UE while simultaneously sensing the environment and acquiring the UE's location. The prototype showcases the complete process of the construction and application of the ISAC-based CKM. For CKM construction phase, the BS stores the UE's channel feedback information in a database indexed by the UE's location, including beam indices and channel gain. For CKM application phase, the BS looks up the best beam index from the CKM based on the UE's location to achieve training-free mmWave beam alignment. The experimental results show that ISAC can be used to construct or update CKM while communicating with UEs, and the pre-learned CKM can assist ISAC for training-free beam alignment.</description>

      <title>Sparsity Based Multi-Source Robust 3D Localization Using a Moving Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately localizing multiple sources is a critical task with various applications in wireless communications, such as emergency services including natural post-disaster search and rescue operations. However, the scenarios where the receiver is moving, are not addressed by recent studies. This paper tackles the angle of arrival (AOA) 3D-localization problem for multiple sparse signal sources with a moving receiver having limited antennas, potentially outnumbered by the sources. First, an energy detector algorithm is proposed to exploit the sparsity of the signal to eliminate the noisy samples of the signals. Subsequently, elevation and azimuth AOAs of sources are roughly estimated using two dimensional multiple signal classification (2D-MUSIC) method. Next, an algorithm is proposed to refine and estimate the elevation and azimuth AOAs more accurately. To this end, we propose a sparse recovery algorithm to exploit the sparsity feature of the signals. Then, we propose a phase smoothing algorithm to refine the estimations in the output of sparse recovery algorithm. Finally, K-SVD algorithm is employed to find the accurate elevation and azimuth AOAs of sources. For localization, a new multi-source 3D-localization algorithm is proposed to estimate the positions of sources in a sequence of time windows. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Sparsely Pre-transformed Polar Codes for Low-Latency SCL Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep polar codes, employing multi-layered polar kernel pre-transforms in series, are recently introduced variants of pre-transformed polar codes. These codes have demonstrated the ability to reduce the number of minimum weight codewords, thereby closely achieving finite-block length capacity with successive cancellation list (SCL) decoders in certain scenarios. However, when the list size of the SCL decoder is small, which is crucial for low-latency communication applications, the reduction in the number of minimum weight codewords does not necessarily improve decoding performance. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative pre-transform technique to enhance the suitability of polar codes for SCL decoders with practical list sizes. Leveraging the fact that the SCL decoding error event set can be decomposed into two exclusive error event sets, our approach applies two different types of pre-transformations, each targeting the reduction of one of the two error event sets. Extensive simulation results under various block lengths and code rates have demonstrated that our codes consistently outperform all existing state-of-the-art pre-transformed polar codes, including CRC-aided polar codes and polarization-adjusted convolutional codes, when decoded using SCL decoders with small list sizes.</description>

      <title>MR-ULINS: A Tightly-Coupled UWB-LiDAR-Inertial Estimator with Multi-Epoch Outlier Rejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) and the ultra-wideband (UWB) have been integrated together to achieve driftless positioning in global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-denied environments. However, the UWB may be affected by systematic range errors (such as the clock drift and the antenna phase center offset) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals, resulting in reduced robustness. In this study, we propose a UWB-LiDAR-inertial estimator (MR-ULINS) that tightly integrates the UWB range, LiDAR frame-to-frame, and IMU measurements within the multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework. The systematic range errors are precisely modeled to be estimated and compensated online. Besides, we propose a multi-epoch outlier rejection algorithm for UWB NLOS by utilizing the relative accuracy of the LIO. Specifically, the relative trajectory of the LIO is employed to verify the consistency of all range measurements within the sliding window. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that MR-ULINS achieves a positioning accuracy of around 0.1 m in complex indoor environments with severe NLOS interference. Ablation experiments show that the online estimation and multi-epoch outlier rejection can effectively improve the positioning accuracy. Besides, MR-ULINS maintains high accuracy and robustness in LiDAR-degenerated scenes and UWB-challenging conditions with spare base stations.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced AF Relaying: Two-Stage Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The movable antenna (MA) technology has attracted increasing attention in wireless communications due to its capability for flexibly adjusting the positions of multiple antennas in a local region to reconfigure channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate its application in an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system, where a multi-MA AF relay is deployed to assist in the wireless communications from a source to a destination. In particular, we aim to maximize the achievable rate at the destination, by jointly optimizing the AF weight matrix at the relay and its MAs' positions in two stages for receiving the signal from the source and transmitting its amplified version to the destination, respectively. However, compared to the existing one-stage antenna position optimization, the two-stage position optimization is more challenging due to its intricate coupling in the achievable rate at the destination. To tackle this challenge, we decompose the considered problem into several subproblems by invoking the alternating optimization (AO) and solve them by using the semidefinite programming and the gradient ascent. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system over the conventional relaying system with fixed-position antennas (FPAs) and also drive essential insights.</description>

      <title>A robust baro-radar-inertial odometry m-estimator for multicopter navigation in cities and forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search and rescue operations require mobile robots to navigate unstructured indoor and outdoor environments. In particular, actively stabilized multirotor drones need precise movement data to balance and avoid obstacles. Combining radial velocities from on-chip radar with MEMS inertial sensing has proven to provide robust, lightweight, and consistent state estimation, even in visually or geometrically degraded environments. Statistical tests robustify these estimators against radar outliers. However, available work with binary outlier filters lacks adaptability to various hardware setups and environments. Other work has predominantly been tested in handheld static environments or automotive contexts. This work introduces a robust baro-radar-inertial odometry (BRIO) m-estimator for quadcopter flights in typical GNSS-denied scenarios. Extensive real-world closed-loop flights in cities and forests demonstrate robustness to moving objects and ghost targets, maintaining a consistent performance with 0.5 % to 3.2 % drift per distance traveled. Benchmarks on public datasets validate the system's generalizability. The code, dataset, and video are available at https://github.com/ethz-asl/rio.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Symbiotic Communications and Blockchain for Sustainable and Trustworthy 6G Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbiotic communication (SC) is known as a new wireless communication paradigm, similar to the natural ecosystem population, and can enable multiple communication systems to cooperate and mutualize through service exchange and resource sharing. As a result, SC is seen as an important potential technology for future sixth-generation (6G) communications, solving the problem of lack of spectrum resources and energy inefficiency. Symbiotic relationships among communication systems can complement radio resources in 6G. However, the absence of established trust relationships among diverse communication systems presents a formidable hurdle in ensuring efficient and trusted resource and service exchange within SC frameworks. To better realize trusted SC services in 6G, in this paper, we propose a solution that converges SC and blockchain, called a symbiotic blockchain network (SBN). Specifically, we first use cognitive backscatter communication to transform blockchain consensus, that is, the symbiotic blockchain consensus (SBC), so that it can be better suited for the wireless network. Then, for SBC, we propose a highly energy-efficient sharding scheme to meet the extremely low power consumption requirements in 6G. Finally, such a blockchain scheme guarantees trusted transactions of communication services in SC. Through ablation experiments, our proposed SBN demonstrates significant efficacy in mitigating energy consumption and reducing processing latency in adversarial networks, which is expected to achieve a sustainable and trusted 6G wireless network.</description>

      <title>Landmark-based Vehicle Self-Localization Using Automotive Polarimetric Radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automotive self-localization is an essential task for any automated driving function. This means that the vehicle has to reliably know its position and orientation with an accuracy of a few centimeters and degrees, respectively. This paper presents a radar-based approach to self-localization, which exploits fully polarimetric scattering information for robust landmark detection. The proposed method requires no input from sensors other than radar during localization for a given map. By association of landmark observations with map landmarks, the vehicle's position is inferred. Abstract point- and line-shaped landmarks allow for compact map sizes and, in combination with the factor graph formulation used, for an efficient implementation. Evaluation of extensive real-world experiments in diverse environments shows a promising overall localization performance of $0.12 \text{m}$ RMS absolute trajectory and $0.43 {}^\circ$ RMS heading error by leveraging the polarimetric information. A comparison of the performance of different levels of polarimetric information proves the advantage in challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Wireless MAC Protocol Design and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a novel Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) framework for MAC protocol design. Unlike centralized approaches, which rely on a single entity for decision-making, MADRL empowers individual network nodes to autonomously learn and optimize their MAC based on local observations. Leveraging ns3-ai and RLlib, as far as we are aware of, our framework is the first of a kind that enables distributed multi-agent learning within the ns-3 environment, facilitating the design and synthesis of adaptive MAC protocols tailored to specific environmental conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the MADRL MAC framework through extensive simulations, showcasing superior performance compared to legacy protocols across diverse scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of MADRL-based MAC protocols to significantly enhance Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for future wireless applications.</description>

Abstract: Autonomic nervous system is important for cardiac function regulation. Modeling of autonomic cardiac regulation can contribute to health tracking and disease management. This study proposed a mathematical model that simulates autonomic cardiac regulation response to Valsalva Maneuver, which is a commonly used test that provokes the autonomic nervous system. Dataset containing skin sympathetic nervous activity extracted from healthy participants' ECG was used to validate the model. In the data collection procedure, each participant was required to perform Valsalva Maneuver. The preliminary result of modeling for one subject is presented, and the model validation result showed that the root measure square error between the simulated and measured average skin sympathetic nervous activity is 0.01mV. The model is expected to be further developed, evaluated using the dataset including 41 subjects, and ultimately applied for capturing the early signs of cardiac dysfunction in the future.</description>

Abstract: With the advancements in technology and monitoring tools, we often encounter multivariate graph signals, which can be seen as the realizations of multivariate graph processes, and revealing the relationship between their constituent quantities is one of the important problems. To address this issue, we propose a cross-spectral analysis tool for bivariate graph signals. The main goal of this study is to extend the scope of spectral analysis of graph signals to multivariate graph signals. In this study, we define joint weak stationarity graph processes and introduce graph cross-spectral density and coherence for multivariate graph processes. We propose several estimators for the cross-spectral density and investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed estimators. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimators through numerical experiments, including simulation studies and a real data application. Finally, as an interesting extension, we discuss robust spectral analysis of graph signals in the presence of outliers.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Based Active User Enumeration for Grant-Free Access Under Carrier Frequency Offsets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) system in the presence of carrier frequency offsets. We propose two schemes for enumerating active users in such a GF-NOMA system, which is equivalent to estimating the sparsity level. Both schemes utilize a short common pilot and the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix of the received signal. The two schemes differ in their treatment of noise variance: one exploits known variance information, while the other is designed to function without this knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in terms of the normalized mean-squared error.</description>

      <title>Robust Instance Optimal Phase-Only Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-only compressed sensing (PO-CS) is concerned with the recovery of structured signals from the phases of complex measurements. Recent results show that structured signals in the standard sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ can be exactly recovered from complex Gaussian phases, by recasting PO-CS as linear compressed sensing and then applying existing solvers such as basis pursuit. Known guarantees are either non-uniform or do not tolerate model error. We show that this linearization approach is more powerful than the prior results indicate. First, it achieves uniform instance optimality: Under complex Gaussian matrix with a near-optimal number of rows, this approach uniformly recovers all signals in $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ with errors proportional to the model errors of the signals. Specifically, for sparse recovery there exists an efficient estimator $\mathbf{x}^\sharp$ and some universal constant $C$ such that $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2\le \frac{C\sigma_s(\mathbf{x})_1}{\sqrt{s}}~(\forall\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{S}^{n-1})$, where $\sigma_s(\mathbf{x})_1=\min_{\mathbf{u}\in\Sigma^n_s}\|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{x}\|_1$ is the model error under $\ell_1$-norm. Second, the instance optimality is robust to small dense disturbances and sparse corruptions that arise before or after capturing the phases. As an extension, we also propose to recast sparsely corrupted PO-CS as a linear corrupted sensing problem and show that this achieves perfect reconstruction of the signals. Our results resemble the instance optimal guarantees in linear compressed sensing and, to our knowledge, are the first results of this kind for a non-linear sensing scenario.</description>

Abstract: With the advent of sixth-generation networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have revolutionized wireless communications through dynamic electromagnetic wave manipulation, thereby facilitating the adaptability and unparalleled control of real-time performance evaluations. This study proposed a framework to analyze the performance of RIS-assisted free-space optics (FSO) communication over doubly inverted Gamma-Gamma (IGGG) distributions with pointing error impairments. Furthermore, a special scenario addressing secure communication in the potential presence of an eavesdropper. Consequently, we derived closed-form expressions for the outage probability, average bit error rate, average channel capacity, average secrecy capacity, and secrecy outage probability by employing an asymptotic analysis to provide deeper insights into the influence of various system parameters. Finally, we verified our analytical results through appropriate numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been a critical enabling technology in 5th generation (5G) wireless networks. With the advent of 6G, a natural evolution is to employ even more antennas, potentially an order of magnitude more, to meet the ever-increasing demand for spectral efficiency. This is beyond a mere quantitative scale-up. The enlarged array aperture brings a paradigm shift towards near-field communications, departing from traditional far-field approaches. However, designing advanced transceiver algorithms for near-field systems is extremely challenging because of the enormous system scale, the complicated channel characteristics, and the uncertainties in the propagation environments. Hence, it is important to develop scalable, low-complexity, and robust algorithms that can efficiently characterize and leverage the properties of the near-field channel. In this article, we discuss the principles and advocate two general frameworks to design deep learning-based near-field transceivers covering both iterative and non-iterative algorithms. Case studies on channel estimation and beam focusing are presented to provide a hands-on tutorial. Finally, we discuss open issues and shed light on future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed learning and adaptation have received significant interest and found wide-ranging applications in machine learning and signal processing. While various approaches, such as shared-memory optimization, multi-task learning, and consensus-based learning (e.g., federated learning and learning over graphs), focus on optimizing either local rewards or a global reward, there remains a need for further exploration of their interconnections. This paper specifically focuses on a scenario where agents collaborate towards a common task (i.e., optimizing a global reward equal to aggregated local rewards) while effectively having distinct individual tasks (i.e., optimizing individual local parameters in a local reward). Each agent's actions can potentially impact other agents' performance through interactions. Notably, each agent has access to only its local zeroth-order oracle (i.e., reward function value) and shares scalar values, rather than gradient vectors, with other agents, leading to communication bandwidth efficiency and agent privacy. Agents employ zeroth-order optimization to update their parameters, and the asynchronous message-passing between them is subject to bounded but possibly random communication delays. This paper presents theoretical convergence analyses and establishes a convergence rate for nonconvex problems. Furthermore, it addresses the relevant use-case of deep learning-based resource allocation in communication networks and conducts numerical experiments in which agents, acting as transmitters, collaboratively train their individual policies to maximize a global reward, e.g., a sum of data rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A joint design of both sensing and communication can lead to substantial enhancement for both subsystems in terms of size, cost as well as spectrum and hardware efficiency. In the last decade, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a means to efficiently utilize the spectrum on a single and shared hardware platform. Recent studies focused on developing multi-function approaches to share the spectrum between radar sensing and communications. Index modulation (IM) is one particular approach to incorporate information-bearing communication symbols into the emitted radar waveforms. While IM has been well investigated in communications-only systems, the implementation adoption of IM concept in ISAC has recently attracted researchers to achieve improved energy/spectral efficiency while maintaining satisfactory radar sensing performance. This article focuses on recent studies on IM-ISAC, and presents in detail the analytical background and relevance of the major IM-ISAC applications.</description>

Abstract: Digital twin channel (DTC) is the real-time mapping of a wireless channel from the physical world to the digital world, which is expected to provide significant performance enhancements for the sixth-generation (6G) air-interface design. In this work, we first define five evolution levels of channel twins with the progression of wireless communication. The fifth level, autonomous DTC, is elaborated with multi-dimensional factors such as methodology, characterization precision, and data category. Then, we provide detailed insights into the requirements and architecture of a complete DTC for 6G. Subsequently, a sensing-enhanced real-time channel prediction platform and experimental validations are exhibited. Finally, drawing from the vision of the 6G network, we explore the potential applications and the open issues in future DTC research.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to achieving secure wireless communication by leveraging the inherent characteristics of wireless channels through end-to-end learning using a single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) autoencoder (AE). To ensure a more realistic signal transmission, we derive the signal model that captures all radio frequency (RF) hardware impairments to provide reliable and secure communication. Performance evaluations against traditional linear decoders, such as zero-forcing (ZR) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), and the optimal nonlinear decoder, maximum likelihood (ML), demonstrate that the AE-based SIMO model exhibits superior bit error rate (BER) performance, but with a substantial gap even in the presence of RF hardware impairments. Additionally, the proposed model offers enhanced security features, preventing potential eavesdroppers from intercepting transmitted information and leveraging RF impairments for augmented physical layer security and device identification. These findings underscore the efficacy of the proposed end-to-end learning approach in achieving secure and robust wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Localising the Seizure Onset Zone from Single-Pulse Electrical Stimulation Responses with a CNN Transformer</title>

Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, often requiring surgical intervention when medication fails to control seizures. For effective surgical outcomes, precise localisation of the epileptogenic focus - often approximated through the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) - is critical yet remains a challenge. Active probing through electrical stimulation is already standard clinical practice for identifying epileptogenic areas. Our study advances the application of deep learning for SOZ localisation using Single-Pulse Electrical Stimulation (SPES) responses, with two key contributions. Firstly, we implement an existing deep learning model to compare two SPES analysis paradigms: divergent and convergent. These paradigms evaluate outward and inward effective connections, respectively. We assess the generalisability of these models to unseen patients and electrode placements using held-out test sets. Our findings reveal a notable improvement in moving from a divergent (AUROC: 0.574) to a convergent approach (AUROC: 0.666), marking the first application of the latter in this context. Secondly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CNN Transformers with cross-channel attention in handling heterogeneous electrode placements, increasing the AUROC to 0.730. These findings represent a significant step in modelling patient-specific intracranial EEG electrode placements in SPES. Future work will explore integrating these models into clinical decision-making processes to bridge the gap between deep learning research and practical healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Terahertz channel modeling based on surface sensing characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dielectric properties of environmental surfaces, including walls, floors and the ground, etc., play a crucial role in shaping the accuracy of terahertz (THz) channel modeling, thereby directly impacting the effectiveness of communication systems. Traditionally, acquiring these properties has relied on methods such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) or vector network analyzers (VNA), demanding rigorous sample preparation and entailing a significant expenditure of time. However, such measurements are not always feasible, particularly in novel and uncharacterized scenarios. In this work, we propose a new approach for channel modeling that leverages the inherent sensing capabilities of THz channels. By comparing the results obtained through channel sensing with that derived from THz-TDS measurements, we demonstrate the method's ability to yield dependable surface property information. The application of this approach in both a miniaturized cityscape scenario and an indoor environment has shown consistency with experimental measurements, thereby verifying its effectiveness in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in area and regression coefficient estimation from remote sensing maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing map products are used to obtain estimates of environmental quantities, such as deforested area or the effect of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and - because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs - errors are difficult to characterize. Without capturing the biases that may be present, naive calculations of population-level estimates from such maps are statistically invalid. In this paper, we compare several uncertainty quantification methods - stratification, Olofsson area estimation method, and prediction-powered inference - that combine a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data with large-scale remote sensing map products to generate statistically valid estimates. Applying these methods across four remote sensing use cases in area and regression coefficient estimation, we find that they result in estimates that are more reliable than naively using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product. Prediction-powered inference uses ground truth data to correct for bias in the map product estimate and (unlike stratification) does not require us to choose a map product before sampling. This is the first work to (1) apply prediction-powered inference to remote sensing estimation tasks, and (2) perform uncertainty quantification on remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors. To improve the utility of machine learning-generated remote sensing maps for downstream applications, we recommend that map producers provide a holdout ground truth dataset to be used for calibration in uncertainty quantification alongside their maps.</description>

      <title>A UAV-Enabled Time-Sensitive Data Collection Scheme for Grassland Monitoring Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grassland monitoring is essential for the sustainable development of grassland resources. Traditional Internet of Things (IoT) devices generate critical ecological data, making data loss unacceptable, but the harsh environment complicates data collection. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and mobile edge computing (MEC) offer efficient data collection solutions, enhancing performance on resource-limited mobile devices. In this context, this paper is the first to investigate a UAV-enabled time-sensitive data collection problem (TSDCMP) within grassland monitoring edge networks (GMENs). Unlike many existing data collection scenarios, this problem has three key challenges. First, the total amount of data collected depends significantly on the data collection duration and arrival time of UAV at each access point (AP). Second, the volume of data at different APs varies among regions due to differences in monitoring objects and vegetation coverage. Third, the service requests time and locations from APs are often not adjacent topologically. To address these issues, We formulate the TSDCMP for UAV-enabled GMENs as a mixed-integer programming model in a single trip. This model considers constraints such as the limited energy of UAV, the coupled routing and time scheduling, and the state of APs and UAV arrival time. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative heuristic algorithm based on temporal-spatial correlations (CHTSC) that integrates a modified dynamic programming (MDP) into an iterated local search to solve the TSDCMP for UAV-enabled GMENs. This approach fully takes into account the temporal and spatial relationships between consecutive service requests from APs. Systematic simulation studies demonstrate that the mixed-integer programming model effectively represents the TSDCMP within UAV-enabled GMENs.</description>

      <title>Time is Not Enough: Time-Frequency based Explanation for Time-Series Black-Box Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the massive attention given to time-series explanations due to their extensive applications, a notable limitation in existing approaches is their primary reliance on the time-domain. This overlooks the inherent characteristic of time-series data containing both time and frequency features. In this work, we present Spectral eXplanation (SpectralX), an XAI framework that provides time-frequency explanations for time-series black-box classifiers. This easily adaptable framework enables users to "plug-in" various perturbation-based XAI methods for any pre-trained time-series classification models to assess their impact on the explanation quality without having to modify the framework architecture. Additionally, we introduce Feature Importance Approximations (FIA), a new perturbation-based XAI method. These methods consist of feature insertion, deletion, and combination techniques to enhance computational efficiency and class-specific explanations in time-series classification tasks. We conduct extensive experiments in the generated synthetic dataset and various UCR Time-Series datasets to first compare the explanation performance of FIA and other existing perturbation-based XAI methods in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, and then show the superiority of our FIA in the time-frequency domain with the SpectralX framework. Finally, we conduct a user study to confirm the practicality of our FIA in SpectralX framework for class-specific time-frequency based time-series explanations.
