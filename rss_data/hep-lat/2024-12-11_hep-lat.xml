      <title>Investigation of $\pi N$ contributions to nucleon matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an improved method to extract nucleon matrix elements from lattice 3-point functions using a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) with nucleon and pion-nucleon interpolating fields. Our method avoids the computation of the costly three-point functions that have pion-nucleon interpolators at both source and sink. We demonstrate that excited state contamination from $N\pi$ is minimized in nucleon matrix elements of the scalar, vector, pseudoscalar, axial, and tensor currents and discuss our results based on a physical-point ensemble with a pion mass value of 131 MeV. We find that the GEVP is most significant for the isovector pseudoscalar and axial currents.</description>

      <title>Scale Separation, Strong Coupling UV Phases, and the Identification of the Edge of the Conformal Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a simple holographic model to discuss approaching the edge of the conformal window in strongly coupled gauge theories to draw lessons for lattice studies. Walking gauge theories have a gap between the scale where they enter the strong coupling regime and the scale of chiral symmetry breaking. We highlight that there can also be a gap between the scale where the critical value of the quark anti-quark operator's anomalous dimension is passed and the scale of the condensate. This potentially makes identifying the edge of the conformal window in a lattice simulation with UV bare coupling below the fixed point value on a finite lattice difficult. A resolution is to study the theory with a coupling above the fixed point value at the UV cut off. Here we show that an ``artefact" phase with chiral symmetry breaking triggered at the UV cut off exists and lies arbitrarily close to the fixed point at the edge of the conformal window. We quantify the chance of a misidentification of a chiral symmetry breaking theory as IR conformal. We also quantify where the artefact phase lies, tuned to the fixed point value. We use the latest lattice results for SU(3) gauge theory with ten quark flavours in [Hasenfratz:2023wbr] as a test case; we conclude their identification that the theory is in the conformal window is reliable.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram of the Schwinger Model by Adiabatic Preparation of States on a Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue the feasibility to study the phase structure of a quantum physical system on quantum devices via adiabatic preparation of states. We introduce a novel method and successfully test it in application to the Schwinger model in the presence of a topological $\theta$-term. We explore the first-order-phase-transition and the no-transition regions of the corresponding phase diagram. The core idea of the method is to separately evolve the ground and the first excited states with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, the time-dependence of which interpolates between different values of $\theta$. Despite our approach being a direct application of the adiabatic theorem, in some cases we are able to demonstrate its advantages in comparison to a different method from the literature that also employs adiabatic state preparation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the confinement string in (2 + 1)-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics with a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact lattice Quantum Electrodynamics is a complex quantum field theory with dynamical gauge and matter fields and it has similarities with Quantum Chromodynamics, in particular asymptotic freedom and confinement. We consider a (2+1)-dimensional lattice discretization of Quantum Electrodynamics with the inclusion of dynamical fermionic matter. We define a suitable quantum algorithm to measure the static potential as a function of the distance between two charges on the lattice and we use a variational quantum calculation to explore the Coulomb, confinement and string breaking regimes. A symmetry-preserving and resource-efficient variational quantum circuit is employed to prepare the ground state of the theory at various values of the coupling constant, corresponding to different physical distances, allowing the accurate extraction of the static potential from a quantum computer. We demonstrate that results from quantum experiments on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion device and emulator, with full connectivity between qubits, agree with classical noiseless simulations using circuits with 10 and 24 qubits. Moreover, we visualize the electric field flux configurations that mostly contribute in the wave-function of the quantum ground state in the different regimes of the potential, thus giving insights into the mechanisms of confinement and string breaking. These results are a promising step forward in the grand challenge of solving higher dimensional lattice gauge theory problems with quantum computing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Lattice Chiral Fermion without Hermiticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our review of the lattice chiral fermion delves into some critical areas of lattice field theory. By abandoning Hermiticity, the non-Hermitian formulation circumvents the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem while maintaining chiral symmetry, a novel approach. Comparing the Wilson and overlap fermions gives insight into how lattice formulations handle chiral symmetry. The Wilson fermion explicitly breaks chiral symmetry to eliminate doublers. In contrast, the overlap fermion restores a modified form of chiral symmetry using the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. We investigate how the (1+1)D Wilson fermion relates to the (1+1)D overlap fermion in the Hamiltonian formulation. This connection could provide a clearer physical understanding of how chiral symmetry manifests at the lattice level. Depending on Hermiticity for efficiency, Monte Carlo methods face unique challenges in a non-Hermitian setting. We investigate how to correctly apply this method to non-Hermitian lattice fermions, which is essential for practical simulations. Finally, the review of topological charge is crucial, as topological features in lattice formulations are strongly connected to chiral symmetry, anomalies, and the index theorem.</description>

      <title>Mass hierarchies in gauge theory with two index symmetric representation matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories, the running of the anomalous dimension of a fermion bilinear operator is believed to lead to chiral symmetry breaking when gamma=1. Naively using perturbative results to judge when gamma=1 leads to the possibility of large dynamically generated mass hierarchies in models with both two index symmetric representation and fundamental representation fermions. In this paper we study a holographic model of this physics to predict the separation in scales in the meson spectrum. We study SU(Nc) theories at different Nc with one flavour of two index symmetric representation as a function of the number of fundamental fermion flavours NfF. The largest hierarchy we find is for Nc=7 and NfF=22 where the rho mesons made of the two different representations are separated in scale by a factor of 13. For general Nc the hierarchy can be made greater than 7 by tuning NfF. We display the hierarchy as a function of NfF and investigate the quark mass dependence. These predictions do depend on the extrapolation of gamma from the perturbative regime - even in a pessimistic scenario a distinct gap can be achieved.</description>
