      <title>From Sentences to Sequences: Rethinking Languages in Biological System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paradigm of large language models in natural language processing (NLP) has also shown promise in modeling biological languages, including proteins, RNA, and DNA. Both the auto-regressive generation paradigm and evaluation metrics have been transferred from NLP to biological sequence modeling. However, the intrinsic structural correlations in natural and biological languages differ fundamentally. Therefore, we revisit the notion of language in biological systems to better understand how NLP successes can be effectively translated to biological domains. By treating the 3D structure of biomolecules as the semantic content of a sentence and accounting for the strong correlations between residues or bases, we highlight the importance of structural evaluation and demonstrate the applicability of the auto-regressive paradigm in biological language modeling.

      <title>Whole body dynamic PET kernel reconstruction using nonnegative matrix factorization features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kernel reconstruction is a method that reduces noise in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) by exploiting spatial correlations in the PET image. Although this method works well for large anatomical regions with relatively slow kinetics, whole body PET reconstruction with the kernel method can produce suboptimal results in regions with fast kinetics and high contrast. In this work we propose a new design of the spatial kernel matrix to improve reconstruction in fast and slow kinetics body regions. We calculate voxels features using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with optimal rank selection. These features are then used to calculate similarities between voxels considering relative differences between features to adapt to a wide range of activity levels. Simulations and whole body mouse scans of high temporal resolution [18F]SynVesT-1, low dose [11C]raclopride, and [18F]Fallypride were performed to assess the performance of the method in different settings. In simulations, bias vs variance tradeoff and contrast was improved using the NMF kernel matrix, compared with the original kernel method. In real data, fast kinetic regions such as the heart, veins and kidneys presented oversmoothing or artifacts with the original kernel method. Our proposed method did not present these effects, while reducing noise. Brain kinetic modeling parametric maps with image derived input function ([18F]SynVesT-1) and with reference region ([11C]raclopride and [18F]Fallypride) also had lower standard error using the proposed kernel matrix compared with other methods. The NMF kernel reconstruction reduces noise and maintains high contrast in whole body PET imaging, outperforming the traditional kernel method.</description>

      <title>Inferring protein folding mechanisms from natural sequence diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein sequences serve as a natural record of the evolutionary constraints that shape their functional structures. We show that it is possible to use only sequence information to go beyond predicting native structures and global stability to infer the folding mechanisms of globular proteins. The one- and two-body evolutionary energy fields at the amino-acid level are mapped to a coarse-grained description of folding, where proteins are divided into contiguous folding elements, commonly referred to as foldons. For 15 diverse protein families, we calculated the folding mechanisms of hundreds of proteins by simulating an Ising chain of foldons, with their energetics determined by the amino acid sequences. We show that protein topology imposes limits on the variability of folding cooperativity within a family. While most beta and alpha/beta structures exhibit only a few possible mechanisms despite high sequence diversity, alpha topologies allow for diverse folding scenarios among family members. We show that both the stability and cooperativity changes induced by mutations can be computed directly using sequence-based evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</description>
