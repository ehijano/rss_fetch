      <title>The Nature of Organization in Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living systems are thermodynamically open but closed in their organization. In other words, even though their material components turn over constantly, a material-independent property persists, which we call organization. Moreover, organization comes from within organisms themselves, which requires us to explain how this self-organization is established and maintained. In this paper we propose a mathematical and conceptual framework to understand the kinds of organized systems that living systems are, aiming to explain how self-organization emerges from more basic elemental processes. Additionally, we map our own notions to existing traditions in theoretical biology and philosophy, aiming to bring the main formal ideas into conceptual congruence.</description>

      <title>Random search with stochastic resetting: when finding the target is not enough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a random search process with stochastic resetting and a partially accessible target $\calU$. That is, when the searcher finds the target by attaching to its surface $\partial \calU$ it does not have immediate access to the resources within the target interior. After a random waiting time, the searcher either gains access to the resources within or detaches and continues its search process. We also assume that the searcher requires an alternating sequence of periods of bulk diffusion interspersed with local surface interactions before being able to attach to the surface. The attachment, detachment and target entry events are the analogs of adsorption, desorption and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in physical chemistry. In applications to animal foraging, the resources could represent food or shelter while resetting corresponds to an animal returning to its home base. We begin by considering a Brownian particle on the half-line with a partially accessible target at the origin $x=0$. We calculate the non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) in the case of reversible adsorption and obtain the corresponding first passage time (FPT) density for absorption when adsorption is only partially reversible. We then reformulate the stochastic process in terms of a pair of renewal equations that relate the probability density and FPT density for absorption in terms of the corresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. The renewal equations allow us to incorporate non-Markovian models of absorption and desorption. They also provide a useful decomposition of quantities such as the mean FPT (MFPT) in terms of the number of desorption events and the statistics of the waiting time density. Finally, we consider various extensions of the theory, including higher-dimensional search processes and an encounter-based model of absorption.</description>

      <title>A Protocol to Exposure Path Analysis for Multiple Stressors Associated with Cardiovascular Disease Risk: A Novel Approach Using NHANES Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Multiple medical and non-medical stressors, along with the complicity of their exposure pathways, have posted significant challenges to the epidemiological interpretation of the non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Objective: To develop a protocol for deconstructing the complex exposure pathways linking various stressors to adverse outcomes and to elucidate the sequential determinants contributing to CVD risk in depth. Methods: In this study, we developed a Path-Lasso approach, rooted in Adaptive Lasso regression, to construct the network and paths to interpret the determinants of CVD in an in-depth way by using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Univariate logistic regression was initially employed to screen out all potential factors of influencing CVD. Then a programmed approach, using Path-Lasso technique, stratified covariates and established a causal network to predict CVD risk. Results: Age, smoking and waist circumference were identified as the most significant predictors of CVD risk. Other factors, such as race, marital status, physical activity, cadmium exposure and diabetes acted as the intermediary or proximal variables. All these stressors (or nodes) formed the network with paths (or edges to link the CVD), in which the latent layer variables that causally associate to the outcome are linearly formed by the stressors in each layer. Discussion: The Path-Lasso approach revealed the epidemiological pathways, linking covariates to CVD risk, which is instrumental in elucidating the inter-covariate transitions of their predication to the outcome, and providing the hierarchal network for foundation of the assessment of CVD risk and the beyond.</description>

      <title>InfoSEM: A Deep Generative Model with Informative Priors for Gene Regulatory Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from gene expression data is crucial for understanding biological processes. While supervised models are reported to achieve high performance for this task, they rely on costly ground truth (GT) labels and risk learning gene-specific biases, such as class imbalances of GT interactions, rather than true regulatory mechanisms. To address these issues, we introduce InfoSEM, an unsupervised generative model that leverages textual gene embeddings as informative priors, improving GRN inference without GT labels. InfoSEM can also integrate GT labels as an additional prior when available, avoiding biases and further enhancing performance. Additionally, we propose a biologically motivated benchmarking framework that better reflects real-world applications such as biomarker discovery and reveals learned biases of existing supervised methods. InfoSEM outperforms existing models by 38.5% across four datasets using textual embeddings prior and further boosts performance by 11.1% when integrating labeled data as priors.</description>

      <title>GeneFEAST: the pivotal, gene-centric step in functional enrichment analysis interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Summary: GeneFEAST, implemented in Python, is a gene-centric functional enrichment analysis summarisation and visualisation tool that can be applied to large functional enrichment analysis (FEA) results arising from upstream FEA pipelines. It produces a systematic, navigable HTML report, making it easy to identify sets of genes putatively driving multiple enrichments and to explore gene-level quantitative data first used to identify input genes. Further, GeneFEAST can compare FEA results from multiple studies, making it possible, for example, to highlight patterns of gene expression amongst genes commonly differentially expressed in two sets of conditions, and giving rise to shared enrichments under those conditions. GeneFEAST offers a novel, effective way to address the complexities of linking up many overlapping FEA results to their underlying genes and data, advancing gene-centric hypotheses, and providing pivotal information for downstream validation experiments.

      <title>Topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, therapeutic peptides have demonstrated great promise for cancer treatment. To explore powerful anticancer peptides, artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have been developed to systematically screen potential candidates. However, the lack of efficient featurization of peptides has become a bottleneck for these machine-learning models. In this paper, we propose a topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptides prediction. Our Top-ML employs peptide topological features derived from its sequence "connection" information characterized by vector and spectral descriptors. Our Top-ML model, employing an Extra-Trees classifier, has been validated on the AntiCP 2.0 and mACPpred 2.0 benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance or results comparable to existing deep learning models, while providing greater interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging novel topology-based featurization to accelerate the identification of anticancer peptides.</description>

      <title>Approximate solutions of a general stochastic velocity-jump model subject to discrete-time noisy observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-resolution spatio-temporal data that track individual motile entities over time. These tracking data motivate the use of mathematical models to characterise the motion observed. In this paper, we aim to describe the solutions of velocity-jump models for single-agent motion in one spatial dimension, characterised by successive Markovian transitions within a finite network of n states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every other state. In particular, we focus on obtaining the solutions of the model subject to discrete-time noisy observations, with no direct access to the agent state. The lack of direct observation of the hidden state makes the problem of finding the exact distributions generally intractable. Therefore, we derive a series of approximations for the data distributions. We verify the accuracy of these approximations by comparing them to the empirical distributions generated through simulations of four example model structures. These comparisons confirm that the approximations are accurate given sufficiently infrequent state switching relative to the imaging frequency. The approximate distributions computed can be used to obtain fast forwards predictions, to give guidelines on experimental design, and as likelihoods for inference and model selection.</description>
