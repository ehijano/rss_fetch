      <title>Optimizing Malware Detection in IoT Networks: Leveraging Resource-Aware Distributed Computing for Enhanced Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, networked IoT systems have revo- lutionized connectivity, portability, and functionality, offering a myriad of advantages. However, these systems are increasingly targeted by adversaries due to inherent security vulnerabilities and limited computational and storage resources. Malicious applications, commonly known as malware, pose a significant threat to IoT devices and networks. While numerous malware detection techniques have been proposed, existing approaches often overlook the resource constraints inherent in IoT environ- ments, assuming abundant resources for detection tasks. This oversight is compounded by ongoing workloads such as sens- ing and on-device computations, further diminishing available resources for malware detection. To address these challenges, we present a novel resource- and workload-aware malware detection framework integrated with distributed computing for IoT networks. Our approach begins by analyzing available resources for malware detection using a lightweight regression model. Depending on resource availability, ongoing workload executions, and communication costs, the malware detection task is dynamically allocated either on-device or offloaded to neighboring IoT nodes with sufficient resources. To safeguard data integrity and user privacy, rather than transferring the entire malware detection task, the classifier is partitioned and distributed across multiple nodes, and subsequently integrated at the parent node for comprehensive malware detection. Experimental analysis demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed technique, achieving a remarkable speed-up of 9.8x compared to on-device inference, while maintaining a high malware detection accuracy of 96.7%.</description>

      <title>Integration of Federated Learning and Blockchain in Healthcare: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable devices and medical sensors revolutionize health monitoring, raising concerns about data privacy in ML for healthcare. This tutorial explores FL and BC integration, offering a secure and privacy-preserving approach to healthcare analytics. FL enables decentralized model training on local devices at healthcare institutions, keeping patient data localized. This facilitates collaborative model development without compromising privacy. However, FL introduces vulnerabilities. BC, with its tamper-proof ledger and smart contracts, provides a robust framework for secure collaborative learning in FL. After presenting a taxonomy for the various types of data used in ML in medical applications, and a concise review of ML techniques for healthcare use cases, this tutorial explores three integration architectures for balancing decentralization, scalability, and reliability in healthcare data. Furthermore, it investigates how BCFL enhances data security and collaboration in disease prediction, medical image analysis, patient monitoring, and drug discovery. By providing a tutorial on FL, blockchain, and their integration, along with a review of BCFL applications, this paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage these technologies for secure and privacy-preserving healthcare ML. It aims to accelerate advancements in secure and collaborative healthcare analytics, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>SoK (or SoLK?): On the Quantitative Study of Sociodemographic Factors and Computer Security Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers are increasingly exploring how gender, culture, and other sociodemographic factors correlate with user computer security and privacy behaviors. To more holistically understand relationships between these factors and behaviors, we make two contributions. First, we broadly survey existing scholarship on sociodemographics and secure behavior (151 papers) before conducting a focused literature review of 47 papers to synthesize what is currently known and identify open questions for future research. Second, by incorporating contemporary social and critical theories, we establish guidelines for future studies of sociodemographic factors and security behaviors that address how to overcome common pitfalls. We present a case study to demonstrate our guidelines in action, at-scale, that conduct a measurement study of the relationships between sociodemographics and de-identified, aggregated log data of security and privacy behaviors among 16,829 users on Facebook across 16 countries. Through these contributions, we position our work as a systemization of a lack of knowledge (SoLK). Overall, we find contradictory results and vast unknowns about how identity shapes security behavior. Through our guidelines and discussion, we chart new directions to more deeply examine how and why sociodemographic factors affect security behaviors.</description>

      <title>Sisu: Decentralized Trustless Bridge For Full Ethereum Node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a detailed approach and implementation to prove Ethereum full node using recursive SNARK, distributed general GKR and Groth16. Our protocol's name is Sisu whose architecture is based on distributed Virgo in zkBridge with some major improvements. Besides proving signature aggregation, we provide solutions to 2 hard problems in proving Ethereum full node: 1) any public key is valid under previous beacon state and 2) all public keys are pairwise distinct. Our solution does not require worker-to-worker communication and therefore reduce total worker-to-worker network traffic from terabyte of data to zero compared to zkBridge. This makes our approach suitable for emerging distributed prover markets and more decentralized compared to zkBridge. Our design is highly parallelable and capable of running on GPU for most parts.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Polkadot's Transactions Ecosystem: methodology, tools, and insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth potential of a crypto(currency) project can be measured by the use cases spurred by the underlying technology. However, these projects are usually distributed, with a weak feedback schemes. Hence, a metric that is widely used as a proxy for their healthiness is the number of transactions and related volumes. Nevertheless, such a metric can be subject to manipulation (the crypto market being an unregulated one magnifies such a risk). To address the cited gap we design a comprehensive methodology to process large cryptocurrency transaction graphs that, after clustering user addresses of interest, derives a compact representation of the network that highlights clusters interactions.
  To show the viability of our solution, we bring forward a use case centered on Polkadot, which has gained significant attention in the digital currency landscape due to its pioneering approach to interoperability and scalability. However, little is known about how many and to what extent its wide range of enabled use cases have been adopted by end-users so far. The answer to this type of question means mapping Polkadot (or any analyzed crypto project) on a palette that ranges from a thriving ecosystem to a speculative coin without compelling use cases.
  Our findings demonstrate that crypto exchanges exert considerable influence on the Polkadot network, owning nearly 40% of all addresses in the ledger and absorbing at least 80% of all transactions. In addition, the high volume of inter-exchange transactions (&gt; 20%) underscores the strong interconnections among just a couple of prominent exchanges, prompting further investigations into the behavior of these actors to uncover potential unethical activities, such as wash trading. These results, while characterized by a high level of scalability and adaptability, are at the same time immune from the drawbacks of currently used metrics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Post Quantum Cryptography with Quantum Key Distribution for Sustainable Mobile Network Architecture Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of mobile networks and their increasing importance to modern life, combined with the emerging threat of quantum computing, present new challenges and opportunities for cybersecurity. This paper addresses the complexity of protecting these critical infrastructures against future quantum attacks while considering operational sustainability. We begin with an overview of the current landscape, identify the main vulnerabilities in mobile networks, and evaluate existing security solutions with new post-quantum cryptography (PQC) methods. We then present a quantum-secure architecture with PQC and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) tailored explicitly for sustainable mobile networks and illustrate its applicability with several use cases that emphasize the need for advanced protection measures in this new era. In addition, a comprehensive analysis of PQC algorithm families is presented, focusing on their suitability for integration in mobile environments, with particular attention to the trade-offs between energy consumption and security improvements. Finally, recommendations for strengthening mobile networks against quantum threats are provided through a detailed examination of current challenges and opportunities.</description>

      <title>Shining Light into the Tunnel: Understanding and Classifying Network Traffic of Residential Proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging in recent years, residential proxies (RESIPs) feature multiple unique characteristics when compared with traditional network proxies (e.g., commercial VPNs), particularly, the deployment in residential networks rather than data center networks, the worldwide distribution in tens of thousands of cities and ISPs, and the large scale of millions of exit nodes. All these factors allow RESIP users to effectively masquerade their traffic flows as ones from authentic residential users, which leads to the increasing adoption of RESIP services, especially in malicious online activities. However, regarding the (malicious) usage of RESIPs (i.e., what traffic is relayed by RESIPs), current understanding turns out to be insufficient. Particularly, previous works on RESIP traffic studied only the maliciousness of web traffic destinations and the suspicious patterns of visiting popular websites. Also, a general methodology is missing regarding capturing large-scale RESIP traffic and analyzing RESIP traffic for security risks. Furthermore, considering many RESIP nodes are found to be located in corporate networks and are deployed without proper authorization from device owners or network administrators, it is becoming increasingly necessary to detect and block RESIP traffic flows, which unfortunately is impeded by the scarcity of realistic RESIP traffic datasets and effective detection methodologies.
  To fill in these gaps, multiple novel tools have been designed and implemented in this study, which include a general framework to deploy RESIP nodes and collect RESIP traffic in a distributed manner, a RESIP traffic analyzer to efficiently process RESIP traffic logs and surface out suspicious traffic flows, and multiple machine learning based RESIP traffic classifiers to timely and accurately detect whether a given traffic flow is RESIP traffic or not.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity in the Quantum Era: Assessing the Impact of Quantum Computing on Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum computing presents a double-edged sword for cybersecurity. While its immense power holds promise for advancements in various fields, it also threatens to crack the foundation of current encryption methods. This analysis explores the impact of quantum computing on critical infrastructure and cloud services, meticulously evaluating potential vulnerabilities across various layers, including applications, data, runtime, middleware, operating systems, virtualization, hardware, storage, and networks. We advocate for proactive security strategies and collaboration between sectors to develop and implement quantum-resistant cryptography. This crucial shift necessitates a comprehensive approach, and the paper introduces a tailored security blueprint encompassing nine critical infrastructure components. This blueprint strengthens each area's defenses against potential quantum-induced cyber threats. Our strategic vulnerability and risk assessment equips stakeholders with the knowledge to navigate the complex quantum threat landscape. This empowers them to make informed decisions about design, implementation, and policy formulation, ultimately bolstering the resilience of critical infrastructure. In essence, this analysis not only forecasts quantum threats but also offers a sophisticated, actionable framework for fortifying infrastructure and cloud environments against the multifaceted challenges of the quantum era. This proactive approach will ensure continued data security and a thriving digital landscape in the years to come</description>

      <title>Dynamic Frequency-Based Fingerprinting Attacks against Modern Sandbox Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cloud computing landscape has evolved significantly in recent years, embracing various sandboxes to meet the diverse demands of modern cloud applications. These sandboxes encompass container-based technologies like Docker and gVisor, microVM-based solutions like Firecracker, and security-centric sandboxes relying on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX and AMD SEV. However, the practice of placing multiple tenants on shared physical hardware raises security and privacy concerns, most notably side-channel attacks.
  In this paper, we investigate the possibility of fingerprinting containers through CPU frequency reporting sensors in Intel and AMD CPUs. One key enabler of our attack is that the current CPU frequency information can be accessed by user-space attackers. We demonstrate that Docker images exhibit a unique frequency signature, enabling the distinction of different containers with up to 84.5% accuracy even when multiple containers are running simultaneously in different cores. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of our attack when performed against several sandboxes deployed in cloud environments, including Google's gVisor, AWS' Firecracker, and TEE-based platforms like Gramine (utilizing Intel SGX) and AMD SEV. Our empirical results show that these attacks can also be carried out successfully against all of these sandboxes in less than 40 seconds, with an accuracy of over 70% in all cases. Finally, we propose a noise injection-based countermeasure to mitigate the proposed attack on cloud environments.</description>

      <title>Confidential Federated Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning and Analytics (FLA) have seen widespread adoption by technology platforms for processing sensitive on-device data. However, basic FLA systems have privacy limitations: they do not necessarily require anonymization mechanisms like differential privacy (DP), and provide limited protections against a potentially malicious service provider. Adding DP to a basic FLA system currently requires either adding excessive noise to each device's updates, or assuming an honest service provider that correctly implements the mechanism and only uses the privatized outputs. Secure multiparty computation (SMPC) -based oblivious aggregations can limit the service provider's access to individual user updates and improve DP tradeoffs, but the tradeoffs are still suboptimal, and they suffer from scalability challenges and susceptibility to Sybil attacks. This paper introduces a novel system architecture that leverages trusted execution environments (TEEs) and open-sourcing to both ensure confidentiality of server-side computations and provide externally verifiable privacy properties, bolstering the robustness and trustworthiness of private federated computations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Federated Learning-Based Deep Learning Model for Privacy MRI Brain Tumor Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed training can facilitate the processing of large medical image datasets, and improve the accuracy and efficiency of disease diagnosis while protecting patient privacy, which is crucial for achieving efficient medical image analysis and accelerating medical research progress. This paper presents an innovative approach to medical image classification, leveraging Federated Learning (FL) to address the dual challenges of data privacy and efficient disease diagnosis. Traditional Centralized Machine Learning models, despite their widespread use in medical imaging for tasks such as disease diagnosis, raise significant privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of patient data. As an alternative, FL emerges as a promising solution by allowing the training of a collective global model across local clients without centralizing the data, thus preserving privacy. Focusing on the application of FL in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain tumor detection, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the Federated Learning framework coupled with EfficientNet-B0 and the FedAvg algorithm in enhancing both privacy and diagnostic accuracy. Through a meticulous selection of preprocessing methods, algorithms, and hyperparameters, and a comparative analysis of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, the research uncovers optimal strategies for image classification. The experimental results reveal that EfficientNet-B0 outperforms other models like ResNet in handling data heterogeneity and achieving higher accuracy and lower loss, highlighting the potential of FL in overcoming the limitations of traditional models. The study underscores the significance of addressing data heterogeneity and proposes further research directions for broadening the applicability of FL in medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning on Riemannian Manifolds with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm in distributed machine learning. Despite the partial safeguarding of agents' information within FL systems, a malicious adversary can potentially infer sensitive information through various means. In this paper, we propose a generic private FL framework defined on Riemannian manifolds (PriRFed) based on the differential privacy (DP) technique. We analyze the privacy guarantee while establishing the convergence properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first federated learning framework on Riemannian manifold with a privacy guarantee and convergence results. Numerical simulations are performed on synthetic and real-world datasets to showcase the efficacy of the proposed PriRFed approach.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Census Data Generation via Multidimensional Multiset Sum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The US Decennial Census provides valuable data for both research and policy purposes. Census data are subject to a variety of disclosure avoidance techniques prior to release in order to preserve respondent confidentiality. While many are interested in studying the impacts of disclosure avoidance methods on downstream analyses, particularly with the introduction of differential privacy in the 2020 Decennial Census, these efforts are limited by a critical lack of data: The underlying "microdata," which serve as necessary input to disclosure avoidance methods, are kept confidential.
  In this work, we aim to address this limitation by providing tools to generate synthetic microdata solely from published Census statistics, which can then be used as input to any number of disclosure avoidance algorithms for the sake of evaluation and carrying out comparisons. We define a principled distribution over microdata given published Census statistics and design algorithms to sample from this distribution. We formulate synthetic data generation in this context as a knapsack-style combinatorial optimization problem and develop novel algorithms for this setting. While the problem we study is provably hard, we show empirically that our methods work well in practice, and we offer theoretical arguments to explain our performance. Finally, we verify that the data we produce are "close" to the desired ground truth.</description>

      <title>Private Vector Mean Estimation in the Shuffle Model: Optimal Rates Require Many Messages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of private vector mean estimation in the shuffle model of privacy where $n$ users each have a unit vector $v^{(i)} \in\mathbb{R}^d$. We propose a new multi-message protocol that achieves the optimal error using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\min(n\varepsilon^2,d)\right)$ messages per user. Moreover, we show that any (unbiased) protocol that achieves optimal error requires each user to send $\Omega(\min(n\varepsilon^2,d)/\log(n))$ messages, demonstrating the optimality of our message complexity up to logarithmic factors. Additionally, we study the single-message setting and design a protocol that achieves mean squared error $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/(d+2)}\varepsilon^{-4/(d+2)})$. Moreover, we show that any single-message protocol must incur mean squared error $\Omega(dn^{d/(d+2)})$, showing that our protocol is optimal in the standard setting where $\varepsilon = \Theta(1)$. Finally, we study robustness to malicious users and show that malicious users can incur large additive error with a single shuffler.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Training-as-a-Service for On-Device Intelligence: Concept, Architectural Scheme, and Open Problems</title>

Abstract: On-device intelligence (ODI) enables artificial intelligence (AI) applications to run on end devices, providing real-time and customized AI services without relying on remote servers. However, training models for on-device deployment face significant challenges due to the decentralized and privacy-sensitive nature of users' data, along with end-side constraints related to network connectivity, computation efficiency, etc. Existing training paradigms, such as cloud-based training, federated learning, and transfer learning, fail to sufficiently address these practical constraints that are prevalent for devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose Privacy-Preserving Training-as-a-Service (PTaaS), a novel service computing paradigm that provides privacy-friendly, customized AI model training for end devices. PTaaS outsources the core training process to remote and powerful cloud or edge servers, efficiently developing customized on-device models based on uploaded anonymous queries, ensuring data privacy while reducing the computation load on individual devices. We explore the definition, goals, and design principles of PTaaS, alongside emerging technologies that support the PTaaS paradigm. An architectural scheme for PTaaS is also presented, followed by a series of open problems that set the stage for future research directions in the field of PTaaS.</description>

      <title>SMap: Internet-wide Scanning for Spoofing</title>

Abstract: To protect themselves from attacks, networks need to enforce ingress filtering, i.e., block inbound packets sent from spoofed IP addresses. Although this is a widely known best practice, it is still not clear how many networks do not block spoofed packets. Inferring the extent of spoofability at Internet scale is challenging and despite multiple efforts the existing studies currently cover only a limited set of the Internet networks: they can either measure networks that operate servers with faulty network-stack implementations, or require installation of the measurement software on volunteer networks, or assume specific properties, like traceroute loops. Improving coverage of the spoofing measurements is critical.
  In this work we present the Spoofing Mapper (SMap): the first scanner for performing Internet-wide studies of ingress filtering. SMap evaluates spoofability of networks utilising standard protocols that are present in almost any Internet network. We applied SMap for Internet-wide measurements of ingress filtering: we found that 69.8% of all the Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet do not filter spoofed packets and found 46880 new spoofable ASes which were not identified in prior studies. Our measurements with SMap provide the first comprehensive view of ingress filtering deployment in the Internet as well as remediation in filtering spoofed packets over a period of two years until May 2021.
  We set up a web service at https://smap.cad.sit.fraunhofer.de to perform continual Internet-wide data collection with SMap and display statistics from spoofing evaluation. We make our datasets as well as the SMap (implementation and the source code) publicly available to enable researchers to reproduce and validate our results, as well as to continually keep track of changes in filtering spoofed packets in the Internet.</description>

Abstract: Ransomware attacks have caused billions of dollars in damages in recent years, and are expected to cause billions more in the future. Consequently, significant effort has been devoted to ransomware detection and mitigation. Behavioral-based ransomware detection approaches have garnered considerable attention recently. These behavioral detectors typically rely on process-based behavioral profiles to identify malicious behaviors. However, with an increasing body of literature highlighting the vulnerability of such approaches to evasion attacks, a comprehensive solution to the ransomware problem remains elusive. This paper presents Minerva, a novel robust approach to ransomware detection. Minerva is engineered to be robust by design against evasion attacks, with architectural and feature selection choices informed by their resilience to adversarial manipulation. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of Minerva across a diverse spectrum of ransomware types, encompassing unseen ransomware as well as variants designed specifically to evade Minerva. Our evaluation showcases the ability of Minerva to accurately identify ransomware, generalize to unseen threats, and withstand evasion attacks. Furthermore, Minerva achieves remarkably low detection times, enabling the adoption of data loss prevention techniques with near-zero overhead.</description>

      <title>Fast and Private Inference of Deep Neural Networks by Co-designing Activation Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is an increasingly popular design where a company with abundant computing resources trains a deep neural network and offers query access for tasks like image classification. The challenge with this design is that MLaaS requires the client to reveal their potentially sensitive queries to the company hosting the model. Multi-party computation (MPC) protects the client's data by allowing encrypted inferences. However, current approaches suffer from prohibitively large inference times. The inference time bottleneck in MPC is the evaluation of non-linear layers such as ReLU activation functions. Motivated by the success of previous work co-designing machine learning and MPC, we develop an activation function co-design. We replace all ReLUs with a polynomial approximation and evaluate them with single-round MPC protocols, which give state-of-the-art inference times in wide-area networks. Furthermore, to address the accuracy issues previously encountered with polynomial activations, we propose a novel training algorithm that gives accuracy competitive with plaintext models. Our evaluation shows between $3$ and $110\times$ speedups in inference time on large models with up to $23$ million parameters while maintaining competitive inference accuracy.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Privacy-Preserving Computing</title>

Abstract: Privacy-preserving computation (PPC) methods, such as secure multiparty computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE), are deployed increasingly often to guarantee data confidentiality in computations over private, distributed data. Similarly, we observe a steep increase in the adoption of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to guarantee (public) verifiability of locally executed computations. We project that applications that are data intensive and require strong privacy guarantees, are also likely to require verifiable correctness guarantees, especially when outsourced. While the combination of methods for verifiability and privacy protection has clear benefits, certain challenges stand before their widespread practical adoption. In this work, we analyze existing solutions that combine verifiability with privacy-preserving computations over distributed data, in order to preserve confidentiality and guarantee correctness at the same time. We classify and compare 37 different schemes, regarding solution approach, security, efficiency, and practicality. Lastly, we discuss some of the most promising solutions in this regard, and present various open challenges and directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Provably Robust Multi-bit Watermarking for AI-generated Text via Error Correction Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed for their remarkable capability to generate texts resembling human language. However, they could be misused by criminals to create deceptive content, such as fake news and phishing emails, which raises ethical concerns. Watermarking is a key technique to mitigate the misuse of LLMs, which embeds a watermark (e.g., a bit string) into a text generated by a LLM. Consequently, this enables the detection of texts generated by a LLM as well as the tracing of generated texts to a specific user. The major limitation of existing watermark techniques is that they cannot accurately or efficiently extract the watermark from a text, especially when the watermark is a long bit string. This key limitation impedes their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., tracing generated texts to a specific user.
  This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge. We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee. This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results. The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets. For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al. (state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</description>

      <title>Resilient Watermarking for LLM-Generated Codes</title>

Abstract: With the development of large language models, multiple AIs are now made available for code generation (such as ChatGPT and StarCoder) and are adopted widely. It is often desirable to know whether a piece of code is generated by AI, and furthermore, which AI is the author. For instance, if a certain version of AI is known to generate vulnerable codes, it is particularly important to know the creator. Existing approaches are not satisfactory as watermarking codes are more challenging compared to watermarking text data, as codes can be altered with relative ease via widely-used code refactoring methods. In this work, we propose ACW (AI Code Watermarking), a novel method for watermarking AI-generated codes. The key idea of ACW is to selectively apply a set of carefully-designed semantic-preserving, idempotent code transformations, whose presence (or absence) allows us to determine the existence of the watermark. It is efficient as it requires no training or fine-tuning and works in a black-box manner. It is resilient as the watermark cannot be easily removed or tampered through common code refactoring methods. Our experimental results show that ACW is effective (i.e., achieving high accuracy, true positive rates and false positive rates) and resilient, significantly outperforming existing approaches.</description>

      <title>VulMCI : Code Splicing-based Pixel-row Oversampling for More Continuous Vulnerability Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning technology has brought new prospects to the field of vulnerability detection. Many vulnerability detection methods involve converting source code into images for detection, yet they often overlook the quality of the generated images. Due to the fact that vulnerability images lack clear and continuous contours, unlike images used in object detection, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) tend to lose semantic information during the convolution and pooling processes. Therefore, this paper proposes a pixel row oversampling method based on code line concatenation to generate more continuous code features, addressing the issue of discontinuity in code image coloration.Building upon these contributions, we propose the vulnerability detection system VulMCI and conduct tests on the SARD and NVD datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that VulMCI outperforms seven state-of-the-art vulnerability detectors (namely Checkmarx, FlawFinder, RATS, VulDeePecker, SySeVR, VulCNN, and Devign). Compared to other image-based methods, VulMCI shows improvements in various metrics, including a 2.877\% increase in True Positive Rate (TPR), a 5.446\% increase in True Negative Rate (TNR), and a 5.91\% increase in Accuracy (ACC). On the NVD real-world dataset, VulMCI achieves an average accuracy of 5.162\%, confirming its value in practical vulnerability detection applications.</description>

      <title>Budget Recycling Differential Privacy</title>

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms usually {force} reduction in data utility by producing "out-of-bound" noisy results for a tight privacy budget. We introduce the Budget Recycling Differential Privacy (BR-DP) framework, designed to provide soft-bounded noisy outputs for a broad range of existing DP mechanisms. By "soft-bounded," we refer to the mechanism's ability to release most outputs within a predefined error boundary, thereby improving utility and maintaining privacy simultaneously. The core of BR-DP consists of two components: a DP kernel responsible for generating a noisy answer per iteration, and a recycler that probabilistically recycles/regenerates or releases the noisy answer. We delve into the privacy accounting of BR-DP, culminating in the development of a budgeting principle that optimally sub-allocates the available budget between the DP kernel and the recycler. Furthermore, we introduce algorithms for tight BR-DP accounting in composition scenarios, and our findings indicate that BR-DP achieves reduced privacy leakage post-composition compared to DP. Additionally, we explore the concept of privacy amplification via subsampling within the BR-DP framework and propose optimal sampling rates for BR-DP across various queries. We experiment with real data, and the results demonstrate BR-DP's effectiveness in lifting the utility-privacy tradeoff provided by DP mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Topic-based Watermarks for LLM-Generated Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) have resulted in indistinguishable text outputs comparable to human-generated text. Watermarking algorithms are potential tools that offer a way to differentiate between LLM- and human-generated text by embedding detectable signatures within LLM-generated output. However, current watermarking schemes lack robustness against known attacks against watermarking algorithms. In addition, they are impractical considering an LLM generates tens of thousands of text outputs per day and the watermarking algorithm needs to memorize each output it generates for the detection to work. In this work, focusing on the limitations of current watermarking schemes, we propose the concept of a "topic-based watermarking algorithm" for LLMs. The proposed algorithm determines how to generate tokens for the watermarked LLM output based on extracted topics of an input prompt or the output of a non-watermarked LLM. Inspired from previous work, we propose using a pair of lists (that are generated based on the specified extracted topic(s)) that specify certain tokens to be included or excluded while generating the watermarked output of the LLM. Using the proposed watermarking algorithm, we show the practicality of a watermark detection algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss a wide range of attacks that can emerge against watermarking algorithms for LLMs and the benefit of the proposed watermarking scheme for the feasibility of modeling a potential attacker considering its benefit vs. loss.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Constrained Policies via Mutual Information Regularized Policy Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.15019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As reinforcement learning techniques are increasingly applied to real-world decision problems, attention has turned to how these algorithms use potentially sensitive information. We consider the task of training a policy that maximizes reward while minimizing disclosure of certain sensitive state variables through the actions. We give examples of how this setting covers real-world problems in privacy for sequential decision-making. We solve this problem in the policy gradients framework by introducing a regularizer based on the mutual information (MI) between the sensitive state and the actions. We develop a model-based stochastic gradient estimator for optimization of privacy-constrained policies. We also discuss an alternative MI regularizer that serves as an upper bound to our main MI regularizer and can be optimized in a model-free setting, and a powerful direct estimator that can be used in an environment with differentiable dynamics. We contrast previous work in differentially-private RL to our mutual-information formulation of information disclosure. Experimental results show that our training method results in policies that hide the sensitive state, even in challenging high-dimensional tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a game-theoretic model that assesses the cyber-security risk of cloud networks and informs security experts on the optimal security strategies. Our approach combines game theory, combinatorial optimization, and cyber-security and aims to minimize the unexpected network disruptions caused by malicious cyber-attacks under uncertainty. Methodologically, we introduce the critical node game, a simultaneous and non-cooperative attacker-defender game where each player solves a combinatorial optimization problem parametrized in the variables of the other player. Each player simultaneously commits to a defensive (or attacking) strategy with limited knowledge about the choices of their adversary. We provide a realistic model for the critical node game and propose an algorithm to compute its stable solutions, i.e., its Nash equilibria. Practically, our approach enables security experts to assess the security posture of the cloud network and dynamically adapt the level of cyber-protection deployed on the network. We provide a detailed analysis of a real-world cloud network and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive computational tests.</description>

      <title>Incentivising the federation: gradient-based metrics for data selection and valuation in private decentralised training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining high-quality data for collaborative training of machine learning models can be a challenging task due to A) regulatory concerns and B) a lack of data owner incentives to participate. The first issue can be addressed through the combination of distributed machine learning techniques (e.g. federated learning) and privacy enhancing technologies (PET), such as the differentially private (DP) model training. The second challenge can be addressed by rewarding the participants for giving access to data which is beneficial to the training model, which is of particular importance in federated settings, where the data is unevenly distributed. However, DP noise can adversely affect the underrepresented and the atypical (yet often informative) data samples, making it difficult to assess their usefulness. In this work, we investigate how to leverage gradient information to permit the participants of private training settings to select the data most beneficial for the jointly trained model. We assess two such methods, namely variance of gradients (VoG) and the privacy loss-input susceptibility score (PLIS). We show that these techniques can provide the federated clients with tools for principled data selection even in stricter privacy settings.</description>

      <title>MetaCloak: Preventing Unauthorized Subject-driven Text-to-image Diffusion-based Synthesis via Meta-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models allow seamless generation of personalized images from scant reference photos. Yet, these tools, in the wrong hands, can fabricate misleading or harmful content, endangering individuals. To address this problem, existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an imperceptible way to render them "unlearnable" from malicious uses. We identify two limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the hand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and ii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian filtering. To solve these challenges, we propose MetaCloak, which solves the bi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation. Specifically, we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft transferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore, by incorporating an additional transformation process, we design a simple denoising-error maximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic distortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments on the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing approaches. Notably, MetaCloak can successfully fool online training services like Replicate, in a black-box manner, demonstrating the effectiveness of MetaCloak in real-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/liuyixin-louis/MetaCloak.</description>

      <title>Towards Unclonable Cryptography in the Plain Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By leveraging the no-cloning principle of quantum mechanics, unclonable cryptography enables us to achieve novel cryptographic protocols that are otherwise impossible classically. Two most notable examples of unclonable cryptography are quantum copy-protection and unclonable encryption. Most known constructions rely on the quantum random oracle model (as opposed to the plain model). Despite receiving a lot of attention in recent years, two important open questions still remain: copy-protection for point functions in the plain model, which is usually considered as feasibility demonstration, and unclonable encryption with unclonable indistinguishability security in the plain model. A core ingredient of these protocols is the so-called monogamy-of-entanglement (MoE) property. Such games allow quantifying the correlations between the outcomes of multiple non-communicating parties sharing entanglement in a particular context. Specifically, we define the games between a challenger and three players in which the first player is asked to split and share a quantum state between the two others, who are then simultaneously asked a question and need to output the correct answer.
  In this work, by relying on previous works of Coladangelo, Liu, Liu, and Zhandry (Crypto'21) and Culf and Vidick (Quantum'22), we establish a new MoE property for subspace coset states, which allows us to progress towards the aforementioned goals. However, it is not sufficient on its own, and we present two conjectures that would allow first to show that copy-protection of point functions exists in the plain model, with different challenge distributions (including arguably the most natural ones), and then that unclonable encryption with unclonable indistinguishability security exists in the plain model. We believe that our new MoE to be of independent interest, and it could be useful in other applications as well.</description>

      <title>SECOMP: Formally Secure Compilation of Compartmentalized C Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Undefined behavior in C often causes devastating security vulnerabilities. One practical mitigation is compartmentalization, which allows developers to structure large programs into mutually distrustful compartments with clearly specified privileges and interactions. In this paper we introduce SECOMP, a compiler for compartmentalized C code that comes with machine-checked proofs guaranteeing that the scope of undefined behavior is restricted to the compartments that encounter it and become dynamically compromised. These guarantees are formalized as the preservation of safety properties against adversarial contexts, a secure compilation criterion similar to full abstraction, and this is the first time such a strong criterion is proven for a mainstream programming language. To achieve this we extend the languages of the CompCert verified C compiler with isolated compartments that can only interact via procedure calls and returns, as specified by cross-compartment interfaces. We adapt the passes and optimizations of CompCert as well as their correctness proofs to this compartment-aware setting. We then use compiler correctness as an ingredient in a larger secure compilation proof that involves several proof engineering novelties, needed to scale formally secure compilation up to a C compiler.</description>

      <title>Off-Path TCP Hijacking in Wi-Fi Networks: A Packet-Size Side Channel Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we unveil a fundamental side channel in Wi-Fi networks, specifically the observable frame size, which can be exploited by attackers to conduct TCP hijacking attacks. Despite the various security mechanisms (e.g., WEP and WPA2/WPA3) implemented to safeguard Wi-Fi networks, our study reveals that an off path attacker can still extract sufficient information from the frame size side channel to hijack the victim's TCP connection. Our side channel attack is based on two significant findings: (i) response packets (e.g., ACK and RST) generated by TCP receivers vary in size, and (ii) the encrypted frames containing these response packets have consistent and distinguishable sizes. By observing the size of the victim's encrypted frames, the attacker can detect and hijack the victim's TCP connections. We validate the effectiveness of this side channel attack through two case studies, i.e., SSH DoS and web traffic manipulation. Precisely, our attack can terminate the victim's SSH session in 19 seconds and inject malicious data into the victim's web traffic within 28 seconds. Furthermore, we conduct extensive measurements to evaluate the impact of our attack on real-world Wi-Fi networks. We test 30 popular wireless routers from 9 well-known vendors, and none of these routers can protect victims from our attack. Besides, we implement our attack in 80 real-world Wi-Fi networks and successfully hijack the victim's TCP connections in 75 (93.75%) evaluated Wi-Fi networks. We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to the Wi-Fi Alliance and proposed several mitigation strategies to address this issue.</description>

      <title>Federated Multi-Task Learning on Non-IID Data Silos: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The innovative Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) approach consolidates the benefits of Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL), enabling collaborative model training on multi-task learning datasets. However, a comprehensive evaluation method, integrating the unique features of both FL and MTL, is currently absent in the field. This paper fills this void by introducing a novel framework, FMTL-Bench, for systematic evaluation of the FMTL paradigm. This benchmark covers various aspects at the data, model, and optimization algorithm levels, and comprises seven sets of comparative experiments, encapsulating a wide array of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data partitioning scenarios. We propose a systematic process for comparing baselines of diverse indicators and conduct a case study on communication expenditure, time, and energy consumption. Through our exhaustive experiments, we aim to provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of existing baseline methods, contributing to the ongoing discourse on optimal FMTL application in practical scenarios.

      <title>Can ChatGPT Detect DeepFakes? A Study of Using Multimodal Large Language Models for Media Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DeepFakes, which refer to AI-generated media content, have become an increasing concern due to their use as a means for disinformation. Detecting DeepFakes is currently solved with programmed machine learning algorithms. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) in DeepFake detection. We conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate multimodal LLMs and show that they can expose AI-generated images through careful experimental design and prompt engineering. This is interesting, considering that LLMs are not inherently tailored for media forensic tasks, and the process does not require programming. We discuss the limitations of multimodal LLMs for these tasks and suggest possible improvements.</description>

      <title>DP-RDM: Adapting Diffusion Models to Private Domains Without Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have been shown to suffer from sample-level memorization, possibly reproducing near-perfect replica of images that they are trained on, which may be undesirable. To remedy this issue, we develop the first differentially private (DP) retrieval-augmented generation algorithm that is capable of generating high-quality image samples while providing provable privacy guarantees. Specifically, we assume access to a text-to-image diffusion model trained on a small amount of public data, and design a DP retrieval mechanism to augment the text prompt with samples retrieved from a private retrieval dataset. Our \emph{differentially private retrieval-augmented diffusion model} (DP-RDM) requires no fine-tuning on the retrieval dataset to adapt to another domain, and can use state-of-the-art generative models to generate high-quality image samples while satisfying rigorous DP guarantees. For instance, when evaluated on MS-COCO, our DP-RDM can generate samples with a privacy budget of $\epsilon=10$, while providing a $3.5$ point improvement in FID compared to public-only retrieval for up to $10,000$ queries.</description>

      <title>How Far Have We Gone in Stripped Binary Code Understanding Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary code analysis plays a pivotal role in various software security applications, such as software maintenance, malware detection, software vulnerability discovery, patch analysis, etc. However, unlike source code, understanding binary code is challenging for reverse engineers due to the absence of semantic information. Therefore, automated tools are needed to assist human players in interpreting binary code. In recent years, two groups of technologies have shown promising prospects: (1) Deep learning-based technologies have demonstrated competitive results in tasks related to binary code understanding, furthermore, (2) Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively pre-trained at the source-code level for tasks such as code understanding and generation. This makes participants wonder about the ability of LLMs in binary code understanding.
  In this work, we propose a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in real-world reverse engineering scenarios. The benchmark covers two key binary code understanding tasks, including function name recovery and binary code summarization. We gain valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations through extensive evaluations of popular LLMs using our benchmark. Our evaluations reveal that existing LLMs can understand binary code to a certain extent, thereby improving the efficiency of binary code analysis. Our results highlight the great potential of the LLMs in advancing the field of binary code understanding.</description>
