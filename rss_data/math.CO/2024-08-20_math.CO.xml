      <title>Generating Functions of Generalized Simplicial Polytopic Numbers and $(s,t)$-Derivatives of Partial Theta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08943v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the generalized simplicial polytopic numbers P$_{n}^{d}(s,t)$, defined on generalized Fibonacci polynomials with parameters $s,t$, are introduced. Moreover, we obtain beautiful generating functions of the numbers P$_{n}^{d}(s,t)$, which are related to the $(s,t)$-derivatives of the Partial Theta function $\Theta_{0}(x,q)$.</description>

      <title>Reduced words for reflections in Weyl groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reflections in a Coxeter group are defined as conjugates of a single generator, and thus admit palindromic expressions as products of generators. Our main result gives closed formulas providing a palindromic reduced expression for each reflection in any finite Weyl group. There exist algorithmic methods for determining such reduced expressions, but explicit formulas have not been recorded outside of well-known special cases.</description>

      <title>On the Edge-Connectivity of the Square of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph. The edge-connectivity of $G$, denoted by $\lambda(G)$, is the minimum number of edges whose removal renders $G$ disconnected. Let $\delta(G)$ be the minimum degree of $G$. It is well-known that $\lambda(G) \leq \delta(G)$, and graphs for which equality holds are said to be maximally edge-connected. The square $G^2$ of $G$ is the graph with the same vertex set as $G$, in which two vertices are adjacent if their distance is not more that $2$.
  In this paper we present results on the edge-connectivity of the square of a graph. We show that if the minimum degree of a connected graph $G$ of order $n$ is at least $\lfloor \frac{n+2}{4}\rfloor$, then $G^2$ is maximally edge-connected, and this result is best possible. We also give lower bounds on $\lambda(G^2)$ for the case that $G^2$ is not maximally edge-connected: We prove that $\lambda(G^2) \geq \kappa(G)^2 + \kappa(G)$, where $\kappa(G)$ denotes the connectivity of $G$, i.e., the minimum number of vertices whose removal renders $G$ disconnected, and this bound is sharp. We further prove that $\lambda(G^2) \geq \frac{1}{2}\lambda(G)^{3/2} - \frac{1}{2} \lambda(G)$, and we construct an infinite family of graphs to show that the exponent $3/2$ of $\lambda(G)$ in this bound is best possible.</description>

      <title>An Improved Tur\'an Exponent for 2-Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}_{\hom}(n,X)$ of a 2-dimensional simplicial complex $X$ asks for the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex 3-uniform hypergraph containing no triangulation of $X$ as a subgraph. We prove that the Tur\'an exponent of any such space $X$ is at most $8/3$, i.e., that $\mathrm{ex}_{\hom}(n,X)\leq Cn^{8/3}$ for some constant $C=C(X)$. This improves on the previous exponent of $3-1/5$, due to Keevash, Long, Narayanan, and Scott. Additionally, we present new streamlined proofs of the asymptotically tight upper bounds for the topological Tur\'an numbers of the torus and real projective plane, which can be used to derive asymptotically tight upper bounds for all surfaces.</description>

      <title>Proper edge colorings of planar graphs with rainbow $C_4$-s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a proper edge coloring of a graph $G$ a B-coloring if every 4-cycle of $G$ is colored with four different colors. Let $q_B(G)$ denote the smallest number of colors needed for a B-coloring of $G$. Motivated by earlier papers on B-colorings, here we consider $q_B(G)$ for planar and outerplanar graphs in terms of the maximum degree $\Delta = \Delta(G)$. We prove that $q_B(G)\le 2\Delta+8$ for planar graphs, $q_B(G)\le 2\Delta$ for bipartite planar graphs and $q_B(G)\le \Delta+1$ for outerplanar graphs with $\Delta \ge 4$. We conjecture that, for $\Delta$ sufficiently large, $q_B(G)\le 2\Delta(G)$ for planar $G$ and $q_B(G)\le \Delta(G)$ for outerplanar $G$.</description>

      <title>B-colorings of planar and outerplanar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coloring of the edges of a graph $G$ in which every $K_{1,2}$ is totally multicolored is known as a proper coloring and a coloring of the edges of $G$ in which every $K_{1,2}$ and every $K_{2,2}$ is totally multicolored is called a B-coloring.
  In this paper, we establish that a planar graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ can be B-colored with $\max\{2\Delta,32\}$ colors. This is best-possible for large $\Delta$ because $K_{2,\Delta}$ requires $2\Delta$ colors. In addition, there is an example with $\Delta=4$ that requires $12$ colors.
  We also establish that an outerplanar graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ can be B-colored with $\max\{\Delta,6\}$ colors. This is almost best-possible because $\Delta$ colors are necessary and there is an example with $\Delta=4$ that requires $5$ colors.</description>

      <title>Ultra log-concavity and real-rootedness of dependence polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For some positive integer $m$, a real polynomial $P(x)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^ma_kx^k$ with $a_k\geqslant 0$ is called log-concave (resp. ultra log-concave) if $a_k^2\geqslant a_{k-1}a_{k+1}$ (resp. $a_k^2\geqslant \left(1+\frac{1}{k}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{m-k}\right)\cdot$ $a_{k-1}a_{k+1}$) for all $1\leqslant k\leqslant m-1$. If $P(x)$ has only real roots, then it is called real-rooted. It is well-known that the conditions of log-concavity, ultra log-concavity and real-rootedness are ever-stronger.
  For a graph $G$, a dependent set is a set of vertices which is not independent, i.e., the set of vertices whose induced subgraph contains at least one edge. The dependence polynomial of $G$ is defined as $D(G, x):=\sum\limits_{k\geqslant 0}d_k(G)x^k$, where $d_k(G)$ is the number of dependent sets of size $k$ in $G$. Horrocks proved that $D(G, x)$ is log-concave for every graph $G$ [J. Combin. Theory, Ser. B, 84 (2002) 180--185]. In the present paper, we prove that, for a graph $G$, $D(G, x)$ is ultra log-concave if $G$ is $(K_2\cup 2K_1)$-free or contains an independent set of size $|V(G)|-2$, and give the characterization of graphs whose dependence polynomials are real-rooted. Finally, we focus more attention to the problems of log-concavity about independence systems and pose several conjectures closely related the famous Mason's Conjecture.</description>

      <title>The heights of symmetric peaks and the depth of symmetric valleys over compositions of an integer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A composition $\pi=\pi_1\pi_2\cdots\pi_k$ of a positive integer $n$ is an ordered collection of one or more positive integers whose sum is $n$ . The number of summands, namely $k$, is called the number of parts of $\pi$. In this paper, we introduce two statistics over compositions of an integer $n$ with exactly $k$ parts: heights of symmetric peaks and depths of symmetric valleys over all compositions of $n$. We derive an explicit formula for the generating functions of compositions of $n$ with exactly $k$ parts according to the number of symmetric peaks (valleys) and the total heights (depths) of peaks (valleys).</description>

      <title>Diameter bound for facet-ridge incidence graphs of geometric lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves that the facet-ridge incidence graph of the order complex of any finite geometric lattice of rank $r$ has diameter at most ${r \choose 2}$. A key ingredient is the well-known fact that every ordering of the atoms of any finite geometric lattice gives rise to a lexicographic shelling of its order complex. The paper also gives results that provide some evidence that this bound ought to be sharp as well as examples indicating that the question of sharpness is quite subtle.</description>

      <title>When Gr\"unbaum meets Poncelet -- Infinite Classes of Movable $n_4$ Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study relations between $(n_4)$ incidence configurations and the classical Poncelet Porism. Poncelet's result studies two conics and a sequence of points and lines that inscribes one conic and circumscribes the other. Poncelet's Porism states that whether this sequence closes up after $m$ steps only depends on the conics and not on the initial point of the sequence. In other words: Poncelet polygons are movable. We transfer this motion into a flexibility statement about a large class of $(n_4)$ configurations, which are configurations where 4 (straight) lines pass through each point and four points lie on each line. A first instance of such configurations in real geometry had been given by Gr\"unbaum and Rigby in their classical 1990 paper where they constructed the first known real geometric realisation of a well known combinatorial $(21_4)$ configuration (which had been studied by Felix Klein), now called the Gr\"unbaum-Rigby configuration. Since then, there has been an intensive search for movable $(n_4)$ configurations, but it is very surprising that the Gr\"unbaum-Rigby $(21_4)$ configuration admits nontrivial motions. It is well-known that the Gr\"unbaum-Rigby configuration is the smallest example of an infinite class of $(n_4)$ configurations, the trivial celestial configurations. A major result of this paper is that we show that all trivial celestial configurations are movable via Poncelet's Porism and results about properties of Poncelet grids. Alternative approaches via geometry of billiards, in-circle nets, and pentagram maps that relate the subject to discrete integrable systems are given as well.</description>

      <title>Explicit Constructions for Poncelet Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometric structure of Poncelet $n$-gons from a projective point of view. In particular we present explicit constructions of Poncelet $n$-gons for certain $n$ and derive algebraic characterisations in terms of bracket polynomials. Via the connections of Poncelet polygons and $(N_4)$-configurations, the results of this article can be used to construct a large class of specific movable $(N_4)$-configurations, the trivial celestial 4-configurations, which up to this point were all thought to be rigid and to require regular polygons for their construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on the divisor theory of graphs, using additive combinatorics. As a test case for this perspective, we compute the gonality of certain families of outerplanar graphs, specifically the strip graphs. The Jacobians of such graphs are always cyclic of Fibonacci order. As a consequence, we obtain several results on the additive properties of Fibonacci numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers $n$-ribbon tilings of general regions and their per-tile entropy (the binary logarithm of the number of tilings divided by the number of tiles). We show that the per-tile entropy is bounded above by $\log_2 n$. This bound improves the best previously known bounds of $n-1$ for general regions, and the asymptotic upper bound of $\log_2 (en)$ for growing rectangles, due to Chen and Kargin.</description>

      <title>On sets with missing differences in compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A much-studied problem posed by Motzkin asks to determine, given a finite set $D$ of integers, the so-called Motzkin density of $D$, i.e., the supremum of upper densities of sets of integers whose difference set avoids $D$. We study the natural analogue of this problem in compact abelian groups. Using ergodic-theoretic tools, this is shown to be equivalent to the following discrete problem: given a lattice $\Lambda\subset \mathbb{Z}^r$, letting $D$ be the image in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$ of the standard basis, determine the Motzkin density of $D$ in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$. We study in particular the periodicity question: is there a periodic $D$-avoiding set of maximal density? The Greenfeld--Tao counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture implies that the answer can be negative. On the other hand, we prove that the answer is positive in several cases, including the case rank$(\Lambda)=1$ (in which we give a formula for the Motzkin density), the case rank$(\Lambda)=r-1$, and hence also the case $r\leq 3$.</description>

      <title>Some results related to the slide decomposition of Schubert polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of a Schubert polynomial into slide polynomials corresponds to a sum over sub-balls in the subword complex. There has been recent interest in other, coarser, expansions of Schubert polynomials. We extend the methods used in [KM04] to prove that the subword complex is a ball or a sphere to a more general method, and use it to prove that the expansion of a Schubert polynomial into forest polynomials also corresponds to a sum over sub-balls in the subword complex.
  When expanding the product $\mathfrak{S}_\pi\mathfrak{S}_\rho$ of two Schubert polynomials into Schubert polynomials $\mathfrak{S}_\sigma$, there is a bijection between shuffles of reduced words for $\pi$ and $\rho$ and reduced words for $\sigma$ (counted with multiplicity). We give such a bijection for Monk's rule and Sottile's Pieri rule.
  We give tableau-based definitions of slide polynomials, glide polynomials, and fundamental quasisymmetric polynomials and show that the expansion of a Schur polynomial into fundamental quasisymmetric polynomials corresponds to a sum over sub-balls in the tableau complex.
  The Schubert polynomials are the cohomology classes of matrix Schubert varieties, but there is no geometric explanation of the slide polynomials. We show that the slide polynomials are not (antidiagonal) Gr\"obner degenerations of matrix Schubert varieties, answering in the negative a question of [ST21, Section 1.4].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 60s, Micha Perles constructed a point-line arrangement in the plane on nine points, which can not be realized only by points with rational coordinates. Gr\"unbaum conjectured that Perles' construction is the smallest: any geometric arrangement on eight or fewer points if it is realizable with real coordinates in the plane, it is also realizable with rational coordinates. In this note, we prove the conjecture.</description>

      <title>On conflict-free colorings of cyclic polytopes and the girth conjecture for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conflict-free colorings for hypergraphs derived from the family of facets of $d$-dimensional cyclic polytopes. For odd dimensions $d$, the problem is fairly easy. However, for even dimensions $d$ the problem becomes very difficult. We provide sharp asymptotic bounds for the conflict-free chromatic number in all even dimensions $4\leq d \leq 20$ except for $d=16$. We also provide non-trivial upper and lower bounds for all even dimensions $d$. We exhibit a strong relation to the famous Erd\H{o}s girth conjecture in extremal graph theory which might be of independent interest for the study of conflict-free colorings. Improving the upper or lower bounds for general even dimensions $d$ would imply an improved lower or upper bound (respectively) on the Erd\H{o}s girth conjecture. Finally, we extend our result for dimension $4$ showing that the hypergraph whose hyperedges are the union of two discrete intervals from $[n]$ of cardinality at least $3$ has conflict-free chromatic number $\Theta(\sqrt {n})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A notable problem within permutation patterns that has attracted considerable attention in literature since 1973 is the search for a bijective proof demonstrating that 123-avoiding and 132-avoiding permutations are equinumerous, both counted by the Catalan numbers. Despite this equivalence, the distributions of occurrences of the patterns 123 and 132 are distinct. When considering 123 and 132 as mesh patterns and selectively shading boxes, similar scenarios arise, even when avoidance is defined by the Bell numbers or other sequences, rather than the Catalan numbers.
  However, computer experiments suggest that mesh patterns 123 and 132 may indeed be equidistributed. Furthermore, by considering symmetric shadings relative to the anti-diagonal, a maximum of 93 such equidistributed pairs can potentially exist. This paper establishes 75 such equidistributions, leaving the justification of the remaining cases as open problems. As a by-product, we also prove 36 relevant non-symmetric equidistributions. All our proofs are bijective and involve swapping occurrences of the patterns in question, thereby demonstrating their joint equidistribution. Our findings are a continuation of the systematic study of distributions of short-length mesh patterns initiated by Kitaev and Zhang in 2019.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the number of cells and the dimension of the Dressian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\em Dressian} of a matroid $M$ is the set of all valuations of $M$. This Dressian is the support of a polyhedral complex $\mathcal{Dr}(M)$ whose open cells correspond 1-1 with matroid subdivisions of the matroid polytope of $M$. We present upper bounds on the number of cells and the dimension of $\mathcal{Dr}(M)$. For matroids $M$ of rank $r\geq 3$ on $n$ elements we show that $$ \ln\#\mathcal{Dr}(M)\leq {\binom{n}{r}} O\left(\frac{\ln(n)^2}{n}\right)\text{ as }n\rightarrow\infty,\qquad\text{and}\qquad\dim \mathcal{Dr}(M)\leq {\binom{n}{r}}\frac{3}{n-r+3},$$ as well as some more detailed bounds that incorporate structural properties of such $M$. For uniform matroids $M=U(r,n)$, these upper bounds are comparable to lower bounds derived from valuations that are constructed from sparse paving matroids.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic formulas for the coefficients of the truncated theta series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the groundbreaking work of Andrews and Merca, truncated theta series have been extensively studied over the years. In particular, Merca made conjectures on the non-negativity of the coefficient of $q^N$ in truncated series from the Jacobi triple product identity and the quintuple product identity. In this paper, using Wright's Circle Method, we establish asymptotic formulas for the coefficients of truncated theta series and prove that Merca's conjectures are true for sufficiently large $N$.</description>

      <title>Counting Perfect Matchings In Dirac Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the foundational theorems of extremal graph theory is Dirac's theorem, which says that if an n-vertex graph G has minimum degree at least n/2, then G has a Hamilton cycle, and therefore a perfect matching (if n is even). Later work by S\'arkozy, Selkow and Szemer\'edi showed that in fact Dirac graphs have many Hamilton cycles and perfect matchings, culminating in a result of Cuckler and Kahn that gives a precise description of the numbers of Hamilton cycles and perfect matchings in a Dirac graph G (in terms of an entropy-like parameter of G).
  In this paper we extend Cuckler and Kahn's result to perfect matchings in hypergraphs. For positive integers d &lt; k, and for n divisible by k, let $m_{d}(k,n)$ be the minimum d-degree that ensures the existence of a perfect matching in an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph. In general, it is an open question to determine (even asymptotically) the values of $m_{d}(k,n)$, but we are nonetheless able to prove an analogue of the Cuckler-Kahn theorem, showing that if an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph G has minimum d-degree at least $(1+\gamma)m_{d}(k,n)$ (for any constant $\gamma&gt;0$), then the number of perfect matchings in G is controlled by an entropy-like parameter of G. This strengthens cruder estimates arising from work of Kang-Kelly-K\"uhn-Osthus-Pfenninger and Pham-Sah-Sawhney-Simkin.</description>

Abstract: Let $(L,\vee)$ be a finite n-element semilattice where $n\geq 5$. We prove that the fourth largest number of subuniverses of an $n$-element semilattice is $25\cdot 2^{n-5}$, the fifth largest number is $ 24.5\cdot 2^{n-5}$, and the sixth one is $ 24\cdot 2^{n-5}$. Also, we describe the $n$-element semilattices with exactly $25\cdot 2^{n-5}$, $ 24.5\cdot 2^{n-5}$ or $ 24\cdot 2^{n-5}$ subuniverses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2007, Andrews studied the odd Durfee symbols and their odd ranks. Let $N^0(m,k,n)$ denote the number of odd Durfee symbols of $n$ with odd rank congruent to $m$ modulo $k$. Motivated by Andrews' work, many authors obtained generating functions of $N^0(m,k,n)$ from which relations between odd ranks are proved. In this paper, we establish a family of congruences for odd ranks modulo powers of $5$.</description>

      <title>Palettes determine uniform Tur\'an density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tur\'an problems, which concern the minimum density threshold required for the existence of a particular substructure, are among the most fundamental problems in extremal combinatorics. We study Tur\'an problems for hypergraphs with an additional uniformity condition on the edge distribution. This kind of Tur\'an problems was introduced by Erd\H{o}s and S\'os in the 1980s but it took more than 30 years until the first non-trivial exact results were obtained when Glebov, Kr\'al' and Volec [Israel J. Math. 211 (2016), 349--366] and Reiher, R\"odl and Schacht [J. Eur. Math. Soc. 20 (2018), 1139--1159] determined the uniform Tur\'an density of $K_4^{(3)-}$.
  Subsequent results exploited the powerful hypergraph regularity method, developed by Gowers and by Nagle, R\"odl and Schacht about two decades ago. Central to the study of the uniform Tur\'an density of hypergraphs are palette constructions, which were implicitly introduced by R\"odl in the 1980s. We prove that palette constructions always yield tight lower bounds, unconditionally confirming present empirical evidence. This results in new and simpler approaches to determining uniform Tur\'an densities, which completely bypass the use of the hypergraph regularity method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using generating functions, we are proposing a unified approach to produce explicit formulas, which count the number of nodes in Smolyak grids based on various univariate quadrature or interpolation rules. Our approach yields, for instance, a new formula for the cardinality of a Smolyak grid, which is based on Chebyshev nodes of the first kind and it allows to recover certain counting-formulas previously found by Bungartz-Griebel, Kaarnioja, M\"uller-Gronbach, Novak-Ritter and Ullrich.</description>

Abstract: The definition of Ricci curvature on graphs in Bakry-\'Emery's sense based on curvature dimension condition was introduced by Lin and Yau [\emph{Math. Res. Lett.}, 2010]. Hua and Lin [\emph{Comm. Anal. Geom.}, 2019] classified unweighted graphs satisfying the curvature dimension condition $CD(0,\infty)$ whose girth are at least five. In this paper, we classify all of connected unweighted normalized $C_4$-free graphs satisfying curvature dimension condition $CD(0,\infty)$ for minimum degree at least 2 and the case with non-normalized Laplacian without degree condition..</description>

      <title>A q-analogue of graph independence polynomials with a group-theoretic interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define totally-isotropic polynomials of alternating matrix spaces over finite fields, by analogy with independence polynomials of graphs. Our main result shows that totally-isotropic polynomials of graphical alternating matrix spaces give rise to a natural q-analogue of graph independence polynomials.
  For p-groups of class 2 and exponent p, this family of polynomials over fields of order p can be naturally interpreted as enumerating their abelian subgroups containing the commutator subgroup according to the orders. With this interpretation, our main result has implications to graphical groups over finite fields, in the same spirit as the results in (Bull. Lond. Math. Soc., 2022) by Rossmann, who studied enumerating conjugacy classes of graphical groups over finite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The undirected underlying graph of a 2-quasi best match graph (2-qBMG) is proven not to contain any induced graph isomorphic to $P_6$ or $C_6$. This new feature allows for the investigation of 2-BMGs further by exploiting the numerous known results on $P_6$ and $C_6$ free graphs together with the available polynomial algorithms developed for their studies. In this direction, there are also some new contributions about dominating bicliques and certain vertex decompositions of the undirected underlying graph of a 2-qBMG.</description>

      <title>Key motifs searching in complex dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Key network motifs searching in complex networks is one of the crucial aspects of network analysis. There has been a series of insightful findings and valuable applications for various scenarios through the analysis of network structures. However, in dynamic systems, slight changes in the choice of dynamic equations and parameters can alter the significance of motifs. The known methods are insufficient to address this issue effectively. In this paper, we introduce a concept of perturbation energy based on the system's Jacobian matrix, and define motif centrality for dynamic systems by seamlessly integrating network topology with dynamic equations. Through simulations, we observe that the key motifs obtained by the proposed energy method present better effective and accurate than them by integrating network topology methods, without significantly increasing algorithm complexity. The finding of key motifs can be used to apply for system control, such as formulating containment policies for the spread of epidemics and protecting fragile ecosystems. Additionally, it makes substantial contribution to a deeper understanding of concepts in physics, such as signal propagation and system's stability.</description>

Abstract: We show that every $d$-regular bipartite Borel graph admits a Baire measurable $k$-regular spanning subgraph if and only if $d$ is odd or $k$ is even. This gives the first example of a locally checkable coloring problem which is known to have a Baire measurable solution on Borel graphs but not a computable solution on highly computable graphs. We also prove the analogous result in the measure setting for hyperfinite graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a quantum spin system has an exact free-parafermion solution if its frustration graph is an oriented indifference graph. Further, we show that if the frustration graph of a model can be dipath oriented via switching operations, then the model is integrable in the sense that there is a family of commuting independent set charges. Additionally, we establish an efficient algorithm for deciding whether this is possible. Our characterisation extends that given for free-fermion solvability. Finally, we apply our results to solve three qudit spin models.</description>

Abstract: Recently, using modular forms F. Beukers posed a unified method that can deal with a large number of supercongruences involving binomial coefficients and Ap\'ery-like numbers. In this paper, we use Beukers' method to prove some conjectures of the first author concerning the congruences for $$\sum_{k=0}^{(p-1)/2}\frac{\binom{2k}k^3}{m^k}, \quad\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k^2\binom{4k}{2k}}{m^k}, \quad \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k\binom{3k}k\binom{6k}{3k}}{m^k}, \quad \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{V_k}{m^k} \quad\hbox{and}\quad \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{T_k}{m^k} $$ modulo $p^3$, where $p&gt;3$ is a prime, $m$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, $V_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{2k}k^2\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}^2$ and $T_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{2k}n^2$.</description>

      <title>A new lower bound for the density of planar Sets avoiding Unit Distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recently published article by G. Ambrus et al. a new upper bound for the density of an unit avoiding, periodic set is given as $0.2470$, the first upper bound $&lt; 1/4$. A construction of Croft 1967 gave a lower bound $\delta_C = 0.22936$ for the density. To this date, no better construction with a higher lower bound has been given. In this article I give a construction planar sets with a higher density than Croft's tortoises. No explicit value for this density is given, it's just shown that Croft's density is a local minima of the density of a here constructed 1-parameter family of planar sets. So the densities are $&gt; \delta_C$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate properties of digital H-spaces in the graph theoretic model of digital topology. As in prior work, the results obtained often depend fundamentally on the choice between NP$_1$ and NP$_2$ product adjacencies. We explore algebraic properties of digital H-spaces preserved under digital homotopy equivalence, and we give a general construction that produces examples of digital H-spaces which are not homotopy-equivalent to digital topological groups in both categories. Further, we show that this construction essentially classifies all NP$_2$-digital H-spaces. In a short appendix, we resolve a question that was left unresolved in [17], and complete the full classification of digital topological groups.</description>

      <title>Completing the proof of the Liebeck--Nikolov--Shalev conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liebeck, Nikolov, and Shalev conjectured the existence of an absolute constant $C&gt;0$, such that for every subset $A$ of a finite simple group $G$ with $|A|\ge 2$, there exists $C\log|G|/\log|A|$ conjugates of $A$ whose product is $G$. This paper is a companion to \cite{GLPS}, and together they prove the conjecture.
  To prove the conjecture, we establish the following skew-product theorem. We show that there exists $ c &gt; 0 $ such that for all $ \epsilon &gt; 0 $ and subsets $ A, B \subseteq G $ of finite simple groups of Lie type, if $ |B| &lt; |G|^{1 - \epsilon} $, then $ |A^{\sigma} B| &gt; |B||A|^{c \epsilon} $ for some $ \sigma \in G $. This result, along with its more involved analogue for alternating groups, constitutes the main contribution of this paper.
  Our proof leverages deep results from character theory alongside the probabilistic method.</description>

      <title>On Bott--Samelson rings for Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology ring of the Bott--Samelson variety. We compute an explicit presentation of this ring via Soergel's result, which implies that it is a combinatorial invariant. We use the presentation to introduce the Bott--Samelson ring associated with a word in arbitrary Coxeter system by generators and relations. In general, it is a split quadratic complete intersection algebra with a triangular pattern of relations. By a result of Tate, it follows that it is a Koszul algebra and we provide a quadratic (reduced) Gr{\"o}bner basis. Furthermore, we prove that it satisfies the whole K\"ahler package, including the Poincar\'e duality, the hard Lefschetz theorem, and the Hodge--Riemann bilinear relations.</description>

      <title>Sharp isoperimetric inequalities for infinite plane graphs with bounded vertex and face degrees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.04394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide sharp bounds for the isoperimetric constants of infinite plane graphs (tessellations) with bounded vertex and face degrees. For example, if $G$ is a plane graph satisfying the inequalities $p_1 \leq \mbox{deg}\ v \leq p_2$ for $v \in V(G)$ and $q_1 \leq \mbox{deg}\ f \leq q_2$ for $f \in F(G)$, where $p_1, p_2, q_1$, and $q_2$ are natural numbers such that $1/p_i + 1/q_i \leq 1/2$, $i=1,2$, then we show that \[ \Phi (p_1, q_1) \leq \inf_S \frac{|\partial S|}{|V(S)|} \leq \Phi (p_2, q_2), \] where the infimum is taken over all finite nonempty subgraphs $S \subset G$, $\partial S$ is the set of edges connecting $S$ to $G \setminus S$, and $\Phi(p,q)$ is defined by \[ \Phi (p, q) = (p-2) \sqrt{1 - \frac{4}{(p-2)(q-2)}}. \] For $p_1=3$ this gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture by Lawrencenko, Plummer, and Zha from 2002, and for general $p_i$ and $q_i$ our result fully resolves a question posed in the book by Lyons and Peres from 2016, where they extended the conjecture of Lawrencenko et al. to the above form.</description>

Abstract: This paper discusses the complete structure of the (bull, diamond)-free graphs. As an application of that, we give the characterization of the partitionable (bull, diamond)-free graphs. Moreover, we show that such a partition for a partitionable (bull, diamond)-free graph can be found in polynomial time. Additionally, we show that the cop number of a (bull, diamond)-free graph containing a triangle is at most two less than its diameter. Furthermore, the cop number of a connected ($P_n$, bull, diamond)-free graph with a triangle, is at most $n-3$, for any natural number $n&gt;3$. We also discuss a couple of applications of the structural theorem of the (bull, diamond)-free graphs in the conclusions.</description>

      <title>The nonrepetitive colorings of grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, a vertex coloring $f$ is called nonrepetitive if for all $k\in\mathbb N$ and all $P_{2k}=\langle v_1, \cdots, v_k,v_{k+1}, \cdots, v_{2k}\rangle$ (path of $2k$ vertices) in $G$, there must be some $1\le i\le k$ such that $f(v_i)\not=f(v_{k+i})$. We use $\pi(G)$ to denote the minimum number of colors required for $G$ to be nonrepetitively colored. In 1906, Thue proved that $\pi(P_n)\le3$ for all $n$. In this paper, we focus on grids, which are the Cartesian products of paths. We prove that $5\le\pi(P_n\square P_n)\le12$ for sufficiently large $n$, where the previous best lower bound was 4 and upper bound was 16. Moreover, we also discuss nonrepetitive coloring of the Cartesian product of complete graphs.</description>

      <title>Feynman symmetries of the Martin and $c_2$ invariants of regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every regular graph, we define a sequence of integers, using the recursion of the Martin polynomial. This sequence counts spanning tree partitions and constitutes the diagonal coefficients of powers of the Kirchhoff polynomial. We prove that this sequence respects all known symmetries of Feynman period integrals in quantum field theory. We show that other quantities with this property, the $c_2$ invariant and the extended graph permanent, are essentially determined by our new sequence. This proves the completion conjecture for the $c_2$ invariant at all primes, and also that it is fixed under twists. We conjecture that our invariant is perfect: Two Feynman periods are equal, if and only if, their Martin sequences are equal.</description>

      <title>Maker-Breaker domination game on Cartesian products of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Maker-Breaker domination game is played on a graph $G$ by two players, called Dominator and Staller. They alternately select an unplayed vertex in $G$. Dominator wins the game if he forms a dominating set while Staller wins the game if she claims all vertices from a closed neighborhood of a vertex.
  The game is called \emph{D-game} if Dominator starts the game and it is an \emph{S-game} when Staller starts the game. If Dominator is the winner in the D-game (or the S-game), then $\gmb(G)$ (or $\gmb'(G)$) is defined by the minimum number of moves of Dominator to win the game under any strategy of Staller.
  Analogously, when Staller is the winner, $\gsmb(G)$ and $\gsmb'(G)$ can be defined in the same way.
  We determine the winner of the game on the Cartesian product of paths, stars, and complete bipartite graphs, and how fast the winner wins. We prove that Dominator is the winner on $P_m \square P_n$ in both the D-game and the S-game, and $\gmb(P_m \square P_n)$ and $\gmb'(P_m \square P_n)$ are determined when $m=3$ and $3 \le n \le 5$. Dominator also wins on $G \square H$ in both games if $G$ and $H$ admit nontrivial path covers. Furthermore, we establish the winner in the D-game and the S-game on $K_{m,n} \square K_{m',n'}$ for every positive integers $m, m',n,n'$.
  We prove the exact formulas for $\gmb (G)$, $\gmb'(G)$, $\gsmb(G)$, and $\gsmb'(G)$ where $G$ is a product of stars.</description>

Abstract: In a linear chord diagram a short chord is one which joins adjacent vertices. We define a bubble to be a region in a linear chord diagram devoid of short chords. We derive a formal generating function counting bubbles by their size and find an exact result for the mean bubble size. We find that once one discards diagrams which have no short chords at all, the distribution of bubble sizes is given by a smooth function in the limit of long diagrams. Using a summation over short chords, the exact form of this asymptotic distribution is found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized $k$-connectivity of a graph $G$, denoted by $\kappa_k(G)$, is the minimum number of internally edge disjoint $S$-trees for any $S\subseteq V(G)$ and $|S|=k$. The generalized $k$-connectivity is a natural extension of the classical connectivity and plays a key role in applications related to the modern interconnection networks. The godan graph $EA_n$ is a kind of Cayley graphs which posses many desirable properties. In this paper, we shall study the generalized 4-connectivity of $EA_n$ and show that $\kappa_4(EA_n)=n-1$ for $n\ge 3$.</description>

Abstract: A conjecture of Graham (repeated by Erd\H{o}s) asserts that for any set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p \setminus \{0\}$, there is an ordering $a_1, \ldots, a_{|A|}$ of the elements of $A$ such that the partial sums $a_1, a_1+a_2, \ldots, a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_{|A|}$ are all distinct. We give a very short proof of this conjecture for sets $A$ of size at most $\log p/\log\log p$.</description>

      <title>Odd 4-coloring of outerplanar graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proper $k$-coloring of $G$ is called an odd coloring of $G$ if for every vertex $v$, there is a color that appears at an odd number of neighbors of $v$. This concept was introduced recently by Petru\v{s}evski and \v{S}krekovski, and they conjectured that every planar graph is odd 5-colorable. Towards this conjecture, Caro, Petru\v{s}evski, and \v{S}krekovski showed that every outerplanar graph is odd 5-colorable, and this bound is tight since the cycle of length 5 is not odd 4-colorable. Recently, the first author and others showed that every maximal outerplanar graph is odd 4-colorable. In this paper, we show that a connected outerplanar graph $G$ is odd 4-colorable if and only if $G$ contains a block which is not a copy of the cycle of length 5. This strengthens the result by Caro, Petru\v{s}evski, and \v{S}krekovski, and gives a complete characterization of odd 4-colorable outerplanar graphs.</description>

      <title>Various Properties of Various Ultrafilters, Various Graph Width Parameters, and Various Connectivity Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filters are collections of sets that are closed under supersets and finite intersections, serving as fundamental tools in topology and set theory. An ultrafilter, a maximal filter on a set, plays a crucial role in these fields by rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X,f) , where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters elucidates the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth, enhancing our understanding of these mathematical structures.</description>

      <title>New refinements of Narayana polynomials and Motzkin polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chen, Deutsch and Elizalde introduced a refinement of the Narayana polynomials by distinguishing between old (leftmost child) and young leaves of plane trees. They also provided a refinement of Coker's formula by constructing a bijection. In fact, Coker's formula establishes a connection between the Narayana polynomials and the Motzkin polynomials, which implies the $\gamma$-positivity of the Narayana polynomials. In this paper, we introduce the polynomial $G_{n}(x_{11},x_{12},x_2;y_{11},y_{12},y_2)$, which further refine the Narayana polynomials by considering leaves of plane trees that have no siblings. We obtain the generating function for $G_n(x_{11},x_{12},x_2;y_{11},y_{12},y_2)$. To achieve further refinement of Coker's formula based on the polynomial $G_n(x_{11},x_{12},x_2;y_{11},y_{12},y_2)$, we consider a refinement $M_n(u_1,u_2,u_3;v_1,v_2)$ of the Motzkin polynomials by classifying the old leaves of a tip-augmented plane tree into three categories and the young leaves into two categories. The generating function for $M_n(u_1,u_2,u_3;v_1,v_2)$ is also established, and the refinement of Coker's formula is immediately derived by combining the generating function for $G_n(x_{11},x_{12},x_2;y_{11},y_{12},y_2)$ and the generating function for $M_n(u_1,u_2,u_3;v_1,v_2)$. We derive several interesting consequences from this refinement of Coker's formula. The method used in this paper is the grammatical approach introduced by Chen. We develop a unified grammatical approach to exploring polynomials associated with the statistics defined on plane trees. As you will see, the derivations of the generating functions for $G_n(x_{11},x_{12},x_2;{y}_{11},{{y}}_{12},y_2)$ and $M_n(u_1,u_2,u_3;v_1,v_2)$ become quite simple once their grammars are established.</description>

      <title>Perfect taxon sampling and fixing taxon traceability: Introducing a class of phylogenetically decisive taxon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3472</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.3472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetically decisive sets of taxon sets have the property that if trees are chosen for each of their elements, as long as these trees are compatible, the resulting supertree is unique. This means that as long as the trees describing the phylogenetic relationships of the (input) species sets are compatible, they can only be combined into a common supertree in precisely one way. This setting is sometimes also referred to as \enquote{perfect taxon sampling}. While for rooted trees, the decision if a given set of input taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive can be made in polynomial time, the decision problem to determine whether a set of taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive concerning \emph{unrooted} trees is unfortunately coNP-complete and therefore in practice hard to solve for large instances. This shows that recognizing such sets is often difficult. In this paper, we explain phylogenetic decisiveness and introduce a class of input taxon sets, namely so-called \emph{fixing taxon traceable} sets, which are guaranteed to be phylogenetically decisive and which can be recognized in polynomial time. Using both combinatorial approaches as well as simulations, we compare properties of fixing taxon traceability and phylogenetic decisiveness, e.g., by deriving lower and upper bounds for the number of quadruple sets (i.e., sets of 4-tuples) needed in the input set for each of these properties. In particular, we correct an erroneous lower bound concerning phylogenetic decisiveness from the literature.
  We have implemented the algorithm to determine if a given set of taxon sets is fixing taxon traceable in \textsf{R} and made our software package \verb+FixingTaxonTraceR+ publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1711.02089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f(a,b,c,d)=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}+\sqrt{c^2+d^2}-\sqrt{(a+c)^2+(b+d)^2}$, let $(a,b,c,d)$ stand for $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$ such that $ad-bc=1$. Define \begin{equation} \label{eq_main} F(s) = \sum_{(a,b,c,d)} f(a,b,c,d)^s. \end{equation} In other words, we consider the sum of the powers of the triangle inequality defects for the lattice parallelograms (in the first quadrant) of area one.
  We prove that $F(s)$ converges when $s&gt;1$ and diverges at $s=1/2$. (This papers differs from its published version: Fedor Petrov showed us how to easily prove that $F(s)$ converges for $s&gt;2/3$ and diverges for $s\leq 2/3$, see below.) We also prove $$\sum\limits_{\substack{(a,b,c,d), 1\leq a\leq b, 1\leq c\leq d}} \frac{1}{(a+b)^2(c+d)^2(a+b+c+d)^2} = 1/24,$$ and show a general method to obtain such formulae. The method comes from the consideration of the tropical analogue of the caustic curves, whose moduli give a complete set of continuous invariants on the space of convex domains.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian fillings for Legendrian links of finite or affine Dynkin type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that there are at least as many exact embedded Lagrangian fillings as seeds for Legendrian links of finite type $\mathsf{ADE}$ or affine type $\tilde{\mathsf{D}} \tilde{\mathsf{E}}$. We also provide as many Lagrangian fillings with rotational symmetry as seeds of type $\mathsf{B}$, $\mathsf{G}_2$, $\tilde{\mathsf{G}}_2$, $\tilde{\mathsf{B}}$, or $\tilde{\mathsf{C}}_2$, and with conjugation symmetry as seeds of type $\mathsf{F}_4$, $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{E}_6^{(2)}$, $\tilde{\mathsf{F}}_4$, or $\mathsf{A}_5^{(2)}$. These families are the first known Legendrian links with (infinitely many) exact Lagrangian fillings (with symmetry) that exhaust all seeds in the corresponding cluster structures beyond type $\mathsf{A} \mathsf{D}$. Furthermore, we show that the $N$-graph realization of (twice of) Coxeter mutation of type $\tilde{\mathsf{D}} \tilde{\mathsf{E}}$ corresponds to a Legendrian loop of the corresponding Legendrian links. Especially, the loop of type $\tilde{\mathsf{D}}$ coincides with the one considered by Casals and Ng.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for the ferromagnetic Potts model on expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give algorithms for approximating the partition function of the ferromagnetic $q$-color Potts model on graphs of maximum degree $d$. Our primary contribution is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for $d$-regular graphs with an expansion condition at low temperatures (that is, bounded away from the order-disorder threshold). The expansion condition is much weaker than in previous works; for example, the expansion exhibited by the hypercube suffices. The main improvements come from a significantly sharper analysis of standard polymer models; we use extremal graph theory and applications of Karger's algorithm to count cuts that may be of independent interest. It is \#BIS-hard to approximate the partition function at low temperatures on bounded-degree graphs, so our algorithm can be seen as evidence that hard instances of \#BIS are rare. We also obtain efficient algorithms in the Gibbs uniqueness region for bounded-degree graphs. While our high temperature proof follows more standard polymer model analysis, our result holds in the largest known range of parameters $d$ and $q$.</description>

      <title>Characters of $GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ and vertex operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15330v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a vertex operator approach to construct and compute all complex irreducible characters of the general linear group $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$. Green's theory of $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ is recovered and enhanced under the realization of the Grothendieck ring of representations $R_G=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0}R(\GL_n(\mathbb F_q))$ as two isomorphic Fock spaces associated to two infinite-dimensional $F$-equivariant Heisenberg Lie algebras $\widehat{\mathfrak{h}}_{\hat{\overline{\mathbb F}}_q}$ and $\widehat{\mathfrak{h}}_{\overline{\mathbb F}_q}$, where $F$ is the Frobenius automorphism of the algebraically closed field $\overline{\mathbb F}_q$. Under this picture, the irreducible characters are realized by the Bernstein vertex operators for Schur functions, the characteristic functions of the conjugacy classes are realized by the vertex operators for the Hall-Littlewood functions, and the character table is completely given by matrix coefficients of vertex operators of these two types. One of the features of the current approach is a simpler identification of the Fock space $R_G$ as the Hall algebra of symmetric functions via vertex operator calculus, and another is that we are able to compute in general the character table, where Green's degree formula is demonstrated as an example.</description>

      <title>Free resolution of the logarithmic derivation modules of close to free arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the algebraic structure of a new class of hyperplane arrangement $A$ obtained by deleting two hyperplanes from a free arrangement. We provide information on the minimal free resolutions of the logarithmic derivation module of $A$, which can be used to compute a lower bound for the graded Betti numbers of the resolution.
  Specifically, for the three-dimensional case, we determine the minimal free resolution of the logarithmic derivation module of $A$. We present illustrative examples of our main theorems to provide insights into the relationship between algebraic and combinatorial properties for close-to-free arrangements.</description>

      <title>On the Euler characteristic of the commutative graph complex and the top weight cohomology of $\mathcal M_g$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an asymptotic formula for the Euler characteristic of Kontsevich's commutative graph complex. This formula implies that the total amount of commutative graph homology grows super-exponentially with the rank and, via a theorem of Chan, Galatius, and Payne, that the dimension of the top weight cohomology of the moduli space of curves, $\mathcal M_g$, grows super-exponentially with the genus $g$.</description>

      <title>$K(Z,2)$ out of circular permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss $\pmb{SC}_*$, a simplicial homotopy model of $K(Z,2)$ constructed from circular permutations. In any dimension, the number of simplices in the model is finite. The complex $\pmb{SC}_*$ naturally manifests as a simplicial set representing ``minimally" triangulated circle bundles over simplicial bases. On the other hand, existence of the homotopy equivalence $|\pmb{SC}_*| \approx B(U(1)) \approx K(Z,2)$ appears to be a canonical fact from the foundations of the theory of crossed simplicial groups.</description>

      <title>The Lamplighter groups have infinite weak cop number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak-cop number of a graph, a variation of the cop number, is an invariant suitable for infinite graphs and is a quasi-isometric invariant. While for any $m\in\mathbb{Z}_+\cup\{\infty\}$ there exist locally finite infinite graphs with weak-cop number $m$, it is an open question whether there exists locally finite vertex transitive graphs whose weak-cop number is different than $1$ and $\infty$. We test this question on Cayley graphs of wreath products, these are objects known for their exotic geometries. We prove that Cayley graphs of wreath products of nontrivial groups by infinite groups have infinite weak-cop number. The result is proved by defining a new pursuit and evasion game and proving the existence of strategies for the evader. We also include a short argument that Cayley graphs of Thompson's group $F$ have infinite weak cop number.</description>
