      <title>GPU-accelerated Modeling of Biological Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex regulatory dynamics of a biological network can be succinctly captured using discrete logic models. Given even sparse time-course data from the system of interest, previous work has shown that global optimization schemes are suitable for proposing logic models that explain the data and make predictions about how the system will behave under varying conditions. Considering the large scale of the parameter search spaces associated with these regulatory systems, performance optimizations on the level of both hardware and software are necessary for making this a practical tool for in silico pharmaceutical research. We show here how the implementation of these global optimization algorithms in a GPU-computing environment can accelerate the solution of these parameter search problems considerably. We carry out parameter searches on two model biological regulatory systems that represent almost an order of magnitude scale-up in complexity, and we find the gains in efficiency from GPU to be a 33%-43% improvement compared to multi-thread CPU implementations and a 33%-1866% increase compared to CPU in serial. These improvements make global optimization of logic model identification a far more attractive and feasible method for in silico hypothesis generation and design of experiments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Communication Through Exploiting RIS, SSK, and CIM for Improved Reliability and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel communication system model that integrates reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), spatial shift keying (SSK), and code index modulation (CIM) based on Hadamard coding called RIS based transmit SSK-CIM (RIS-CIM-TSSK). By leveraging RIS, the system adapts rapidly to dynamic environments, enhancing error rates and overall reliability. SSK facilitates the transmission of additional passive information while eliminating the need for multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, thereby reducing complexity. CIM enhances passive information transmission through frequency domain spreading, which may increase signal obfuscation. This proposed scheme not only improves energy efficiency but also offers a robust solution for reliable communication in modern wireless networks, paving the way for smarter and more adaptable implementations. We consider a suboptimal, low-complexity detector for the proposed scheme and also address the blind case for phase adjustment of the RIS. Finally, we present the simulation results for the proposed system model across various configurations, including different numbers of receive and transmit antennas, varying reflecting elements of the RIS, and different code lengths.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis Of Heuristic and Approximation Algorithms for the The Mutual-Visibility Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms -- a direct random heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm -- on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.</description>
