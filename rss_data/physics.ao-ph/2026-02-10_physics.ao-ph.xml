      <title>Machine Learning-Ready Data Sets for the Analysis and Nowcasting of Atmospheric Radiation at Aviation Altitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowcasting and forecasting of the radiation environment in the Earth's lower atmosphere are critical for the safety of aircraft and spacecraft crews and passengers. Currently, this problem is addressed by employing statistical and physics-based models that take into account particle transport and precipitation. However, given the increased number of radiation measurements available to the community, it is possible to start developing data-driven approaches. We prepared Machine Learning-ready (ML-ready) datasets to nowcast the effective dose rates at aviation altitudes. The presented datasets contain 92,476 individual measurements from 589 flights obtained by the Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) experiment from 2013 to 2023. The ARMAS measurements are augmented with the properties of the Geospace environment, such as solar soft X-ray and proton fluxes, solar wind properties, secondary cosmic ray neutrons, space weather indexes, and global solar activity indicators (such as daily sunspot number). ARMAS data are separated into three partitions, ensuring that (1) the data points from a single flight remain within the same partition, and (2) each partition samples the flight locations and Geospace environment conditions equally. Several versions of the datasets allow predictions based on point-in-time measurements and use up to 24 hours of Geospace parameter history. The test of the use case demonstrates a possibility of nowcasting ARMAS measurements with accuracies slightly better than the considered physics-based models. The publicly available ML-ready datasets could serve as the first step in data preparation for ML-driven nowcasting and forecasting of the radiation environment.</description>

      <title>Linear Response and Optimal Fingerprinting for Nonautonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a link between response theory, pullback measures, and optimal fingerprinting method that paves the way for a) predicting the impact of acting forcings on time-dependent systems and b) attributing observed anomalies to acting forcings when the reference state in not time-independent. We first derive formulas for linear response theory for time-dependent Markov chains and diffusions processes. We discuss existence, uniqueness, and differentiability of the pullback measure under general (not necessarily slow or periodic) perturbations of the transition kernels. An explicit Green-Kubo-type formula for the linear response is derived. We analyze in detail the case of periodic reference dynamics, where the unperturbed pullback attractor is periodic but the response is generally not. Our formulas reduce to those of classic linear response if one considers a reference autonomous state. Finally, we show that our results allow for extending the theory of optimal fingerprinting for detection and attribution of climate change (or change in any complex system) for the case of time-dependent background state and for the case where the optimal solution is sought for multiple time slices at the same time. We provide strong numerical support for the findings by applying our theory to a modified version of the Ghil-Sellers energy balance model where we include explicit time dependence in the reference state as a result of natural forcings. We verify the accuracy of response theory in predicting the impact of increases of $CO_2$ in the temperature field even when we discretize the system using Markov state modelling approach. Additionally, we consider a more complex modelling scenario where a localized aerosol forcing is also included in the system and show that the optimal fingerprinting method developed here is able to attribute the climate change signal to the acting forcings.</description>

      <title>XiChen: A global weather observation-to-forecast machine learning system via four-dimensional variational gradient-guided flexible assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has shown great promise in revolutionizing weather forecasting, yet most ML systems still rely on initial conditions generated by Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems. End-to-end ML models aim to eliminate this dependency, but they often rely on observation-specific encoders and require redesign or retraining when observation sources change, thereby limiting their operational robustness. Here, we introduce XiChen, a global weather observation-to-forecast ML system via four-dimensional variational (4DVar) gradient-guided flexible assimilation. We demonstrate that the gradient of the 4DVar cost function serves as a physically grounded interface that maps heterogeneous observations into a common state space. This novel formulation enables XiChen to flexibly assimilate diverse conventional and raw satellite observations while preserving physical consistency. Experiments show that the system achieves forecasting metrics competitive with operational NWP systems. This work provides a practical and physically consistent route toward operational ML-based global weather forecasting systems with heterogeneous and evolving observations.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Spectral-Element Methods for the Spherical Shallow Water Equations in Covariant Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce discontinuous spectral-element methods of arbitrary order that are well balanced, conservative of mass, and conservative or dissipative of total energy (i.e., a mathematical entropy function) for a covariant flux formulation of the rotating shallow water equations with variable bottom topography on curved manifolds such as the sphere. The proposed methods are based on a skew-symmetric splitting of the tensor divergence in covariant form, which we implement and analyze within a general flux-differencing framework using tensor-product summation-by-parts operators. Such schemes are proven to satisfy semi-discrete mass and energy conservation on general unstructured quadrilateral grids in addition to well balancing for arbitrary continuous bottom topographies, with energy dissipation resulting from a suitable choice of numerical interface flux. Furthermore, the proposed covariant formulation permits an analytical representation of the geometry and associated metric terms while satisfying the aforementioned entropy stability, conservation, and well-balancing properties without the need to approximate the metric terms so as to enforce discrete metric identities. Numerical experiments on cubed-sphere grids are presented in order to verify the schemes' structure-preservation properties as well as to assess their accuracy and robustness within the context of several standard test cases characteristic of idealized atmospheric flows. Our theoretical and numerical results support the further development of the proposed methodology towards a full dynamical core for numerical weather prediction and climate modelling, as well as broader applications to other hyperbolic and advection-dominated systems of partial differential equations on curved manifolds.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic bias adjustment of seasonal predictions of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast. However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological mean adjusted forecasts.</description>

      <title>China Regional 3km Downscaling Based on Residual Corrective Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05377v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in numerical weather prediction is to efficiently produce high-resolution forecasts. A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 40 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models.</description>
