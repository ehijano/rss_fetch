      <title>Global boundedness for Generalized Schr\"odinger-Type Double Phase Problems in $\mathbb{R}^N$ and Applications to Supercritical Double Phase Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish two global boundedness results for weak solutions to generalized Schr\"{o}dinger-type double phase problems with variable exponents in $\mathbb{R}^N$ under new critical growth conditions optimally introduced in [26, 32]. More precisely, for the case of subcritical growth, we employ the De Giorgi iteration with a suitable localization method in $\mathbb{R}^N$ to obtain a-priori bounds. As a byproduct, we derive the decay property of weak solutions. For the case of critical growth, using the De Giorgi iteration with a localization adapted to the critical growth, we prove the global boundedness. As an interesting application of these results, the existence of weak solutions for supercritical double phase problems is shown. These results are new even for problems with constant exponents in $\mathbb{R}^N$.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions for a biharmonic-Kirchhoff system on locally finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study on the partial differential equations (systems) in the graph setting is a hot topic in recent years because of their applications to image processing and data clustering. Our motivation is to develop some existence results for biharmonic-Kirchhoff systems and biharmonic systems in the Euclidean setting, which are the continuous models, to the corresponding systems in the locally finite graph setting, which are the discrete models. We mainly focus on the existence of infinitely many solutions for a biharmonic-Kirchhoff system on a locally finite graph. The method is variational and the main tool is the symmetric mountain pass theorem. We obtain that the system has infinitely many solutions when the nonlinear term admits the super-$4$ linear growth, and we also present the corresponding results to the biharmonic system. We also find that the results in the locally finite graph setting are better than that in the Euclidean setting, which caused by the better embedding theorem in the locally finite graph.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory for 2D abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional abelian anyons are, in the magnetic gauge picture, represented as fermions coupled to magnetic flux tubes. For the ground state of such a system in a trapping potential, we theoretically and numerically investigate a Hartree approximate model, obtained by restricting trial states to Slater determinants and introducing a self-consistent magnetic field, locally proportional to matter density. This leads to a fermionic variant of the Chern-Simons-Schr{\"o}dinger system. We find that for dense systems, a semi-classical approximation yields qualitatively good results. Namely, we derive a density functional theory of magnetic Thomas-Fermi type, which correctly captures the trends of our numerical results. In particular, we explore the subtle dependence of the ground state with respect to the fraction of magnetic flux units attached to particles.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic preserving scheme for the quantum Liouville-BGK equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in this work in the numerical resolution of the Quantum Liouville-BGK equation, which arises in the derivation of quantum hydrodynamical models from first principles. Such models are often obtained in some asymptotic limits, for instance a diffusion or a fluid limit, and as a consequence the original Liouville equation contains small parameters. A standard method such as a split-step algorithm is then accurate provided the time step is sufficiently small compared to the asymptotic parameter, which is a severe limitation. In the case of the diffusion limit, we propose a numerical method that is accurate for time steps independent of the small parameter, and which captures well both the microscopic dynamics and the diffusion limit. Our approach is substantiated by an informal theoretical error analysis.</description>

      <title>Hypoellipticit{\'e} de polyn{\^o}mes de champs de vecteurs et conjectures de Helffer etNourrigat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study here the sub-Riemannian geometry on a manifold $M$ induced by a finite family $F$ of vector fields satisfying the H{\"o}rmander condition, as well as the differential operators obtained as polynomials in the elements of $F$. Such an operator $D$ is hypoelliptic if, for any smooth function $f$, the solutions $u$ of the equation $Du=f$ are also smooth. A more refined notion, that of maximal hypoelliptic operators, extends this property in terms of Sobolev regularity, offering a parallel in sub-Riemannian geometry to elliptic operators. In 1979, Helffer and Nourrigat proposed a conjecture characterizing maximal hypoellipticity, generalizing the main regularity theorem for elliptic operators. This conjecture has recently been confirmed using tools from non-commutative geometry. A central element of this work is a natural generalisation in sub-Riemannian geometry, introduced by Mohsen, of the Connes tangent groupoid, in which appear all the tangent cones, key ingredients in the work of Helffer and Nourrigat. In collaboration with Androulidakis and Yuncken, Mohsen developed a pseudodifferential calculus in this context, introducing in particular the notion of principal symbol. They obtained that the invertibility of this symbol is equivalent to maximal hypoellipticity, thus validating the conjecture. This talk will present the ingredients and broad outlines of these innovative advances.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the fully discrete JKO scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JKO scheme provides the discrete-in-time approximation for the solutions of evolutionary equations with Wasserstein gradient structure. We study a natural space-discretization of this scheme by restricting the minimization to the measures supported on the nodes of a regular grid. The study of the fully discrete JKO scheme is motivated by the applications to developing numerical schemes for the nonlinear diffusion equation with drift and the crowd motion model. The main result of this paper is the convergence of the scheme as both the time and space discretization parameters tend to zero in a suitable regime.</description>

      <title>Rigorous derivation of magneto-Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation with non-local temperature term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general compressible, viscous, heat and magnetically conducting fluid described by the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system coupled with induction equation. In particular, we do not assume conservative boundary conditions for the temperature and allow heating or cooling on the surface of the domain. We are interested in the mathematical analysis when the Mach, Froude, and Alfv\'en numbers are small, converging to zero at a specific rate. We give a rigorous mathematical justification that in the limit, in case of low stratification, one obtains a modified Oberbeck-Boussinesq-MHD system with a non-local term or a non-local boundary condition for the temperature deviation. Choosing a domain confined between parallel plates, one finds also that the flow is horizontal, and the magnetic field is perpendicular to it. The proof is based on the analysis of weak solutions to a primitive system and the relative entropy method.</description>

      <title>Euler-Lagrange equations for variable-growth total variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of integral functionals with Musielak-Orlicz type variable growth, possibly linear in some regions of the domain. This includes $p(x)$ power-type integrands with $p(x)\ge 1$ as well as double-phase $p\!-\!q$ integrands with $p=1$. The main goal of this paper is to identify the $L^2$-subdifferential of the functional, including a local characterisation in terms of a variant of the Anzellotti product defined through the Young's inequality. As an application, we obtain the Euler-Lagrange equation for the variant of the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi image denoising problem with variable growth regularising term.</description>

      <title>One-side Liouville Theorem for hypoelliptic Ornstein--Uhlenbeck operators having drifts with imaginary spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Liouville theorem for \emph{non-negative} solutions to (possibly degenerate) Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equations whose linear drift has imaginary spectrum. This provides an answer to a question raised by Priola and Zabczyk since the proof of their Theorem characterizing the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators having the Liouville property for \emph{bounded} solutions. Our approach is based on a Liouville property at ``$t=-\infty$" for the solutions to the relevant Kolmogorov equation which, in turn, derives from a new parabolic Harnack-type inequality for its non-negative ancient solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider $2\times 2$ matrix-valued pseudodifferential equations in which the two characteristic sets intersect with finite contact order. We show that the asymptotic behavior of its solution changes dramatically before and after the crossing point, and provide a precise asymptotic formula. This is a generalization of the previous results for matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operators and Landau-Zener models. The proof relies on a normal form reduction and a detailed analysis of a simple first-order system.</description>

      <title>A dynamical Amrein-Berthier uncertainty principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a selfadjoint magnetic Schr\"odinger operator
  \begin{equation*}
  H = ( i \partial + A(x) )^2 + V(x)
  \end{equation*} on $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, with $V(x)$ strictly subquadratic and $A(x)$ strictly sublinear, we prove that the flow $u(t)=e^{-itH}u(0)$ satisfies an Amrein--Berthier type inequality
  \begin{equation*}
  \|u(t)\|_{L^{2}}\lesssim_{E,F,T,A,V}
  \|u(0)\|_{L^{2}(E^{c})}
  +
  \|u(T)\|_{L^{2}(F^{c})},
  \qquad
  0\le t\le T
  \end{equation*} for all compact sets $E,F \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$. In particular, if both $u(0)$ and $u(T)$ are compactly supported, then $u$ vanishes identically. Under different assumptions on the operator, which allow for time--dependent coefficients, the result extends to sets $E,F$ of finite measure. We also consider a few variants for Schr\"{o}dinger operators with singular coefficients, metaplectic operators, and we include applications to control theory.</description>

      <title>An eco-epidemiological model with prey-taxis and slow diffusion: Global existence, boundedness and novel dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, an attempt has been made to understand the effects of prey-taxis on the existence of global-in-time solutions and dynamics in an eco-epidemiological model, particularly under the influence of slow dispersal characterized by the $p$-Laplacian operator and enhanced mortality of the infected prey, subject to specific assumptions on the taxis sensitivity functions. We prove the global existence of classical solutions when the infected prey undergoes random motion and exhibits standard mortality. Under the assumption that the infected prey disperses slowly and exhibits enhanced mortality, we prove the global existence of weak solutions. Following a detailed mathematical investigation of the proposed model, we shift our focus to analyse the stability of the positive equilibrium point under the scenario where all species exhibit linear diffusion, the infected prey experiences standard mortality, and the predator exhibits taxis exclusively toward the infected prey. Within this framework, we establish the occurrence of a steady-state bifurcation. Numerical simulations are then carried out to observe this dynamical behavior. Our results have large scale applications to biological invasions and biological control of pests, under the prevalence of disease in the pest population.</description>

      <title>Stability of nonlinear recovery from scattering and modified scattering maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove stability estimates for the recovery of the nonlinearity from the scattering or modified scattering map for one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. We consider nonlinearities of the form $a(x) |u|^p u$ for $p\in [2,4]$ and $[1+a(x)]|u|^2 u$, where $a$ is a localized function. In the first case, we show that for $p\in(2,4]$ we may obtain a H\"older-type stability estimate for recovery via the scattering map, while for $p=2$ we obtain a logarithmic stability estimate. In the second case, we show a logarithmic stability estimate for recovery via the modified scattering map.</description>

      <title>Contractivity of Wasserstein distance and exponential decay for the Landau equation with Maxwellian molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Landau equation with Maxwell molecules and show two results: exponential decay of the relative $L^2$ norm and contractivity of the $2$-Wasserstein distance of two arbitrary solutions. The proof of the decay of the relative $L^2$ uses a careful analysis of the operator and weighted Poincar\'e inequalities. Using the framework recently introduced by Guillen and Silvestre in \cite{GS24}, we provide a new, short, intuitive and quantitative proof that the Landau equation is contractive in the 2-Wasserstein metric. To achieve this, we quantify the convexity of the $2$-Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>On 1D Mass-subcritical Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in modulation spaces $M^{p, p'} (p&lt;2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish global well-posedness for the 1D mass-subcritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation $$iu_t +u_{xx} \pm |u|^{\alpha-1}u=0 \quad (1&lt; \alpha&lt;5)$$ for large Cauchy data in modulation spaces $M^{p,\frac{p}{p-1}}(\mathbb R)$ with $4/3&lt;p&lt;2$ and $p$ sufficiently close to $2$. This complements the work of Vargas-Vega (2001) and Chaichenets et al. (2017), where they established the result for $p$ larger than $2$. The proof adopts Bourgain's high-low decomposition method inspired by the work of Vargas-Vega (2001) and Hyakuna-Tsutsumi (2012) to the modulation space setting and exploits generalized Strichartz estimates in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <title>Multiharmonic algorithms for contrast-enhanced ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmonic generation plays a crucial role in contrast-enhanced ultrasound, both for imaging and therapeutic applications. However, accurately capturing these nonlinear effects is computationally very demanding when using traditional time-domain approaches. To address this issue, in this work, we develop algorithms based on a time discretization that uses a multiharmonic Ansatz applied to a model that couples the Westervelt equation for acoustic pressure with a volume-based approximation of the Rayleigh--Plesset equation for the dynamics of microbubble contrast agents. We first rigorously establish the existence of time-periodic solutions for this Westervelt-ODE system. We then derive a multiharmonic representation of the system under time-periodic excitation and develop iterative algorithms that rely on the successive computation of higher harmonics under the assumption of real-valued or complex solution fields. In the real-valued setting, we characterize the approximation error in terms of the number of harmonics and a contribution owing to the fixed-point iteration. Finally, we investigate these algorithms numerically and illustrate how the number of harmonics and presence of microbubbles influence the propagation of acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Strong well-posedness of the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equation on moving domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the strong($H^1$) well-posedness of the two dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with multiplicative noise on moving domains. Due to the nonlocality effect, this equation exhibits a ``piecewise" variational setting. Namely the global well-posedness of this equation is decomposed into the well-posedness of a family of stochastic partial differential equations(SPDEs) in the variational setting on each small time-interval. We first examine the well-posedness on each time interval, which does not have (nonhomogeneous) coercivity. Subsequently, we give an estimate of lower bound of length of the time-interval, which enables us to achieve the global well-posedness.</description>

      <title>Accurate semiclassical analysis of light propagation on tilted hyperplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the scalar light model given by Helmholtz' equation in R^{1+d} , we consider the transformation of an initial scene (a hologram) in {0}xR^d by an arbitrary affine transformation (which can be viewed as a propagation into a tilted hyperplane). In the high frequency regime, we use microlocal and semiclassical analysis to describe the propagator as a semiclassical Fourier integral operator, thus generalising the well-known Angular Spectrum formula from optics. We then prove new precise Egorov theorems, including subprincipal terms, which indicate how to take into account the propagation along rays of geometric optics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing quasi-dissipative evolution equations with the moment-SOS hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there is no relaxation gap between a quasi-dissipative nonlinear evolution equation in a Hilbert space and its linear Liouville equation reformulation on probability measures. In other words, strong and generalized solutions of such equations are unique in the class of measure-valued solutions. As a major consequence, non-convex numerical optimization over these non-linear partial differential equations can be carried out with the infinite-dimensional moment-SOS hierarchy with global convergence guarantees. This covers in particular all reaction-diffusion equations with polynomial nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity theory of the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation in a Lipschitz domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation $-\Delta u=f(X)\cdot u^{-\gamma}$ in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$, with a vanishing boundary condition $u|_{\partial\Omega}=0$ and a positive, bounded function $f(X)$. A distinguishing feature of this problem is that the vanishing boundary condition introduces a singularity in the equation. We focus on the well-posedness of the problem and the growth rate of solutions near the boundary. Additionally, we investigate the boundary Harnack principle for the equation. Our results offer new perspectives on singular elliptic equations in non-smooth domains.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control for Kuramoto Model: from Many-Particle Liouville Equation to Diffusive Mean-Field Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the mean-field optimal control problem of a swarm of Kuramoto oscillators. Using the notion of wrapped distribution, we explain the connection between the stochastic particle system and the mean-field PDE on the periodic domain. In the limit of an infinite number of oscillators the collective dynamics of the agents' density is described by a diffusive mean-field model in the form of a non-local PDE, where the non-locality arises from the synchronization mechanism. We prove the existence of the optimal control of the mean-field model by using $\Gamma$-convergence strategy of the cost functional corresponding to the Liouville equation on the particle level. In the discussion of propagation of chaos for fixed control functions we complete the relative entropy estimate by using large deviation estimate given by \cite{MR3858403}.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Anisotropic Viscosities for the Stochastic Primitive Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The viscosity parameters play a fundamental role in applications involving stochastic primitive equations (SPE), such as accurate weather predictions, climate modeling, and ocean current simulations. In this paper, we develop several novel estimators for the anisotropic viscosities in the SPE, using a finite number of Fourier modes of a single sample path observed within a finite time interval. The focus is on analyzing the consistency and asymptotic normality of these estimators. We consider a torus domain and treat strong, pathwise solutions in the presence of additive white noise (in time). Notably, the analysis for estimating horizontal and vertical viscosities differs due to the unique structure of the SPE and the fact that both parameters of interest are adjacent to the highest-order derivative. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing the estimation of anisotropic viscosities, with the potential applicability of the developed methodology to other models.</description>

      <title>Derivation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and quantum Boltzmann equations in an interacting Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our previous work [37] presented a rigorous derivation of quantum Boltzmann equations near a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here, we extend it with a complete characterization of the leading order fluctuation dynamics. For this purpose, we correct the latter via an appropriate Bogoliubov rotation, in partial analogy to the approach by Grillakis-Machedon et al. [59], in addition to the Weyl transformation applied in [37]. Based on the analysis of the third order expansion of the BEC wave function, and the second order expansions of the pair-correlations, we show that through a renormalization strategy, various contributions to the effective Hamiltonian can be iteratively eliminated by an appropriate choice of the Weyl and Bogoliubov transformations. This leads to a separation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations and quantum Boltzmann equations. A multitude of terms that were included in the error term in [37] are now identified as contributions to the HFB renormalization terms. Thereby, the error bound in the work at hand is improved significantly. To the given order, it is now sharp, and matches the order or magnitude expected from scaling considerations. Consequently, we extend the time of validity to $t\sim (\log N)^2$ compared to $t\sim (\log N/\log \log N)^2$ before. We expect our approach to be extensible to smaller orders in $\frac1N$.</description>

      <title>The Light ray transform for pseudo-Euclidean metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ray transform $L$ over null (light) rays in the pseudo-Euclidean space with signature $(n',n'')$, $n'\ge2$, $n''\ge2$. We analyze the normal operator $L'L$, derive an inversion formula, and prove stability estimates. We show that the symbol $p(\xi)$ is elliptic but singular at the light cone. We analyze $L$ as an Fourier Integral Operator as well. Finally, we compare this to the Minkowski case.</description>
