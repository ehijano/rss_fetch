      <title>Empirical Welfare Analysis with Hedonic Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze demand settings where heterogeneous consumers maximize utility for product attributes subject to a nonlinear budget constraint. We develop nonparametric methods for welfare-analysis of interventions that change the constraint. Two new findings are Roy's identity for smooth, nonlinear budgets, which yields a Partial Differential Equation system, and a Slutsky-like symmetry condition for demand. Under scalar unobserved heterogeneity and single-crossing preferences, the coefficient functions in the PDEs are nonparametrically identified, and under symmetry, lead to path-independent, money-metric welfare. We illustrate our methods with welfare evaluation of a hypothetical change in relationship between property rent and neighborhood school-quality using British microdata.</description>

      <title>Changes-In-Changes For Discrete Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the changes-in-changes (CIC) model to handle discrete treatments with more than two categories, extending the binary case of Athey and Imbens (2006). While the original CIC model is well-suited for binary treatments, it cannot accommodate multi-category discrete treatments often found in economic and policy settings. Although recent work has extended CIC to continuous treatments, there remains a gap for multi-category discrete treatments. I introduce a generalized CIC model that adapts the rank invariance assumption to multiple treatment levels, allowing for robust modeling while capturing the distinct effects of varying treatment intensities.</description>

      <title>Understanding the decision-making process of choice modellers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete Choice Modelling serves as a robust framework for modelling human choice behaviour across various disciplines. Building a choice model is a semi structured research process that involves a combination of a priori assumptions, behavioural theories, and statistical methods. This complex set of decisions, coupled with diverse workflows, can lead to substantial variability in model outcomes. To better understand these dynamics, we developed the Serious Choice Modelling Game, which simulates the real world modelling process and tracks modellers' decisions in real time using a stated preference dataset. Participants were asked to develop choice models to estimate Willingness to Pay values to inform policymakers about strategies for reducing noise pollution. The game recorded actions across multiple phases, including descriptive analysis, model specification, and outcome interpretation, allowing us to analyse both individual decisions and differences in modelling approaches. While our findings reveal a strong preference for using data visualisation tools in descriptive analysis, it also identifies gaps in missing values handling before model specification. We also found significant variation in the modelling approach, even when modellers were working with the same choice dataset. Despite the availability of more complex models, simpler models such as Multinomial Logit were often preferred, suggesting that modellers tend to avoid complexity when time and resources are limited. Participants who engaged in more comprehensive data exploration and iterative model comparison tended to achieve better model fit and parsimony, which demonstrate that the methodological choices made throughout the workflow have significant implications, particularly when modelling outcomes are used for policy formulation.</description>

      <title>Estimating Nonseparable Selection Models: A Functional Contraction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method for estimating nonseparable selection models. We show that, given the selection rule and the observed selected outcome distribution, the potential outcome distribution can be characterized as the fixed point of an operator, and we prove that this operator is a functional contraction. We propose a two-step semiparametric maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the selection model and the potential outcome distribution. The consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator are established. Our approach performs well in Monte Carlo simulations and is applicable in a variety of empirical settings where only a selected sample of outcomes is observed. Examples include consumer demand models with only transaction prices, auctions with incomplete bid data, and Roy models with data on accepted wages.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic Properties of Debiased Machine Learning Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the properties of debiased machine learning (DML) estimators under a novel asymptotic framework, offering insights for improving the performance of these estimators in applications. DML is an estimation method suited to economic models where the parameter of interest depends on unknown nuisance functions that must be estimated. It requires weaker conditions than previous methods while still ensuring standard asymptotic properties. Existing theoretical results do not distinguish between two alternative versions of DML estimators, DML1 and DML2. Under a new asymptotic framework, this paper demonstrates that DML2 asymptotically dominates DML1 in terms of bias and mean squared error, formalizing a previous conjecture based on simulation results regarding their relative performance. Additionally, this paper provides guidance for improving the performance of DML2 in applications.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Causal Message Passing for Experimentation with Complex Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of treatment effects is essential for decision-making across various scientific fields. This task, however, becomes challenging in areas like social sciences and online marketplaces, where treating one experimental unit can influence outcomes for others through direct or indirect interactions. Such interference can lead to biased treatment effect estimates, particularly when the structure of these interactions is unknown. We address this challenge by introducing a new class of estimators based on causal message-passing, specifically designed for settings with pervasive, unknown interference. Our estimator draws on information from the sample mean and variance of unit outcomes and treatments over time, enabling efficient use of observed data to estimate the evolution of the system state. Concretely, we construct non-linear features from the moments of unit outcomes and treatments and then learn a function that maps these features to future mean and variance of unit outcomes. This allows for the estimation of the treatment effect over time. Extensive simulations across multiple domains, using synthetic and real network data, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in estimating total treatment effect dynamics, even in cases where interference exhibits non-monotonic behavior in the probability of treatment.</description>

      <title>Educational Effects in Mathematics: Conditional Average Treatment Effect depending on the Number of Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the educational effect of the Academic Support Center at Kogakuin University. Following the initial assessment, it was suggested that group bias had led to an underestimation of the Center's true impact. To address this issue, the authors applied the theory of causal inference. By using T-learner, the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) of the Center's face-to-face (F2F) personal assistance program was evaluated. Extending T-learner, the authors produced a new CATE function that depends on the number of treatments (F2F sessions) and used the estimated function to predict the CATE performance of F2F assistance.</description>

      <title>Identifying Economic Factors Affecting Unemployment Rates in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we seek to understand how macroeconomic factors such as GDP, inflation, Unemployment Insurance, and S&amp;P 500 index; as well as microeconomic factors such as health, race, and educational attainment impacted the unemployment rate for about 20 years in the United States. Our research question is to identify which factor(s) contributed the most to the unemployment rate surge using linear regression. Results from our studies showed that GDP (negative), inflation (positive), Unemployment Insurance (contrary to popular opinion; negative), and S&amp;P 500 index (negative) were all significant factors, with inflation being the most important one. As for health issue factors, our model produced resultant correlation scores for occurrences of Cardiovascular Disease, Neurological Disease, and Interpersonal Violence with unemployment. Race as a factor showed a huge discrepancies in the unemployment rate between Black Americans compared to their counterparts. Asians had the lowest unemployment rate throughout the years. As for education attainment, results showed that having a higher education attainment significantly reduced one chance of unemployment. People with higher degrees had the lowest unemployment rate. Results of this study will be beneficial for policymakers and researchers in understanding the unemployment rate during the pandemic.</description>

      <title>Theory coherent shrinkage of Time-Varying Parameters in VARs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel theory-coherent shrinkage prior for Time-Varying Parameter VARs (TVP-VARs). The prior centers the time-varying parameters on a path implied a priori by an underlying economic theory, chosen to describe the dynamics of the macroeconomic variables in the system. Leveraging information from conventional economic theory using this prior significantly improves inference precision and forecast accuracy compared to the standard TVP-VAR. In an application, I use this prior to incorporate information from a New Keynesian model that includes both the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB) and forward guidance into a medium-scale TVP-VAR model. This approach leads to more precise estimates of the impulse response functions, revealing a distinct propagation of risk premium shocks inside and outside the ZLB in US data.</description>

      <title>Economic Diversification and Social Progress in the GCC Countries: A Study on the Transition from Oil-Dependency to Knowledge-Based Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gulf Cooperation Council countries -- Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia -- holds strategic significance due to its large oil reserves. However, these nations face considerable challenges in shifting from oil-dependent economies to more diversified, knowledge-based systems. This study examines the progress of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in achieving economic diversification and social development, focusing on the Social Progress Index (SPI), which provides a broader measure of societal well-being beyond just economic growth. Using data from the World Bank, covering 2010 to 2023, the study employs the XGBoost machine learning model to forecast SPI values for the period of 2024 to 2026. Key components of the methodology include data preprocessing, feature selection, and the simulation of independent variables through ARIMA modeling. The results highlight significant improvements in education, healthcare, and women's rights, contributing to enhanced SPI performance across the GCC countries. However, notable challenges persist in areas like personal rights and inclusivity. The study further indicates that despite economic setbacks caused by global disruptions, including the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price volatility, GCC nations are expected to see steady improvements in their SPI scores through 2027. These findings underscore the critical importance of economic diversification, investment in human capital, and ongoing social reforms to reduce dependence on hydrocarbons and build knowledge-driven economies. This research offers valuable insights for policymakers aiming to strengthen both social and economic resilience in the region while advancing long-term sustainable development goals.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Political Stability in GCC Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Political stability is crucial for the socioeconomic development of nations, particularly in geopolitically sensitive regions such as the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain. This study focuses on predicting the political stability index for these six countries using machine learning techniques. The study uses data from the World Banks comprehensive dataset, comprising 266 indicators covering economic, political, social, and environmental factors. Employing the Edit Distance on Real Sequence method for feature selection and XGBoost for model training, the study forecasts political stability trends for the next five years. The model achieves high accuracy, with mean absolute percentage error values under 10, indicating reliable predictions. The forecasts suggest that Oman, the UAE, and Qatar will experience relatively stable political conditions, while Saudi Arabia and Bahrain may continue to face negative political stability indices. The findings underscore the significance of economic factors such as GDP and foreign investment, along with variables related to military expenditure and international tourism, as key predictors of political stability. These results provide valuable insights for policymakers, enabling proactive measures to enhance governance and mitigate potential risks.</description>

      <title>Cluster-Randomized Trials with Cross-Cluster Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The literature on cluster-randomized trials typically assumes no interference across clusters. This may be implausible when units are irregularly distributed in space without well-separated communities, in which case clusters may not represent significant geographic, social, or economic divisions. In this paper, we develop methods for reducing bias due to cross-cluster interference. First, we propose an estimation strategy that excludes units not surrounded by clusters assigned to the same treatment arm. We show that this substantially reduces asymptotic bias relative to conventional difference-in-means estimators without substantial cost to variance. Second, we formally establish a bias-variance trade-off in the choice of clusters: constructing fewer, larger clusters reduces bias due to interference but increases variance. We provide a rule for choosing the number of clusters to balance the asymptotic orders of the bias and variance of our estimator. Finally, we consider unsupervised learning for cluster construction and provide theoretical guarantees for $k$-medoids.</description>

      <title>Weak-instrument-robust subvector inference in instrumental variables regression: A subvector Lagrange multiplier test and properties of subvector Anderson-Rubin confidence sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a weak-instrument-robust subvector Lagrange multiplier test for instrumental variables regression. We show that it is asymptotically size-correct under a technical condition. This is the first weak-instrument-robust subvector test for instrumental variables regression to recover the degrees of freedom of the commonly used non-weak-instrument-robust Wald test. Additionally, we provide a closed-form solution for subvector confidence sets obtained by inverting the subvector Anderson-Rubin test. We show that they are centered around a k-class estimator. Also, we show that the subvector confidence sets for single coefficients of the causal parameter are jointly bounded if and only if Anderson's likelihood-ratio test rejects the hypothesis that the first-stage regression parameter is of reduced rank, that is, that the causal parameter is not identified. Finally, we show that if a confidence set obtained by inverting the Anderson-Rubin test is bounded and nonempty, it is equal to a Wald-based confidence set with a data-dependent confidence level. We explicitly compute this Wald-based confidence test.</description>
