      <title>Determining the acoustoelastic effect of longitudinal waves propagating inclined to principal stress directions in concrete: theory and experimental validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of acoustoelasticity pertains to changes in elastic wave velocity within a medium when subjected to initial stresses. However, existing acoustoelastic expressions are predominantly developed for waves propagating parallel or perpendicular to the principal stress directions, where no shear stresses are involved. In our previous publication, we demonstrated that the impact of shear stresses on longitudinal wave velocity in concrete, when body waves propagate in the shear deformation plane, is negligible. This finding allows us to revise the acoustoelastic expression for longitudinal waves propagating inclined to the principal stress directions in stressed concrete. The revised expression reveals that the acoustoelastic effect for such longitudinal waves can be expressed using acoustoelastic parameters derived from waves propagating parallel and perpendicular to the uniaxial principal stress direction. To validate our theoretical statement, experiments were conducted on a concrete cylinder subjected to uniaxial stress. Despite slight fluctuations in the experimental observations, the overall trend of acoustoelastic effects for inclined propagating longitudinal waves aligns with the theory. This proposed theory holds potential for monitoring changes in the magnitudes and directions of principal stresses in the plane stress state.</description>

      <title>An operator approach to the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive media. Part 2: transmission problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this second chapter, we analyse transmission problems between a dielectric and a dispersive negative material. In the first part, we consider a transmission problem between two half-spaces, filled respectively by the vacuum and a Drude material, and separated by a planar interface. In this setting, we answer to the following question: does this medium satisfy a limiting amplitude principle? This principle defines the stationary regime as the large time asymptotic behavior of a system subject to a periodic excitation. In the second part, we consider the transmission problem of an infinite strip of Drude material embedded in the vacuum and analyse the existence and dispersive properties of guided waves. In both problems, our spectral analysis enlighten new and unusual physical phenomena for the considered transmission problems due to the presence of the dispersive negative material. In particular, we prove the existence of an interface resonance in the first part and the existence of slow light phenomena for guiding waves in the second part.</description>

      <title>An operator approach to the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive media. Part 1: general results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate in this chapter the mathematical models for electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive isotropic passive linear media for which the dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon$ and magnetic permeability $\mu$ depend on the frequency. We emphasize the link between physical requirements and mathematical properties of the models. A particular attention is devoted to the notions of causality and passivity and its connection to the existence of Herglotz functions that determine the dispersion of the material. We consider successively the cases of the general passive media and the so-called local media for which $\varepsilon$ and $\mu$ are rational functions of the frequency. This leads us to analyse the important class of non dissipative and dissipative generalized Lorentz models. In particular, we discuss the connection between mathematical and physical properties of models through the notions of stability, energy conservation, dispersion and modal analyses, group and phase velocities and energy decay in dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>A dual-scale stochastic analysis framework for creep failure considering microstructural randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creep failure under high temperatures is a complex multiscale and multi-mechanism issue involving inherent microstructural randomness. To investigate the effect of microstructures on the uniaxial/multiaxial creep failure, a dual-scale stochastic analysis framework is established to introduce the grain boundary (GB) characteristics into the macroscopic analysis. The nickel-base superalloy Inconel 617 is considered in this study. Firstly, the damage mechanisms of GBs are investigated based on the crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) method and cohesive zone model (CZM). Subsequently, based on the obtained GB damage evolution, a novel Monte Carlo (MC) approach is proposed to establish the relationship between the GB orientation and area distribution and macroscopic creep damage. Finally, a dual-scale stochastic multiaxial creep damage model is established to incorporate the influence of the random GB orientation and area distribution. With the numerical application of the proposed creep damage model, the random initiation and growth of creep cracks in the uniaxial tensile specimen and the pressurized tube are captured and analyzed. The proposed stochastic framework effectively considers the inherent randomness introduced by GB characteristics and efficiently realizes full-field multiscale calculations. It also shows its potential applications in safety evaluation and life prediction of creep components and structures under high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Determining diffusivity and dissipation of diffuse body waves in concrete with multiple planar boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for determining the diffusive properties of diffuse body waves, specifically diffusivity and dissipation, in concrete with multiple planar boundaries. Instead of relying on the analytical solution to the diffusion equation, which accounts for all possible reflections and has a significantly complex form, we propose a simpler method that considers the reflected energy originating from a limited number of image sources, making it easier to perform curve fitting and obtain diffusive properties. Our experimental findings highlight that distant image sources have a negligible effect on the acquired diffusive properties, suggesting that the number of image sources considered should be determined based on their maximum contribution to the main energy. Additionally, failing to account for the reflected energy during the fitting process results in an underestimation of both the diffusivity and dissipation. The obtained diffusive properties can be used to evaluate damage in concrete.</description>
