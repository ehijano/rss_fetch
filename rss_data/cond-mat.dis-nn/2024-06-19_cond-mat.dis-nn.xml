      <title>Scaling of the Quantum Geometry Metrics in Disordered Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a study of disorder-dependent quantum geometry in topological systems. Thanks to the development of an efficient linear-scaling numerical methodology based on the kernel polynomial method, we can explore the nontrivial behavior of the quantum geometry metrics (quantum metric and Chern number) in large-scale inhomogeneous systems, accounting for the presence of disorder. We illustrate this approach in the disordered Haldane model, examining the impact of Anderson and vacancy-type of disorders on the trivial and topological phases captured by this model.</description>

      <title>Towrad mean-field bound for critical temperature on Nishimori line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation gives a lower bound of the true critical inverse temperature in a broad class of ferromagnetic spin models, which is called the mean-field bound for the critical temperature. In this study, we explore the possibility of a corresponding mean-field bound for the critical temperature in Ising spin-glass models with Gaussian randomness on the Nishimori line. On the Nishimori line, the critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation is given by $\beta_{MF}^{NL}=\sqrt{1/z}$, where $z$ denotes the coordination number. Using the Griffiths inequalities on the Nishimori line, we prove that there is zero spontaneous magnetization in the high-temperature region $\beta &lt; \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. In other words, the true critical inverse temperature $\beta_c^{NL}$ of the Nishimori line is always bounded by $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. Unfortunately, we did not succeed in obtaining the corresponding mean-field bound $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}$ on the Nishimori line.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Identifying trivial and Majorana zero-energy modes using the Majorana polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider superconductor-semiconductor hybrids containing both trivial and Majorana zero modes and explore their signatures in the Majorana polarization. In particular, we consider trivial zero energy states due to confinement and disorder, which seem to be very likely experimental scenarios. We show that the Majorana polarization is able to characterize the topological phase transition as well as the emergence of Majorana zero modes even when trivial zero-energy states proliferate. Notably, the Majorana polarization inherits direct information about spatial correlations which are then the key for distinguishing Majorana and trivial zero-modes. We demonstrate the utility of the Majorana polarization in normal-superconductor junctions and superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junctions. Our results support the interpretation of the Majorana polarization as a real space topological indicator.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Associative Memory, Parallelized MLP-Mixer, and Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have established themselves as the leading neural network model in natural language processing and are increasingly foundational in various domains. In vision, the MLP-Mixer model has demonstrated competitive performance, suggesting that attention mechanisms might not be indispensable. Inspired by this, recent research has explored replacing attention modules with other mechanisms, including those described by MetaFormers. However, the theoretical framework for these models remains underdeveloped. This paper proposes a novel perspective by integrating Krotov's hierarchical associative memory with MetaFormers, enabling a comprehensive representation of the entire Transformer block, encompassing token-/channel-mixing modules, layer normalization, and skip connections, as a single Hopfield network. This approach yields a parallelized MLP-Mixer derived from a three-layer Hopfield network, which naturally incorporates symmetric token-/channel-mixing modules and layer normalization. Empirical studies reveal that symmetric interaction matrices in the model hinder performance in image recognition tasks. Introducing symmetry-breaking effects transitions the performance of the symmetric parallelized MLP-Mixer to that of the vanilla MLP-Mixer. This indicates that during standard training, weight matrices of the vanilla MLP-Mixer spontaneously acquire a symmetry-breaking configuration, enhancing their effectiveness. These findings offer insights into the intrinsic properties of Transformers and MLP-Mixers and their theoretical underpinnings, providing a robust framework for future model design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Variational optimization of the amplitude of neural-network quantum many-body ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQSs), variationally optimized by combining traditional methods and deep learning techniques, is a new way to find quantum many-body ground states and gradually becomes a competitor of traditional variational methods. However, there are still some difficulties in the optimization of NQSs, such as local minima, slow convergence, and sign structure optimization. Here, we split a quantum many-body variational wave function into a multiplication of a real-valued amplitude neural network and a sign structure, and focus on the optimization of the amplitude network while keeping the sign structure fixed. The amplitude network is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual blocks, namely a ResNet. Our method is tested on three typical quantum many-body systems. The obtained ground state energies are lower than or comparable to those from traditional variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Surprisingly, for the frustrated Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model, our results are better than those of the complex-valued CNN in the literature, implying that the sign structure of the complex-valued NQS is difficult to be optimized. We will study the optimization of the sign structure of NQSs in the future.</description>

      <title>Timeliness criticality in complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In complex systems, external parameters often determine the phase in which the system operates, i.e., its macroscopic behavior. For nearly a century, statistical physics has extensively studied systems' transitions across phases, (universal) critical exponents, and related dynamical properties. Here we consider the functionality of systems, notably operations in socio-technical ones, production in economic ones and, more generally, any schedule-based system, where timing is of crucial importance. We introduce a stylized model of delay propagation on temporal networks, where the magnitude of delay-mitigating buffer acts as a control parameter. The model exhibits {\it timeliness criticality}, a novel form of critical behavior. We characterize fluctuations near criticality, commonly referred to as ``avalanches'', and identify the corresponding critical exponents. The model exhibits timeliness criticality also when run on real-world temporal systems such as production networks. Additionally, we explore potential connections with the Mode-Coupling Theory of glasses, the depinning transition and the directed polymer problem.</description>

      <title>Neural ODEs for holographic transport models without translation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the data-driven holographic transport models without translation symmetry. Our data are the real part of the frequency-dependent shear viscosity, denoted as $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$. We develop a radial flow equation of the shear response and establish its relation to $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$ for a wide class of holographic models. This allows us to determine $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$ of a strongly coupled field theory by the black hole metric and the graviton mass. The latter serves as the bulk dual to the translation symmetry breaking on the boundary. We convert the flow equation to a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE), which is a neural network with continuous depth and produces output through a black-box ODE solver. We test the Neural ODE in three well-known holographic models without translation symmetry. Given either the metric or the mass, we display that the Neural ODE can learn the other with high accuracy. We also illustrate that the learned metric can be used to predict the derivative of entanglement entropy $S$ with respect to the size of entangling region $l$, which suggests an intriguing relationship between $S^{\prime }(l)$ and $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$.</description>

      <title>Quantum inspired approach for denoising with application to medical imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background noise in many fields such as medical imaging poses significant challenges for accurate diagnosis, prompting the development of denoising algorithms. Traditional methodologies, however, often struggle to address the complexities of noisy environments in high dimensional imaging systems. This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired approach for image denoising, drawing upon principles of quantum and condensed matter physics. Our approach views medical images as amorphous structures akin to those found in condensed matter physics and we propose an algorithm that incorporates the concept of mode resolved localization directly into the denoising process. Notably, our approach eliminates the need for hyperparameter tuning. The proposed method is a standalone algorithm with minimal manual intervention, demonstrating its potential to use quantum-based techniques in classical signal denoising. Through numerical validation, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in addressing noise-related challenges in imaging and especially medical imaging, underscoring its relevance for possible quantum computing applications.</description>
