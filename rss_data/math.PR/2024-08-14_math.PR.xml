      <title>Analysis of Clustering and Degree Index in Random Graphs and Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the degree index and clustering index in random graphs. The degree index in our setup is a certain measure of degree irregularity whose basic properties are well studied in the literature, and the corresponding theoretical analysis in a random graph setup turns out to be tractable. On the other hand, the clustering index, based on a similar reasoning, is first introduced in this manuscript. Computing exact expressions for the expected clustering index turns out to be more challenging even in the case of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, and our results are on obtaining relevant upper bounds. These are also complemented with observations based on Monte Carlo simulations. Besides the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi case, we also do simulation-based analysis for random regular graphs, the Barab\'asi-Albert model and the Watts-Strogatz model.</description>

      <title>Cross Modality of the Extended Binomial Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a family of probability functions (or a probability kernel), cross modality occurs when every likelihood maximum matches a mode of the distribution. This implies existence of simultaneous maxima on the modal ridge of the family. The paper explores the property for extended Bernoulli sums, which are random variables representable as a sum of independent Poisson and any number (finite or infinite) of Bernoulli random variables with variable success probabilities. We show that the cross modality holds for many subfamilies of the class, including power series distributions derived from entire functions with totally positive series expansion. A central role in the study is played by the extended Darroch's rule \cite{Darroch, Pitman}, which originally localised the mode of Poisson-binomial distribution in terms of the mean. We give different proofs and geometric interpretation to the extended rule and point at other modal properties of extended Bernoulli sums, in particular discuss stability of the mode in the context of a transport problem.</description>

      <title>A random walk on the category of finite abelian $p$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an irreducible Markov chain on the category of finite abelian $p$-groups, whose stationary measure is the Cohen-Lenstra distribution. This Markov chain arises when one studies the cokernel of a random matrix $M$, after conditioning on a submatrix of $M$. We show two surprising facts about this Markov chain. Firstly, it is reversible. Hence, one may regard it is a random walk on finite abelian $p$-groups. The proof of reversibility also explains the appearance of the Cohen-Lenstra distribution in the context of random matrices. Secondly, we can explicitly determine the spectrum of the infinite transition matrix associated to this Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Stationary Distribution of open Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes on an Interval as a marginal of a two-layer ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on an interval with open boundaries. We provide a representation for its stationary distribution as a marginal of the top layer of a two-layer ensemble under Liggett's condition. The representation is valid in the fan region and in the shock region, extending the representation previously obtained in [Bryc-Zatitskii-2024 arXiv:2403.03275] to ASEP. We also give a recursion for the two-layer weight function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_{k,n}$ be a group of permutations of $kn$ objects which permutes things independently in disjoint blocks of size $k$ and then permutes the blocks. We investigate the probabilistic and/or enumerative aspects of random elements of $G_{k,n}$. This includes novel limit theorems for fixed points, cycles of various lengths, number of cycles and inversions. The limits are compound Poisson distributions with interesting dependence structure.</description>

      <title>Stunned by Sleeping Beauty: How Prince Probability updates his forecast upon their fateful encounter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sleeping Beauty problem is a puzzle in probability theory that has gained much attention since Elga's discussion of it [Elga, Adam, Analysis 60 (2), p.143-147 (2000)]. Sleeping Beauty is put asleep, and a coin is tossed. If the outcome of the coin toss is Tails, Sleeping Beauty is woken up on Monday, put asleep again and woken up again on Tuesday (with no recollection of having woken up on Monday). If the outcome is Heads, Sleeping Beauty is woken up on Monday only. Each time Sleeping Beauty is woken up, she is asked what her belief is that the outcome was Heads. What should Sleeping Beauty reply? In literature arguments have been given for both 1/3 and 1/2 as the correct answer. In this short note we argue using simple Bayesian probability theory why 1/3 is the right answer, and not 1/2. Briefly, when Sleeping Beauty awakens, her being awake is nontrivial extra information that leads her to update her beliefs about Heads to 1/3. We strengthen our claim by considering an additional observer, Prince Probability, who may or may not meet Sleeping Beauty. If he meets Sleeping Beauty while she is awake, he lowers his credence in Heads to 1/3. We also briefly consider the credence in Heads of a Sleeping Beauty who knows that she is dreaming (and thus asleep).</description>

      <title>A Functional Central Limit Theorem for the General Brownian Motion on the Half-Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a Trotter-Kato type theorem. More precisely, we characterize the convergence in distribution of Feller processes by examining the convergence of their generators. The main novelty lies in providing quantitative estimates in the vague topology at any fixed time. As important applications, we deduce functional central limit theorems for random walks on the positive integers with boundary conditions, which converge to Brownian motions on the positive half-line with boundary conditions at zero.</description>

      <title>The averaging process on infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the averaging process on an infinite connected graph with bounded degree and independent, identically distributed starting values or initial opinions. Assuming that the law of the initial opinion of a vertex has a finite second moment, we show that the opinions of all vertices converge in $L^2$ to the first moment of the law of the initial opinions. A key tool in the proof is the Sharing a drink procedure introduced by Olle H\"aggstr\"om.</description>

In particular, this complements earlier recurrence results obtained by Gracar et al. (Electron. J. Probab. 27 (2022)) and a transience criterion derived by the author (Probab.

      <description>arXiv:2408.06978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new version of the stochastic sewing lemma, capable of handling multiple discontinuous control functions. This is then used to develop a theory of rough stochastic analysis in a c\`adl\`ag setting. In particular, we define rough stochastic integration and establish solutions to rough stochastic differential equations with jump discontinuities in both sources of noise, along with an It\^o formula for stochastic controlled paths with jumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Activated Random Walk model on the one-dimensional ring, in the high density regime. We develop a toppling procedure that gradually builds an environment that can be used to show that activity will be sustained for a long time. This yields a self-contained and relatively short proof of existence of a slow phase for arbitrarily large sleep rates.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional optimization for multi-spiked tensor PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of two local optimization algorithms, online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and gradient flow, within the framework of the multi-spiked tensor model in the high-dimensional regime. This multi-index model arises from the tensor principal component analysis (PCA) problem, which aims to infer $r$ unknown, orthogonal signal vectors within the $N$-dimensional unit sphere through maximum likelihood estimation from noisy observations of an order-$p$ tensor. We determine the number of samples and the conditions on the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) required to efficiently recover the unknown spikes from natural initializations. Specifically, we distinguish between three types of recovery: exact recovery of each spike, recovery of a permutation of all spikes, and recovery of the correct subspace spanned by the signal vectors. We show that with online SGD, it is possible to recover all spikes provided a number of sample scaling as $N^{p-2}$, aligning with the computational threshold identified in the rank-one tensor PCA problem [Ben Arous, Gheissari, Jagannath 2020, 2021]. For gradient flow, we show that the algorithmic threshold to efficiently recover the first spike is also of order $N^{p-2}$. However, recovering the subsequent directions requires the number of samples to scale as $N^{p-1}$. Our results are obtained through a detailed analysis of a low-dimensional system that describes the evolution of the correlations between the estimators and the spikes. In particular, the hidden vectors are recovered one by one according to a sequential elimination phenomenon: as one correlation exceeds a critical threshold, all correlations sharing a row or column index decrease and become negligible, allowing the subsequent correlation to grow and become macroscopic. The sequence in which correlations become macroscopic depends on their initial values and on the associated SNRs.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multilevel Stochastic Approximation of the Value-at-Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cr\'epey, Frikha, and Louzi (2023) introduced a multilevel stochastic approximation scheme to compute the value-at-risk of a financial loss that is only simulatable by Monte Carlo. The optimal complexity of the scheme is in $O({\varepsilon}^{-5/2})$, ${\varepsilon} &gt; 0$ being a prescribed accuracy, which is suboptimal when compared to the canonical multilevel Monte Carlo performance. This suboptimality stems from the discontinuity of the Heaviside function involved in the biased stochastic gradient that is recursively evaluated to derive the value-at-risk. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes and analyzes a multilevel stochastic approximation algorithm that adaptively selects the number of inner samples at each level, and proves that its optimal complexity is in $O({\varepsilon}^{-2}|\ln {\varepsilon}|^{5/2})$. Our theoretical analysis is exemplified through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient variance-based reliability sensitivity analysis for Monte Carlo methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a Monte Carlo based approach for the quantification of the importance of the scattering input parameters with respect to the failure probability is presented. Using the basic idea of the alpha-factors of the First Order Reliability Method, this approach was developed to analyze correlated input variables as well as arbitrary marginal parameter distributions. Based on an efficient transformation scheme using the importance sampling principle, only a single analysis run by a plain or variance-reduced Monte Carlo method is required to give a sufficient estimate of the introduced parameter sensitivities. Several application examples are presented and discussed in the paper.</description>

      <title>Estimation of material parameter uncertainties using probabilistic and interval approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the calibration of material models, often the numerical results of a simulation model $y$ are compared with the experimental measurements $y^*$. Usually, the differences between measurements and simulation are minimized using least squares approaches including global and local optimization techniques. In this paper, the resulting scatter or uncertainty of the identified material parameters p are investigated by assuming the measurement curves as non-deterministic. Based on classical probabilistic approaches as the Markov estimator or the Bayesian updating procedure, the scatter of the identified parameters can be estimated as a multi-variate probability density function. Both procedures require a sufficient accurate knowledge or estimate of the scatter of the measurement points, often modeled by a Gaussian covariance matrix. In this paper, we present a different idea by assuming the scatter of the measurements not as correlated random numbers but just as individual intervals with known minimum and maximum values. The corresponding possible minimum and maximum values for each input parameter can be obtained for this assumption using a constrained optimization approach. However, the identification of the whole possible parameter domain for the given measurement bounds is not straight forward. Therefore, we introduce an efficient line-search method, where not only the bounds itself but also the shape of the feasible parameter domain can be identified. This enables the quantification of the interaction and the uniqueness of the input parameters. As a numerical example, we identify the fracture parameters of plain concrete with respect to a wedge splitting test, where five unknown material parameters could be identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a conceptually simple covering technique has surprisingly rich applications to density theorems and conjectures on patterns in sets involving set differences. These applications fall into three categories: (i) analogues of these statements to distance $2$ versions of the pattern, (ii) reduction of these statements to relative versions, and (iii) reductions of these statements to a quasirandom case with respect to some quantities that affect the number of realisations of the pattern.</description>

      <title>On the Lottery Problem: Tracing Stefan Mandel's Combinatorial Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stephan Mandel is the man who won the lottery 14 times. He never disclosed the recipe he called combinatorial condensation, which enabled him to hit the Romanian lottery jackpot in the early phase of his betting career. Combinatorial condensation is frequently mixed up with another strategy known as buying the pot, which Stefan Mandel was pursuing later on. On occasion, he dropped a few hints on combinatorial condensation. The hints are applied in this work to narrow down and assess his initial recipe. The underlying theory resembles what a weekend mathematician, as he once referred to himself, may have encountered in the 1960s. Calculations indicate that he took residual risks that his method might fail. Residual risks explain why he changed his strategy from combinatorial condensation to buying the pot. The cardinality of the (15, 6, 6, 5)- and the (49, 6, 6, 5)-lottery scheme shows that Stefan Mandel probably wasn't aware of lottery designs. First concepts on such topics had been available at that time, but coherent theories on combinatorial designs took off only in later decades, triggered by growing computing power, and eventually triggered by Stefan Mandel's publicity and successes in the field. But, as the comparison with actual covering designs reveals, Stefan Mandel probably constructed a (15, 6, 5)-covering design years before others published about it, which he applied in the Romanian lottery.</description>

      <title>Extended mean field control problems with constraints: The generalized Fritz-John conditions and Lagrangian method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the extended mean field control problems under dynamic expectation constraints and/or dynamic state-control constraints. We aim to pioneer the establishment of the stochastic maximum principle (SMP) and the derivation of the backward SDE (BSDE) from the perspective of the constrained optimization using the method of Lagrangian multipliers. To this end, we first propose to embed the constrained extended mean-field control (C-(E)MFC) problems into some abstract optimization problems with constraints on Banach spaces, for which we develop the generalized Fritz-John (FJ) optimality conditions. We then prove the stochastic maximum principle (SMP) for C-(E)MFC problems by transforming the FJ type conditions into an equivalent stochastic first-order condition associated with a general type of constrained forward-backward SDEs (FBSDEs). Contrary to the existing literature, we recast the controlled Mckean-Vlasov SDE as an infinite-dimensional equality constraint such that the BSDE induced by the FJ first-order optimality condition can be interpreted as the generalized Lagrange multiplier to cope with the SDE constraint. Finally, we also present the SMP for constrained stochastic control problems and constrained mean field game problems as consequences of our main result for C-(E)MFC problems.</description>

Abstract: We establish a simultaneous generalization of It\^o's theory of stochastic and Lyons' theory of rough differential equations. The interest in such a unification comes from a variety of applications, including pathwise stochastic filtering, - control and the conditional analysis of stochastic systems with common noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the bicausal optimal transport problem between the laws of scalar time-homogeneous stochastic differential equations, and we establish the optimality of the synchronous coupling between these laws. The proof of this result is based on time-discretisation and reveals a novel connection between the synchronous coupling and the celebrated discrete-time Knothe--Rosenblatt rearrangement. We also prove a result on equality of topologies restricted to a certain subset of laws of continuous-time processes. We complement our main results with examples showing how the optimal coupling may change in path-dependent and multidimensional settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the well-posed character of a regularity structure formulation of the quasilinear generalized (KPZ) equation and give an explicit form for a renormalized equation in the full subcritical regime. Under the assumption that the BPHZ models associated with a non-translation invariant operator converge, we obtain a convergence result for the solutions of the regularized renormalized equations. This conditional result covers the spacetime white noise case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The area of fractional calculus has made its way into various pure and applied scientific fields, as evidenced by its integration into numerous disciplines. An increasing number of researchers are exploring various approaches to incorporating fractional calculus into stochastic analysis. In this paper, we generalise the Wiener chaos expansion by constructing a fractional Wiener chaos expansion based on the parabolic cylinder function with an exponential factor. In the process, we demonstrate that this parabolic cylinder function with an exponential factor, which we call "a power normalised parabolic cylinder function" acts as an extension of a Hermite polynomial and retains the same martingale properties inherent in the Hermite polynomial, as well as other basic properties of Hermite polynomials. Hence, it is accurate to state that power normalised cylindrical functions can be viewed as fractional versions of Hermite polynomials.</description>

Abstract: The convergence rate in Wasserstein distance is estimated for empirical measures of ergodic Markov processes, and the estimate can be sharp in some specific situations.
  The main result is applied to subordinations of typical models excluded by existing results, which include: stochastic Hamiltonian systems on $\mathbb R^{n}\times \mathbb R^{m}$, spherical velocity Langevin processes on $\mathbb R^n\times\mathbb S^{n-1},$ multi-dimensional Wright-Fisher type diffusion processes, and stable type jump processes.</description>

      <title>Operator formalism for discretely holomorphic parafermions of the two-color Ashkin-Teller, loop $\mathrm{O} ( 1 )$, staggered eight-vertex, odd eight-vertex, and abelian sandpile models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend an operator formalism, developed by Hongler, Kyt\"ol\"a, and Zahabi in 2012 for the Ising model, to the Ashkin-Teller and loop $\mathrm{O} ( n ) $ models. The formalism is primarily dependent upon notions of massive, and massless, s-holomorphicity of the Ising model, which are respectively satisfied at, and below, the critical temperature, hence allowing for rigorous analyses of the transfer matrix, correlation functions, and lattice fermion operators. From results of another paper, by Tanhayi-Ahari and Rouhani in 2012, which demonstrates that parafermionic observables for the staggered eight-vertex model coincide with those of the Ashkin-Teller model, as well as a 2003 paper, by Wu and Kunz, which establishes a correspondence between the staggered eight-vertex and odd eight-vertex models, we establish further associations.</description>

      <title>Mixed orthogonality graphs for continuous-time state space models and orthogonal projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive (local) orthogonality graphs for the popular continuous-time state space models, including in particular multivariate continuous-time ARMA (MCARMA) processes. In these (local) orthogonality graphs, vertices represent the components of the process, directed edges between the vertices indicate causal influences and undirected edges indicate contemporaneous correlations between the component processes. We present sufficient criteria for state space models to satisfy the assumptions of Fasen-Hartmann and Schenk (2024a) so that the (local) orthogonality graphs are well-defined and various Markov properties hold. Both directed and undirected edges in these graphs are characterised by orthogonal projections on well defined linear spaces. To compute these orthogonal projections, we use the unique controller canonical form of a state space model, which exists under mild assumptions, to recover the input process from the output process. We are then able to derive some alternative representations of the output process and its highest derivative. Finally, we apply these representations to calculate the necessary orthogonal projections, which culminate in the characterisations of the edges in the (local) orthogonality graph. These characterisations are given by the parameters of the controller canonical form and the covariance matrix of the driving L\'evy process.</description>

      <title>A large-scale particle system with independent jumps and distributed synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a system consisting of $n$ particles, moving forward in jumps on the real line. Each particle can make both independent jumps, whose sizes have some distribution, or ``synchronization'' jumps, which allow it to join a randomly chosen other particle if the latter happens to be ahead of it. System state is the empirical distribution of particle locations. The mean-field asymptotic regime, where $n\to\infty$, is considered. We prove that $v_n$, the steady-state speed of the particle system advance, converges, as $n\to\infty$, to a limit $v_{**}$ which can be easily found from a {\em minimum speed selection principle.} Also, as $n\to\infty$, we prove the convergence of the system dynamics to that of a deterministic mean-field limit (MFL). We show that the average speed of advance of any MFL is lower bounded by $v_{**}$, and the speed of a ``benchmark'' MFL, resulting from all particles initially co-located, is equal to $v_{**}$.
  In the special case of exponentially distributed independent jump sizes, we prove that a traveling wave MFL with speed $v$ exists if and only if $v\ge v_{**}$, with $v_{**}$ having simple explicit form; we also show the existence of traveling waves for the modified systems, with a left or right boundary moving at a constant speed $v$. Using these traveling wave existence results, we provide bounds on an MFL average speed of advance, depending on the right tail exponent of its initial state. We conjecture that these results for exponential jump sizes generalize to general jump sizes.</description>

Abstract: We consider the 2-spin spherical Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model without external magnetic field where the interactions between the spins are given as random variables with heavy-tailed distribution. We show that the free energy exhibits a sharp phase transition depending on the location of the largest eigenvalue of the interaction matrix. We also prove the order of the limiting free energy and the limiting distribution of the fluctuation of the free energy for both regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the convergence of the densities of a sequence of nonlinear functionals of an underlying Gaussian process to the density of a Gamma distribution. The key idea of our work is a new density formula for random variables in the setting of Markov diffusion generators, which yields a special representation for the density of a Gamma distribution. Via this representation, we are able to provide precise estimates on the distance between densities while developing the techniques of Malliavin calculus and Stein's method suitable to Gamma approximation at the density level. We first focus our study on the case of random variables living in a fixed Wiener chaos of an even order for which the bound for the difference of the densities can be dominated by a linear combination of moments up to order four. We then study the case of general Gaussian functionals with possibly infinite chaos expansion. Finally, we provide two applications of our results, namely the limit of random variables living in the second Wiener chaos, and the limit of sums of independent Pareto distributed random variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The matrix Markov inequality by Ahlswede was stated using the Loewner anti-order between positive definite matrices. Wang use this to derive several other Chebyshev and Chernoff-type inequalities (Hoeffding, Bernstein, empirical Bernstein) in the Loewner anti-order, including self-normalized matrix martingale inequalities. These imply upper tail bounds on the maximum eigenvalue, such as those developed by Tropp and howard et al. The current paper develops analogs of all these inequalities in the Loewner order, rather than anti-order, by deriving a new matrix Markov inequality. These yield upper tail bounds on the minimum eigenvalue that are a factor of d tighter than the above bounds on the maximum eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>The Principle of Optimality in Dynamic Programming: A Pedagogical Note</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08467v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The principle of optimality is a fundamental aspect of dynamic programming, which states that the optimal solution to a dynamic optimization problem can be found by combining the optimal solutions to its sub-problems. While this principle is generally applicable, it is often only taught for problems with finite or countable state spaces in order to sidestep measure-theoretic complexities. Therefore, it cannot be applied to classic models such as inventory management and dynamic pricing models that have continuous state spaces, and students may not be aware of the possible challenges involved in studying dynamic programming models with general state spaces. To address this, we provide conditions and a self-contained simple proof that establish when the principle of optimality for discounted dynamic programming is valid. These conditions shed light on the difficulties that may arise in the general state space case. We provide examples from the literature that include the relatively involved case of universally measurable dynamic programming and the simple case of finite dynamic programming where our main result can be applied to show that the principle of optimality holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12950v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the spectral method for proving limit theorems to random non-uniformly expanding dynamical systems. This yields the CLT and moderate deviations principles (MDP). We show that as the amount of non-uniformity decreases the CLT rates and the speed in the MDP become closer to the optimal ones. For smooth systems the rates are effective. Compared to recent progress on the subject [34] we are able to consider much more general maps, Gibbs measures and observables. However, our main results are new even in the setup of [34].</description>

Abstract: Define the map $\mathsf{T}$ on the positive integers by $\mathsf{T}(m)=\frac{m}{2}$ if $m$ is even and by $\mathsf{T}(m)=\frac{3m+1}{2}$ if $m$ is odd. Results of Terras and Everett imply that, given any $\epsilon&gt;0$, almost all $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ (in the sense of natural density) fulfill $(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^km^{1-\epsilon}\leq \mathsf{T}^k(m)\leq (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^km^{1+\epsilon}$ simultaneously for all $0\leq k\leq \alpha\log m$ with $\alpha=(\log 2)^{-1}\approx 1.443$. We extend this result to $\alpha=2(\log\frac{4}{3})^{-1}\approx 6.952$, which is the maximally possible value. Set $\mathsf{T}_{\min}(m):=\min_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathsf{T}^n(m)$. As an immediate consequence, one has $\mathsf{T}_{\min}(m)\leq\mathsf{T}^{\left\lfloor2(\log\frac{4}{3})^{-1}\log m\right\rfloor}(m)\leq m^{\epsilon}$ for almost all $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ for any given $\epsilon&gt;0$. Previously, Korec has shown that $\mathsf{T}_{\min}(m)\leq m^\epsilon$ for almost all $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ if $\epsilon&gt;\frac{\log3}{\log4}$, and recently Tao proved that $\mathsf{T}_{\min}(m)\leq f(m)$ for almost all $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ (in the sense of logarithmic density) for all functions $f$ diverging to $\infty$. Denote by $\tau(m)$ the minimal $n\in\mathbb{N}$ for which $\mathsf{T}^n(m)=1$ if there exists such an $n$ and set $\tau(m)=\infty$ otherwise. As another application, we show that $\liminf_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{x\log x}\sum_{m=1}^{\lfloor x\rfloor}\tau(m)\geq 2(\log\frac{4}{3})^{-1}$, partially answering a question of Crandall and Shanks. Under the assumption that the Collatz Conjecture is true in the strong sense that $\tau(m)$ is in $O(\log m)$, we show that $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{x\log x}\sum_{m=1}^{\lfloor x\rfloor}\tau(m)= 2(\log\frac{4}{3})^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the initial-boundary value problem for the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Baryakhtar (SLLBar) equation with Stratonovich-type noise in bounded domains $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=1,2,3$. Our main results can be briefly described as follows: (1) for $d=1,2,3$ and any $\mathbf{u}_0\in\mathbb{H}^1$, the SLLBar equation admits a unique local-in-time pathwise weak solution; (2) for $d=1$ and small-data $\mathbf{u}_0\in\mathbb{H}^1$, the SLLBar equation has a unique global-in-time pathwise weak solution and at least one invariant measure; (3) for $d=1,2$ and small-data $\mathbf{u}_0\in\mathbb{L}^2$, the SLLBar equation possesses a unique global-in-time pathwise very weak solution and at least one invariant measure, while for $d=3$ only the existence of martingale solution is obtained due to the loss of pathwise uniqueness.</description>
