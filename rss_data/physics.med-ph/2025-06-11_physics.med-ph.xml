      <title>A Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework for Generalizable CBCT to Synthetic CT Translation in Head and Neck</title>

Abstract: Shortened Abstract
  Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become a widely adopted modality for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). However, CBCT suffers from increased noise, limited soft-tissue contrast, and artifacts, resulting in unreliable Hounsfield unit values and hindering direct dose calculation. Synthetic CT (sCT) generation from CBCT addresses these issues, especially using deep learning (DL) methods. Existing approaches are limited by institutional heterogeneity, scanner-dependent variations, and data privacy regulations that prevent multi-center data sharing.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a cross-silo horizontal federated learning (FL) approach for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis in the head and neck region, extending our FedSynthCT framework. A conditional generative adversarial network was collaboratively trained on data from three European medical centers in the public SynthRAD2025 challenge dataset.
  The federated model demonstrated effective generalization across centers, with mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from $64.38\pm13.63$ to $85.90\pm7.10$ HU, structural similarity index (SSIM) from $0.882\pm0.022$ to $0.922\pm0.039$, and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) from $32.86\pm0.94$ to $34.91\pm1.04$ dB. Notably, on an external validation dataset of 60 patients, comparable performance was achieved (MAE: $75.22\pm11.81$ HU, SSIM: $0.904\pm0.034$, PSNR: $33.52\pm2.06$ dB) without additional training, confirming robust generalization despite protocol, scanner differences and registration errors.
  These findings demonstrate the technical feasibility of FL for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis while preserving data privacy and offer a collaborative solution for developing generalizable models across institutions without centralized data sharing or site-specific fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Correlation Between DNA Double-Strand Break Distribution in 3D Genome and Radiation-Induced Cell Death</title>

Abstract: The target theory is the most classical hypothesis explaining radiation-induced cell death, the physical or biological nature of the "target" remains ambiguous. This study hypothesizes that the distribution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the 3D genome is a pivotal factor affecting the probability of radiation-induced cell death. We propose that clustered DSBs in DNA segments with high interaction frequencies are more susceptible to leading to cell death than isolated DSBs. Topologically associating domains (TAD) can be regarded as the reference unit for evaluating the impact of DSB clustering in the 3D genome. To quantify this correlation between the DSB distribution in 3D genome and radiation-induced effect, we developed a simplified model considering the DSB distribution across TADs. Utilizing track-structure Monte Carlo codes to simulate the electron and carbon ion irradiation, we calculated the incidence of each case across a variety of radiation doses and LETs. Our simulation results indicate that DSBs in TADs with frequent interactions (case 3) are significantly more likely to induce cell death than clustered DSBs within a single TAD (case 2). Moreover, case 2 is significantly more likely to induce cell death than isolated DSBs (case 1). The curves of the incidence of case 2 and case 3 versus LETs have a similar shape to the radiation quality factor used in radiation protection. This indicates that these two cases are also associated with the stochastic effects induced by high LET irradiation. Our study underscores the significance of the 3D genome structure in the fundamental mechanisms of radiobiological effects. The hypothesis in our research offers novel perspectives on the mechanisms that regulate radiobiological effects. Moreover, it serves as a valuable reference for establishing mechanistic models that can predict cell survival under different doses and LETs.</description>
