      <title>The rationality of radical pair mechanism in real biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radical pair mechanism (RPM) in the chemical magnetic compass model is considered to be one of the most promising candidates for the avian magnetic navigation, and quantum needle phenomenon further boosts the navigation precision to a new high level. It is well known that there are also a variety of methods in the field of magnetic field sensing in laboratory, e.g. Ramsey protocol of NV centers in diamond. Here, we compare the RPM model and Ramsey-like model under laboratory conditions and under in vivo conditions respectively. The results are both surprising and reasonable. Under laboratory conditions, if we have precise control over time and a reasonably accurate prior knowledge of the magnetic field direction, the Ramsey-like model will outperform the RPM model. However, when such information is unavailable, as under in vivo conditions, the RPM model stands out. The RPM model achieves greater practicality at the cost of reduced accuracy.</description>

      <title>Information-Thermodynamic Bounds on Planetary Biosphere Productivity and Their Observational Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The productivity of a planetary biosphere is limited by how its free-energy budget is partitioned between maintaining a habitable environment, driving metabolism, and processing heritable information. We derive an upper bound on net primary productivity (NPP) from non-equilibrium thermodynamics and information theory, given a planet's usable free-energy flux and a few coarse-grained biological parameters. The bound subtracts an irreducible power cost of heritable information processing -- set by global template-copying rates, copying fidelity, alphabet size, and proofreading work -- from the planetary power budget before converting the remainder into biomass. This yields an ``information-productivity trade-off'': at fixed planetary power, higher copying rates, lower error rates, larger alphabets, or more intensive proofreading all lower the ceiling on biomass production. Using conservative parameter choices, we show that Earth lies well below this ceiling, whereas low-flux environments such as M-dwarf habitable zones and subsurface ocean worlds can be driven into an information-limited regime where only modest combinations of productivity and heritable complexity are attainable. We outline how future exoplanet observations of stellar irradiation, climate, atmospheric disequilibria, and temporal variability could be used to place physics-based upper limits on NPP and compare them with independent productivity estimates.</description>

      <title>Protocol to evaluate the viscoelastic response of a polymer suspension to an active agent via oscillatory shear rheometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microorganisms inhabit viscoelastic environments, where their locomotion can deform polymers and trigger local complex viscoelastic responses. However, a systematic approach to quantify such responses remains lacking. Here, we propose a protocol that maps the shear effect induced by an active agent to oscillatory shear rheometry. The central idea is to establish a correspondence between the mean shear rate generated by swimming and that produced by an oscillating plate. In this mapping, the swimming velocity and active stress are translated into an effective oscillation frequency and strain amplitude. The resulting viscoelastic response can then be evaluated by standard oscillatory rheometry. The protocol is validated using lattice Boltzmann simulations of a squirmer embedded in polymer solutions. Our framework is generic and can be naturally extended to active microrheology, providing a pathway to quantify swimmer-induced viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Alterations of brain tissue structural complexity and disorder in Parkinson disease (PD): Fractal, multifractal, fractal transformation, and disorder strength analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinson disease (PD) is marked by progressive neurodegeneration, yet early and subtle structural alterations in brain tissue remain difficult to detect with conventional imaging and analytical methods. Fractal and multifractal frameworks offer a principled way to quantify complex biological architecture, but their diagnostic utility in PD has been largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the fractal and multifractal characteristics of human brain tissues to identify structural alterations associated with PD. Alongside conventional fractal and multifractal analysis, we employed a recently developed fractal functional distribution method that transforms distributions into a Gaussian form, thereby enhancing quantification. Using this combined approach, we found notable deviations across multiple distribution metrics in PD samples, offering potential for quantitative staging and diagnostic applications. The multifractal analysis revealed threshold-dependent variations in intensity-based measures, which are linked to the sparsity and heterogeneity of neural tissue and suggestive of potential biomarker value. Additionally, we applied inverse participation ratio (IPR) analysis to assess structural disorder, demonstrating that larger IPR pixel sizes correlate with increased structural complexity during disease progression. These complementary analyses outline a multi-layered quantitative profile of PD-related tissue disruption, offering a foundation for earlier, objective assessment of disease-associated microstructural change.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Pre-trained Neural Network Models for the Classification of Tumor Cells Analyzed by Label-free Phase Holotomographic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can a single label-free image reveal whether cancer cells were exposed to chemotherapy? We present an innovative methodology on the label-free and high-resolution imaging properties of phase holotomographic microscopy coupled with neural network models for the classification of cancer cells. Using 3D phase holotomographic microscopy, we imaged live A549 lung cancer cells with and without paclitaxel, converted stacks to 2D maximum-intensity projections, and evaluated pre-trained convolutional networks (VGG16, ResNet18, DenseNet121, and EfficientNet-B0) for binary classification of treatment status. EfficientNet-B0 achieved 96.9 % accuracy on unsegmented images. Refractive index analysis revealed bimodal distribution in treated cells, reflecting heterogeneous biophysical responses to paclitaxel exposure and supporting the network's ability to detect subtle, label-free indicators of drug action. As further proof-of-concept, the same pipeline separated holotomographic images of label-free, high versus low-graded urothelial cancer cells with high accuracy (90.6 %). These findings highlight the potential of integrating label-free holotomographic imaging with deep learning techniques for rapid and efficient classification of tumor cells, paving the way for advancements in treatment optimization and personalized diagnostic strategies.</description>

      <title>Alterations of brain tissue structural complexity and disorder in Alzheimer's disease (AD): Fractal, multifractal, fractal transformation, and disorder strength analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive microstructural deterioration in brain tissue, yet conventional imaging and histopathology often lack the sensitivity needed to detect subtle early-stage changes. Here, we present a multiparametric framework combining fractal and multifractal analysis and their distributions to quantify structural alterations in human brain tissue affected by AD. Moreover, from the fractal and multifractal formalism, we introduced an innovative fractal functional distribution method, a novel technique that transforms fractal distribution into a Gaussian form. Statistically, these distribution parameters are easy to interpret and can distinguish between control and diseased tissues. Across samples, we identify pronounced threshold-dependent behavior of fractal and multifractal parameters, reflecting the intrinsic sparsity and heterogeneous intensity landscape of brain tissue. These threshold-sensitive signatures provide a framework for quantitative stage detection and may serve as biomarkers for early pathological transitions. In addition, we studied structural disorder and complexity using our established light localization technique, inverse participation ratio (IPR) analysis. IPR-based analysis demonstrates that increasing IPR pixel size highlights the elevation of structural alterations with disease progression. Together, these integrative analyses establish a robust, multi-scale quantitative framework for detecting microstructural alterations in AD, providing a promising foundation for early diagnosis and improved pathological assessment.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Characterization of Brain Tissue Alterations in Brain Cancer Using Fractal, Multifractal, and IPR Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the structural alterations between healthy and diseased brain tissues using a multiparametric framework combining fractal analysis, fractal functional transformation, multifractal analysis, and the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) analysis. Accurate characterization of brain tissue microstructure is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of cancer. By applying box-counting methods on brightfield microscopy images, we estimated the fractal dimension (Df) and its logarithmic (ln(Df)) and functional (ln(Dtf)) forms to highlight spatial irregularities in the tissue architecture. While Df and ln(Df) exhibited long-tailed distributions distinguishing healthy from cancer tissues, ln(Dtf) provided significantly improved differentiation by emphasizing local structural variations. Additionally, multifractal analysis revealed broader f({\alpha}) vs {\alpha} curves in cancerous samples, reflecting higher heterogeneity. IPR analysis based on light localization further demonstrated increased nanoscale variations in mass density, reflecting higher structural disorder in cancer tissues. Combining these complementary approaches creates a robust framework for measuring tissue complexity and holds great potential to improve microscopic diagnostic methods for brain cancer detection.</description>

      <title>Single-cell identification with quantum-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identification of individual cells within heterogeneous populations is essential for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Conventional labeling-based sorting methods, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting and magnetic-activated cell sorting, enable precise sorting when reliable markers are available. However, their applicability is limited in cells lacking defined markers or sensitive to labeling, as labeling can compromise cellular viability and function. We present a single-cell identification approach using quantum-enhanced NMR with diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers for label-free detection of intracellular proton ($^1$H) signals. Using this method, we distinguish two human tumor cell lines by their proton spin-lattice ($T_1$) relaxation times, which serve as a cell-intrinsic physicochemical signature. It lays the groundwork for label-free sorting applications in rare cell analysis, personalized medicine, and single-cell diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A novel multiscale modelling for the hemodynamics in retinal microcirculation with an analytic solution for the capillary-tissue coupled system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling of the microcirculatory hemodynamics in the retina is an essential tool for understanding various diseases of the retina, yet remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of the retinal vasculature and its coupling to surrounding tissue. To address this, we develop a multiscale model that couples retinal vasculature across scales with interstitial tissue. Our model combines the one-dimensional (1D) model for arteries and veins with the coupled Darcy equations for capillaries and tissue. The model uses an analytic solution for capillary-tissue coupled system that provides a simple interpretation of the results along with much faster computation. The analytic solution implies a dynamic coupling condition that links the capillary bed with upstream arterial and downstream venous flows. The model is mathematically robust, demonstrated through analysis of the solution's truncation error and convergence. Its predictive accuracy is verified against experimental data and other models, making it useful in interpreting experimental results. Finally, the role of various parameters in controlling retinal hemodynamics is explored.</description>

      <title>First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (sDCs). In this study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of non-zero sDCs. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, particles will eventually reach the boundary with probability one, and that diffusion with a sDC exhibits higher transport efficiency in an early arrival of particles at the boundary than would be expected under diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average (EA) of the sDC. When particles begin to reach an absorbing boundary before the change in a sDC occurs, diffusion with a sDC with a larger supremum exhibits a more efficient transport in an early arrival of particles at the boundary even if the EAs of sDCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, the mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach an absorbing boundary, higher transport efficiency in an early arrival at the boundary almost disappears and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the L\'evy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the EA and the convergence speed is determined by the time scale of fluctuations in the DC. We finally discuss the similarities and differences of FPT properties between three-dimensional diffusion outside a spherical absorbing boundary and the one-dimensional diffusion. Our results indicate that fluctuations in DCs may need to be non-Markov and/or non-ergodic to allow efficient transport of particles to distant targets. Our results also suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role, for example, in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.</description>

      <title>Charge Regulation Effect on Nanoparticles Interaction Mediated by Polyelectrolyte</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to precisely control surface charge using charged polymers is fundamental to many nanotechnology applications, enabling the design and fabrication of materials with tailored properties and functionalities. Here, we study the effect of charge regulation (CR) on the interaction between two nanoparticles (NPs) mediated by an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (PE) in an electrolyte solution. To this end, we employ a hybrid CR Monte Carlo / molecular dynamics simulation framework to systematically explore the effects of pH, salt concentration, and polymer chain length on NP surface charge behavior. For comparison, we also conduct molecular simulations under constant charge (CC) conditions. Our results reveal that CR enhances PE adsorption onto NP surfaces compared to the CC case, where polymer bridging dominates across a wide range of NP intersurface separations. This enhanced adsorption under CR leads to a weak net repulsion driven by osmotic forces. In contrast, the CC model yields a stronger net attraction due to the bridging force. Furthermore, we find that the CR effects are more pronounced at low salt concentration, whereas at high salt concentration, counterion screening dominates in both CR and CC cases, diminishing the CR effect. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating charge regulation in characterizing nanoparticle interactions within a complex biochemical environment, particularly in low salt concentrations.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Variability Alters Macroscopic Rotation Speed in Stochastic Spiral Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general theory for noise-induced corrections to the angular velocity of spiral waves. Stochasticity produces two second-order effects: an instantaneous term from heterogeneity that always slows rotation, and an orbital-drift term from temporal fluctuations that can either accelerate or decelerate it. For our parameters, orbital drift is weaker, producing a net slowdown. Analytical predictions match Barkley-model simulations with temporal noise. Examination of additional noise types in silico confirms angular velocity slowing. This mechanism provides a robust route by which stochasticity reshapes spiral dynamics in excitable media, with direct implications for arrhythmias and neural wave propagation.</description>
