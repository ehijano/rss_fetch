      <title>Cyclotron reonance in a kagome spin liquid candidate material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose cyclotron resonance as an optical probe for emergent fractionalized excitations in $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids, focusing on kagome antiferromagnets. In contrast to conventional systems, where cyclotron resonance directly couples to charged carriers, spinons in spin liquids are charge-neutral and interact only through an emergent gauge field. We identify two key mechanisms by which an external physical electromagnetic field induces emergent electric and magnetic fields, enabling indirect coupling to spinons. Using these mechanisms, we compute the absorption rate of the cyclotron resonance response for Dirac spinons forming Landau levels. Our analysis shows that, although the absorption per layer is small, the absence of a skin-depth limitation in insulating spin liquids allows for cumulative absorption comparable to graphene in realistic sample sizes for the recently discovered spin-liquid candidate material YCu${}_3$(OH)${}_6$Br${}_2$[Br${}_{1-y}$(OH)${}_y$]. Our findings shows that cyclotron resonance is a viable experimental probe of spinon Landau quantization and emergent gauge fields, providing powerful positive experimental signatures of quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons-matter conformal field theory on fuzzy sphere: Confinement transition of Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge theories compose a large class of interacting conformal field theories in 3d, among which an outstanding category is critical Chern-Simons-matter theories. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances: one complex critical scalar coupled to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ Chern-Simons gauge field. It is theoretically interesting as it is conjectured to exhibit dualities between four simple Lagrangian descriptions, but also practically important as it describes the transition between Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (or $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state) and trivially gapped phase. Using the fuzzy sphere regularisation, we realise this theory as a transition on the spherical lowest Landau level between a $\nu_f=2$ fermionic integer quantum Hall state and a $\nu_b=1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that this transition is continuous and has emergent conformal symmetry. By studying the operator spectrum, we show that there exists only one relevant singlet with scaling dimension $\Delta_S=1.52(18)$. We also discuss other higher operators and the consequences of our results.</description>

      <title>Local Potential Functional Embedding Theory of Molecular Systems: Localized Orbital-Based Embedding from an Exact Density-Functional Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized orbital-based quantum embedding, as originally formulated in the context of density matrix embedding theory (DMET), is revisited from the perspective of lattice density functional theory (DFT). An in-principle exact (in the sense of full configuration interaction) formulation of the theory, where the occupations of the localized orbitals play the role of the density, is derived for any (model or ab initio) electronic Hamiltonian. From this general formalism we deduce an exact relation between the local Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the full-size Kohn-Sham (KS) lattice-like system and the embedding chemical potential that is adjusted on each embedded fragment, individually, such that both KS and embedding cluster systems reproduce the exact same local density. When well-identified density-functional approximations (that find their justification in the strongly correlated regime) are applied, a practical self-consistent local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET), where the local Hxc potential becomes the basic variable, naturally emerges from the theory. LPFET differs from previous density embedding approaches by its fragment-dependent embedding chemical potential expression, which is a simple functional of the Hxc potential. Numerical calculations on prototypical systems show the ability of such an ansatz to ease convergence and improve substantially the description of density profiles (localized orbital occupations in this context) in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupled Langevin dynamics for Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations are widely used to study spin dynamics in Mott insulators. However, because energy dissipation is typically introduced phenomenologically, its validity for describing nonequilibrium processes and long-time dynamics in real materials remains questionable. In this paper, we derive a generalized stochastic LLG equation from first principles for spin-orbital coupled Mott insulators, explicitly incorporating the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and lattice vibrations. Our approach is based on the path-integral formalism formulated along the Keldysh contour, which naturally accounts for dissipation and thermal fluctuations through interactions with a phonon bath and emergent stochastic noise. We benchmark our theoretical framework by numerically integrating the equations of motion for a two-orbital spin chain coupled to Einstein phonons. The resulting energy relaxation mimics realistic cooling dynamics, exhibits nontrivial transient behavior during thermalization, and accurately reproduces thermodynamic properties upon equilibration. This demonstrates the robustness and reliability of our formalism for capturing both equilibrium and nonequilibrium aspects of dissipative spin dynamics in strongly correlated systems. We further show how electron-phonon coupling induces hybridization between electronic and phononic modes in the excitation spectrum. Finally, we demonstrate how the conventional LLG equations can be recovered as a limiting case of our microscopic theory, and discuss their applicability to real materials.</description>

      <title>Spin-flop-like transition as quantum critical point in Cs$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report thermodynamic, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Cs$_2$RuO$_4$, a member of the celebrated family of frustrated magnets Cs$_2$MX$_4$ (M = Cu, Co, X = Br, Cl). Unlike the previously studied members, it is based on $4d$ transition metal ions with $S=1$. Mapping out the $H-T$ magnetic phase diagram reveals an unusual continuous spin-flop-like phase transition associated with a quantum critical point within the antiferromagnetically ordered phase. A quantitative analysis of the complex magnetic excitation spectrum measured in zero field allows us to derive a model magnetic Hamiltonian for this compound. Its main feature is a frustration of magnetic anisotropy on a level that is much higher than in any of the previously studied species. This frustration naturally explains the peculiar phase transition observed.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal quench dynamics of entanglement and quantum geometry in PT-symmetric non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the quench dynamics of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian systems by utilizing the biorthogonal formalism. We analyze quench dynamics of observable quantities, the quantum geometric tensor, and various entanglement quantities, including the entanglement entropy, the SVD entropy, and the Tu-Tzeng-Chang entropy. Our results show that a sudden quench into a PT-broken phase generally leads to exponential growth in these quantities, driven by the biorthogonal density matrix's non-positivity. In contrast to generic interacting systems, we observe a surprising linear decay in the TTC entropy for non-interacting fermionic systems. This finding originates from the approximate spectral symmetry of the biorthogonal reduced density matrix, and we confirm our findings using the Yang-Lee and non-Hermitian XXZ models.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Dynamics in a Quantum Spin Chain with Pump-Probe Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of the transverse field Ising chain (TFIC) using time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (tr-RIXS) in a pump-probe setup within a condensed matter setting. The tr-RIXS spectra reveal distinctive features, including two-kink continua at high energies and oscillatory spectral weight at low energies, both strongly influenced by the pump dynamics. By systematically analyzing the nonequilibrium tr-RIXS cross section under various pump configurations, we demonstrate how the spectra encode detailed information about the system's transient states, capturing instantaneous Hamiltonian parameters and the traversal of equilibrium quantum critical points during dynamic evolution. Notably, we uncover a one-to-one correspondence between oscillatory features in the low-energy spectra and dynamical quantum phase transitions, offering a novel and experimentally accessible approach for their detection. These findings highlight the versatility of tr-RIXS as a powerful tool for studying quantum systems far from equilibrium and their critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Variational study of the magnetization plateaus of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet and its implication on YCOB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations find that there are multiple plateaus in the magnetization curve of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model(KAFH) at fractional magnetization $m=1/9,1/3,5/9,7/9$. While it is well known that the $m=1/3,5/9,7/9$ plateau feature a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ valence bond crystal(VBC) ordering pattern with a David-star-shaped motif, the origin of the narrow plateau at $m=1/9$ remains elusive. Some researchers claim that a subtle translational symmetry breaking pattern with the same $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ periodicity occurs at the $m=1/9$ plateau. On the other hand, it has also been argued that the $m=1/9$ plateau may harbor a novel $Z_{3}$ chiral spin liquid phase. To resolve this controversy, we have proposed the most general variational ansatz based on the resonating valence bond(RVB) picture that is consistent with the spin symmetry of the system and developed a new algorithm to optimize such a complicated ansatz. We find that a peculiar VBC state with a $3\times3$ periodicity and a windmill-shaped motif has significantly lower energy than the claimed $Z_{3}$ chiral spin liquid state and other proposed VBC states around the $m=1/9$ plateau. We find that there are strong spatial modulation in the local magnetization at the $1/9$ plateau, so strong that even its polarization can be reversed. Our general RVB ansatz also well reproduces all other more conventional magnetization plateaus of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ KAFH. We find that the local magnetization is always strongly inhomogeneous below the saturating field for such a strongly frustrated quantum magnet.</description>

      <title>Third-order strong-coupling impurity solver for real-frequency DMFT: Accurate spectral functions for antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a real-frequency third-order strong-coupling impurity solver which employs quantics tensor cross interpolation (QTCI) for an efficient evaluation of the diagram weights. Applying the method to dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, we clarify the interaction and temperature range in which the third-order approach yields accurate results. Since the calculations are implemented on the real-time/frequency axis, the detailed structure of spectral functions can be obtained without analytical continuation, as we demonstrate with examples for paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states. Our work establishes a viable path toward high-order, real-frequency impurity solvers for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium DMFT studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of entanglement halos, a set of strongly entangled distant sites within the ground state of a quantum many-body system. Such halos emerge in star-like systems with exponentially decaying couplings, as we show using both free-fermions and the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Depending on the central connectivity, entanglement halos may exhibit trivial and non trivial symmetry-protected topological features. Our findings highlight how geometry and connectivity can generate complex entanglement structures with rich physical content, which can be experimentally accessible via state-of-the-art technologies.</description>

      <title>Vacancy induced expansion of spin-liquid regime in J1-J2 Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the model for spin-1/2 J1-J2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a square lattice in the presence of spin vacancies. In order to overcome the methodological challenges associated with analyzing models with magnetic frustration and inhomogeneities, we introduce a new semi-classical approach in which singlet dimers are treated as effective classical degrees of freedom. The energetic and entropic aspects of the dimer formation are included via a classical Monte Carlo scheme that allows for the dynamical conversion of spin pairs into dimers and vice versa. We show that our semi-classical approach recovers the qualitative physics of the J1-J2 model in the absence of vacancies. The vacancies lead to a broadening of the spin-liquid regime between the N\'eel and the stripe antiferromagnetic phases. This suggests a possible new route to discover spin-liquid ground states by tuning the J2/J1 ratio in doped square lattice antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Driven Moir\'e Potential Enhancement and Tertiary Gap Opening in Graphene/h-BN Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices enable engineering of correlated quantum states through tunable periodic potentials, where twist angle controls periodicity but dynamic potential strength modulation remains challenging. Here, we develop a high-pressure quantum transport technique for van der Waals heterostructures, achieving the ultimate pressure limit (~9 GPa) in encapsulated moir\'e devices. In aligned graphene/h-BN, we demonstrate that pressure induces a substantial enhancement of the moir\'e potential strength, evidenced by the suppression of the first valence bandwidth and the near-doubling of the primary band gap. Moreover, we report the first observation of a tertiary gap emerging above 6.4 GPa, verifying theoretical predictions. Our results establish hydrostatic pressure as a universal parameter to reshape moir\'e band structures. By enabling quantum transport studies at previously inaccessible pressure regimes, this Letter expands the accessible parameter space for exploring correlated phases in moir\'e systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperkagome-lattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg ferromagnet is studied by means of the linear spin-wave theory, the double-time temperature Green's function method, high-temperature expansions series analysis, and quantum Monte Carlo simulations to examine the effect of lattice geometry on the finite-temperature properties. In particular, we have found that the Curie temperature $T_c$ for the hyperkagome-lattice (frustrated lattice) ferromagnet is about $0.33\vert J\vert$ that is smaller than $T_c$ for the diamond-lattice (another three-dimensional lattice with the same coordination number 4 but bipartite one) ferromagnet by about $25\%$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transition in a strongly hybridized phonon-triplon chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dimerized spin-1/2 chain, such as CuGeO$_3$, hosting triplon excitations coupled to optical phonons under weak terahertz laser driving. Both phonons and triplons weakly lose energy into the surrounding baths, forming a non-equilibrium steady state. In the strong phonon-triplon coupling regime, phonons near the two-triplon continuum hybridize strongly with triplons. Using mean-field Lindblad dynamics, we show that this strong hybridization induces sharp first-order phase transitions -- either single or simultaneous double -- in the emission spectrum, mainly due to dissipation-induced nonlinearities. Using mean-field Floquet analysis of harmonic modes in both sectors, we analytically confirm the existence of these phase transitions. Furthermore, we map the complete steady-state phase diagram by varying key control parameters and provide experimentally relevant parameters for observing these transitions in laser-driven CuGeO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Crystalline electric field and large anomalous Hall effect in the candidate topological material CeGaSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of CeGaSi single crystals, including magnetic, thermodynamic, electronic, and magnetotransport properties. The powder x-ray diffraction refinement revealed that CeGaSi crystallizes in LaPtSi-type tetragonal structure with space group I41md. The electrical resistivity data show a metallic nature with a sharp drop occurring around T_m = 11 K, revealing a magnetic phase transition, which is confirmed by magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity data. The magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and heat capacity data are analyzed through the crystalline electric field based on point charge model, suggesting that the six degenerate ground states of Ce3+ (J = 5/2) ion split into three doublets with an overall splitting energy = 288 K. The maximum negative magnetoresistance in CeGaSi for both B\parallel c and B\parallel ab field-direction is observed near T_m, it is attributed to the suppression of spin-disorder scattering by the magnetic field. The Hall resistivity data for B \parallel c and B\parallel ab show anomalous Hall signal. Our scaling analysis suggests that anomalous Hall effect in CeGaSi is dominated by the skew scattering mechanism. In addition, first-principles calculations identify CeGaSi as a nodal-line metal.</description>

      <title>SPLENDOR: a novel detector platform to search for light dark matter with narrow-gap semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a Hall effect driven by effective gravitational fields arising from quantum geometry. We develop four mechanisms for this ''emergent-gravity Hall effect" : real-space gravity, momentum-space gravity, gravitional anomalous velocity, and gravitational Lorentz force which are described by the Christoffel symbols in real, momentum, and time spaces. We construct a unified theoretical framework to systematically investigate the effects of emergent gravity in these spaces on transport phenomena based on the semiclassical theory. We demonstrate these effects by model calculations and clarify the conditions under which a finite Hall response can arise. Our findings open a new avenue for exploring gravitational effects in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Exciton dynamics and exciton-phonon coupling in bulk and thin flakes of layered van der Waals antiferromagnet Ni2P2S6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zhang-Rice (ZR) singlet is an intriguing quantum state offering potential to realize a spin-orbit-entangled bosonic quasiparticle, which gives rise to the Zhang-Rice exciton. Its formation is attributed to the correlation between a localized d-orbital of a transition metal and the p-orbitals of the neighbouring ligands. The layered two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic Ni2P2S6 system provide an excellent platform to probe the ZR exciton dynamics along with the role of exciton-phonon coupling. Here, we present a comprehensive study of ZR exciton and coupling with the phonons in bulk and few-layered single crystals of Ni2P2S6 using temperature, polarization and power-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. At cryogenic temperatures, the PL spectra reveal distinct phonon sidebands spaced by an energy difference of nearly 117 cm-1, indicative of exciton-phonon hybridization. Polarization-resolved measurements demonstrate a strong optical anisotropy, with a linear polarization degree of ~ 40 % at 4 K. Excitation power variation highlights linear scaling of PL intensity in the low-power regime, followed by spectral deformation at higher powers attributed to the phonon-assisted recombination and exciton saturation effects. ZR exciton and phonon side bands survival temperature decreases with decreasing flake thickness suggesting their tunability. The emergence and suppression of phonon sidebands with temperature and flake thickness emphasize dimensional sensitivity and coherence limits of excitonic states. Our findings position Ni2P2S6 as a promising candidate for tunable and anisotropic optoelectronic applications, while offering insight into quasiparticle interactions in 2D magnetic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum correlations and a key resource underpinning advances in quantum information and many-body physics. We uncover a universal relationship between bipartite entanglement entropy and particle number after the barrier in a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard system with an external asymmetric potential. Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks - a novel machine learning architecture - we learn this relationship across a broad range of interaction strengths with near-perfect predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a simple analytical binary-entropy-like expression that quantitatively captures the observed correlation for fixed parameters. Our findings open new avenues for characterizing quantum correlations in transport phenomena and provide a powerful framework for predicting entanglement evolution in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A unified diagrammatic formulation of single-reference and multi-reference random phase approximations: the particle-hole and particle-particle channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of many-body perturbation theory was recently introduced [J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2025, 16, 3047]. This framework allows us to extend single-reference (SR) Green's function methods defined at the diagrammatic level naturally into multi-reference case, as previously exemplified by the formulation of multi-reference direct random phase approximation (MR-dRPA) and the multi-reference second-order screened exchange approximation (MR-SOSEX). In this work, we further elaborate this framework and use it to develop MR generalizations of two other RPA variants, namely, particle-hole (ph) RPA with exchange (MR-RPAx) and particle-particle RPA (MR-ppRPA). We define these two MR generalizations by infinite order resummations of the generalized `ring' and `ladder' diagrams with antisymmetrized interaction vertices, respectively, which incorporate the contributions from the active-space connected two-body Green's functions. As for MR-dRPA, we derive unified sets of equations that hold at both SR and MR levels for RPAx and ppRPA, respectively. We perform numerical studies of prototypical systems using the three MR-RPA methods and carry out a perturbative analysis to gain a deeper understanding of their behaviors. We find that error cancellation between the second and third orders is a key factor for both SR-RPA and MR-RPA. In addition, we observe that MR-phRPA (MR-dRPA and MR-RPAx) and MR-ppRPA tend to overestimate and underestimate correlation energies, respectively, suggesting that a better accuracy can be achieved by further combining these two channels in the future.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Space-Time Parity Breaking Without Thermal Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an ultraviolet-complete, local, and unitary quantum field theory in 2+1 dimensions that exhibits spontaneous breaking of space-time parity, persisting to arbitrarily high temperatures. The theory is defined by a renormalization group trajectory, triggered by a relevant deformation of a conformal field theory, consisting of a critical biconical vector model and a free massless Dirac fermion. This deformation couples the fermion to the scalar sector, generating a renormalization group flow that terminates at a nontrivial infrared fixed point described by a conformal Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model and a decoupled critical vector model. By construction, the quantum field theory is parity invariant at zero temperature. However, we show that at sufficiently high temperatures, parity symmetry is spontaneously broken and remains so even in the infinite-temperature limit. Our analysis relies on both, perturbative renormalization group techniques in $4\!-\!\epsilon$ dimensions and functional renormalization group techniques directly in 2+1 dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that the Kohn--Luttinger superconductivity mechanism interplaying with other types of ordering can be implemented in systems with a hexagonal lattice. A number of unusual properties of such systems in the normal phase have also been considered. Our previous results on Kohn--Luttinger superconductivity with $p$-, $d$-, and $f$-wave pairing in monolayer and AB bilayer graphene, obtained disregarding the effect of substrate potential and impurities, have been presented in the first part. Then, the interplay of the superconducting Kohn--Luttinger state with the spin density wave state in actual AB, AA, and twisted bilayer graphene has been discussed in detail. In the last parts, a number of anomalous properties in the normal phase and the appearance of nematic superconductivity alongside with the spin density wave in the twisted bilayer graphene have been presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze topological phase transitions and higher Berry curvature in one-dimensional quantum spin systems, using a framework that explicitly incorporates the symmetry group action on the parameter space. Based on a $G$-compatible discretization of the parameter space, we incorporate both group cochains and parameter-space differentials, enabling the systematic construction of equivariant topological invariants. We derive a fixed-point formula for the higher Berry invariant in the case where the symmetry action has isolated fixed points. This reveals that the phase transition point between Haldane and trivial phases acts as a monopole-like defect where higher Berry curvature emanates. We further discuss hierarchical structures of topological defects in the parameter space, governed by symmetry reductions and compatibility with subgroup structures.</description>

      <title>Numerical extraction of crosscap coefficients in microscopic models for (2+1)D conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theory (CFT) can be placed on disparate space-time manifolds to facilitate investigations of their properties. For (2+1)D theories, one useful choice is the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^3$ obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary sphere of a three-dimensional ball. One-point functions of scalar primary fields on this manifold generally do not vanish and encode the so-called crosscap coefficients. These coefficients also manifest on the sphere as the overlaps between certain crosscap states and CFT primary states. Taking the (2+1)D Ising CFT as a concrete example, we demonstrate that crosscap coefficients can be extracted from microscopic models. We construct crosscap states in both lattice models defined on polyhedrons and continuum models in Landau levels, where the degrees of freedom at antipodal points are entangled in Bell-type states. By computing their overlaps with the eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians, we obtain results consistent with those from conformal bootstrap. Importantly, our approach directly reveals the absolute values of crosscap overlaps, whereas bootstrap calculations typically yield only their ratios. Furthermore, we investigate the finite-size scaling of these overlaps and their evolution under perturbations away from criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In copper oxides (cuprates) with single CuO$_2$ layer such as La$_{2-x}$Ba(Sr)$_x$CuO$_4$, antiferromagnetism coexists with superconductivity at small doping levels $x$, where chemical disorders are significant. Here, we report that superconductivity occurs in a uniform and fully ordered N${\'e}$el state in a single-layer cuprate La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ with a small amount of excess oxygen $(\delta = 0.015)$ as demonstrated by the $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance measurement. A uniform oxygen distribution in the crystal is crucial for achieving microscopic phase coexistence and overcoming the miscibility gap associated with the staging instability; self-organized periodic oxygen arrangement driven by mobile oxygen atoms. This finding prompts the reconsideration of superconductivity in cuprates, highlighting that it can emerge in a robust N${\'e}$el state that retains sizable magnetic moments and hosts only a small carrier density.</description>

      <title>Pairing without $\gamma$-Pocket in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film at ambient pressure has aroused great research interest. The $\gamma$-pocket formed by the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band, which was previously proposed to be crucial in the pairing mechanism of pressurized bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, is reported to be either present or absent here by different experimental groups, giving rise to the problem: what is the pairing mechanism and pairing nature without the $\gamma$-pocket? Here, we start from a band structure obtained via density-functional-theoretical calculation, which exhibits no $\gamma$-pocket. Then, equipped with electron interactions, we study the pairing nature via combined weak- and strong- coupling approaches, which provide consistent results. In the weak-coupling study, the nesting between the $\alpha$- and $\beta$- pockets leads to an $s^\pm$-wave pairing in which the gap signs on the two pockets are opposite, as provided by our random-phase-approximation based calculations. In real-space, the pairing pattern is dominated by the interlayer pairing of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. In the strong-coupling study, as the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals are nearly half-filled and hence localized, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals carry the HTSC. Driven by the interlayer superexchange transferred from the $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the Hund's rule coupling, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital electrons form interlayer $s$-wave pairing, as suggested by our slave-boson-mean-field study on the related two-orbital $t$-$J$ model. Projected onto the Fermi surface, this pairing just gives the $s^\pm$-wave pattern consistent with that obtained in the weak-coupling study. Our result is consistent with that obtained in recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid matter is classified through symmetry of ordering phenomena. Experimentally, this approach is straightforward, except when distinct orderings occur with identical or almost identical symmetry breaking. Here we show that the cuprate system Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$ hosts two distinct orderings with almost identical translational symmetry breaking. Only when applying site-sensitive resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), charge ordering can be conclusively differentiated from a super-lattice structure. These two orderings occur with almost the same in-plane symmetry but manifest at different atomic sites and display different temperature dependence. Differentiating these orders provides an important clue to the anomalous behavior of PrBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ within the 123-series of high-temperature superconductors. We conclude that the symmetry breaking at the Pr-site is unfavorable for superconducting pairing.</description>

      <title>hBN alignment orientation controls moir\'e strength in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene hosts a rich landscape of correlated symmetry-broken phases, driven by strong interactions from its flat band edges. Aligning to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) creates a moir\'e pattern, leading to recent observations of exotic ground states such as integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects. Here, we show that the moir\'e effects and resulting correlated phase diagrams are critically influenced by a previously underestimated structural choice: the hBN alignment orientation. This binary parameter distinguishes between configurations where the rhombohedral graphene and hBN lattices are aligned near 0{\deg} or 180{\deg}, a distinction that arises only because both materials break inversion symmetry. Although the two orientations produce the same moir\'e wavelength, we find their distinct local stacking configurations result in markedly different moir\'e potential strengths. Using low-temperature transport and scanning SQUID-on-tip magnetometry, we compare nearly identical devices that differ only in alignment orientation and observe sharply contrasting sequences of symmetry-broken states. Theoretical analysis reveals a simple mechanism based on lattice relaxation and the atomic-scale electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene, supported by detailed modeling.

      <title>Flat-band projected versus fully atomistic twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We benchmark the recently proposed projection method [Phys. Rev. B 111, 205133 (2025)] for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) across various symmetry-breaking phases at charge neutrality. The flat-band projected solutions agree well with the full tight-binding, with band structures and total energies differing by only a few meV. The projection to the flat bands is justified, owing to the increased gap to the remote bands in the normal state. Moreover, we employ a novel set of order parameters that allow us to visualize the wave functions locally in real space and quantify the breaking of various symmetries in the correlated phases. These order parameters are suitable to characterize MATBG and generic honeycomb systems.</description>

      <title>Cascade of Even-Denominator Fractional Quantum Hall States in Mixed-Stacked Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), particularly at half-filling of Landau levels, provides a unique window into topological phases hosting non-Abelian excitations. However, experimental platforms simultaneously offering large energy gaps, delicate tunability, and robust non-Abelian signatures remain scarce. Here, we report the observation of a cascade of even-denominator FQH states at filling factors ${\nu}$ = ${-5/2}$, ${-7/2}$, ${-9/2}$, ${-11/2}$, and ${-13/2}$, alongside numerous odd-denominator states in mixed-stacked pentalayer graphene, a previously unexplored system characterized by intertwined quadratic and cubic band dispersions. These even-denominator states, representing the highest filling half-filled states reported so far in the zeroth Landau level (ZLL), emerge from two distinct intra-ZLL and exhibit unprecedented displacement field tunability driven by LL crossings in the hybridized multiband structure. At half fillings, continuous quasiparticle phase transitions between paired FQH states, magnetic Bloch states, and composite Fermi liquids are clearly identified upon tuning external fields. Numerical calculations, revealing characteristic sixfold ground-state degeneracy and chiral graviton spectral analysis, suggest the observed even-denominator FQH states belong to the non-Abelian Moore-Read type. These results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a rich and versatile crystalline platform for exploring tunable correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Theory of off-diagonal disorder in multilayer topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multilayer topological insulators with random interlayer tunnelling, known as off-diagonal disorder. Within the Burkov-Balents model a single Hermitian defect creates a bound state whose energy crosses the middle of the gap in the trivial phase but never in the topological phase; a non-Hermitian defect splits this level yet preserves the same crossing rule, so the effect serves as a local marker of topology. However, the key distinction persists: the bound state crosses zero in the trivial phase but not in the topological phase. Two complementary diagrammatic approaches give matching densities of states for the normal, topological, Weyl and anomalous quantum Hall regimes. Off diagonal disorder inserts bulk states into the gap and can close it: the Weyl phase remains robust under strong disorder, whereas the anomalous quantum Hall phase survives only for weak fluctuations, and the added bulk states shrink the Hall plateau, clarifying experimental deviations. Finally, we analyse edge modes. Uniform disorder shortens their localization length slightly, while Gaussian and Lorentzian disorder enlarge it and in the Gaussian case can even delocalize the edges. Although chirality is maintained, the enhanced overlap permits tunnelling between opposite edges and pulls the longitudinal conductance away from its quantized value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between strong correlations and Markovian dephasing, resulting from monitoring the charge or spin degrees of freedom of a quantum dot described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model. Using the Auxiliary master equation approach we compute the steady-state spectral function and occupation of the dot and discuss the role of dephasing on Kondo physics. Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations. Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory is used to investigate the effect of biaxial strain on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of [111]-oriented NdNiO$_3$, as a representative of the rare-earth perovskites that undergo metal-to-insulator transitions. We find that this constraint on the system induces unique structural phase transitions not previously observed under the well-studied bulk or [001]-oriented strained systems. We also report unique electronic behaviour, including amplification of the electronic band-gap with tensile strain, and insulating, charge-ordered phases with non-orthorhombic tilt patterns. To provide clarity to the trends we observe, we also investigate the coupling between the breathing mode and strain, where we observe certain strains to directly favour and disfavour the creation of the breathing mode (and thus the associated charge-ordering). The amplification of the band gap with strain is understood in terms of a cooperative coupling between the elastic constraint and octahedral breathing, which expands on the previously reported triggered mechanism mediated by octahedral tilting.</description>

      <title>Color and Transparency from Quantum Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical properties of solids are governed not only by their energy band dispersions but also by the quantum geometry of Bloch states. While the role of energy bands in determining the perceived optical appearance of materials, such as color and transparency, is well established, the influence of quantum geometry remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the color and transparency of materials can be direct manifestations of their underlying quantum geometry. To illustrate this principle, we employ quadratic band-touching models that allow us to tune only the geometric properties of Bloch states, while keeping the energy dispersion fixed. This decoupling reveals that modifying the wavefunction texture alone can lead to dramatic changes in the optical conductivity and, consequently, in the reflectance spectrum of the material. This results in distinct and controllable changes in perceived color. Similarly, we show that quantum geometry can govern the transparency of two-dimensional materials. Our findings demonstrate how quantum geometry shapes the visual appearance of materials, opening new avenues for tailoring color and transparency beyond traditional band structure design. This establishes quantum geometric engineering as a novel approach for manipulating materials with customized optical functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PtPb$_4$ is a type II superconductor with a bulk critical temperature $T_{c}\approx 3 $K and an upper critical field of $H_{c2}=0.36 $T. PtPb$_4$ is related to non-superconducting PtSn$_4$, which presents nodal arc states at the surface. Here we measure the superconducting density of states of PtPb$_4$ using millikelvin Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). We observe a fully opened superconducting gap of $\Delta=0.48$\ meV similar to expectations from Bardeen Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) theory ($\Delta_0=1.76k_BT_{c}=0.49 $meV). Measurements under magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the surface show a spatially inhomogeneous gap structure, presenting superconducting signatures at fields as high as 1.5 T, significantly above $H_{c2}=0.36 $T. On some locations we find that the superconducting density of states does not vanish above $T_{c}$. We can find signatures of a superconducting gap up to 5K. We discuss possible reasons for the observation of superconducting properties above $T_{c}$ and $H_{c2}$, emphasizing the role played by structural defects.</description>

      <title>Topological chiral superconductivity from antiferromagnetic correlations in moir\'{e} bands with extreme spin-orbit coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the strong-correlation phenomenology observed near the superconducting phase in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we study multi-orbital $t$-$J$ models that are derived from different parameter regimes. The models contain effective antiferromagnetic interactions that are influenced by the strong underlying spin-orbit coupling. The possible superconducting pairing states are investigated in these models. We find that the preferred pairing order parameters are associated with the $^{1,2}E$ representations of the three-fold rotation symmetry operator $C_3$, with the $p\pm i p$ component intermixing with the $d\pm id$ component. The chiral superconducting states are shown to be topological, based on the Wilson loops of the corresponding Bogoliubov quasiparticles. We discuss the implications of our findings for experimental observations, as well as the new connections our results uncover between the moir\'{e} superconductivity and its counterpart in bulk quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamical response theory of interacting Majorana fermions and its application to generic Kitaev quantum spin liquids in a field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the appearance of Majorana fermions in a broad range of correlated and topological electronic systems, we develop a general method to compute the dynamical response of interacting Majorana fermions in the random-phase approximation (RPA). This can be applied self-consistently on top of Majorana mean-field theory (MFT) backgrounds, thereby in particular providing a powerful tool to analyse $\textit{generic}$ behaviour in the vicinity of (various heavily studied) exactly soluble models. Prime examples are quantum spin liquids (QSL) with emergent Majorana excitations, with the celebrated exact solution of Kitaev. We employ the RPA to study in considerable detail phase structure and dynamics of the extended Kitaev honeycomb $KJ\Gamma$-model, with and without an applied field. First, we benchmark our method with Kitaev's exactly soluble model, finding a remarkable agreement. The interactions between Majorana fermions even turn out to mimic the effect of local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations, which we explain analytically. Second, we show how small non-Kitaev couplings $J$ and $\Gamma$ induce Majorana bound states, resulting in sharp features in the dynamical structure factor in the presence of fractionalisation: such 'spinon excitons' naturally appear, and can coexist and interact with the broad Majorana continuum. Third, for increasing couplings or field, our theory predicts instabilities of the KQSL triggered by the condensation of the sharp modes. From the high symmetry momenta of the condensation we can deduce which magnetically ordered phases surround the KQSL, in good agreement with previous finite-size numerics. We discuss implications for experiments and the broad range of applicability of our method to other QSL and Majorana systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network wave functions have shown promise as a way to achieve high accuracy on the many-body quantum problem. These wave functions most commonly use a determinant or sum of determinants to antisymmetrize many-body orbitals which are described by a neural network. In many cases, the wave function is projected onto a fixed-spin state. Such a treatment is allowed for spin-independent operators; however, it cannot be applied to spin-dependent problems, such as Hamiltonians containing spin-orbit interactions. We show that for spin-independent Hamiltonians, a strict upper bound property is obeyed between a traditional Hartree-Fock like determinant, full spinor wave function, the full determinant wave function, and a generalized spinor wave function. The relationship between a spinor wave function and the full determinant arises because the full determinant wave function is the spinor wave function projected onto a fixed-spin, after which antisymmetry is implicitly restored in the spin-independent case. For spin-dependent Hamiltonians, the full determinant wave function is not applicable, because it is not antisymmetric. Numerical experiments on the H$_3$ molecule and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gas confirm the bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is generally believed that spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry is restricted by Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. A special case is that the 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain holds long-range order because the order parameter commutes with the Hamiltonian. The other one is that the recently found frustration-free Hamiltonians can bypass this theorem, but the observed symmetry breaking is fragile under generic perturbations. In this Letter, we have discovered a new example that goes beyond the above two examples -- a 1D antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on comb lattice -- that can achieve spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry. In addition to the long range order parameter, its energy spectrum shows Anderson tower of states. Importantly, it is not a frustration-free model and its order parameter does not commute with the Hamiltonian. Moreover, the long-range order is robust under symmetry-preserving perturbations. Combining numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, we have further confirmed and understood this nontrivial phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework beyond internal symmetries by including geometric data that encode spacetime symmetries. Concretely, we enrich the SymTFT of an internal symmetry by spacetime symmetries and study the resulting symmetry-enriched topological (SET) order, which captures the interplay between the spacetime and internal symmetries. We illustrate the framework by focusing on symmetries in 1+1D. To this end, we first analyze how gapped boundaries of 2+1D SETs affect the enriching symmetry, and apply this within the SymTFT framework to gauging and detecting anomalies of the 1+1D symmetry, as well as to classifying 1+1D symmetry-enriched phases. We then consider quantum spin chains and explicitly construct the SymTFTs for three prototypical spacetime symmetries: lattice translations, spatial reflections, and time reversal. For lattice translations, the interplay with internal symmetries is encoded in the SymTFT by translations permuting anyons, which causes the continuum description of the SymTFT to be a foliated field theory. Using this, we elucidate the relation between Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies and modulated symmetries and classify modulated symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. For reflection and time-reversal symmetries, the interplay can additionally be encoded by symmetry fractionalization data in the SymTFT, and we identify mixed anomalies and study gauging for such examples.</description>

Abstract: Superconductivity arising from fully spin-polarized, repulsively interacting electrons can host intrinsically chiral Cooper pairs and Majorana zero modes, yet no concrete microscopic route to such a state has been established. Motivated by recent observations in twisted homobilayer MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model: spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable periodic potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations reveal that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before the system turns metallic: a chiral $f$-wave superconductor and a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) whose energies differ by less than $1\%$. These two competing states mirror the superconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases observed experimentally near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome survives realistic Coulomb interaction, light doping, and various lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between electronic correlations and band topology remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, primarily hindered by a language mismatch problem. While band topology is naturally formulated within a single-particle band theory, strong correlations typically elude such an effective one-body description. In this work, we bridge this gap leveraging the ghost Gutzwiller (gGut) variational embedding framework, which introduces auxiliary quasiparticle degrees of freedom to recover an effective band structure description of strongly correlated systems. This approach enables an interpretable and computationally efficient treatment of correlated topological phases, resulting in energy- and momentum-resolved topological features that are directly comparable with experimental spectra. We exemplify the advantages of this framework through a detailed study of the interacting Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. Not only does the gGut description reproduce established results, but it also reveals previously inaccessible aspects: most notably, the emergence of topologically nontrivial Hubbard bands hosting their own edge states, as well as possible ways to manipulate these through a finite magnetization. These results position the gGut framework as a promising tool for the predictive modeling of correlated topological materials.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the charge fluctuations by nonlocal correlations close to the Mott transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of nonlocal correlations on charge fluctuations in the two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model close to the Mott metal-to-insulator transition. At half-filling and for interaction strengths and temperatures where the system is in the Mott insulating phase, charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Under these conditions, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations predict a strong enhancement of the charge susceptibility at small (electron or hole) doping. However, these DMFT results include only the effects of purely local correlations despite the importance of nonlocal correlations in two-dimensional systems. We have, hence, carried out dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A) simulations which allow for the inclusion of such nonlocal correlation effects while retaining the local ones of DMFT. Our numerical data show that close to half-filling the large uniform charge susceptibility of DMFT is strongly suppressed by nonlocal fluctuations but gradually increases with (electron) doping. At a certain doping value, charge fluctuations eventually become larger in D$\Gamma$A with respect to DMFT indicating that the absence of nonlocal correlations underestimates the mobility of the charge carriers in this parameter regime. This metallization effect is also reflected in an enhancement of the D$\Gamma$A kinetic and potential energies and a corresponding reduction of the (absolute value of the) D$\Gamma$A Matsubara self-energy with respect to DMFT.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Ordering and Elastocaloric Effect in TmVO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare-earth material TmVO$_4$ shows ferro-quadrupolar order below a critical temperature which can be tuned by various parameters such as a magnetic field, a strain field, chemical composition, and nuclear spin coupling to its non-Kramers electronic doublets. In this work, we study a pseudo-spin-1/2 model to understand the various phases in TmVO$_4$. The model captures coupled electronic and nuclear orders via (i) a ferro-quadrupolar Jahn-Teller interaction, (ii) a $B_{1g}$ shear strain, (iii) a transverse magnetic field, and (iv) a weak on-site nuclear hyperfine coupling A. At zero transverse magnetic and strain fields, electronic quadrupoles undergo a second-order transition at $T_Q$, lowering the entropy per site from ln 4 to ln 2. At a much lower $T_N$ ~ $A^2/T_Q$, virtual electronic fluctuations mediate an effective nuclear-spin Ising interaction, driving a second transition that collapses the remaining entropy. Under a transverse magnetic field, nuclear moments polarize smoothly, replacing the sharp low-T transition by a crossover. In contrast, adiabatic $B_{1g}$ strain sweeps across the two ordering temperatures yielding a pronounced two-step elastocaloric effect, highlighting TmVO$_4$ as a tunable strain-driven solid-state refrigerant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-flip inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy allows magnetic materials to be probed at the single-atom level via scanning tunneling microscopy. Previously, the local spectral weight of spin excitations of small systems has been deduced from discrete steps in the differential conductance. However, this is not viable for large systems. We show that the local spin density of states can be measured via the double differential conductance. This contrasts with elastic measurements where the local density of electronic states is deduced from the differential conductance. We study the tunneling currents of the spin-1/2 and -1 Heisenberg chains and propose a method to probe zero-frequency modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a method to compute Slavnov overlaps in the Lieb-Liniger model using the steepest descent method of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. To do so, we employ the Matsuo-Kostov Representation of the Slavnov overlaps to write an integral equation for the respective resolvent, and then represent this equation as a Riemann-Hilbert problem. We demonstrate the validity and applicability of the method by computing the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in the $c\to\infty$ limit, corresponding to free fermions.</description>

Abstract: Exotic entanglement entropy scaling properties usually come with interesting entanglement structures in real space and novel metrics of the spacetime lattice. One prominent example is the rainbow chain where lattice sites symmetric about the center form entangled Bell pairs due to an effective long-range coupling from the strong inhomogeneity of the coupling strength. This manuscript generalizes the rainbow chain to higher dimensional space on lattices with Hausdorff dimension one and enlarged local Hilbert space keeping the Hamiltonian frustration free. The effective Hamiltonian from the Schrieffer-Wolf transformation is given by a stacking of layers of $k$-simplices with $0$-dimensional (fully-connected) antiferromagnetic Hamiltonians, which can be diagonalized analytically with Young operators. The original lattice can be obtained from proliferating disinclination defects in a regular $k$-dimensional cubical lattice, which introduces curvature at the center of the lattice. The model interpolates between the SYK model and the free-fermionic XX spin chain, and hence might be potentially useful in understanding black hole physics and holography.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural network wave functions for Rydberg atom arrays on kagome lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom array experiments have demonstrated the ability to act as powerful quantum simulators, preparing strongly-correlated phases of matter which are challenging to study for conventional computer simulations. A key direction has been the implementation of interactions on frustrated geometries, in an effort to prepare exotic many-body states such as spin liquids and glasses. In this paper, we apply two-dimensional recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions to study the ground states of Rydberg atom arrays on the kagome lattice. We implement an annealing scheme to find the RNN variational parameters in regions of the phase diagram where exotic phases may occur, corresponding to rough optimization landscapes. For Rydberg atom array Hamiltonians studied previously on the kagome lattice, our RNN ground states show no evidence of exotic spin liquid or emergent glassy behavior. In the latter case, we argue that the presence of a non-zero Edwards-Anderson order parameter is an artifact of the long autocorrelations times experienced with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, and we show that autocorrelations can be systematically reduced by increasing numerical effort. This result emphasizes the utility of autoregressive models, such as RNNs, in conjunction with QMC, to explore Rydberg atom array physics on frustrated lattices and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizer states are a fundamental resource for universal quantum computation. However,despite broad significance in quantum computing, the emergence of "many-body" non-stabilizerness in interacting quantum systems remains poorly understood due to its analytical intractability. Here we show that Rydberg atom arrays provide a natural reservoir of non-stabilizerness that extends beyond single qubits and arises from quantum correlations engendered by the Rydberg blockade. We demonstrate that this non-stabilizerness can be experimentally accessed in two complementary ways, either by performing quench dynamics or via adiabatic ground state preparation. Using the analytical framework based on matrix product states, we explain the origin of Rydberg nonstabilizerness via a quantum circuit decomposition of the wave function.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall crystals in moir\'e bands with higher Chern number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realization of fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e materials has sparked the search for further novel phases of matter in this platform. In particular, recent works have demonstrated the possibility of realizing quantum anomalous Hall crystals (QAHCs), which combine the zero-field quantum Hall effect with spontaneously broken discrete translation symmetry. Here, we employ exact diagonalization to demonstrate the existence of stable QAHCs arising from $\frac{2}{3}$-filled moir\'e bands with Chern number $C=2$. Our calculations show that these topological crystals, which are characterized by a quantized Hall conductivity of $1$ (in units of $e^2/h$) and a tripled unit cell, are robust in an ideal model of twisted bilayer-trilayer graphene -- providing a novel explanation for experimental observations in this heterostructure. Furthermore, we predict that the QAHC remains robust in a realistic model of twisted double bilayer graphene and, in addition, we provide a range of optimal tuning parameters, namely twist angle and electric field, for experimentally realizing this phase. Overall, our work demonstrates the stability of QAHCs at odd-denominator filling of $C=2$ bands, provides specific guidelines for future experiments, and establishes chiral multilayer graphene as a theoretical platform for studying topological phases beyond the Landau-level paradigm.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</description>

      <title>A Denser Hydrogen Inferred from First-Principles Simulations Challenges Jupiter's Interior Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state. For Jupiter, this implies a lower bulk metallicity (i.e., a smaller mass of heavy elements). Our results further amplify the inconsistency between Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity measured by the Galileo probe and the envelope metallicity inferred from interior models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum field theory is referred to as bosonic (non-spin) if its physical quantities are independent of the spacetime spin structure, and as fermionic (spin) if they depend on it. We explore fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) that emerge from bosonic abelian Chern-Simons theories, playing the role of a symmetry topological field theory, by imposing topological boundary conditions. Our construction includes the fermionic generalization of code CFTs. When the Chern-Simons theory is associated with the root lattice of a simply laced Lie algebra, this approach yields a fermionic CFT with a level-one affine Lie algebra symmetry. As an application, we consider the Chern-Simons theories corresponding to a class of supersymmetric vertex operator algebras studied by Johnson-Freyd and classify their fermionic topological boundary conditions that give rise to supersymmetric CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-linear and non-empirical (nlane) double hybrid density functional derived from an accurate interpolation of the adiabatic connection in density functional theory, incorporating the correct asymptotic expansions. By bridging the second-order perturbative weak correlation limit with the fully interacting limit from the semi-local SCAN functional, nlane-SCAN is free of fitted parameters while providing improved energetic predictions compared to SCAN for moderately and strongly correlated systems alike. It delivers accurate predictions for atomic total energies and multiple reaction datasets from the GMTKN55 benchmark while significantly outperforming traditional linear hybrids and double hybrids for non-covalent interactions without requiring dispersion corrections. Due to the exact constraints at the weak correlation limit, nlane-SCAN has reduced delocalization errors as evident through the SIE4x4 benchmark and bond dissociations of H\(_2^+\) and He\(_2^+\). Its proper asymptotic behavior ensures stability in strongly correlated systems, improving H\(_2\) and N\(_2\) bond dissociation profiles compared to conventional functionals.</description>

      <title>Topotactical Hydrogen Induced Single-Band $d$-wave Superconductivity in La$_2$NiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a structural resemblance to its cuprate counterpart, La$_2$CuO$_4$. However, La$_2$CuO$_4$ has a Cu$^{2+}$ or 3$d^9$ electronic configuration that needs to be hole or electron doped for superconductivity, whereas La$_2$NiO$_4$ is 3$d^8$ with divalent Ni$^{2+}$. Making a cuprate analog through conventional electron doping is impractical due to the rarity of tetravalent substituents for trivalent La. Here, we propose an alternative route: intercalating topotactical hydrogen, which is possible through electric-field-controlled protonation and transforms La$_2$NiO$_4$ into a 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ single-band two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Mott insulator analogous to La$_2$CuO$_4$. This we find through density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The furthergoing dynamical vertex approximation predicts that H-La$_2$NiO$_4$ can host $d$-wave superconductivity under 15\% hole doping with a critical temperature above 20\,K. Our findings not only suggest a new method for tuning the electronic structure of layered nickelates but also provide theoretical evidence for a new nickelate superconductor, awaiting experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>Anyonic analogue of optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyonic interferometry is a direct probe of fractional statistics. We propose an interferometry geometry that parallels an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer and offers several advantages over existing interferometry schemes. In contrast to the currently studied electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, our setup has no drain inside the device so that the trapped topological charge is time-independent. In contrast to electronic Fabry-P\'erot interferometry, anyons cannot go around the device more than once. Thus, the interference signal has a straightforward interpretation in terms of anyonic statistical phases. The proposed geometry suppresses the undesirable effects of bulk-edge coupling. Moreover, the setup allows for simple exact solutions for the electric current and noise for an arbitrary quasiparticle tunneling strength in a broad range of conditions. The structure of the solutions is similar to that for non-interacting electrons but reflects fractional charge and statistics. We present results for electric current and noise in Jain states and address thermal interferometry at zero voltage bias.</description>
