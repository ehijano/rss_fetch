      <title>Anti-pig Antibodies in Swine Veterinarian Serum: Implications for Clinical Xenotransplantation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent clinical xenotransplantation and human decedent studies demonstrate that clinical hyperacute rejection of genetically engineered porcine organs can be reliably avoided but that antibody mediated rejection continues to limit graft survival. We previously identified porcine glycans and proteins which are immunogenic after cardiac xenotransplantation in nonhuman primates, but the clinical immune response to antigens present in glycan depleted triple knockout (TKO) donor pigs is poorly understood. In this study we use fluorescence barcoded HEK cells and HEK cell lines expressing porcine glycans (Gal and SDa) or proteins (CD9, CD46, CD59, PROCR and ANXA2) to screen antibody reactivity in human serum from 160 swine veterinarians, a serum source with potential occupational immune challenge from porcine tissues and pathogens. High levels of anti-Gal IgM were present in all samples and lower levels of anti-SDa IgM were present in 41% of samples. IgM binding to porcine proteins, primarily CD9 and CD46, previously identified as immunogenic in pig to non-human primate cardiac xenograft recipients, was detected in 28 of the 160 swine veterinarian samples. These results suggest that barcoded HEK cell lines expressing porcine protein antigens can be useful for screening human patient serum. A comprehensive analysis of sera from clinical xenotransplant recipients to define a panel of commonly immunogenic porcine antigens will likely be necessary to establish an array of porcine non-Gal antigens for effective monitoring of patient immune responses and allow earlier therapies to reverse antibody mediated rejection.</description>
