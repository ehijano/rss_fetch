      <title>Constructing Low-Redundancy Codes via Distributed Graph Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing error-correcting codes using distributed graph coloring under the LOCAL model. Building on the correspondence between independent sets in the confusion graph and valid codes, we show that the color of a single vertex - consistent with a global proper coloring - can be computed in polynomial time using a modified version of Linial's coloring algorithm, leading to efficient encoding and decoding. Our results include: i) uniquely decodable code constructions for a constant number of errors of any type with redundancy twice the Gilbert-Varshamov bound; ii) list-decodable codes via a proposed extension of graph coloring, namely, hypergraph labeling; iii) an incremental synchronization scheme with reduced average-case communication when the edit distance is not precisely known; and iv) the first asymptotically optimal codes (up to a factor of 8) for correcting bursts of unbounded-length edits. Compared to syndrome compression, our approach is more flexible and generalizable, does not rely on a good base code, and achieves improved redundancy across a range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Joint Low-Rank and Sparse Bayesian Channel Estimation for Ultra-Massive MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates channel estimation for ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. We propose a joint low-rank and sparse Bayesian estimation (LRSBE) algorithm for spatial non-stationary ultra-massive channels by exploiting the low-rankness and sparsity in the beam domain. Specifically, the channel estimation integrates sparse Bayesian learning and soft-threshold gradient descent within the expectation-maximization framework. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives under different signal-to-noise ratio conditions in terms of estimation accuracy and overall complexity.</description>

      <title>One-Step Generative Channel Estimation via Average Velocity Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have shown immense potential for wireless communication by learning complex channel data distributions. However, the iterative denoising process associated with these models imposes a significant challenge in latency-sensitive wireless communication scenarios, particularly in channel estimation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel solution for one-step generative channel estimation. Our approach bypasses the time-consuming iterative steps of conventional models by directly learning the average velocity field. Through extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based approach. Specifically, our scheme achieves a normalized mean squared error up to 2.65 dB lower than the diffusion method and reduces latency by around 90%, demonstrating the potential of our method to enhance channel estimation performance.</description>

      <title>Timely Information for Strategic Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a dynamic variant of Bayesian persuasion, in which a strategic sender seeks to influence a receiver's belief over time through controlling the timing of the information disclosure, under resource constraints. We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna-Enhanced Cell-Free Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising technology that can exploit new spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by flexibly adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of antennas. In this letter, we investigate an RA-enhanced cell-free system for downlink transmission, where multiple RA-equipped access points (APs) cooperatively serve multiple single-antenna users over the same time-frequency resource. Specifically, we aim to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the AP-user associations and the RA boresight directions. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage strategy to solve the AP-user association problem, and then employ fractional programming (FP) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to optimize the RA boresight directions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-enhanced cell-free system significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Robust Precoding Designs of RSMA for Multiuser MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has been studied for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MUMIMO) systems especially in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. However, its precoding designs that maximize the sum rate normally have high computational complexity. To implement an efficient RSMA scheme for the MU-MIMO system, in this work, we propose a novel robust precoding design, which can handle imperfect CSI. Specifically, we first adopt the generalized mutual information to construct a lower bound of the objective function in the sum rate maximization problem. Then, we apply a smooth lower bound of the non-smooth sum rate objective function to construct a new optimization problem. By revealing the relationship between the generalized signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the minimum mean square error matrices, we transform the constructed problem into a tractable one. After decomposing the transformed problem into three subproblems, we investigate a new alternating precoding design based on sequential solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed precoding scheme achieves comparable performance to conventional methods, while significantly reducing the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Exact 3-D Channel Impulse Response for Spherical Receivers with Arbitrary Drift Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel modeling for spherical absorbing receivers is fundamental to the design of realistic molecular multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. While advanced modulation schemes have been proposed to mitigate interference, determining the channel impulse response (CIR) under arbitrary flow directions remains a challenge; existing exact solutions are restricted to either 1-D/no-drift scenarios or planar receiver geometries. Addressing this gap, we derive the first exact analytical CIR for a spherical receiver in a 3-D molecular communication system with uniform drift in an arbitrary direction. Unlike prior approximations that ignore the angle between the drift and the transmission axis, our approach utilizes the Girsanov theorem to analytically transform the hitting-time distribution from a stationary medium to a drifted one. The proposed closed-form expression not only eliminates modeling errors inherent in previous approximations for off-axis receivers but also enables efficient parameter-space exploration of critical system metrics (e.g., peak time and amplitude), a task that would be computationally costly with pure simulation-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Maximal Leakage over Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal leakage quantifies the leakage of information from data $X \in \mathcal{X}$ due to an observation $Y$. While fundamental properties of maximal leakage, such as data processing, sub-additivity, and its connection to mutual information, are well-established, its behavior over Bayesian networks is not well-understood and existing bounds are primarily limited to binary $\mathcal{X}$. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of maximal leakage over Bayesian networks with finite alphabets. Our bounds on maximal leakage are established by utilizing coupling-based characterizations which exist for channels satisfying certain conditions. Furthermore, we provide more general conditions under which such coupling characterizations hold for $|\mathcal{X}| = 4$. In the course of our analysis, we also present a new simultaneous coupling result on maximal leakage exponents. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed bounds with some examples.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Channel Inference via Cross-Modal Flow: From Multimodal Sensing to Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) underpins reliable and efficient wireless communication. However, acquiring CSI via pilot estimation incurs substantial overhead, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in high-Doppler environments. By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface over Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the recently proposed concept of fluid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (FRIS) on covert communications. Specifically, we consider a communication scenario where a legitimate transmitter aims to covertly deliver information to its intended receiver through a planar FRIS, while an adversary attempts to detect whether any transmission is occurring. In this context, we analyze the false alarm (FA) and missed detection (MD) probabilities, and derive a closed-form expression for the covertness outage probability (COP). Furthermore, the success probability is characterized under the optimal detection threshold, providing new insights into the trade-off between covertness and reliable transmission. Numerical results reveal that FRIS provides a clear advantage over fixed-position RIS at low-to-moderate transmit powers by improving reliability and enhancing covertness, while at very high power levels, fixed-position RIS may sustain slightly higher success probability due to reduced leakage toward the adversary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operator layer cake theorem provides an integral representation for the directional derivative of the operator logarithm in terms of a family of projections [arXiv:2507.06232]. Recently, the related work [arXiv:2507.07065] showed that the theorem gives an alternative proof to Frenkel's integral formula for Umegaki's relative entropy [Quantum, 7:1102 (2023)]. In this short note, we find a converse implication, demonstrating that the operator layer cake theorem is equivalent to Frenkel's integral formula.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna System Design under Random LoS and NLoS Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching antennas, realized through position-adjustable radiating elements along dielectric waveguides, have emerged as a promising flexible-antenna technology thanks to their ability to dynamically reshape large-scale channel conditions. However, most existing studies focus on idealized LoS-dominated environments, overlooking the stochastic nature of realistic wireless propagation. This paper investigates a more practical multiuser pinching-antenna system under a composite probabilistic channel model that captures distance-dependent LoS blockage and NLoS scattering. To account for both efficiency and reliability aspects of communication, two complementary design metrics are considered: an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric characterizing long-term throughput and fairness, and an outage-constrained metric ensuring a prescribed reliability level. Based on these metrics, we formulate two optimization problems: the first maximizes the max-min average SNR across users, while the second maximizes a guaranteed SNR threshold under per-user outage constraints. Although both problems are inherently nonconvex, we exploit their underlying monotonic structures and develop low-complexity, bisection-based algorithms that achieve globally optimal solutions using only simple scalar evaluations. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems significantly outperform conventional fixed-antenna designs even under random LoS and NLoS channels.</description>

      <title>Beampattern Synthesis for Discrete Phase RIS in Communication and Sensing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive research on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) has primarily focused on optimizing reflective coefficients for passive beamforming in specific target directions. This optimization typically assumes prior knowledge of the target direction, which is unavailable before the target is detected. To enhance direction estimation, it is critical to develop array pattern synthesis techniques that yield a wider beam by maximizing the received power over the entire target area. Although this challenge has been addressed with active antennas, RIS systems pose a unique challenge due to their inherent phase constraints, which can be continuous or discrete.
  This work addresses this challenge through a novel array pattern synthesis method tailored for discrete phase constraints in RIS. We introduce a penalty method that pushes these constraints to the boundary of the convex hull. Then, the Minorization-Maximization (MM) method is utilized to reformulate the problem into a convex one. Our numerical results show that our algorithm can generate a wide beam pattern comparable to that achievable with per-power constraints, with both the amplitudes and phases being adjustable. We compare our method with a traditional beam sweeping technique, showing a) several orders of magnitude reduction of the MSE of Angle of Arrival (AOA) at low to medium Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)s; and b) $8$~dB SNR reduction to achieve a high probability of detection.</description>

      <title>Learning Causality for Longitudinal Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis develops methods for causal inference and causal representation learning (CRL) in high-dimensional, time-varying data.
  The first contribution introduces the Causal Dynamic Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE), a model for estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITEs) by capturing unobserved heterogeneity in treatment response driven by latent risk factors that affect only outcomes. CDVAE comes with theoretical guarantees on valid latent adjustment and generalization bounds for ITE error. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that CDVAE outperforms baselines, and that state-of-the-art models greatly improve when augmented with its latent substitutes, approaching oracle performance without access to true adjustment variables.
  The second contribution proposes an efficient framework for long-term counterfactual regression based on RNNs enhanced with Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and InfoMax. It captures long-range dependencies under time-varying confounding while avoiding the computational cost of transformers, achieving state-of-the-art results and introducing CPC into causal inference.
  The third contribution advances CRL by addressing how latent causes manifest in observed variables. We introduce a model-agnostic interpretability layer based on the geometry of the decoder Jacobian. A sparse self-expression prior induces modular, possibly overlapping groups of observed features aligned with shared latent influences. We provide recovery guarantees in both disjoint and overlapping settings and show that meaningful latent-to-observed structure can be recovered without anchor features or single-parent assumptions. Scalable Jacobian-based regularization techniques are also developed.</description>

      <title>Semantic Soft Bootstrapping: Long Context Reasoning in LLMs without Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long context reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated enhancement of their cognitive capabilities via chain-of-thought (CoT) inference. Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show a jump of 10.6%, and 10% improvements in accuracy, respectively, over group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which is a commonly used RLVR algorithm. Our code is available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/semantic-soft-bootstrapping, and the model, curated dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/semantic-soft-bootstrapping.</description>

      <title>System-level Analysis of Dual-Mode Networked Sensing: ISAC Integration &amp; Coordination Gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper characterizes integration and coordination gains in dense millimeter-wave ISAC networks through a dual-mode framework that combines monostatic and multistatic sensing. A comprehensive system-level analysis is conducted, accounting for base station (BS) density, power allocation, antenna misalignment, radar cross-section (RCS) fluctuations, clutter, bistatic geometry, channel fading, and self-interference cancellation (SIC) efficiency. Using stochastic geometry, coverage probabilities and ergodic rates for sensing and communication are derived, revealing tradeoffs among BS density, beamwidth, and power allocation. It is shown that the communication performance sustained reliable operation despite the overlaid sensing functionality. In contrast, the results reveal the foundational role of spatial sensing diversity, driven by the dual-mode operation, to compensate for the weak sensing reflections and vulnerability to imperfect SIC along with interference and clutter. To this end, we identify a system transition from monostatic to multistatic-dominant sensing operation as a function of the SIC efficiency. In the latter case, using six multistatic BSs instead of a single bistatic receiver improved sensing coverage probability by over 100%, highlighting the coordination gain. Moreover, comparisons with pure communication networks confirm substantial integration gain. Specifically, dual-mode networked sensing with four cooperative BSs can double throughput, while multistatic sensing alone improves throughput by over 50%.</description>

      <title>Entropic Analysis of Time Series through Kernel Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for time series analysis using entropic measures based on the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the time series' Takens' embeddings. Using this framework we introduce two distinct analytical tools: (1) a multi-scale KDE entropy metric, denoted as $\Delta\text{KE}$, which quantifies the evolution of time series complexity across different scales by measuring certain entropy changes, and (2) a sliding baseline method that employs the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to detect changes in time series dynamics through changes in KDEs. The $\Delta{\rm KE}$ metric offers insights into the information content and ``unfolding'' properties of the time series' embedding related to dynamical systems, while the KL divergence-based approach provides a noise and outlier robust approach for identifying time series change points (injections in RF signals, e.g.). We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of these tools through a set of experiments encompassing diverse domains. In the space of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, we achieve accurate detection of signal injections under varying noise and interference conditions. Furthermore, we apply our methodology to electrocardiography (ECG) data, successfully identifying instances of ventricular fibrillation with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our tools for dynamic state detection by accurately identifying chaotic regimes within an intermittent signal. These results show the broad applicability of our framework for extracting meaningful insights from complex time series data across various scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Region-of-Interest-Guided Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (deepJSCC) methods have shown promising improvements in communication performance over wireless networks. However, existing approaches primarily focus on enhancing overall image reconstruction quality, which may not fully align with user experiences, often driven by the quality of regions of interest (ROI). Motivated by this, we propose ROI-guided joint source-channel coding (ROI-JSCC), a novel deepJSCC framework that prioritizes high-quality transmission of ROI. The ROI-JSCC consists of four key components: (1) Image ROI embedding, (2) ROI-guided split processing, (3) ROI-based loss function design, and (4) ROI-adaptive bandwidth allocation. Together, these components allow ROI-JSCC to selectively enhance the ROI reconstruction quality at varying ROI positions while maintaining overall image quality with minimal computational overhead. Experimental results under diverse communication environments demonstrate that ROI-JSCC significantly improves ROI reconstruction quality while maintaining competitive average image quality compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Secure Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) leverages distance-dependent channel variations for joint distance and angle estimation. However, full-digital architectures have prohibitive hardware costs, making hybrid analog-digital (HAD) designs the primary alternative. Nevertheless, such architectures compromise beamfocusing precision and lead to energy leakage, which exacerbates inter-user interference and increases eavesdropping risks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enhanced secure transmit scheme for near-field ISAC. For the first time, it exploits the common stream in RSMA to concurrently (i) flexibly manage interference, (ii) act as artificial noise to suppress eavesdropping, and (iii) serve as sensing sequences. The objective is to maximize the minimum secrecy rate while satisfying the angle and distance Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) constraints. This results in a hard, non-convex optimization problem, and we employ block coordinate descent to decompose it into three sub-problems with lower computational complexity. In the first stage of optimizing fully digital beamfocusers, we develop an iterative solution using weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE), quadratic transform, and Taylor expansion methods, thus avoiding conventional semidefinite relaxation. In the second and third stages, the analog and digital beamfocusers are optimized in closed form. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme (1) achieves near full-digital beamfocusing performance with a 16-fold reduction in RF chains, (2) provides superior secrecy performance compared to conventional beamfocusing-only and far-field security schemes, and (3) enables high-accuracy sensing with negligible loss in secrecy performance.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamfocusing Design for RSMA-Enhanced Near-Field Secure Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-field spherical wavefronts enable spotlight-like beam focusing to mitigate unintended energy leakage, creating new opportunities for physical-layer security (PLS). However, under hybrid analog-digital (HAD) antenna architectures, beamfocusing alone may not provide foolproof privacy protection due to reduced focusing precision. To address this issue, this paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enhanced secure transmit scheme for near-field communications with fully-connected or sub-connected HAD architectures. In the proposed scheme, the common stream is designed for dual purposes, delivering the desired message for legitimate users while acting as artificial noise to disrupt eavesdropping. The primary objective is to maximize the minimum secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the analog beamfocuser, digital beamfocuser, and common secrecy rate allocation. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm. Specifically, the variables are partitioned into three blocks, where one block is solved via a surrogate optimization method, while the others are updated in closed form. Simulation results reveal that our transmit scheme: (1) approaches fully digital beamfocusing with substantially fewer radio frequency chains, (2) outperforms conventional beamfocusing-only and far-field security schemes, and (3) preserves secrecy without significantly compromising communication rates.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis for Deep Sparse Coding via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the intersection of sparse coding theory and deep learning to enhance our understanding of feature extraction capabilities in advanced neural network architectures. We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish a thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature-learning tasks. We additionally extend this convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for the extraction of deep-sparse features. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn sparser features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insight for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.</description>

Abstract: The advent of large-scale quantum computers implies that our existing public-key cryptography infrastructure has become insecure. That means that the privacy of many mobile applications involving dynamic peer groups, such as multicast messaging or pay-per-view, could be compromised. In this work we propose a generalization of the well known group key exchange protocol proposed by Burmester and Desmedt to the non-abelian case by the use of finite group actions and we prove that the presented protocol is secure in Katz and Yung's model.</description>

      <title>Reducing measurements in quantum erasure correction by quantum local recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As measurements are costly and prone to errors on certain quantum computing devices, we should reduce the number of measurements and the number of measured qudits as small as possible in quantum erasure correction. It is intuitively obvious that a decoder can omit measurements of stabilizers that are irrelevant to erased qudits, but this intuition has not been rigorously formalized as far as the author is aware. In this paper, we formalize relevant stabilizers sufficient to correct erased qudits with a quantum stabilizer code, by using a recent idea from quantum local recovery. The minimum required number of measured stabilizer observables is also clarified. As an application, we also show that correction of $\delta$ erasures on a generalized surface code proposed by Delfosse, Iyer and Poulin requires at most $\delta$ measurements of vertexes and at most $\delta$ measurements of faces, independently of its code parameters.</description>

      <title>CaFTRA: Frequency-Domain Correlation-Aware Feedback-Free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental design of wireless systems toward AI-native 6G and beyond is driven by the need for ever-increasing demand of mobile data traffic, extreme spectral efficiency, and adaptability across diverse service scenarios. To overcome the limitations posed by feedback-based multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, we propose a novel frequency-domain Correlation-aware Feedback-free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation (CaFTRA) framework tailored for fully-decoupled radio access networks (FD-RAN) to meet the emerging requirements of AI-Native 6G and beyond. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), CaFTRA effectively eliminates real-time uplink feedback by predicting channel state information (CSI) based solely on user geolocation. We introduce a Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network for CSI mapping from user geolocation, which utilizes multi-head attention and learnable query embeddings to accurately capture frequency-domain correlations among resource blocks (RBs), thereby significantly improving the precision of CSI prediction. Once base stations (BSs) adopt feedback-free transmission, their downlink transmission coverage can be significantly expanded due to the elimination of frequent uplink feedback. To enable efficient resource scheduling under such extensive-coverage scenarios, we apply a low-complexity many-to-one matching theory-based algorithm for efficient multi-BS association and multi-RB resource allocation, which is proven to converge to a stable matching within limited iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that CaFTRA achieves stable matching convergence and significant gains in spectral efficiency and user fairness compared to 5G, underscoring its potential value for 6G standardization efforts.</description>

      <title>An Information Theory of Finite Abstractions and their Fundamental Scalability Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite abstractions are discrete approximations of dynamical systems, such that the set of abstraction trajectories contains, in a formal sense, all system trajectories. There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And, yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results concerning their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the branch of information theory studying lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems in a higher-dimensional ambient space. Rate represents abstraction size, while distortion describes abstraction accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and a threshold on abstraction size. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through generalized entropy. We demonstrate the bound's tightness on certain dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how the developed theory can be employed to construct optimal abstractions, in terms of the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system.</description>
