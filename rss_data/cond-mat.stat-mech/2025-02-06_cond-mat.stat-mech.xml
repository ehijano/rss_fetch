      <title>Monitored interacting Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically study interacting Dirac fermions, described by the Thirring model, under weak local particle number measurements with monitoring rate $\gamma$. This system maps to a bosonic replica field theory, analyzed via the renormalization group. For a nonzero attractive interaction, a phase transition occurs at a critical measurement strength $\gamma_c$. When $\gamma&gt;\gamma_c$, the system enters a localized phase characterized by exponentially decaying density-density correlations beyond a finite correlation length; for $\gamma&lt;\gamma_c$, the correlations decay algebraically. The transition is of BKT-type, reflected by a characteristic scaling of the correlation length. In the non-interacting limit, $\gamma_c\to0$ shifts to zero, reducing the algebraic phase to a single point in parameter space. This identifies weak measurements in the free case as an implicit double fine-tuning to the critical endpoint of the BKT phase transition. Along the non-interacting line, we compute the entanglement entropy from density-density correlation functions and find no entanglement transition at nonzero measurement strength in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perhaps the simplest approach to constructing models with sub-dimensional particles or fractons is to require the conservation of dipole or higher multipole moments. We generalize this approach to allow for moments in phase space and classify all possible classical fracton models with phase-space multipole conservation laws. We focus on a new self-dual model that conserves both dipole and quadrupole moments in position and momentum; we analyze its dynamics and find quasi-periodic orbits in phase space that evade ergodic exploration of the full phase space.</description>

      <title>Nested Stochastic Resetting: Nonequilibrium Steady-states and Exact Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting breaks detailed balance and drives the formation of nonequilibrium steady states . Here, we consider a chain of diffusive processes $x_i(t)$ that interact unilaterally: at random time intervals, the process $x_n$ stochastically resets to the instantaneous value of $x_{n-1}$. We derive analytically the steady-state statistics of these nested stochastic resetting processes including the stationary distribution for each process as well as its moments. We are also able to calculate exactly the steady-state two-point correlations $\langle x_n x_{n+j}\rangle$ between processes by mapping the problem to one of the ordering statistics of random counting processes. Understanding statistics and correlations in many-particle nonequilibrium systems remains a formidable challenge and our results provide an example of such tractable correlations. We expect this framework will both help build a model-independent framework for random processes with unilateral interactions and find immediate applications, e.g. in the modelling of lossy information propagation.</description>

      <title>Time scale competition in the Active Coagulation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spreading processes on top of active dynamics provide a novel theoretical framework for capturing emerging collective behavior in living systems. I consider run-and-tumble dynamics coupled with coagulation/decoagulation reactions that lead to an absorbing state phase transition. While the active dynamics does not change the location of the transition point, the relaxation toward the stationary state depends on motility parameters. Because of the competition between spreading dynamics and active motion, the system can support long-living currents whose typical time scale is a nontrivial function of motility and reaction rates. Beyond the mean-field regime, instability at finite length scales regulates a crossover from periodic to diffusive modes. Finally, it is possible to individuate different mechanisms of pattern formation on a large time scale, ranging from Fisher-Kolmogorov to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential-in-volume tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lieb-Robinson bounds demonstrate the emergence of locality in many-body quantum systems. Intuitively, Lieb-Robinson bounds state that with local or exponentially decaying interactions, the correlation that can be built up between two sites separated by distance $r$ after a time $t$ decays as $\exp(vt-r)$, where $v$ is the emergent Lieb-Robinson velocity. In many problems, it is important to also capture how much of an operator grows to act on $r^d$ sites in $d$ spatial dimensions. Perturbation theory and cluster expansion methods suggest that at short times, these volume-filling operators are suppressed as $\exp(-r^d)$ at short times. We confirm this intuition, showing that for $r &gt; vt$, the volume-filling operator is suppressed by $\exp(-(r-vt)^d/(vt)^{d-1})$. This closes a conceptual and practical gap between the cluster expansion and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We then present two very different applications of this new bound. Firstly, we obtain improved bounds on the classical computational resources necessary to simulate many-body dynamics with error tolerance $\epsilon$ for any finite time $t$: as $\epsilon$ becomes sufficiently small, only $\epsilon^{-O(t^{d-1})}$ resources are needed. A protocol that likely saturates this bound is given. Secondly, we prove that disorder operators have volume-law suppression near the "solvable (Ising) point" in quantum phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking, which implies a new diagnostic for distinguishing many-body phases of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Observation of slow relaxation due to Hilbert space fragmentation in strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While isolated quantum systems generally thermalize after long-time evolution, there are several exceptions defying thermalization. A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide the first experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.</description>

      <title>Cooperation, satisfaction, and rationality in social games on complex networks with aspiration-driven players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A network model based on players' aspirations is proposed and analyzed theoretically and numerically within the framework of evolutionary game theory. In this model, players decide whether to cooperate or defect by comparing their payoffs from pairwise games with their neighbors, driven by a common aspiration level. The model also incorporates a degree of irrationality through an effective temperature in the Fermi function. The level of cooperation in the system is fundamentally influenced by two social attributes: satisfaction, defined as the fraction of players whose payoffs exceed the aspiration level, and the degree of rationality in decision-making. Rational players tend to maintain their initial strategies for sufficiently low aspiration levels, while irrational agents promote a state of perfect coexistence, resulting in half of the agents cooperating. The transition between these two behaviors can be critical, often leading to abrupt changes in cooperation levels. When the aspiration level is high, all players become dissatisfied, regardless of the effective temperature. Intermediate aspiration levels result in diverse behaviors, including sudden transitions for rational agents and a non-monotonic relationship between cooperation and increased irrationality. The study also carefully examines the effects of the interaction structure, initial conditions, and the strategy update rule (asynchronous versus synchronous). Special attention is given to the prisoner's dilemma, where significant cooperation levels can be achieved in a structured environment, with moderate aspiration and high rationality settings, and following a synchronous strategy updating scheme.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitivity without conformational spread: A mechanical origin for non-equilibrium cooperativity in the bacterial flagellar motor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flagellar motors enable bacteria to navigate their environments by switching rotation direction in response to external cues with high sensitivity. Previous work suggested that ultrasensitivity of the flagellar motor originates from conformational spread, in which subunits of the switching complex are strongly coupled to their neighbors as in an equilibrium Ising model. However, dynamic single-motor measurements indicated that rotation switching is driven out of equilibrium, and the mechanism for this dissipative driving remains unknown. Here, based on recent cryo-EM structures, we propose that local mechanical torques on motor subunits can affect their conformation dynamics. This gives rise to a tug of war between stator-associated subunits, which produces cooperative, non-equilibrium switching responses without requiring nearest-neighbor interactions. Since subunits are effectively coupled at a distance, we call this mechanism ``Global Mechanical Coupling." Our model makes a qualitatively new prediction that the motor response cooperativity grows with the number of stators driving rotation. Re-analyzing published motor dose-response curves in varying load conditions, we find tentative experimental evidence for this prediction. Finally, we show that operating out of equilibrium enables motors to achieve high cooperativity with faster responses compared to equilibrium motors. Our results suggest a general role for mechanics in sensitive chemical regulation.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the polydisperse random close packing problem in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory for the random close packing density, $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using a theoretical approach based on the equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)], which was recently justified based on extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the hard-sphere phase diagram [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the underlying equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions of $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$ as a function of the ratio of the standard deviation of the disk diameter distribution to its mean $s$. For the power-law size distribution evaluated at $s=0.246$, the theory yields $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.892$, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.905$ based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)].</description>

      <title>Heat engines for scale invariant systems dual to black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to holography, a black hole is dual to a thermal state in a strongly coupled quantum system. The principle example of holography is the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. We construct reversible heat engines where the working substance consists of a static thermal equilibrium state of a CFT. For thermal states dual to an asymptotically AdS black hole, this yields a novel realization of Johnson's holographic heat engines. We compute the efficiency for a number of idealized heat engines, such as the Carnot, Brayton, Otto, Diesel, and Stirling cycles. The efficiency of most heat engines can be derived from the CFT equation of state, which follows from scale invariance, and we compare them to the efficiencies for an ideal gas. However, the Stirling efficiency for a generic CFT is uniquely determined in terms of its characteristic temperature and volume only in the high-temperature or large-volume regime. We derive an exact expression for the Stirling efficiency for CFT states dual to AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, and compare the subleading corrections in the high-temperature regime with those in a generic CFT.</description>

      <title>Continuous non-equilibrium transition driven by the heat flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.12765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discovered an out-of-equilibrium transition in the ideal gas between two walls, divided by an inner, adiabatic, movable wall. The system is driven out-of-equilibrium by supplying energy directly into the volume of the gas. At critical heat flux, we have found a continuous transition to the state with a low-density, hot gas on one side of the movable wall and a dense, cold gas on the other side. Molecular dynamic simulations of the soft-sphere fluid confirm the existence of the transition in the interacting system. We introduce a stationary state Helmholtz-like function whose minimum determines the stable positions of the internal wall. This transition can be used as a paradigm of transitions in stationary states and the Helmholtz-like function as a paradigm of the thermodynamic description of these states.</description>

      <title>Field theories of active particle systems and their entropy production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active particles that translate chemical energy into self-propulsion can maintain a far-from-equilibrium steady state and perform work. The entropy production measures how far from equilibrium such a particle system operates and serves as a proxy for the work performed. Field theory offers a promising route to calculating entropy production, as it allows for many interacting particles to be considered simultaneously. Approximate field theories obtained by coarse-graining or smoothing that draw on additive noise can capture densities and correlations well, but they generally ignore the microscopic particle nature of the constituents, thereby producing spurious results for the entropy production. As an alternative we demonstrate how to use Doi-Peliti field theories, which capture the microscopic dynamics, including reactions and interactions with external and pair potentials. Such field theories are in principle exact, while offering a systematic approximation scheme, in the form of diagrammatics. We demonstrate how to construct them from a Fokker-Planck equation and show how to calculate entropy production of active matter from first principles. This framework is easily extended to include interaction. We use it to derive exact, compact and efficient general expressions for the entropy production for a vast range of interacting conserved particle systems. These expressions are independent of the underlying field theory and can be interpreted as the spatial average of the local entropy production. They are readily applicable to numerical and experimental data. In general, the entropy production due to any pair interaction draws at most on the three point, equal time density; and an $n$-point interaction on the $(2n-1)$-point density. We illustrate the technique in a number of exact, tractable examples, including some with pair-interaction as well as in a system of many interacting ABPs.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity in open quantum critical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs) through counterdiabatic driving in quantum critical systems in the presence of dissipation. We evaluate unitary as well as nonunitary controls, such that the system density matrix follows a prescribed trajectory corresponding to the eigenstates of a time-dependent reference Hamiltonian at any instant of time. The strength of the dissipator control term for the low-energy states shows universal scaling close to criticality. Using the example of free-fermionic systems, in particular, the transverse-field Ising model, we show that in contrast to STAs in closed quantum critical systems, here, STAs may require multibody interactions terms, even away from criticality, owing to the change in entropy of the time-dependent target state. Further, the associated heat current shows an extremum, while power dissipation changes curvature, close to criticality, and analogous to unitary control, no operational cost is associated with implementation of the exact counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. We believe the counterdiabatic protocol studied here could be of fundamental importance for understanding STAs in many-body open quantum systems and could be highly relevant for varied topics involving open many-body quantum systems, such as quantum computation and many-body quantum heat engines.</description>

Abstract: Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is a defining property of non-equilibrium systems, such as active matter, which is composed of units that consume energy. We employ a formalism that allows us to derive a class of identities associated with the time-reversal transformation in non-equilibrium field theories, in the spirit of Ward-Takahashi identities. We present a generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for active systems as a particular realization of such an identity, and consider its implications and applications for a range of active field theories. The field theoretical toolbox developed here helps to quantify the degree of non-equilibrium activity of complex systems exhibiting collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Entropic selection of magnetization in a frustrated 2D magnetic model</title>

Abstract: We discuss the magnetic ground state and properties of a frustrated two-dimensional classical Heisenberg model of interacting hexagonal clusters of spins. The energy of the ground states is found exactly for arbitrary values of $J_1$ (intra-cluster couplings) and $J_2$ (inter-cluster couplings). Our main results concern a frustrated region of the phase diagram, where we show that the set of ground states has a degeneracy larger than that due to global rotation symmetry. Furthermore, the ground state manifold does not have a fixed total magnetization~: there is a range of allowed values. At finite temperature, our Monte-Carlo simulations show that the entropy selects the most probable value of the total magnetization, while the histogram of the Monte-Carlo time series is non-trivial. This model is a first step towards modelling properties of a class of frustrated magnetic structures composed of coupled spin clusters.</description>

      <title>Multi-Type Instability Processes of Periodic Orbits in Nonlinear Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear normal modes are periodic orbits that survive in nonlinear many-body Hamiltonian systems, and their instability is crucial for relaxation dynamics. Here, we study the instability process of the $\pi/3$-mode in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-$\alpha$ chain with fixed boundary conditions. We find that three types of bifurcations -- period-doubling, tangent, and Hopf -- coexist in this system, each driving instability at specific reduced wave-number $\tilde{k}$. Our analysis reveals a universal scaling law for the instability time $\mathcal{T} \propto (\lambda - \lambda_{\rm c})^{-1/2}$, independent of bifurcation types and models, where the critical perturbation strength $\lambda_{\rm c}$ scales as $\lambda_{\rm c} \propto (\tilde{k} - \tilde{k}_{\rm c})$, with $\tilde{k}_{\rm c}$ varying across bifurcations. We also observe a double instability phenomenon for certain system sizes, meaning that larger perturbations do not always lead to faster thermalization. These results provide new insights into the relaxation and thermalization dynamics in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Strange relaxation and metastable behaviours of the Ising ferromagnetic thick cubic shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the equilibrium and nonequilibrium behaviours of the Ising ferromagnetic thick cubic shell by Monte Carlo simulation. Our goal is to find the dependence of the responses on the thickness of the shell. In the equilibrium results, we found that the pseudo-critical temperature of ferro-para phase transition of thick cubic shell increases with the increase of the thickness following a hyperbolic tangent relation. In the nonequilibrium studies, the relaxation time has been found to decrease with the increase of the thickness of the cubic shell. Here three different regimes are found, namely rapid fall, plateau and linear region. The metastable behaviour has been studied also as another kind of non-equilibrium response. The metastable lifetime has been studied as function of the thickness of the cubic shell. A non-monotonic variation of metastable lifetime with the thickness of the shell is observed. A specified thickness for longest-lived metastability has been identified.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Robust and Efficient Quantum Property Learning with Shallow Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is a major component of quantum information processing tasks. Randomized measurements, or classical shadows, enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single-qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Prepending a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements maintains this experimental friendliness, but also has favorable sample complexities for observables beyond low-weight Paulis, including high-weight Paulis and global low-rank properties such as fidelity. However, in realistic scenarios, quantum noise accumulated with each additional layer of the shallow circuit biases the results. To address these challenges, we propose the \emph{robust shallow shadows protocol}. Our protocol uses Bayesian inference to learn the experimentally relevant noise model and mitigate it in postprocessing. This mitigation introduces a bias-variance trade-off: correcting for noise-induced bias comes at the cost of a larger estimator variance. Despite this increased variance, as we demonstrate on a superconducting quantum processor, our protocol correctly recovers state properties such as expectation values, fidelity, and entanglement entropy, while maintaining a lower sample complexity compared to the random single qubit measurement scheme. We also theoretically analyze the effects of noise on sample complexity and show how the optimal choice of the shallow shadow depth varies with noise strength. This combined theoretical and experimental analysis positions the robust shallow shadow protocol as a scalable, robust, and sample-efficient protocol for characterizing quantum states on current quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Extracting the symmetries of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries play a pivotal role in our understanding of the properties of quantum many-body systems. While there are theorems and a well-established toolbox for systems in thermal equilibrium, much less is known about the role of symmetries and their connection to dynamics out of equilibrium. This arises due to the direct link between a system's thermal state and its Hamiltonian, which is generally not the case for nonequilibrium dynamics. Here we present a pathway to identify the effective symmetries and to extract them from data in nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. Our approach is based on exact relations between correlation functions involving different numbers of spatial points, which can be viewed as nonequilibrium versions of (equal-time) Ward identities encoding the symmetries of the system. We derive symmetry witnesses, which are particularly suitable for the analysis of measured or simulated data at different snapshots in time. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we apply our method to numerical and experimental data for a spinor Bose gas. We investigate the important question of a dynamical restoration of an explicitly broken symmetry of the Hamiltonian by the initial state. Remarkably, it is found that effective symmetry restoration can occur long before the system equilibrates. We also use the approach to define and identify spontaneous symmetry breaking far from equilibrium, which is of great relevance for applications to nonequilibrium phase transitions. Our work opens new avenues for the classification and analysis of quantum as well as classical many-body dynamics in a large variety of systems, ranging from ultracold quantum gases to cosmology.</description>

      <title>$NVU$ view on energy polydisperse Lennard-Jones systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When energy polydispersity is introduced into the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system, there is little effect on structure and dynamics [Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point both the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by even large energy polydispersity; this is in stark contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue -- and validate by simulations of up to 30\% polydispersity -- that this almost invariance of structure and dynamics reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface. Because $NVU$ dynamics (defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy) is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface implies virtually the same physics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as of the standard single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy surface is significantly affected by introducing size polydispersity.</description>
