      <title>The exotic structure of the spectral $\zeta$-function for the Schr\"odinger operator with P\"oschl--Teller potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the analysis of the spectral $\zeta$-function associated with a Schr\"{o}dinger operator endowed with a P\"oschl--Teller potential. We construct the spectral $\zeta$-function using a contour integral representation and, for particular self-adjoint extensions, we perform its analytic continuation to a larger region of the complex plane. We show that the spectral $\zeta$-function in these cases can possess a very unusual and remarkable structure consisting of a series of logarithmic branch points located at every nonpositive integer value of $s$ along with infinitely many additional branch points (and finitely many simple poles) whose locations depend on the parameters of the problem. By comparing the P\"oschl--Teller potential to the classic Bessel potential, we further illustrate that perturbing a given potential by a smooth potential on a finite interval can greatly affect the meromorphic structure and branch points of the spectral $\zeta$-function in surprising ways.</description>

      <title>Wave scattering at a rectangular junction of four waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the scattering of linear waves in two dimensions by a rectangular region at the junction of four waveguides. A solution to the frequency domain problem is obtained by exploiting reflective symmetry to reduce the full problem to sub-problems defined on one quadrant of the junction. These sub-problems are solved using the eigenfunction matching method. The solution to the problem on the full region is then recovered from the solutions to the sub-problems, and a scattering matrix for the junction is presented. Finally, the solution in the time domain is constructed as a superposition of the frequency domain solutions and visualised for a range of incident pulses and waveguide geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I present the state of the art concerning the theoretical detectability (and the open challenges for the experimental detectability) of a special class of paraparticles beyond bosons and fermions. The particles under considerations obey a parastatistics and (unlike anyons which transform under the braid group) are mutually exchanged via the permutation group.</description>

      <title>Universality for random matrices with an edge spectrum singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study invariant random matrix ensembles \begin{equation*}
  \mathbb{P}_n(d M)=Z_n^{-1}\exp(-n\,tr(V(M)))\,d M \end{equation*} defined on complex Hermitian matrices $M$ of size $n\times n$, where $V$ is real analytic such that the underlying density of states is one-cut regular. Considering the average \begin{equation*}
  E_n[\phi;\lambda,\alpha,\beta]:=\mathbb{E}_n\bigg(\prod_{\ell=1}^n\big(1-\phi(\lambda_{\ell}(M))\big)\omega_{\alpha\beta}(\lambda_{\ell}(M)-\lambda)\bigg),\ \ \ \ \ \omega_{\alpha\beta}(x):=|x|^{\alpha}\begin{cases}1,&amp;x&lt;0\\ \beta,&amp;x\geq 0\end{cases}, \end{equation*} taken with respect to the above law and where $\phi$ is a suitable test function, we evaluate its large-$n$ asymptotic assuming that $\lambda$ lies within the soft edge boundary layer, and $(\alpha,\beta)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{C}$ satisfy $\alpha&gt;-1,\beta\notin(-\infty,0)$. Our results are obtained by using Riemann-Hilbert problems for orthogonal polynomials and integrable operators and they extend previous results of Forrester and Witte \cite{FW} that were obtained by an application of Okamoto's $\tau$-function theory. A key role throughout is played by distinguished solutions to the Painlev\'e-XXXIV equation.</description>

      <title>Mock modularity of Calabi-Yau threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating functions $h_r(\tau)$ of D4-D2-D0 BPS indices, appearing in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identical to rank 0 Donaldson-Thomas invariants, are known to be higher depth mock modular forms satisfying a specific modular anomaly equation, with depth determined by the D4-brane charge $r$. We develop a method to solve the anomaly equation for arbitrary charges, in terms of indefinite theta series. This allows us to find the generating functions up to modular forms that can be fixed by computing just a finite number of Fourier coefficients of $h_r$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain simple formulas for the matrix elements of the resolvent operator (the Green's function) in any finite set of square integrable basis. These formulas are suitable for numerical computations whether the basis elements are orthogonal or not. A byproduct of our findings is an expression for the normalized eigenvectors of a matrix in terms of its eigenvalues. We give a physical application as an illustration of how useful these results can be.</description>

      <title>Ordered random walks and the Airy line ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Airy line ensemble is a random collection of continuous ordered paths that plays an important role within random matrix theory and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. The aim of this paper is to prove a universality property of the Airy line ensemble. We study growing numbers of i.i.d. continuous-time random walks which are then conditioned to stay in the same order for all time using a Doob h-transform. We consider a general class of increment distributions; a sufficient condition is the existence of an exponential moment and a log-concave density. We prove that the top particles in this system converge in an edge scaling limit to the Airy line ensemble in a regime where the number of random walks is required to grow slower than a certain power (with a non-optimal exponent 3/50) of the expected number of random walk steps. Furthermore, in a similar regime we prove that the law of large numbers and fluctuations of linear statistics agree with non-intersecting Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>$C^{k}$-regular extremal black holes in maximally-symmetric spacetime and the third law of black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we extend the proof of Ryan Unger and Christoph Kehle's work, "Gravitational collapse to extremal black holes and the third law of black hole thermodynamics", to construct examples of black hole formation from regular, one-ended asymptotically flat Cauchy data for the Einstein-Maxwell charged scalar field system in maximally-symmetric 3+1 dimensional spacetime which are exactly isometric to $dS_{4}/AdS_{4}$ Reissner N\"ordstrom black holes after a finite advanced time along the event horizon. Furthermore, the apparent horizon coincides with that of a vacuum at finite advanced time.
  This paper exists as an extension of the aforementioned work done by Unger and Kehle which disproves the "third law of black hole thermodynamics" originally posed by Hawking and Bardeen's "The Four Laws of Black Hole Mechanics". We begin with a brief introduction to the history of black hole thermodynamics, tracing the the lineage of the third law of black hole thermodynamics up to Kehle &amp; Unger's 2022 work; the basepoint for our extension to dS/AdS spacetime. We adapt the machinery from Kehle and Unger to Schwarzschild and Reissner-N\"ordstrom solutions in $dS_{4}$ and $AdS_{4}$ spacetime. Then, we study the relevant manifold gluing theory and reprove necessary gluing theorems in $dS_{4}$ and $AdS_{4}$. Finally, we provide analysis of the third law of black hole thermodynamics in these maximally symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the regularisation of a differential system related to generalised Krawtchouk polynomials. We show a straightforward connection between certain auxiliary quantities involving the recurrence coefficients of these polynomials and Painlev\'e V equation via iterative regularisation. Furthermore, we explore how iterative regularisation yields polynomial systems and enables us to find decompositions of certain birational transformations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Stokes origami: folds, cusps and skyrmionic facets in random polarisation fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the jacobian of a random transverse polarisation field, from the transverse plane to the Poincar\'e sphere, as a Skyrme density partially covering the sphere. Connected domains of the plane where the jacobian has the same sign -- patches -- map to facets subtending some general solid angle on the Poincar\'e sphere. As a generic continuous mapping between surfaces, we interpret the polarisation pattern on the sphere in terms of fold lines (corresponding to the crease lines between neighbouring patches) and cusp points (where fold lines meet). We perform a basic statistical analysis of the properties of the patches and facets, including a brief discussion of the percolation properties of the jacobian domains. Connections with abstract origami manifolds are briefly considered. This analysis combines previous studies of structured skyrmionic polarisation patterns with random polarisation patterns, suggesting a particle-like interpretation of random patches as polarisation skyrmionic anyons.</description>

      <title>Interacting phantom dark energy: new accelerating scaling attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed investigation of interacting phantom cosmology, by applying the powerful method of dynamical system analysis. We consider two well-studied interaction forms, namely one global and one local one, while the novel ingredient of our work is the examination of new potentials for the phantom field. Our analysis shows the existence of saddle matter-dominated points, stable dark-energy dominated points, and scaling accelerating solutions, that can attract the Universe at late times. As we show, some of the stable accelerating scaling attractors, in which dark matter and dark energy can co-exist, alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem, are totally new, even for the previously studied interaction rates, and arise purely from the novel potential forms.</description>

      <title>Entropy formula of folding type for $C^{1+\alpha}$ maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, Ruelle derived explicit formulae for entropy production of smooth dynamical systems. The vanishing or strictly positivity of entropy production is determined by the entropy formula of folding type \[h_{\mu}(f)= F_{\mu}(f)-\displaystyle\int\sum\nolimits_{\lambda_i(f, x)&lt;0} \lambda_i(f, x)d\mu(x), \] which relates the metric entropy, folding entropy and negative Lyapunov exponents. This paper establishes the formula for all $C^{1+\alpha}$ maps, including those with degeneracy. More specifically, the entropy formula of folding type holds if and, under a condition on the Jacobian of the map, only if $\mu$ has absolutely continuous conditional measures on the stable manifolds. To overcome the degeneracy, the Pesin Theory for general $C^{1+\alpha}$ maps is developed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scale factor Duality Symmetry in Symmetric Teleparallel Scalar-tensor FLRW Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the Gasperini-Veneziano scale factor duality symmetry for the dilaton field in scalar-tensor theory and its extension in teleparallelism. Within the framework of symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor theory, we consider a spatially flat Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Walker metric cosmology. For the three possible connections, we write the corresponding point-like Lagrangians for the gravitational field equations, and we construct discrete transformations which generalize the Gasperini-Veneziano scale factor duality symmetry. The discrete transformations depend on the parameter which defines the coupling between the scalar field and the nonmetricity scalar. The Gasperini-Veneziano duality symmetry is recovered for a specific limit of this free parameter. Furthermore, we derive the conservation laws for the classical field equations for these models, and we present the origin of the discrete transformations. Finally, we discuss the integrability properties of the model, and exact solutions are determined.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensate Vortices with Hypercylindrical Symmetry using Zeroth-order Dimensional Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate D-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in a hypercylindrical trap with a vortex core along the z-axis and quantized circulation $\hbar m$. We analytically approximate the hypercylindrical Gross-Pitaevskii equation using dimensional perturbation theory, where the perturbation parameter is $\delta=1/(D+2|m|-3)$. We analyze lower effective dimensions due to trap anisotropy, and we compute properties of vortices in higher dimensions motivated by the study of synthetic dimensions, where additional dimensions can be simulated experimentally, and by holographic duality, where a higher-dimensional gravitational model corresponds to a lower-dimensional quantum model. We derive zeroth-order ($\delta \to 0$) semiclassical approximations for the condensate density, energy, chemical potential, and critical vortex rotation speed in arbitrary dimensions. In the zeroth-order approximation, we observe crossings between energy levels for different dimensions as a function of interaction strength and anisotropy parameters.</description>

      <title>Large systems of symmetrized trapped Brownian Bridges and Schrodinger processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a large system of $N$ Brownian motions in $\R ^d$ fixed on a time interval $[0,\beta]$ with symmetrized initial and terminal conditions, under the influence of a trap potential. Such systems describe systems of bosons at positive temperatures confined in a spatial domain. We describe the large $N$ behavior of the averaged path (that is, their empirical path measure) and its connection with a well known optimal transport problem formulated by Erwin Schr\"odinger. We also explore the asymptotic behavior of the Brownian motions in terms of Large Deviations. In particular, the rate function that governs the mean of occupation measures turns out to be the well-known Donsker-Varadhan rate function. We therefore prove a simple formula for the large $N$ asymptotic of the symmetrized trace of $e^{-\beta \Hcal_N}$, where $\Hcal_N$ is an $N$ particle Hamilton operator in a trap</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish new explicit connections between classical (scalar) and matrix Gegenbauer polynomials, which result in new symmetries of the latter and further give access to several properties that have been out of reach before: generating functions, distribution of zeros for individual entries of the matrices and new type of differential-difference structure. We further speculate about other potentials of the connection formulas found. Part of our proofs makes use of creative telescoping in a matrix setting$-$the strategy which is not yet developed algorithmically.</description>

Abstract: Given a smooth integral two-form and a smooth potential on the flat torus of dimension 2, we study the high energy properties of the corresponding magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. Under a geometric condition on the magnetic field, we show that every sequence of high energy eigenfunctions satisfies the quantum unique ergodicity property even if the Liouville measure is not ergodic for the underlying classical flow (the Euclidean geodesic flow on the 2-torus).</description>

      <title>Cosmological solutions in teleparallel $F(T,B)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we find several teleparallel $F(T,B)$ solutions for a Robertson-Walker (TRW) cosmological spacetime. We first set and solve the $F(T,B)$-type field equations for a linear perfect fluid. Using similar techniques, we then find new $F(T,B)$ solutions for non-linear perfect fluids with a weak-quadratic correction term to the linear equation of state (EoS). Finally, we solve for new classes of $F(T,B)$ solutions for a scalar field source by assuming a power-law scalar field and then an exponential scalar field in terms of the time-coordinate. For flat cosmological cases ($k=0$ cases), we find new exact and approximate $F(T,B)$ solutions. For non-flat cases ($k=\pm 1$ cases), we only find new teleparallel $F(T,B)$ solutions for some specific and well-defined cosmological expansion subcases. We conclude by briefly discussing the impact of these new teleparallel solutions on cosmological processes such as dark energy quintessence and phantom energy models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores displaced fermionic Gaussian operators with nonzero linear terms. We first demonstrate equivalence between several characterizations of displaced Gaussian states. We also provide an efficient classical simulation protocol for displaced Gaussian circuits and demonstrate their computational equivalence to circuits composed of nearest-neighbor matchgates augmented by single-qubit gates on the initial line. Finally, we construct a novel Gaussianity-preserving unitary embedding that maps $n$-qubit displaced Gaussian states to $(n+1)$-qubit even Gaussian states. This embedding facilitates the generalization of existing Gaussian testing protocols to displaced Gaussian states and unitaries. Our results provide new tools to analyze fermionic systems beyond the constraints of parity super-selection, extending the theoretical understanding and practical simulation of fermionic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Bit symmetry entails the symmetry of the quantum transition probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is quite common to use the generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs) as generic models to reconstruct quantum theory from a few basic principles and to gain a better understanding of the probabilistic or information theoretic foundations of quantum physics and quantum computing. A variety of symmetry postulates was introduced and studied in this framework, including the transitivity of the automorphism group (1) on the pure states, (2) on the pairs of orthogonal pure states [these pairs are called 2-frames] and (3) on any frames of the same size. The second postulate is M\"uller and Ududec's bit symmetry, which they motivate by quantum computational needs. Here we explore these three postulates in the transition probability framework, which is more specific than the GPTs since the existence of the transition probabilities for the quantum logical atoms is presupposed either directly or indirectly via a certain geometric property of the state space. This property for compact convex sets was introduced by the author in a recent paper. We show that bit symmetry implicates the symmetry of the transition probabilities between the atoms. Using a result by Barnum and Hilgert, we can then conclude that the third rather strong symmetry postulate rules out all models but the classical cases and in the simple Euclidean Jordan algebras.</description>

      <title>Classification of higher grade $\ell$ graphs for $\mathrm{U}(N)^2\times \mathrm{O}(D)$ multi-matrix models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The authors studied in [Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e D 9, 367-433, (2022)], a complex multi-matrix model with $\mathrm{U}(N)^2 \times \mathrm{O}(D)$ symmetry, and whose double scaling limit where simultaneously the large-$N$ and large-$D$ limits were taken while keeping the ratio $N/\sqrt{D}=M$ finite and fixed. In this double scaling limit, the complete recursive characterization of the Feynman graphs of arbitrary genus for the leading order grade $\ell=0$ was achieved. In this current study, we classify the higher order graphs in $\ell$. More specifically, $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ with arbitrary genus, in addition to a specific class of two-particle-irreducible (2PI) graphs for higher $\ell \geqslant 3$ but with genus zero. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each 2PI graph with a single $\mathrm{O}(D)$-loop with an arbitrary $\ell$ corresponds to a reduced alternating knot diagram with $\ell$ crossings as listed in the Rolfsen knot table, or a resulting alternating knot diagram obtained after performing the Tait flyping moves. We generalize to 2PR by considering the connected sum and the Reidemeister move I.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

Abstract: We provide the first counterexample showing that the ground state energy of electrons in an external Coulomb potential is not always a convex function of the number of electrons. This convexity has been conjectured for decades and plays an important role in quantum chemistry. Our counterexample involves six nuclei with small fractional charges placed far apart. The ground state energy of 3 electrons is shown to be higher than the average of the energies for 2 and 4 electrons. We also show that the nuclei can bind 2 or 4 electrons, but not 3. This article raises the question of whether the energy convexity really holds for all possible molecules (with nuclei of integer charge).</description>

      <title>The Character Map in Equivariant Twistorial Cohomotopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental notion of non-abelian generalized cohomology gained recognition in algebraic topology as the non-abelian Poincar\'e-dual to "factorization homology", and in theoretical physics as providing flux-quantization for non-linear Gauss laws. However, already the archetypical example -- unstable Cohomotopy, first studied almost a century ago by Pontrjagin -- may remain underappreciated as a cohomology theory.
  In illustration and amplification of its cohomological nature, we construct the non-abelian generalization of the Chern character map on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariantized 7-Cohomotopy -- in fact on its "twistorial" version classified by complex projective 3-space -- essentially by computing its equivariant Sullivan model, and we highlight some interesting integral cohomology classes which are extracted this way.
  We end with an outlook on the application of this result to the rigorous deduction of anyonic quantum states on M5-branes wrapped over Seifert 3-orbifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend recent results on discrete approximations of the Laplacian in $\mathbf{R}^d$ with norm resolvent convergence to the corresponding results for Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on a half-space. The resolvents of the discrete Dirichlet/Neumann Laplacians are embedded into the continuum using natural discretization and embedding operators. Norm resolvent convergence to their continuous counterparts is proven with a quadratic rate in the mesh size. These results generalize with a limited rate to also include operators with a real, bounded, and H\"older continuous potential, as well as certain functions of the Dirichlet/Neumann Laplacians, including any positive real power.

Abstract: We prove the existence of a class of orbitally stable bound state solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with super-quadratic confinement in two and three spatial dimensions. These solutions are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile which in itself is obtained via a doubly constrained energy minimization. One of the two constraints imposed is the total mass, while the other is given by the expectation value of the angular momentum around the z-axis. Our approach also allows for a new description of the set of minimizers subject to only a single mass constraint.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Chirality of Vibrational Modes in Helical Molecular Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16352v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lack of quantitative methods for studying chirality has stunted our theoretical understanding of chirality-induced physical phenomena. The chiral phonon has been proposed to be involved in various physical phenomena, but it is not yet well defined mathematically. Here we examine two approaches for assigning and quantifying the chirality of molecular normal modes in double-helical molecular wires with various levels of twist. First, associating with each normal mode a structure obtained by imposing the corresponding motion on a common atomic origin, we apply the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) to quantitatively assess the relationship between the chirality-weighted normal mode spectrum and the chirality of the underlying molecular structure. We find that increasing the amount of twist in the double helix shifts the mean normal mode CCM to drastically higher values, implying that the chirality of molecular normal modes is strongly correlated with that of the underlying molecular structure. Second, we assign to each normal mode a pseudoscaler defined as the product of atomic linear and angular momentum summed over all atoms, and we analyze the handedness of the normal mode spectrum with respect to this quantity. We find that twisting the double-chain structure introduces asymmetry between right and left-handed normal modes so that in twisted structures different frequency bands are characterized by distinct handedness. This may give rise to global phenomena such as thermal chirality.</description>

      <title>Strong Error Bounds for Trotter &amp; Strang-Splittings and Their Implications for Quantum Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient error estimates for the Trotter product formula are central in quantum computing, mathematical physics, and numerical simulations. However, the Trotter error's dependency on the input state and its application to unbounded operators remains unclear. Here, we present a general theory for error estimation, including higher-order product formulas, with explicit input state dependency. Our approach overcomes two limitations of the existing operator-norm estimates in the literature. First, previous bounds are too pessimistic as they quantify the worst-case scenario. Second, previous bounds become trivial for unbounded operators and cannot be applied to a wide class of Trotter scenarios, including atomic and molecular Hamiltonians. Our method enables analytical treatment of Trotter errors in chemistry simulations, illustrated through a case study on the hydrogen atom. Our findings reveal: (i) for states with fat-tailed energy distribution, such as low-angular-momentum states of the hydrogen atom, the Trotter error scales worse than expected (sublinearly) in the number of Trotter steps; (ii) certain states do not admit an advantage in the scaling from higher-order Trotterization, and thus, the higher-order Trotter hierarchy breaks down for these states, including the hydrogen atom's ground state; (iii) the scaling of higher-order Trotter bounds might depend on the order of the Hamiltonians in the Trotter product for states with fat-tailed energy distribution. Physically, the enlarged Trotter error is caused by the atom's ionization due to the Trotter dynamics. Mathematically, we find that certain domain conditions are not satisfied by some states so higher moments of the potential and kinetic energies diverge. Our analytical error analysis agrees with numerical simulations, indicating that we can estimate the state-dependent Trotter error scaling genuinely.</description>

      <title>Quantum transition probability in convex sets and self-dual cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between the algebraic structure (operator algebras) for the quantum observables and the convex structure of the state space has been explored for a long time and most advanced results are due to Alfsen and Shultz. Here we present a more elementary approach with a more generic structure for the observables, which focuses on the transition probability of the quantum logical atoms. The binary case gives rise to the generalized qubit models and was fully developed in a preceding paper. Here we consider any case with finite information capacity (binary means that the information capacity is 2). A novel geometric property that makes any compact convex set a matching state space is presented. Generally, the transition probability is not symmetric; if it is symmetric, we get an inner product and a self-dual cone. The emerging mathematical structure comes close to the Euclidean Jordan algebras and becomes a new mathematical model for a potential extension of quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Critical spin chains and loop models with $U(n)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting with the Ising model, statistical models with global symmetries provide fruitful approaches to interesting physical systems, for example percolation or polymers. These include the $O(n)$ model (symmetry group $O(n)$) and the Potts model (symmetry group $S_Q$). Both models make sense for $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ and not just $n,Q\in \mathbb{N}$, and both give rise to a conformal field theory in the critical limit.
  Here, we study similar models based on the unitary group $U(n)$. We focus on the two-dimensional case, where the models can be described either as gases of non-intersecting orientable loops, or as alternating spin chains. This allows us to determine their spectra either by computing a twisted torus partition function, or by studying representations of the walled Brauer algebra.
  In the critical limit, our models give rise to a CFT with global $U(n)$ symmetry, which exists for any $n\in\mathbb{C}$. Its spectrum is similar to those of the $O(n)$ and Potts CFTs, but a bit simpler. We conjecture that the $O(n)$ CFT is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of the $U(n)$ CFT, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts as complex conjugation.</description>

      <title>Power law coupling Higgs-Palatini inflation with a congruence between physical and geometrical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a power law coupling Higgs inflationary model in which the background geometry is determined by the Palatini's variational principle. The geometrical symmetries of the background geometry determine the invariant form of the action of the model and the background geometry resulted is of the Weyl-integrable type. The invariant action results also invariant under the $U(1)$ group, which in general is not compatible with the Weyl group of invariance of the background geometry. However, we found compatibility conditions between the geometrical and physical symmetries of the action in the strong coupling limit. We found that if we start with a non-minimally coupled to gravity action, when we impose the congruence between the both groups of symmetries we end with an invariant action of the scalar-tensor type. We obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations for certain values of some parameters of the model. Also we obtain va\-lues for the tensor to scalar ratio in agreement with PLANCK and BICEP observational data: $r&lt;0.032$.</description>

      <title>Solving the Poisson Yang-Baxter equation via deformation-to-quasiclassical-limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental construction of Poisson algebras is to derive them as the quasiclassical limits (QCLs) of associative algebra deformations of commutative associative algebras. This paper lifts this process to the level of classical Yang-Baxter type equations. Solutions of the Poisson Yang-Baxter equation (PYBE) in Poisson algebras is obtained by scalarly deforming solutions of the associative Yang-Baxter equation (AYBE) in commutative associative algebras. Inspired by the characterization of solutions of various classical Yang-Baxter type equations by $\mathcal{O}$-operators, we introduce the notions of deformations of (bi)module algebras and scalar deformations of the corresponding $\mathcal{O}$-operators, from which the QCLs give $\mathcal{O}$-operators for Poisson algebras, which in turn provide solutions of the PYBE. Furthermore, as the QCLs of tridendriform algebra deformations of commutative tridendriform algebras, post-Poisson algebras produce deformations-QCLs of $\mathcal{O}$-operators for Poisson algebras, thus offering explicit solutions of the PYBE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we address the issue of the loss of SU(2) internal symmetry in Loop Quantum Cosmology and its relationship with Loop Quantum Gravity. Drawing inspiration from Yang-Mills theory and employing the framework of fiber bundle theory, we successfully identify a cosmological sector for General Relativity in Ashtekar variables, which preserves the SU(2) gauge structure of the theory. As a consequence, we proceed to quantize it using the machinery of Loop Quantum Gravity, uncovering that the resulting Hilbert space is generated by spin-network states that exhibit distinctive symmetry properties and encompass the usual states of Loop Quantum Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Barycentric bounds on the error exponents of quantum hypothesis exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is an operational task that has significance in studying foundational questions related to interpreting quantum theory. In such a task, one is given a system whose state is randomly selected from a finite set, and the goal is to identify a state from the set that is not the true state of the system. An error, i.e., an unsuccessful exclusion, occurs if and only if the state identified is the true state. In this paper, we study the optimal error probability of quantum state exclusion and its error exponent -- the rate at which the error probability decays asymptotically -- from an information-theoretic perspective. Our main finding is a single-letter upper bound on the error exponent of state exclusion given by the multivariate log-Euclidean Chernoff divergence, and we prove that this improves upon the best previously known upper bound. We also extend our analysis to the more complicated task of quantum channel exclusion, and we establish a single-letter and efficiently computable upper bound on its error exponent, even assuming the use of adaptive strategies. We derive both upper bounds, for state and channel exclusion, based on one-shot analysis and formulate them as a type of multivariate divergence measure called a barycentric Chernoff divergence. Moreover, our result on channel exclusion has implications in two important special cases. First, for the special case of two hypotheses, our upper bound provides the first known efficiently computable upper bound on the error exponent of symmetric binary channel discrimination. Second, for the special case of classical channels, we show that our upper bound is achievable by a nonadaptive strategy, thus solving the exact error exponent of classical channel exclusion and generalising a similar result on symmetric binary classical channel discrimination.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quantum-Mechanical Evolutions from Probability Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of both time-optimal and time sub-optimal quantum Hamiltonian evolutions connecting arbitrary source and a target states on the Bloch sphere equipped with the Fubini-Study metric. This investigation is performed in a number of steps. First, we describe each unitary Schr\"odinger quantum evolution by means of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient of its corresponding dynamical trajectory linking the source state to the target state. Second, starting from a classical probabilistic setting where the so-called information geometric complexity can be employed to describe the complexity of entropic motion on curved statistical manifolds underlying the physics of systems when only partial knowledge about them is available, we transition into a deterministic quantum setting. In this context, after proposing a definition of the complexity of a quantum evolution, we present a notion of quantum complexity length scale. In particular, we discuss the physical significance of both quantities in terms of the accessed (i.e., partial) and accessible (i.e., total) parametric volumes of the regions on the Bloch sphere that specify the quantum mechanical evolution from the source to the target states. Third, after calculating the complexity measure and the complexity length scale for each one of the two quantum evolutions, we compare the behavior of our measures with that of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient. We find that, in general, efficient quantum evolutions are less complex than inefficient evolutions. However, we also observe that complexity is more than length. Indeed, longer paths that are sufficiently bent can exhibit a behavior that is less complex than that of shorter paths with a smaller curvature coefficient.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory perturbative methods for local quantum spin chain quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss local magnetic field quenches using perturbative methods of finite time path field theory (FTPFT) in the following spin chains: Ising and XY in a transverse magnetic field. Their common characteristics are: (i) they are integrable via mapping to a second quantized noninteracting fermion problem; and (ii) when the ground state is nondegenerate (true for finite chains except in special cases), it can be represented as a vacuum of Bogoliubov fermions. By switching on a local magnetic field perturbation at finite time, the problem becomes nonintegrable and must be approached via numeric or perturbative methods. Using the formalism of FTPFT based on Wigner transforms (WTs) of projected functions, we show how to: (i) calculate the basic ``bubble'' diagram in the Loschmidt echo (LE) of a quenched chain to any order in the perturbation; and (ii) resum the generalized Schwinger--Dyson equation for the fermion two-point retarded functions in the ``bubble'' diagram, hence achieving the resummation of perturbative expansion of LE for a wide range of perturbation strengths under certain analyticity assumptions. Limitations of the assumptions and possible generalizations beyond it and also for other spin chains are further discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a Riemann surface of genus $&gt; 1$, we discuss how to construct opers with apparent singularities from $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$ $\lambda$-connections $(E, \nabla_\lambda)$ and sub-line bundles $L$ of $E$. This construction defines a rational map from a space which captures important data of triples $(E, L, \nabla_\lambda)$ to a space which parametrises the positions and residue parameters of the induced apparent singularities. We show that this is a Poisson map with respect to natural Poisson structures. The relations to wobbly bundles and Lagrangians in the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and $\lambda$-connections are discussed.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of diffeomorphism groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of diffeomorphism groups and their applications to problems in analysis and geometry has a long history. In geometric hydrodynamics, pioneered by V.~Arnold in the 1960s, one considers an ideal fluid flow as the geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the fluid domain with respect to the metric defined by the kinetic energy. Similar considerations on the space of densities lead to a geometric description of optimal mass transport and the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric. Likewise, information geometry associated with the Fisher-Rao metric and the Hellinger distance has an equally beautiful infinite-dimensional geometric description and can be regarded as a higher-order Sobolev analogue of optimal transportation. In this work we review various metrics on diffeomorphism groups relevant to this approach and introduce appropriate topology, smooth structures and dynamics on the corresponding infinite-dimensional manifolds. Our main goal is to demonstrate how, alongside topological hydrodynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics and optimal mass transport, information geometry with its elaborate toolbox has become yet another exciting field for applications of geometric analysis on diffeomorphism groups.</description>

      <title>An exploration of connections and curvature in the presence of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the notions of connections and curvature for general Lie-Rinehart algebras without using smoothness assumptions on the base space. We present situations when a connection exists. E.g., this is the case when the underlying module is finitely generated. We show how the group of module automorphism acts as gauge transformations on the space of connections. When the underlying module is projective we define a version of the Chern character reproducing results of Hideki Ozeki. We discuss various examples of flat connections and the associated Maurer-Cartan equations. We provide examples of Levi-Civita connections on singular varieties and singular differential spaces with non-zero Riemannian curvature. The main observation is that for quotient singularities, even though the metric degenerates along strata, the poles of the Christoffel symbols are removable.</description>

      <title>Is there any Trinity of Gravity, to start with?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has been rather fashionable to talk about geometric trinity of gravity. The main idea is that one can formally present the gravity equations in different terms, those of either torsion or nonmetricity instead of curvature. It starts from a very erroneous claim that the Levi-Civita connection, and therefore the (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry itself, are nothing but an arbitrary choice. The point is that, as long as we admit the need of having a metric for describing gravity, the standard approach does not involve any additional independent geometric structures on top of that. At the same time, any other metric-affine model does go for genuinely new stuff. In particular, the celebrated teleparallel framework introduces a notion of yet another parallel transport which is flat. It gives us curious new ways of modifying gravity, even though very often quite problematic. However, in GR-equivalent models, we only get a new language for describing the same physics, in terms of absolutely unobservable and unpredictable geometrical inventions. For sure, one can always safely create novel constructions which do not influence the physical equations of motion, but in itself it does not make much sense and blatantly goes against the Occam's razor.</description>
