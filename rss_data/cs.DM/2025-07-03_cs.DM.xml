      <title>Some remarks on the uncolored versions of the original CFI-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CFI-graphs, named after Cai, F\"urer, and Immerman, are central to the study of the graph isomorphism testing and of first-order logic with counting. They are colored graphs, and the coloring plays a role in many of their applications. As usual, it is not hard to remove the coloring by some extra graph gadgets, but at the cost of blowing up the size of the graphs and changing some parameters of them as well. This might lead to suboptimal combinatorial bounds important to their applications. Since then for some uncolored variants of the CFI-graphs it has been shown that they serve the same purposes. We show that this already applies to the graphs obtained from the original CFI-graphs by forgetting the colors. Moreover, we will see that there is a first-order formula $\varphi(x,y)$ expressing in almost all uncolored CFI-graphs that $x$ and $y$ have the same color in the corresponding colored graphs.</description>

      <title>Scheduling on identical machines with conflicts to minimize the mean flow time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of scheduling jobs on identical machines with conflict constraints, where certain jobs cannot be scheduled simultaneously on different machines. We focus on the case where conflicts can be represented by a simple undirected graph, and the objective is to minimize the mean flow time. We show that the problem is NP-hard even on two machines and two distinct processing times. For unit-time jobs, the problem becomes NP-hard when the number of machines increases to three. We also identify polynomial-time solvable cases for specific classes of conflict graphs. For the general problem, we propose mathematical models, lower bounds, and a genetic algorithm. We evaluate their performance through computational experiments on a wide range of instances derived from well-known benchmark instances in the literature.</description>

      <title>Multipacking in Hypercubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an undirected graph $G$, a dominating broadcast on $G$ is a function $f : V(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that for any vertex $u \in V(G)$, there exists a vertex $v \in V(G)$ with $f(v) \geqslant 1$ and $d(u,v) \leqslant f(v)$. The cost of $f$ is $\sum_{v \in V} f(v)$. The minimum cost over all the dominating broadcasts on $G$ is defined as the broadcast domination number $\gamma_b(G)$ of $G$. A multipacking in $G$ is a subset $M \subseteq V(G)$ such that, for every vertex $v \in V(G)$ and every positive integer $r$, the number of vertices in $M$ within distance $r$ of $v$ is at most $r$. The multipacking number of $G$, denoted $\operatorname{mp}(G)$, is the maximum cardinality of a multipacking in $G$. These two optimisation problems are duals of each other, and it easily follows that $\operatorname{mp}(G) \leqslant \gamma_b(G)$. It is known that $\gamma_b(G) \leqslant 2\operatorname{mp}(G)+3$ and conjectured that $\gamma_b(G) \leqslant 2\operatorname{mp}(G)$.
  In this paper, we show that for the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ $$ \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor
  \leqslant \operatorname{mp}(Q_n)
  \leqslant \frac{n}{2} + 6\sqrt{2n}. $$
  Since $\gamma_b(Q_n) = n-1$ for all $n \geqslant 3$, this verifies the above conjecture on hypercubes and, more interestingly, gives a sequence of connected graphs for which the ratio $\frac{\gamma_b(G)}{\operatorname{mp}(G)}$ approaches $2$, a search for which was initiated by Beaudou, Brewster and Foucaud in 2018. It follows that, for connected graphs $G$ $$
  \limsup_{\operatorname{mp}(G) \rightarrow \infty} \left\{\frac{\gamma_b(G)}{\operatorname{mp}(G)}\right\} = 2.$$
  The lower bound on $\operatorname{mp}(Q_n)$ is established by a recursive construction, and the upper bound is established using a classic result from discrepancy theory.</description>

      <title>The EnvDesign Model: A Method to Solve the Environment Design Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18109v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today, several people and organizations rely on cloud platforms. The reliability of cloud platforms depends heavily on the performance of their internal programs (agents). To better prevent regressions in cloud platforms, the design of pre-production testing environments (that test new agents, new hardwares, and other changes) must take into account the diversity of server/node properties (hardware model, virtual machine type, etc.) across the fleet and dynamically emphasize or de-emphasize the prevalence of certain node properties based on current testing priorities. This paper formulates this task as the ``environment design" problem and presents the EnvDesign model, a method that uses graph theory and optimization algorithms to solve the environment design problem. The EnvDesign model was built on context and techniques that apply to combinatorial testing in general, so it can support combinatorial testing in other domains. An earlier version of this paper was peer-reviewed and published internally at Microsoft.</description>

      <title>Cops and Robbers for Graphs on Surfaces with Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a game played on a graph where a set of cops attempt to capture a single robber. The game proceeds in rounds, where each round first consists of the cops' turn, followed by the robber's turn. In the cops' turn, every cop can choose to either stay on the same vertex or move to an adjacent vertex, and likewise the robber in his turn. The robber is considered to be captured if, at any point in time, there is some cop on the same vertex as the robber. A natural question in this game concerns the cop-number of a graph -- the minimum number of cops needed to capture the robber. It has long been known that graphs embeddable (without crossings) on surfaces of bounded genus have bounded cop-number. In contrast, the class of 1-planar graphs -- graphs that can be drawn on the plane with at most one crossing per edge -- does not have bounded cop-number. This paper initiates an investigation into how distance between crossing pairs of edges influences a graph's cop number. In particular, we look at Distance $d$ Cops and Robbers, a variant of the classical game, where the robber is considered to be captured if there is a cop within distance $d$ of the robber. Let $c_d(G)$ denote the minimum number of cops required in the graph $G$ to capture a robber within distance $d$. We look at various classes of graphs, such as 1-plane graphs, $k$-plane graphs (graphs where each edge is crossed at most $k$ times), and even general graph drawings, and show that if every crossing pair of edges can be connected by a path of small length, then $c_d(G)$ is bounded, for small values of $d$.</description>

      <title>Linear Layouts of Graphs with Priority Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linear layout of a graph consists of a linear ordering of its vertices and a partition of its edges into pages such that the edges assigned to the same page obey some constraint. The two most prominent and widely studied types of linear layouts are stack and queue layouts, in which any two edges assigned to the same page are forbidden to cross and nest, respectively. The names of these two layouts derive from the fact that, when parsing the graph according to the linear vertex ordering, the edges in a single page can be stored using a single stack or queue, respectively. Recently, the concepts of stack and queue layouts have been extended by using a double-ended queue or a restricted-input queue for storing the edges of a page. We extend this line of study to edge-weighted graphs by introducing priority queue layouts, that is, the edges on each page are stored in a priority queue whose keys are the edge weights. First, we show that there are edge-weighted graphs that require a linear number of priority queues. Second, we characterize the graphs that admit a priority queue layout with a single queue, regardless of the edge-weight function, and we provide an efficient recognition algorithm. Third, we show that the number of priority queues required independently of the edge-weight function is bounded by the pathwidth of the graph, but can be arbitrarily large already for graphs of treewidth two. Finally, we prove that determining the minimum number of priority queues is NP-complete if the linear ordering of the vertices is fixed.</description>

      <title>Generation of Cycle Permutation Graphs and Permutation Snarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the efficient generation of all pairwise non-isomorphic cycle permutation graphs, i.e. cubic graphs with a $2$-factor consisting of two chordless cycles, non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs and permutation snarks, i.e. cycle permutation graphs that do not admit a $3$-edge-colouring. This allows us to generate all cycle permutation graphs up to order $34$ and all permutation snarks up to order $46$, improving upon previous computational results by Brinkmann et al. Moreover, we give several improved lower bounds for interesting permutation snarks, such as for a smallest permutation snark of order $6 \bmod 8$ or a smallest permutation snark of girth at least $6$ and give more evidence in support of a conjecture of Goddyn. These computational results also allow us to complete a characterisation of the orders for which non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs exist, answering an open question by Klee from 1972, and yield many more counterexamples to conjectures by Jackson and Zhang.</description>

      <title>The Normal Play of the Domination Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2010, Bre\v{s}ar, Klav\v{z}ar and Rall introduced the optimization variant of the graph domination game and the game domination number. In 2024, Leo Versteegen obtained the celebrated proof of the Conjecture $\frac{3}{5}$ on this variant of the domination game, proposed by Kinnersley, West and Zamani in 2013. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the normal play of the domination game, which we call \textsc{Normal Domination Game}, that is an impartial game where the last to play wins. We first prove that this game is PSPACE-complete even in graphs with diameter two. We also use the Sprague-Grundy theory to prove that Alice (the first player) wins in the path $P_n$ if and only if $n$ is not a multiple of $4$, and wins in the cycle $C_n$ if and only if $n=4k+3$ for some integer $k$. Finally, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to decide the winner for any disjoint union of paths and cycles in the \textsc{Normal Domination Game} and its natural partizan variant.</description>

      <title>On the time complexity of finding a well-spread perfect matching in bridgeless cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for finding a perfect matching in a $3$-edge-connected cubic graph that intersects every $3$-edge cut in exactly one edge. Specifically, we propose an algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n \log^4 n)$, which significantly improves upon the previously known $O(n^3)$-time algorithms for the same problem. The technique we use for the improvement is efficient use of cactus model of 3-edge cuts. As an application, we use our algorithm to compute embeddings of $3$-edge-connected cubic graphs with limited number of singular edges (i.e., edges that are twice in the boundary of one face) in $O(n \log^4 n)$ time; this application contributes to the study of the well-known Cycle Double Cover conjecture.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Spectral Partitioning Works: Bounds for Special Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral partitioning is a method that can be used to compute small sparse cuts or small edge-separators in a wide variety of graph classes, by computing the second-smallest eigenvalue (and eigenvector) of the Laplacian matrix. Upper bounds on this eigenvalue for certain graph classes imply that the method obtains small edge-separators for these classes, usually with a sub-optimal dependence on the maximum degree. In this work, we show that a related method, called reweighted spectral partitioning, guarantees near-optimal sparse vertex-cuts and vertex-separators in a wide variety of graph classes. In many cases, this involves little-to-no necessary dependence on maximum degree.
  We also obtain a new proof of the planar separator theorem, a strengthened eigenvalue bound for bounded-genus graphs, and a refined form of the recent Cheeger-style inequality for vertex expansion via a specialized dimension-reduction step.</description>

      <title>Approximating Submodular Matroid-Constrained Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The submodular partitioning problem asks to minimize, over all partitions $P$ of a ground set $V$, the sum of a given submodular function $f$ over the parts of $P$. The problem has seen considerable work in approximability, as it encompasses multiterminal cuts on graphs, $k$-cuts on hypergraphs, and elementary linear algebra problems such as matrix multiway partitioning. This research has been divided between the fixed terminal setting, where we are given a set of terminals that must be separated by $P$, and the global setting, where the only constraint is the size of the partition. We investigate a generalization that unifies these two settings: minimum submodular matroid-constrained partition. In this problem, we are additionally given a matroid over the ground set and seek to find a partition $P$ in which there exists some basis that is separated by $P$. We explore the approximability of this problem and its variants, reaching the state of the art for the special case of symmetric submodular functions, and provide results for monotone and general submodular functions as well.</description>

      <title>Inverse matroid optimization under subset constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Inverse Matroid problem, we are given a matroid, a fixed basis $B$, and an initial weight function, and the goal is to minimally modify the weights -- measured by some function -- so that $B$ becomes a maximum-weight basis. The problem arises naturally in settings where one wishes to explain or enforce a given solution by minimally perturbing the input.
  We extend this classical problem by replacing the fixed basis with a subset $S_0$ of the ground set and imposing various structural constraints on the set of maximum-weight bases relative to $S_0$. Specifically, we study six variants: (A) Inverse Matroid Exists, where $S_0$ must contain at least one maximum-weight basis; (B) Inverse Matroid All, where all bases contained in $S_0$ are maximum-weight; and (C) Inverse Matroid Only, where $S_0$ contains exactly the maximum-weight bases, along with their natural negated counterparts.
  For all variants, we develop combinatorial polynomial-time algorithms under the $\ell_\infty$-norm. A key ingredient is a refined min-max theorem for Inverse Matroid under the $\ell_\infty$-norm, which enables simpler and faster algorithms than previous approaches and may be of independent combinatorial interest. Our work significantly broadens the range of inverse optimization problems on matroids that can be solved efficiently, especially those that constrain the structure of optimal solutions through subset inclusion or exclusion.</description>
