      <title>On edge irregularity strength of cycle-star graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, a vertex labeling $\phi:V(G) \rightarrow \{1, 2,\ldots,k\}$ is called $k$-labeling. The weight of an edge $uv$ in $G$, written $w_{\phi}(uv)$, is the sum of the labels of end vertices $u$ and $v$, i.e., $w_{\phi}(uv)=\phi(u)+\phi(v)$. A vertex $k$-labeling is defined to be an edge irregular $k$-labeling of the graph $G$ if for every two distinct edges $u$ and $v$, $w_{\phi}(u) \neq w_{\phi}(v)$. The minimum $k$ for which the graph $G$ has an edge irregular $k$-labeling is called the edge irregularity strength of $G$, written $es(G)$. In this paper, we study the edge irregular $k$-labeling for cycle-star graph $CS_{k,n-k}$ and determine the exact value for cycle-star graph for $3 \leq k \leq 7$ and $n-k \geq 1$. Finally, we make a conjecture for the edge irregularity strength of $CS_{k,n-k}$ for $k \geq 8$ and $n-k \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Problems on the Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a number of problems defined on the triangular lattice with $n$ rows, which we will denote as $T_n$. Define a \textit{proper coloring} to be an assignment of colors to the points of $T_n$ such that no three points constituting the vertices of an equilateral triangle all receive the same color, and denote by $f(n)$ the smallest possible number of colors that can be used in a proper coloring of $T_n$. We either determine exactly or give upper bounds for $f(n)$ for many small values of $n$, and it is shown that $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(n)}{n} \leq \frac13$. We also give formulas counting the number of pairs of points in $T_n$ for which there are, respectively, 0, 1, or 2 choices of points in $T_n$ which extend those two into the vertices of an equilateral triangle. Along the way, we pose a number of related questions.</description>

      <title>Super Hayashi Quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quandles are right-invertible, right-self distributive (and idempotent) algebraic structures. Therefore, right translations are quandle automorphisms. It has been interesting to look into finite quandles by way of the cycle structures their right translations may have. For each quandle, the list of these cycle structures is known as the profile of the quandle. For a connected quandle, any two right translations are conjugate so there is essentially one cycle structure per connected quandle - which we thus identify with the profile. Hayashi conjectured that, for a connected quandle, each length of its profile divides the longest length. In the present article we introduce Super Hayashi Quandles (SHQ). An SHQ is a finite connected quandle such that any two lengths in its profile are (i) distinct, and (ii) the shorter one divides the longer one. The SHQ's are latin quandles and we prove that their profiles depend only on the second shortest length and on the number of cycles. Furthermore, we prove that SHQ's have SHQ's alone for subquandles (with the same second shortest length but fewer cycles). Finally, we construct infinitely many SHQ's.</description>

      <title>On some singular graphs with non-isomorphic associated evolution algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected graph can be associated with two distinct evolution algebras. In the first case, the structural matrix is the adjacency matrix of the graph itself. In the second case, the structural matrix is the transition probabilities matrix of the symmetric random walk on the same graph. It is well-known that, for a non-singular graph, both evolution algebras are isomorphic if, and only if, the graph is regular or biregular. Moreover, through examples and partial results, it has been conjectured that the same result remains true for singular graphs. The purpose of this work is to provide new examples supporting this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Constructions for the Digraph Degree-Diameter Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree-diameter problem for graphs is to find the largest number of vertices a graph can have given its diameter and maximum degree. We show we can realize this problem in terms of quasigroups, 1-factors and permutation groups. Our investigation originated from the study of graphs as the Cayley graphs of groupoids with d generators, a left identity and right cancellation; that is, a right quasigroup. This enables us to provide compact algebraic definitions for some important graphs that are either given as explicit edge lists or as the Cayley coset graphs of groups larger than the graph. One such example is a single expression for the Hoffman-Singleton graph. From there, we notice that the groupoids can be represented uniquely by a set of disjoint permutations and we explore the consequences of that observation.</description>

      <title>Avoidance of vincular patterns by Catalan words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}_n$ denote the set of words $w=w_1\cdots w_n$ on the alphabet of positive integers satisfying $w_{i+1}\leq w_i+1$ for $1 \leq i \leq n-1$ with $w_1=1$. The members of $\mathcal{C}_n$ are known as Catalan words and are enumerated by the $n$-th Catalan number $C_n$. The problem of finding the cardinality of various avoidance classes of $\mathcal{C}_n$ has been an ongoing object of study, and members of $\mathcal{C}_n$ avoiding one or two classical or a single consecutive pattern have been enumerated. In this paper, we extend these results to vincular patterns and seek to determine the cardinality of each avoidance class corresponding to a pattern of type (1,2) or (2,1). In several instances, a simple explicit formula for this cardinality may be given. In the more difficult cases, we find only a formula for the (ordinary) generating function which enumerates the class in question. We make extensive use of functional equations in establishing our generating function results.</description>

      <title>A Subexponential Reduction from Product Partition to Subset Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Product Partition Problem (PPP), i.e. we are given a set of $n$ natural numbers represented on $m$ bits each and we are asked if a subset exists such that the product of the numbers in the subset equals the product of the numbers not in the subset. Our approach is to obtain the integer factorization of each number. This is the subexponential step. We then form a matrix with the exponents of the primes and show that the PPP has a solution iff some Subset Sum Problems have a common solution. Finally, using the fact that the exponents are not large we combine all the Subset Sum Problems in a single Subset Sum Problem (SSP) and show that its size is polynomial in $m,n$. We show that the PPP has a solution iff the final SSP has one.</description>

      <title>Geometry of convex geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any convex geometry $\mathcal{A}=(U,\mathcal{C})$ on $n$ points and any ideal $\mathcal{I}=(U',\mathcal{C}')$ of $\mathcal{A}$ can be realized as the intersection pattern of an open convex polyhedral cone $K\subseteq {\mathbb R}^n$ with the orthants of ${\mathbb R}^n$. Furthermore, we show that $K$ can be chosen to have at most $m$ facets, where $m$ is the number of critical rooted circuits of $\mathcal{A}$. We also show that any convex geometry of convex dimension $d$ is realizable in ${\mathbb R}^d$ and that any multisimplicial complex (a basic example of an ideal of a convex geometry) of dimension $d$ is realizable in ${\mathbb R}^{2d}$ and that this is best possible. From our results it also follows that distributive lattices of dimension $d$ are realizable in ${\mathbb R}^{d}$ and that median systems are realizable. We leave open %the question whether each median system of dimension $d$ is realizable in ${\mathbb R}^{O(d)}$.</description>

Abstract: We give the first example of a mosaic of three combinatorial designs with distinct parameters $2$-$(13,3,1)$, $2$-$(13,4,2)$, and $2$-$(13,6,5)$. Furthermore, we give examples of mosaics of $2$-$(9,3,2)$ designs that are not resolvable, thereby answering a question posed by M. Wiese and H. Boche. Finally, we give an example of a mosaic of projective planes of order $3$ that cannot be obtained by tiling groups with difference sets.</description>

      <title>Weak and Strong Nestings of BIBDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two types of nestings of balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs). In both types of nesting, we wish to add a point (the nested point) to every block of a $(v,k,\lambda)$-BIBD in such a way that we end up with a partial $(w,k+1,\lambda+1)$-BIBD for some $w \geq v$. In the case where $w &gt; v$, we are introducing $w-v$ new points. This is called a weak nesting. A strong nesting satisfies the stronger property that no pair containing a new point occurs more than once in the partial $(w,k+1,\lambda+1)$-BIBD. In both cases, the goal is to minimize $w$. We prove lower bounds on $w$ as a function of $v$, $k$ and $\lambda$ and we find infinite classes of $(v,2,1)$- and $(v,3,2)$-BIBDs that have optimal nestings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jacobian is an algebraic invariant of a graph which is often seen in analogy to the class group of a number field. In particular, there have been multiple investigations into the Iwasawa theory of graphs with the Jacobian playing the role of the class group. In this paper, we construct an Iwasawa module related to the Jacobian of a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-tower of connected graphs, and give examples where we use this to compute asymptotic sizes of the Jacobians in this tower.</description>

      <title>Improved upper bounds for the Heilbronn's Problem for $k$-gons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Heilbronn triangle problem asks for the placement of $n$ points in a unit square that maximizes the smallest area of a triangle formed by any three of those points. In $1972$, Schmidt considered a natural generalization of this problem. He asked for the placement of $n$ points in a unit square that maximizes the smallest area of the convex hull formed by any four of those points. He showed a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{-3/2})$, which was improved to $\Omega(n^{-3/2}\log{n})$ by Leffman.
  A trivial upper bound of $3/n$ could be obtained, and Schmidt asked if this could be improved asymptotically. However, despite several efforts, no asymptotic improvement over the trivial upper bound was known for the last $50$ years, and the problem started to get the tag of being notoriously hard. Szemer{\'e}di posed the question of whether one can, at least, improve the constant in this trivial upper bound. In this work, we answer this question by proving an upper bound of $2/n+o(1/n)$. We also extend our results to any convex hulls formed by $k\geq 4$ points.</description>

      <title>Generalized permutohedra in the kinematic space</title>

      <description>arXiv:1804.05460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we study the permutohedral geometry of the poles of a certain differential form introduced in recent work of Arkani-Hamed, Bai, He and Yan. There it was observed that the poles of the form determine a family of polyhedra which have the same face lattice as that of the permutohedron. We realize that family explicitly, proving that it in fact fills out the configuration space of a particularly well-behaved family of generalized permutohedra, the zonotopal generalized permutohedra, that are obtained as the Minkowski sums of line segments parallel to the root directions $e_i-e_j$.
  Finally we interpret Mizera's formula for the biadjoint scalar amplitude $m(\mathbb{I}_n,\mathbb{I}_n)$, restricted to a certain dimension $n-2$ subspace of the kinematic space, as a sum over the boundary components of the standard root cone, which is the conical hull of the roots $e_1-e_2,\ldots, e_{n-2}-e_{n-1}$.</description>

      <title>Lattice Size of Width One Lattice Polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lattice size $\operatorname{ls_\Delta}(P)$ of a lattice polytope $P$ is a geometric invariant, which was formally introduced in relation to the problem of bounding the total degree and the bi-degree of the defining equation of an algebraic curve, but appeared implicitly earlier in geometric combinatorics. In this paper, we show that for an empty lattice polytope $P\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ there exists a reduced basis of $\mathbb{Z}^3$ which computes its lattice size $\operatorname{ls_\Delta}(P)$. This leads to a fast algorithm for computing $\operatorname{ls_\Delta}(P)$ for such $P$. We also extend this result to another class of lattice width one polytopes $P\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. We then provide a counterexample demonstrating that this result does not hold true for an arbitrary lattice polytope $P\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ of lattice width one.</description>

Abstract: Kamiya, Takemura, and Terao introduced a characteristic quasi-polynomial which enumerates the numbers of elements in the complement of hyperplane arrangements modulo positive integers. In this paper, we compute the characteristic quasi-polynomials for arrangements which contain the Coxeter arrangements of types A, B, C, and D described by the orthonormal basis. We also compute the characteristic quasi-polynomials for their deletion arrangements and we can show that they are factorized. From this result, the poset generated by hypertori of the corresponding torus arrangement is an inductive poset.</description>

Abstract: Using the vertex operator representations for symplectic and orthogonal Schur functions, we define two families of symmetric functions and show thatthey are the skew symplectic and skew orthogonal Schur polynomials defined implicitly by Koike and Terada and satisfy the general branching rules. Furthermore, we derive the Jacobi-Trudi identities and Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns for these symmetric functions. Additionally, the vertex operator method yields their Cauchy-type identities. This demonstrates that vertex operator representations serve not only as a tool for studying symmetric functions but also offers unified realizations for skew Schur functions of types A, C, and D.</description>

      <title>A $q$-analog of the Markoff injectivity conjecture holds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09852v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elements of Markoff triples are given by coefficients in certain matrix products defined by Christoffel words, and the Markoff injectivity conjecture, a long-standing open problem (also known as the uniqueness conjecture), is then equivalent to injectivity on Christoffel words. A $q$-analog of these matrix products has been proposed recently, and we prove that injectivity on Christoffel words holds for this $q$-analog. The proof is based on the evaluation at $q = \exp(i\pi/3)$. Other roots of unity provide some information on the original problem, which corresponds to the case $q=1$. We also extend the problem to arbitrary words and provide a large family of pairs of words where injectivity does not hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An arithmetical structure on a finite, connected graph without loops is an assignment of positive integers to the vertices that satisfies certain conditions. Associated to each of these is a finite abelian group known as its critical group. We show how to determine the critical group of an arithmetical structure on a star graph or complete graph in terms of the entries of the arithmetical structure. We use this to investigate which finite abelian groups can occur as critical groups of arithmetical structures on these graphs.</description>

      <title>Dumont-Thomas complement numeration systems for $\mathbb{Z}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the well-known Dumont-Thomas numeration systems to $\mathbb{Z}$ using an approach inspired by the two's complement numeration system. Integers in $\mathbb{Z}$ are canonically represented by a finite word (starting with $\mathtt{0}$ when nonnegative and with $\mathtt{1}$ when negative). The systems are based on two-sided periodic points of substitutions as opposed to the right-sided fixed points. For every periodic point of a substitution, we construct an automaton which returns the letter at position $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ of the periodic point when fed with the representation of $n$ in the corresponding numeration system. The numeration system naturally extends to $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We give an equivalent characterization of the numeration system in terms of a total order on a regular language. Lastly, using particular periodic points, we recover the well-known two's complement numeration system and the Fibonacci analogue of the two's complement numeration system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize Artin-Ihara L-functions for graphs to hypergraphs by exploring several analogous notions, such as (unramified) Galois coverings and Frobenius elements. To a hypergraph $H$, one can naturally associate a bipartite graph $B_H$ encoding incidence relations of $H$. We study Artin-Ihara $L$-functions of hypergraphs $H$ by using Artin-Ihara $L$-functions of associated bipartite graphs $B_H$. As a result, we prove various properties for Artin-Ihara L-functions for hypergraphs. For instance, we prove that the Ihara zeta function of a hypergraph $H$ can be written as a product of Artin-Ihara $L$-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the class $S_n(1324)$ of permutations of size $n$ that avoid the pattern 1324 and examine the subset $S_n^{a\prec n}(1324)$ of elements for which $a\prec n\prec [a-1]$, $a\ge 1$. This notation means that, when written in one line notation, such a permutation must have $a$ to the left of $n$, and the elements of $\{1,\dots,a-1\}$ must all be to the right of $n$. For $n\ge 2$, we establish a connection between the subset of permutations in $S_n^{1\prec n}(1324)$ having the 1 adjacent to the $n$ (called primitives), and the set of 1324-avoiding dominoes with $n-2$ points. For $a\in\{1,2\}$, we introduce constructive algorithms and give formulas for the enumeration of $S_n^{a\prec n}(1324)$ by the position of $a$ relative to the position of $n$. For $a\ge 3$, we formulate some conjectures for the corresponding generating functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An isolating set in a graph is a set $X$ of vertices such that every edge of the graph is incident with a vertex of $X$ or its neighborhood. The isolation number of a graph, or equivalently the vertex-edge domination number, is the minimum number of vertices in an isolating set. Caro and Hansberg, and independently \.{Z}yli\'{n}ski, showed that the isolation number is at most one-third the order for every connected graph of order at least $6$. We show that in fact all such graphs have three disjoint isolating sets. Further, using a family introduced by Lema\'{n}ska, Mora, and Souto-Salorio, we determine all graphs with equality in the original bound.</description>

      <title>On stable assignments generated by choice functions of mixed type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider one variant of stable assignment problems in a bipartite graph endowed with nonnegative capacities on the edges and quotas on the vertices. It can be viewed as a generalization of the stable allocation problem introduced by Ba\H{\i}ou and Balinsky, which arises when strong linear orders of preferences on the vertices in the latter are replaced by weak ones. At the same time, our stability problem can be stated in the framework of a theory by Alkan and Gale on stable schedule matchings generated by choice functions of a wide scope. In our case, the choice functions are of a special, so-called mixed, type.
  The main content of this paper is devoted to a study of rotations in our mixed model, functions on the edges determining ``elementary'' transformations between close stable assignments. These look more sophisticated compared with rotations in the stable allocation problem (which are generated by simple cycles). We efficiently construct a poset of rotations and show that the stable assignments are in bijection with the so-called closed functions for this poset; this gives rise to a ``compact'' affine representation for the lattice of stable assignments and leads to an efficient method to find a stable assignment of minimum cost.</description>

      <title>A criterion for Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s type theorems and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17219v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s Theorem states that for $\ell\ge 2$, every $n$-vertex $K_{\ell+1}$-free graph with minimum degree greater than $\frac{3\ell-4}{3\ell-1}n$ must be $\ell$-partite. We establish a simple criterion for $r$-graphs, $r \geq 2$, to exhibit an Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s type property, also known as degree-stability. This leads to a classification of most previously studied hypergraph families with this property. An immediate application of this result, combined with a general theorem by Keevash--Lenz--Mubayi, solves the spectral Tur\'{a}n problems for a large class of hypergraphs.
  For every $r$-graph $F$ with degree-stability, there is a simple algorithm to decide the $F$-freeness of an $n$-vertex $r$-graph with minimum degree greater than $(\pi(F) - \varepsilon_F)\binom{n}{r-1}$ in time $O(n^r)$, where $\varepsilon_F &gt;0$ is a constant. In particular, for the complete graph $K_{\ell+1}$, we can take $\varepsilon_{K_{\ell+1}} = (3\ell^2-\ell)^{-1}$, and this bound is tight up to some multiplicative constant factor unless $\mathbf{W[1]} = \mathbf{FPT}$. Based on a result by Chen--Huang--Kanj--Xia, we further show that for every fixed $C &gt; 0$, this problem cannot be solved in time $n^{o(\ell)}$ if we replace $\varepsilon_{K_{\ell+1}}$ with $(C\ell)^{-1}$ unless $\mathbf{ETH}$ fails. Furthermore, we apply the degree-stability of $K_{\ell+1}$ to decide the $K_{\ell+1}$-freeness of graphs whose size is close to the Tur\'{a}n bound in time $(\ell+1)n^2$, partially improving a recent result by Fomin--Golovach--Sagunov--Simonov. As an intermediate step, we show that for a specific class of $r$-graphs $F$, the (surjective) $F$-coloring problem can be solved in time $O(n^r)$, provided the input $r$-graph has $n$ vertices and a large minimum degree, refining several previous results.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new type of operad-like structure called a P-operad, which depends on the choice of some collection of posets P, and which is governed by chains in posets of P. We introduce several examples of such structures which are related to classical poset theoretic notions such as poset homology, Cohen--Macaulayness and lexicographic shellability. We then show that P-operads form a satisfactory framework to categorify Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of geometric lattices and their kernel. In particular, this leads to a new proof of the positivity of the coefficients of Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of geometric lattices.</description>

      <title>The Quantitative Fractional Helly theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two celebrated extensions of Helly's theorem are the Fractional Helly theorem of Katchalski and Liu (1979) and the Quantitative Volume theorem of B\'ar\'any, Katchalski, and Pach (1982). Improving on several recent works, we prove an optimal combination of these two results. We show that given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $n$ convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that at least $\alpha \binom{n}{d+1}$ of the $(d+1)$-tuples of $\mathcal{F}$ have an intersection of volume at least 1, then one can select $\Omega_{d,\alpha}(n)$ members of $\mathcal{F}$ whose intersection has volume at least $\Omega_d(1)$.
  Furthermore, with the help of this theorem, we establish a quantitative version of the $(p,q)$ theorem of Alon and Kleitman. Let $p\geq q\geq d+1$ and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a finite family of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that among any $p$ elements of $\mathcal{F}$, there are $q$ that have an intersection of volume at least $1$. Then, we prove that there exists a family $T$ of $O_{p,q}(1)$ ellipsoids of volume $\Omega_d(1)$ such that every member of $\mathcal{F}$ contains at least one element of $T$.
  Finally, we present extensions about the diameter version of the Quantitative Helly theoerm.</description>

      <title>Zig-zag Eulerian polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any finite partially ordered set $P$, the $P$-Eulerian polynomial is the generating function for the descent number over the set of linear extensions of $P$, and is closely related to the order polynomial of $P$ arising in the theory of $P$-partitions. Here we study the $P$-Eulerian polynomial where $P$ is a naturally labeled zig-zag poset; we call these zig-zag Eulerian polynomials. A result of Br\"and\'en implies that these polynomials are gamma-nonnegative, and hence their coefficients are symmetric and unimodal. The zig-zag Eulerian polynomials and the associated order polynomials have appeared fleetingly in the literature in a wide variety of contexts$\unicode{x2014}$e.g., in the study of polytopes, magic labelings of graphs, and Kekul\'e structures$\unicode{x2014}$but they do not appear to have been studied systematically.
  In this paper, we use a "relaxed" version of $P$-partitions to both survey and unify results. Our technique shows that the zig-zag Eulerian polynomials also capture the distribution of "big returns" over the set of (up-down) alternating permutations, as first observed by Coons and Sullivant. We develop recurrences for refined versions of the relevant generating functions, which evoke similarities to recurrences for the classical Eulerian polynomials. We conclude with a literature survey and open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system of linear equations $L$ is common over $\mathbb{F}_p$ if, as $n\to\infty$, any 2-coloring of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ gives asymptotically at least as many monochromatic solutions to $L$ as a random 2-coloring. The notion of common linear systems is analogous to that of common graphs, i.e., graphs whose monochromatic density in 2-edge-coloring of cliques is asymptotically minimized by the random coloring. Saad and Wolf initiated a systematic study on identifying common linear systems, built upon the earlier work of Cameron-Cilleruelo-Serra. When $L$ is a single equation, Fox-Pham-Zhao gave a complete characterization of common linear equations. When $L$ consists of two equations, Kam\v{c}ev-Liebenau-Morrison showed that irredundant $2\times 4$ linear systems are always uncommon. In this work, (1) we determine commonness of all $2\times 5$ linear systems up to a small number of cases, and (2) we show that all $2\times k$ linear systems with $k$ even and girth (minimum number of nonzero coefficients of a nonzero equation spanned by the system) $k-1$ are uncommon, answering a question of Kam\v{c}ev-Liebenau-Morrison.</description>

      <title>An answer to Goswami's question and new sources of $IP^{\star}$-sets containing combined zigzag structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $A$ set is called $IP$-set in a semigroup $\left(S,\cdot \right)$ if it contains finite products of a sequence. A set that intersects with all $IP$-sets is called $IP^\star$-set. It is a well known and established result by Bergelson and Hindman that if $A$ is an $IP^{\star}$-set, then for any sequence $\langle x_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}$, there exists a sum subsystem $\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}$ such that $FS\left(\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}\right)\cup FP\left(\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}\right)\subset A$. In \cite[Question 3]{G}, S. Goswami posed the question: if we replace the single sequence by $l$-sequences, then is it possible to obtain a sum subsystem such that all of its zigzag finite sums and products will be in $A$. Goswami has given affirmative answers only for dynamical $IP^{\star}$-sets which are not equivalent to those of $IP^{\star}$-sets, but are rather significantly stronger. In this article, we will give the answer to Goswami's question that was unknown until now.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.11914v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider relational structures arising from Comer's finite field construction, where the cosets need not be sum free. These Comer schemes generalize the notion of a Ramsey scheme and may be of independent interest. As an application, we give the first finite representation of $34_{65}$. This leaves $33_{65}$ as the only remaining relation algebra in the family $N_{65}$ with a flexible atom that is not known to be finitely representable. Motivated by this, we complement our upper bounds with some lower bounds. Using a SAT solver, we show that $33_{65}$ is not finitely representable on fewer than $24$ points, and that $33_{65}$ does not admit a cyclic group representation on fewer than $120$ points. We also employ a SAT solver to show that $34_{65}$ is not representable on fewer than $24$ points.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Bound For Szemer\'edi's Theorem for a Complexity One Polynomial Progression over $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05540v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a large prime and $P, Q \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ two linearly independent polynomials with $P(0) = Q(0) = 0$. We show that if a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ lacks a progression of the form $(x, x + P(y), x + Q(y), x + P(y) + Q(y))$, then $$|A| \le O\left(\frac{N}{\log_{(O(1))}(N)}\right)$$ where $\log_{C}(N)$ is an iterated logarithm of order $C$ (e.g., $\log_{2}(N) = \log\log(N)$). To establish this bound, we adapt Peluse's (2018) degree lowering argument to the quadratic Fourier analysis setting to obtain quantitative bounds on the true complexity of the above progression. Our method also shows that for a large class of polynomial progressions, if one can establish polynomial-type bounds on the true complexity of those progressions, then one can establish polynomial-type bounds on Szemer\'edi's theorem for that type of polynomial progression.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-delay generation of functional digraphs up to isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a procedure for the generation of functional digraphs up to isomorphism; these are digraphs with uniform outdegree 1, also called mapping patterns, finite endofunctions, or finite discrete-time dynamical systems. This procedure is based on a reverse search algorithm for the generation of connected functional digraphs, which is then applied as a subroutine for the generation of arbitrary ones. Both algorithms output solutions with $O(n^2)$ delay and require linear space with respect to the number $n$ of vertices.</description>

      <title>Intertwining the Busemann process of the directed polymer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Busemann process of the planar directed polymer model with i.i.d. weights on the vertices of the planar square lattice, both the general case and the solvable inverse-gamma case. We demonstrate that the Busemann process intertwines with an evolution obeying a version of the geometric Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence. In the inverse-gamma case this relationship enables an explicit description of the distribution of the Busemann process: the Busemann function on a nearest-neighbor edge has independent increments in the direction variable, and its distribution comes from an inhomogeneous planar Poisson process. Various corollaries follow, including that each Busemann function has the same countably infinite dense set of discontinuities in the direction variable. This contrasts with the known zero-temperature last-passage percolation cases, where the analogous sets are nowhere dense but have a dense union. The distribution of the asymptotic competition interface direction of the inverse-gamma polymer is discrete and supported on the Busemann discontinuities. Further implications follow for the eternal solutions and the failure of the one force--one solution principle for the discrete stochastic heat equation solved by the polymer partition function.</description>

      <title>Uniquely compatible transfer systems for cyclic groups of order $p^rq^s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bi-incomplete Tambara functors over a group $G$ can be understood in terms of compatible pairs of $G$-transfer systems. In the case of $G = C_{p^n}$ , Hill, Meng and Li gave a necessary and sufficient condition for compatibility and computed the exact number of compatible pairs. In this article, we study compatible pairs of $G$-transfer systems for the case $G = C_{p^rq^s}$ and identify conditions when such transfer systems are uniquely compatible in the sense that they only form trivially compatible pairs. This gives us new insight into collections of norm maps that are relevant in equivariant homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Marton's Conjecture in abelian groups with bounded torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Freiman--Ruzsa-type theorem with polynomial bounds in arbitrary abelian groups with bounded torsion, thereby proving (in full generality) a conjecture of Marton. Specifically, let $G$ be an abelian group of torsion $m$ (meaning $mg=0$ for all $g \in G$) and suppose that $A$ is a non-empty subset of $G$ with $|A+A| \leq K|A|$. Then $A$ can be covered by at most $(2K)^{O(m^3)}$ translates of a subgroup of $H \leq G$ of cardinality at most $|A|$. The argument is a variant of that used in the case $G = \mathbf{F}_2^n$ in a recent paper of the authors.</description>
