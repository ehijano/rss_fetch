      <title>Uniform terms and local elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article explores function terms within uniform theories. It examines the uniformity of these theories through an algebraic lens. The paper compares the uniformity of terms and predicates within axiom schemas. It demonstrates the connection between such theories and both field theory and measure theory. The work proposes a novel interpretation of elements as automorphisms of the sets that include them. Additionally, it introduces a method for the localization of elements in relation to one another. Uniform Terms and Local Elements, 2024, msc: 03G30, 03H99 Key words: Terms and predicates, singletons, sections, automorphisms, translation group, Galois correspondence, uniformity and non-uniformity.</description>

      <title>Finite model property of pretransitive analogues of (w)K4 and GL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modal logic is pretransitive, if the modality corresponding to the transitive closure of an accessibility relation is expressible in it. In the present work we establish the finite model property for pretransitive generalizations of K4, wK4, and GL and their extensions by canonical subframe-hereditary formulas.</description>

      <title>Revisiting virtual difference ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:1608.08438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main idea of [4] was that structures built from periodic prime ideals have better properties from the usual ones built from invariant ideals; but unable to work with periodic ideals alone, we had to generalise further to a somewhat ephemeral setting called virtual ideals. This text has two purposes. It corrects an error in [4] discovered by Tom Scanlon's UCB seminar, recovering all results for all virtual ideals. In addition, based on results in [3], we describe a wide family of difference equations where virtual ideals reduce to periodic ideals.</description>

      <title>Reordered Computable Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A real number is called left-computable if there exists a computable increasing sequence of rational numbers converging to it. In this article we are investigating a proper subset of the left-computable numbers. We say that a real number $x$ is reordered computable if there exist a computable function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-f(k)} = x$ and a bijective function $\sigma \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that the rearranged series $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-f(\sigma(k))}$ converges computably. In this article we will give some examples and counterexamples for reordered computable numbers and we will show that these numbers are closed under addition, multiplication and the Solovay reduction. Finally, we will also present a density theorem for reordered computable numbers.</description>

      <title>The Tameness of Quantum Field Theory, Part I -- Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalized finiteness principle for physical theories, in terms of the concept of tameness in mathematical logic. A tame function or space can only have a finite amount of structure, in a precise sense which we explain. Tameness generalizes the notion of an analytic function to include certain non-analytic limits, and we show that this includes many limits which are known to arise in physics. For renormalizable quantum field theories, we give a general proof that amplitudes at each order in the loop expansion are tame functions of the external momenta and the couplings. We then consider a variety of exact non-perturbative results and show that they are tame but only given constraints on the UV definition of the theory. This provides further evidence for the recent conjecture of the second author that all effective theories that can be coupled to quantum gravity are tame. We also discuss whether renormalization group flow is tame, and comment on the applicability of our results to effective theories.</description>

      <title>On the first-order theories of quaternions and octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be the language of rings. We provide an axiomatization of the $L$-theories of quaternions and octonions and we characterize the models of mentioned theories: they coincide, up to isomorphism, to quaternion and octonion algebras over a real closed field, respectively. We prove these theories are complete, model complete and they do not have quantifier elimination. Then, we focus on the class of ordered polynomials. Over $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$ these polynomials are of special interest in hypercomplex analysis since they are slice regular. We deduce some fundamental properties of the zero loci of ordered polynomials from completeness and we prove the failure of quantifier elimination for the fragment of ordered formulas.</description>

      <title>Coordinate systems in Banach spaces and lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using methods of descriptive set theory, in particular, the determinacy of infinite games of perfect information, we answer several questions from the literature regarding different notions of bases in Banach spaces and lattices. For the case of Banach lattices, our results follow from a general theorem stating that (under the assumption of analytic determinacy), every $\sigma$-order basis $(e_n)$ for a Banach lattice $X=[e_n]$ is a uniform basis, and every uniform basis is Schauder. Moreover, the notions of order and $\sigma$-order bases coincide when $X=[e_n].$ Regarding Banach spaces, we address two problems concerning filter Schauder bases for Banach spaces, i.e., in which the norm convergence of partial sums is replaced by norm convergence along some appropriate filter on $\mathbb N$. We first provide an example of a Banach space admitting such a filter Schauder basis, but no ordinary Schauder basis. Secondly, we show that every filter Schauder basis with respect to an analytic filter is also a filter Schauder basis with respect to a Borel filter.</description>
