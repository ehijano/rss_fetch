      <title>Next-Generation Improvements in Giant Exoplanet Evolutionary and Structural Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparison between legacy and modern evolutionary models for giant exoplanets, using our planetary evolution code, APPLE, to emulate and extend previous studies. Our analysis isolates and quantifies the impact of recent physical advances motivated by detailed modeling of Jupiter and Saturn, including updated hydrogen-helium and heavy-element equations of state, helium rain, "fuzzy" cores, and non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous envelopes, alongside improved atmospheric boundary conditions that incorporate ammonia cloud physics. We first examine the influence of each new physical ingredient individually, then construct combined baseline models for masses between 0.3 to 4 Jupiter masses to assess their collective effect on planetary structure and observable properties. We find that the adoption of modern equations of state and realistic heavy-element distributions leads to systematic, but sometimes subtle, differences (~5 to 10%) in radius evolution, while helium rain and the treatment of convection can significantly alter thermal histories and atmospheric compositions (by ~5 to 20%). These updated physical processes must be incorporated into the next-generation exoplanet evolutionary models to achieve physically consistent interpretations of planetary observations.</description>

      <title>The ExoGRAVITY survey: a K-band spectral library of giant exoplanet and brown dwarf companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct observations of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions with near-infrared interferometry, first enabled by the dual-field mode of VLTI/GRAVITY, provide unique measurements of the objects' orbital motion and atmospheric composition. Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all exoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We re-reduce all available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where companions are detected, extract their ~2.0-2.4 $\mu$m K-band contrast spectra. We then derive stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references that we use to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely from the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extract spectral types, spectral indices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the help of age constraints from the literature, we also derive isochronal masses for most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R ~ 500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T spectral type, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition, a shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type dwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the objects' bolometric luminosity to typically within $\pm$0.15 dex. The derived isochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where available, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported potential underluminosity. Medium resolution spectroscopy of substellar companions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the cloudiness of these objects' atmospheres. It also constrains these objects' bolometric luminosity which can yield measurements of their formation entropy if combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY astrometry.</description>

      <title>The polar debris disc around 99 Herculis: A potential signpost for polar circumbinary planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearby binary star system 99 Herculis (99 Her) is host to the only known polar-aligned circumbinary debris disc. We investigate the hypothesis that the narrow structure of this circumbinary disc is sculpted by the gravitational influence of one or more unseen polar circumbinary planets. We first establish the theoretically viable parameter space for a sculpting planet by considering dynamical stability and clearing mechanisms, including the chaotic zone, Hill radius, diffusion, and polar alignment timescales. We then use $N$-body simulations to test three specific architectures: a single planet interior to the disc, a single planet exterior, and a two-planet system bracketing the disc. Our simulations demonstrate that single-planet models are insufficient to reproduce the observed morphology, as they can only truncate one edge of the disc while leaving the other dynamically extended. In contrast, the two-planet shepherding model successfully carves both the inner and outer edges, confining the debris into a narrow, stable polar ring consistent with observations. We conclude that the structure of the 99 Her debris disc is most plausibly explained by the presence of two shepherding, polar circumbinary planets. We present a specific, testable model for this unique system, which elucidates the pivotal role of planetary bodies in sculpting the architecture of debris discs.</description>

      <title>Understanding Exoplanet Habitability: A Bayesian ML Framework for Predicting Atmospheric Absorption Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of space technology in recent years, fueled by advancements in computing such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), has profoundly transformed our capacity to explore the cosmos. Missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have made information about distant objects more easily accessible, resulting in extensive amounts of valuable data. As part of this work-in-progress study, we are working to create an atmospheric absorption spectrum prediction model for exoplanets. The eventual model will be based on both collected observational spectra and synthetic spectral data generated by the ROCKE-3D general circulation model (GCM) developed by the climate modeling program at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). In this initial study, spline curves are used to describe the bin heights of simulated atmospheric absorption spectra as a function of one of the values of the planetary parameters. Bayesian Adaptive Exploration is then employed to identify areas of the planetary parameter space for which more data are needed to improve the model. The resulting system will be used as a forward model so that planetary parameters can be inferred given a planet's atmospheric absorption spectrum. This work is expected to contribute to a better understanding of exoplanetary properties and general exoplanet climates and habitability.</description>

      <title>Constraining exoplanet interiors using observations of their atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical surveys have identified numerous exoplanets with bulk compositions that are unlike the planets of the Solar System, including rocky super-Earths and gas-enveloped sub-Neptunes. Observing the atmospheres of these objects provides information on the geological processes that influence their climates and surfaces. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of these planets, including insights into the interaction between the atmosphere and interior based on observations made with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We describe the expected climatic and interior planetary regimes for planets with different density and stellar flux and how those regimes might be observationally distinguished. We also identify the observational, experimental, and theoretical innovations that will be required to characterize Earth-like exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Probing the geological setting of exoplanets through atmospheric analysis: using Mars as a test case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the frontier research fields of exoplanetary science is the study of the composition and variability of exoplanetary atmospheres. This field is now moving from the gas giant planets towards the smaller and colder telluric planets, and future instruments like ANDES will focus on the observations of the atmosphere of telluric planets in the habitable zone in reflected light. These future observations will possibly find variable signals due to the view of different hemispheres of the planet. Particularly, the strength of the signal may be linked to the thickness of the atmospheric layer probed, and therefore to the average altitude variations of the planetary surface, that are related to the global geodynamic evolution of the planet. To better prepare for the interpretation and exploitation of these future data, we used Mars as a Solar System analog of a spatially resolved telluric exoplanet. We observed the reflected light of Mars with the high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectrograph GIANO-B (widely used in exoplanetary atmospheric studies) during a 3 month period: we studied the spatial and temporal variations of the Martian CO2 signal using the least-squared deconvolution technique (LSD), to mimic as closely as possible the standard exoplanetary atmospheric analysis. We linked the variations found to the well-known Martian geological surface characteristics: we found a clear dependence of the strength of the CO2 signal with the thickness of the Martian atmospheric layer by comparing the retrieved CO2 signal with the altitudes of our pointings. The proposed strategy is promising: it proved to be effective on Mars and may shed light on the variations in the strength of atmospheric signal of telluric exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Astrobiology: Paper I -- Workshop and Overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in machine learning over the past decade have resulted in a proliferation of algorithmic applications for encoding, characterizing, and acting on complex data that may contain many high dimensional features. Recently, the emergence of deep-learning models trained across very large datasets has created a new paradigm for machine learning in the form of Foundation Models. Foundation Models are programs trained on very large and broad datasets with an extensive number of parameters. Once built, these powerful, and flexible, models can be utilized in less resource-intensive ways to build many different, downstream applications that can integrate previously disparate, multimodal data. The development of these applications can be done rapidly and with a much lower demand for machine learning expertise. And the necessary infrastructure and models themselves are already being established within agencies such as NASA and ESA. At NASA this work is across several divisions of the Science Mission Directorate including the NASA Goddard and INDUS Large Language Models and the Prithvi Geospatial Foundation Model. And ESA initiatives to bring Foundation Models to Earth observations has led to the development of TerraMind. A workshop was held by the NASA Ames Research Center and the SETI Institute, in February 2025, to investigate the potential of Foundation Models for astrobiological research and to determine what steps would be needed to build and utilize such a model or models. This paper shares the findings and recommendations of that workshop, and describes clear near-term, and future opportunities in the development of a Foundation Model (or Models) for astrobiology applications. These applications would include a biosignature, or life characterization, task, a mission development and operations task, and a natural language task for integrating and supporting astrobiology research needs.</description>

      <title>Tracing Planetary Accretion in a 3 Gyr-old Hydrogen-Rich White Dwarf: The Extremely Polluted Atmosphere of LSPM J0207+3331</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of 13 heavy elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Sr) in the photosphere of LSPM J0207+3331, a ~3 Gyr old hydrogen-rich white dwarf with an effective temperature comparable to that of the Sun. Upper limits on carbon, obtained through the absence of molecular CH, suggest accretion from a carbon-volatile-depleted source. The accreted parent body exhibits slight deficits of Mg and Si relative to Fe but otherwise bulk Earth-like abundance patterns; a reasonable interpretation is that LSPM J0207+3331 is accreting a massive differentiated rocky body that had a core mass fraction higher than the Earth's. The high level of pollution indicates that substantial accretion events can still occur even after 3 Gyr of cooling. We also detect weak Ca II H &amp; K line-core emission, making this only the second known isolated polluted white dwarf to exhibit this phenomenon and suggesting the presence of additional physical processes in or above the upper atmosphere. Our analysis also highlights the critical importance of including heavy elements in the model atmosphere structure calculations for highly polluted hydrogen-rich white dwarfs. Neglecting their contribution significantly impacts the inferred thermodynamic structure, leading to inaccuracies in derived stellar parameters. Finally, we show that the observed 11.3 microns infrared excess can be explained by a single silicate dust disk rather than a two-ring disk model.</description>

      <title>Interactions between syn-rift magmatism and tectonic extension at intermediate rifted margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermediate rifted margins exhibit neither seaward dipping reflectors nor exhumed mantle at the continent-ocean transition (COT). Instead, they transition into normal-thickness, magmatic Penrose-type oceanic crust, and thus diverge from the classic magma-rich and magma-poor end-member models. However, several intermediate margins, such as the South China Sea (SCS), display detachment faulting similar to magma-poor margins and magmatic underplating typical of magma-rich ones. How tectonics and magmatism interact in these intermediate environments is poorly understood. Here we use 2D numerical models to demonstrate that the elevated initial geotherm inherited from prior plate subduction in the SCS explains several key observations: an early phase of wide rifting, subsequent localization onto core complexes with substantial footwall magmatic intrusions, and eventual formation of normal igneous oceanic crust at break-up. Thermal weakening caused by syn-rift footwall magmatic intrusions facilitates lower crustal ductile flow, promoting the development of rolling-hinge type detachment faults and exhumation of core complexes. These structures are associated with accelerated tectonic subsidence, which is later moderated by detachment-related doming, as observed in the SCS. Normal-thickness oceanic crust occurs after break-up, even under ultra-slow extension rates used in our simulations, highlighting the importance of inheritance in determining margin architecture, the spatio-temporal distribution of syn-rift magmatism, and the nature of the COT. This behavior contrasts sharply with magma-poor margins, where a cooler lithosphere and similar ultra-slow extension produce no syn-rift magmatism, leading instead to crustal embrittlement, mantle serpentinization and exhumation at the COT.</description>

      <title>Diversity of low-mass planet atmospheres in the C-H-O-N-S-Cl system with interior dissolution, non-ideality, and condensation: Application to TRAPPIST-1e and sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantitative understanding of the nature and composition of low-mass rocky exo(planet) atmospheres during their evolution is needed to interpret observations. The magma ocean stage of terrestrial- and sub-Neptune planets permits mass exchange between their interiors and atmospheres, during which the mass and speciation of the atmosphere is dictated by the planet's volatile budget, chemical equilibria, and gas/fluid solubility in molten rock. As the atmosphere cools, it is modified by gas-phase reactions and condensation. We combine these processes into an open-source Python package built using JAX called Atmodeller, and perform calculations for planet sizes and conditions analogous to TRAPPIST-1e and K2-18b. For TRAPPIST-1e-like planets, our simulations indicate that CO-dominated atmospheres are prevalent during the magma ocean stage, which, upon isochemical cooling, predominantly evolve into CO2-rich atmospheres of a few hundred bar at 280 K. Around 40% of our simulations predict the coexistence of liquid water, graphite, sulfur, and ammonium chloride-key ingredients for surface habitability. For sub-Neptune gas dwarfs, pressures are sufficiently high (few GPa) that gas fugacities deviate from ideality, thereby drastically enhancing solubilities. This buffers the total atmospheric pressure to lower values than for the ideal case. These effects conspire to produce CH4-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres for total pressures exceeding around 3.5 GPa, provided H/C is approximately 100x solar and fO2 moderately reducing (3 log10 units below the iron-wustite buffer). Otherwise, molecular hydrogen remains the predominant species at lower total pressures and/or higher H/C. For all planets at high temperature, solubility enriches C/H in the atmosphere relative to the initial composition.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of a Spacecraft Flyby with the Third Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS from Earth or Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of a spacecraft mission to conduct a flyby of 3I/ATLAS, the third macroscopic interstellar object discovered on July 1 2025, as it traverses the Solar System. There are both ready-to-launch spacecraft currently in storage on Earth, such as Janus, and spacecraft nearing the end of their missions at Mars. We calculate minimum $\Delta V$ single-impulse direct transfer trajectories to 3I/ATLAS both from Earth and from Mars. We consider launch dates spanning January 2025 through March 2026 to explore obtainable and hypothetical mission scenarios. Post-discovery Earth departures require a challenging $\Delta V\gtrsim24$ km s$^{-1}$ to fly by 3I/ATLAS. By contrast, Mars departures from July 2025 - September 2025 require $\Delta V\sim5$ km s$^{-1}$ to achieve an early October flyby -- which is more feasible with existing propulsion capabilities. \added{We further calculate the phase angle and flyby velocity for these trajectories, noting that the resulting flyby speeds would impose significant observational and engineering challenges that a mission would need to overcome.} We discuss how existing spacecraft could be used to observe 3I/ATLAS and how spacecraft at other locations in the Solar System could be repurposed to visit future interstellar objects on short notice.</description>

Abstract: Interstellar objects provide a direct window into the environmental conditions around stars other than the Sun. The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS, a new interstellar comet, offers a unique opportunity to investigate the physical and chemical properties of interstellar objects and to compare them with those of comets in our own Solar System. In this Letter we present the results of a 10-night spectroscopic and photometric monitoring campaign with the 2.4 m Hiltner and 1.3 m McGraw-Hill telescopes at the MDM Observatory. The campaign was conducted between August 8 and 17 while 3I/ATLAS was inbound at heliocentric distances of 3.2 - 2.9 au. Our observations captured the onset of optical gas activity. Nightly spectra reveal a weak CN emission feature in the coma of 3I/ATLAS, absent during the first nights but steadily strengthening thereafter. We measure a CN production rate of $Q$(CN)$\sim6\times$10$^{24}$ s$^{-1}$, towards the lower end of activity observed in Solar System comets. Simultaneous photometry also indicates a small but measurable increase in the coma's radial profile and increasing $r$-band $Af\rho$ with values in the order of $\sim300$ cm. We derived a gas-to-dust production ratio of $\log Q (\mathrm{CN})/Af\rho\sim22.4$. Our upper limit on the C$_2$-to-CN ratio ($\log Q(\mathrm{C}_2)/Q(\mathrm{CN})\lesssim-0.8$) indicates that 3I/ATLAS is a strongly carbon-chain depleted comet. Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are required to verify the apparent carbon-chain depletion and to explore whether such composition represents a recurring trait of the interstellar comet population.</description>

      <title>Orbital decay candidates reconsidered: WASP-4 b is not decaying and Kepler-1658 b is not a planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05229</link>

Abstract: The fate of hot Jupiters is thought to be engulfment by their host stars, the outcome of tidal orbital decay. Transit timing has revealed a few systems with apparently shrinking orbital periods, but such signals can be mimicked by light travel-time effects (LTTE) of a distant companion. Combining transit timings with precise radial-velocity data, including new data, we reassessed three reported cases of orbital decay: WASP-4, WASP-12, and Kepler-1658. For WASP-4, the period change is best explained by LTTE due to an ~8-Jupiter-mass companion at ~8 AU, with no need to invoke orbital decay. For WASP-12, in contrast, the data firmly exclude LTTE and confirm genuine orbital decay. For Kepler-1658, spectroscopic and photometric anomalies reveal the "planet" to be an eclipsing K/M binary bound to the F-type primary, with LTTE explaining the observed period change. Thus, among the known hot Jupiters, only WASP-12 b currently shows compelling evidence for orbital decay.</description>

      <title>Eastward Transients in the Dayside Ionosphere II: A Parallel-plate Capacitor-Like Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03174v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven, energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence, and with matching temporal characteristics as that of the magnetospheric observations. We detailed this in a companion paper. In the present article, we place those observations into context with the dayside ionosphere, and describe a remarkably similar event that took place during the May 2024 geospace superstorm. In both cases, fast, eastward-moving electric field structures were excited equatorward of the ionospheric cusp, on closed magnetic field-lines -- observations that challenge existing modes of explanation for electrodynamics in the cusp-region, where most such observations are interpreted in the context of poleward-moving auroral forms. Instead, primarily eastward-moving electric field structures were associated with turbulent Hall currents that are perhaps characteristically excited during geospace storms by wave-particle interactions near magnetospheric equator or by proton precipitation characteristics in the cusp, forming a `parallel-plate capacitor-like effect'. We propose that transient eastward electrodynamic bursts in the dayside ionosphere might be a common, albeit previously unresolved, feature of geomagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>A Characteristic Signature of Magnetospheric Wave-Particle Interactions Found in the Turbulent E-region</title>

Abstract: Plasma waves in the magnetosphere scatter electrons, causing them to precipitate into Earth's atmosphere, imparting their temporal characteristics to diffuse auroras. In a case study of conjugate radar and satellite observations, we demonstrate a close and unprecedented association between enhanced electrostatic cyclotron harmonic wave activity in the magnetosphere and the appearance of meter-scale plasma turbulence a few seconds later in the lower ionosphere on nearby magnetic field lines. Such direct structuring of the ionosphere carries implications for our understanding of space weather.</description>

      <title>HWO Target Stars and Systems: A Prioritized Community List of Potential Stellar Targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory's ExoEarth Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The HWO Target Stars and Systems 2025 (TSS25) list is a community-developed catalog of potential stellar targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) in its survey to directly image Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. The TSS25 list categorizes potential HWO targets into priority tiers based on their likelihood to be surveyed and the necessity of obtaining observations of their stellar properties prior to the launch of the mission. This target list builds upon previous efforts to identify direct imaging targets and incorporates the results of multiple yield calculations assessing the science return of current design concepts for HWO. The TSS25 list identifies a sample of target stars that have a high probability to be observed by HWO (Tiers 1 and 2), independent of assumptions about the mission's final architecture. These stars should be the focus of community precursor science efforts in order to mitigate risks and maximize the science output of HWO. This target list is publicly available and is a living catalog that will be continually updated leading up to the mission.</description>
