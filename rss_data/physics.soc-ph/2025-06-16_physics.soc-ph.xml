      <title>Modeling Urban Air Quality Using Taxis as Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring urban air quality with high spatiotemporal resolution continues to pose significant challenges. We investigate the use of taxi fleets as mobile sensing platforms, analyzing over 100 million PM2.5 readings from more than 3,000 vehicles across six major U.S. cities during one year. Our findings show that taxis provide fine-grained, street-level air quality insights while ensuring city-wide coverage. We further explore urban air quality modeling using traffic congestion, built environment, and human mobility data to predict pollution variability. Our results highlight geography-specific seasonal patterns and demonstrate that models based solely on traffic and wind speeds effectively capture a city's pollution dynamics. This study establishes taxi fleets as a scalable, near-real-time air quality monitoring tool, offering new opportunities for environmental research and data-driven policymaking.</description>

      <title>A statistical mechanical view of complex economies under the green transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a stylized model of a complex economy to explore the economic tradeoffs imposed by the so called "green transition" -- the shift towards more sustainable production paradigms -- using tools from the Statistical Mechanics of disordered systems. Namely, we promote the parameters of a standard input-output economic model to random variables, in order to characterize the typical statistical properties of its equilibria. A central feature of our work is the explicit inclusion of a waste variable as a proxy for the unwanted byproducts, such as emissions, generated by different production processes. We find that the interplay between economic development and waste gives rise to a double phase transition, separating a region of viable economic activity from two distinct shutdown regimes. Notably, more wasteful ("brown") economies support a larger number of technologies per good but fail to activate most of them, limiting their productive capacity. In contrast, "greener" economies, while having access to fewer technologies, tend to achieve higher economic welfare, up to a critical point where rapid growth under tight waste constraints may destabilize them. Our results highlight the structural tensions between technological development and environmental sustainability, suggesting that the green transition may require careful navigation to avoid abrupt collapses in economic activity. The nature of the phase transitions we observe in the model is linked to the shrinkage of feasible economic configurations under increasing constraints, akin to algorithmic phase transitions studied in Computer Science.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of weighted networks: weight approximation method and its application to food webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowing which parts of a complex system have identical roles simplifies computations and reveals patterns in its network structure. Group theory has been applied to study symmetries in unweighted networks. However, in real-world weighted networks, edge weights are rarely equal, making exact symmetry uncommon. To study symmetries in weighted networks, we aggregate edge weights into a small number of discrete categories. The symmetries of these aggregated networks identify vertices with similar roles in the original weighted network.
  In food webs, this approach helps to quantify ecological co-existence and competition by assessing the functional substitutability of species. We apply our method to 250 empirical food webs, finding that symmetric vertices emerge even under weak approximations, typically forming small orbits of size two or three. These symmetric vertices can appear at any trophic level or network position. We also apply three symmetry measures to compare structural patterns at the network level.</description>

      <title>Bilateral collaboration between Mexico and the United Kingdom for the construction of technical equipment (CHARM) for the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT/GTM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano (LMT), is the largest millimeter radio telescope in the world, and was founded in 2006. This radio telescope is the final product of a collaboration agreement between Mexico and the United States in the 1990s. It is located on top of an extinct volcano in Mexico at an altitude of 4600 meters above sea level. In 2018, the University of Manchester and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory signed an agreement with the Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica Optica y Electronica (INAOE) to train Mexican astronomers in high-frequency radio receiver construction techniques by designing an innovative device called Collaborative Heterodyne Amplifier Receiver for Mexico (CHARM) designed to work at a frequency of 345 GHz. The research team, composed of British and Mexican technicians and scientists, installed CHARM at the LMT in 2019 and began testing the equipment until the COVID-19 pandemic shut it down in March 2020. This paper describes the collaboration process between Mexico and the United Kingdom, facilitated by a British institution dedicated to supporting scientific projects in developing countries, the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF).</description>

      <title>Bias and Identifiability in the Bounded Confidence Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics models such as the bounded confidence models (BCMs) describe how a population can reach consensus, fragmentation, or polarization, depending on a few parameters. Connecting such models to real-world data could help understanding such phenomena, testing model assumptions. To this end, estimation of model parameters is a key aspect, and maximum likelihood estimation provides a principled way to tackle it. Here, our goal is to outline the properties of statistical estimators of the two key BCM parameters: the confidence bound and the convergence rate. We find that their maximum likelihood estimators present different characteristics: the one for the confidence bound presents a small-sample bias but is consistent, while the estimator of the convergence rate shows a persistent bias. Moreover, the joint parameter estimation is affected by identifiability issues for specific regions of the parameter space, as several local maxima are present in the likelihood function. Our results show how the analysis of the likelihood function is a fruitful approach for better understanding the pitfalls and possibilities of estimating the parameters of opinion dynamics models, and more in general, agent-based models, and for offering formal guarantees for their calibration.</description>

      <title>Sustained changes to urban mobility after COVID-19 amplified socio-economic inequalities in Latin America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban mobility is central to economic activity, social inclusion, and access to essential services. COVID-19 caused disruptions to mobility globally, yet its long-term impacts in less developed countries remain poorly understood. Using over 170 million anonymised mobile phone records from Meta-Facebook users in Argentina, Chile, and Colombia (March 2020 to May 2022), we find sustained changes in mobility across socioeconomic and rural-urban gradients. We reveal that mobility recorded the sharpest declines and remained below pre-pandemic levels in most high-density and low socio-economic deprivation areas, while low-density and more deprived communities returned to baseline. These differences reflect the scale of the initial mobility shock rather than subsequent recovery rates. Net mobility to urban cores remained consistently below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting a shift in their functional role. By revealing how COVID-19 reinforced mobility-related inequalities, we contribute novel evidence for planners and policymakers seeking to build more inclusive and resilient mobility systems.</description>

      <title>Bounded confidence dynamics generates opinion cascades on growing scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the pairwise bounded confidence model on scale-free networks where new agents regularly arrive over time. The probability that arriving agents form links to preexisting ones depends on both agent degree and opinion proximity. In parameter value ranges where both factors impact the link choice, a new phenomenon is observed. Minor clusters continuously form on the periphery of the opinion space and remain stable for a time, before suddenly merging with a major cluster in the network. We label these processes as "opinion cascades", and analyse their origin and behavior. They are triggered by the arrival of agents acting as "bridges" between the previously disconnected minor and major clusters. Lastly, we propose theoretical approximations to describe the varying shapes and merging behavior of opinion cascades under different conditions.</description>

      <title>Universal roughness and the dynamics of urban expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to quantify urban sprawl using tools from surface growth physics. Analyzing built-up area expansion in 19 cities (1985-2015), we uncover anisotropic growth with branch-like extensions and a piecewise linear relation between area and population. A universal local roughness exponent $\alpha_{\text{loc}} \approx 0.54$ coexists with variable exponents $\beta$, $z$. As modeling urban sprawl remains an open problem, these results offer a necessary empirical basis for theory.</description>
