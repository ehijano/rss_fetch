      <title>A shear-induced limit on bacterial surface adhesion in fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling bacterial surface adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation in fluid systems is crucial for the safety and efficacy of medical and industrial processes. Here, we theoretically examine the transport of bacteria close to surfaces, isolating how the key processes of bacterial motility and fluid flow interact and alter surface adhesion. We exploit the disparity between the fluid velocity and the swimming velocity of common motile bacteria and, using a hybrid asymptotic-computational approach, we systematically derive the coarse-grained bacterial diffusivity close to surfaces as a function of swimming speed, rotational diffusivity, and shape. We calculate an analytical upper bound for the bacterial adhesion rate by considering the scenario in which bacteria adhere irreversibly to the surface on first contact. Our theory predicts that maximal adhesion occurs at intermediate flow rates: at low flow rates, increasing flow increases surface adhesion, while at higher flow rates, adhesion is decreased by shear-induced cell reorientation.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Cholesteric Phase in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals: Preference for Integer Number of Pitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal, the electrostatic interaction can induce a spontaneous cholesteric helix, even if the material is not chiral. If the liquid-crystal cell is infinitely thick, then the predicted pitch depends continuously on material parameters. Here, we consider how the prediction must be modified in a cell of finite thickness. If the Debye screening length is large enough, we find that the free energy has multiple minima. In these minima, the cholesteric pitch is locked to the cell thickness, so that the cell contains an integer number of pitches. However, if the screening length is smaller, then the cholesteric pitch can vary continuously.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion near a soft surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion near soft surfaces is a situation widely encountered in nanoscale and biological physics. However, a complete theoretical description is lacking to date. Here, we theoretically investigate the dynamics of a two-dimensional colloid in an arbitrary external potential and near a soft surface. The latter is minimally modelled by a Winkler's foundation, and we restrict the study to the colloidal motion in the direction perpendicular to the surface. We start from deterministic hydrodynamic considerations, by invoking the already-established leading-order soft-lubrication forces acting on the particle. Importantly, a negative softness-induced and position-dependent added mass is identified. We then incorporate thermal fluctuations in the description. In particular, an effective Hamiltonian formulation is introduced and a temperature-dependent generalized potential is constructed in order to ensure equilibrium properties for the colloidal position. From these considerations and the Fokker-Planck equation, we then derive the relevant Langevin equation, which self-consistently allows to recover the deterministic equation of motion at zero temperature. Interestingly, besides an expected multiplicative-noise feature, the noise correlator appears to be modified by the surface softness. Moreover, a softness-induced temperature-dependent spurious drift term has to be incorporated within the Ito prescription. Finally, using numerical simulations with various initial conditions and parameter values, we statistically analyze the trajectories of the particle when placed within a harmonic trap and in presence of the soft surface. This allows us to: i) quantify further the influence of surface softness, through the added mass, which enhances the velocity fluctuations; and ii) show that intermediate-time diffusion is unaffected by softness, within the assumptions of the model.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to the phonon theory of liquids: An analytical study of Frenkel frequency and heat capacity as a function of pressure and temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Maxwell relationship and experimental viscosity data, the phonon theory of liquids can provide a temperature-dependent description of liquid heat capacity that is consistent with experimental data. However, since liquid heat capacity also varies with pressure, we present an alternative approach that can be used to calculate the Frenkel frequency in terms of temperature and pressure by applying the concept of chemical potential under the assumption of a diffusive equilibrium. Using this derived Frenkel frequency, we formulate an analytical expression for the liquid heat capacity in terms of both temperature and pressure, without the need for viscosity data, which is consistent with predictions from the phonon theory of liquids. Our model is tested by comparing the calculated heat liquid capacity with experimental data for four noble liquids at various pressures and temperatures, and good agreement is found. Finally, based on our findings, we propose analytical expressions for the Frenkel line and viscosity as a function of pressure and temperature, and discuss the key details and implications of our approach.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the equilibrium Kauzmann transition in a two-dimensional atomistic glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense liquids gradually transform into non-equilibrium amorphous solids as they pass through the experimental glass transition. Experimentally, ergodicity is lost because measurements are conducted within a finite time window. More than seventy years ago, Kauzmann posed a fundamental question: If experiments could run indefinitely, would there exist a critical temperature at which an ergodicity-breaking phase transition occurs? Random first-order transitions represent the modern theoretical framework for this idea, rigorously established in the mean-field limit of high-dimensional atomistic systems and several idealized physical models. However, achieving theoretical understanding in finite dimensions is challenging, while experimental and numerical limitations on accessible timescales hinder direct observation of the putative Kauzmann transition. Here, we overcome this longstanding barrier by developing a computational strategy that combines three advanced Monte Carlo methods to access the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional atomistic glass-former down to zero temperature across a range of system sizes. This enables us to directly measure thermodynamic and structural observables that provide unambiguous evidence that the system undergoes a Kauzmann transition at a temperature that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. This transition is towards an ideal glass state characterized by a complex energy landscape with a hierarchical organization of low-lying states. Our results are the first demonstration that computer simulations can fully probe the statistical mechanics of the bulk transition to a non-ergodic glass state. We anticipate that our study will serve as a foundation for future simulation work on larger systems, three-dimensional materials, and more complex glass-forming models to fully elucidate the nature of the glass state of matter.</description>

      <title>Enhanced molecular diffusion near a soft fluctuating membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles diffusing near interfaces face anisotropic resistance to motion due to hydrodynamic interactions. While this has been extensively studied near \textit{hard} interfaces since the works of Lorentz and Brenner, our understanding of diffusion near \textit{soft, thermally fluctuating} interfaces remains limited. Previous studies have predominantly focused on particles much larger than the molecular scale at which thermal fluctuations become important. In this work, we numerically investigate the dynamics of individual solvent molecules near a thermally fluctuating lipid membrane, a canonical soft interface in biology. We observe that diffusive motion of solvent molecules near the fluctuating membrane is slightly enhanced compared to a flat rigid interface and significantly more so than near an undulated rigid interface. This enhancement in diffusive motion of solvent molecules arises from spontaneous momentum exchanges between the moving membrane and adjacent molecules, promoting mixing. Notably, this dispersion effect overcomes geometric trapping that slows diffusion near the rigid undulated interface. Our analysis reveals that the momentum transfer near the fluctuating membrane is so efficient that it resembles an effective slip boundary condition over a length scale equal to the fluctuation height. These molecular-scale mechanisms differ from those of larger particles, where hydrodynamic memory and elasticity effects can be at play as they relax over timescales comparable to significant diffusive motion. Our findings advance understanding of enhanced diffusive motion and promoted mixing near soft fluctuating membranes involved in diverse biological processes and soft-matter technologies containing natural and model cell membranes.</description>

      <title>Topological defects govern plasticity and shear band formation in two-dimensional amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind plastic instabilities and shear band formation in amorphous media under applied deformation remains a long-standing challenge. Leveraging on the mathematical concept of topology, we revisit this problem using two-dimensional experimental amorphous granular packings subjected to pure shear. We demonstrate that topological defects (TDs) in the displacement vector field act as carriers of plasticity, enabling the prediction of both the onset of plastic flow and the global mechanical response of the system. At the microscopic level, we show that these TDs are responsible for the dynamical breakdown of local orientational order, thereby linking topological excitations to short-range structural changes. Finally, we establish that the spatial localization and cooperative alignment of TDs underlie the formation of macroscopic shear bands, which drive plastic flow under large shear loads. This process is mediated by the quasi-periodic annihilation of large defect clusters and their geometric transformation from an approximately isotropic to a strongly anisotropic shape. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding plastic deformation and shear band formation in two-dimensional amorphous systems by connecting topology, short-range order, and mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Rigid Spheres Rising at Constant Speed Through Collections of Hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of an experimental investigation into buoyant rigid spheres rising through concentrated collections of hydrated hydrogel particles. The volume fraction of particles is such that the mechanical properties of the material are intermediate between a very viscous fluid and a soft solid. Despite the non-Newtonian character of these hydrogels, we find that when the surface of the material is free, an immersed buoyant sphere rises with a constant speed. The effects of the motion in the surrounding material are observed to be highly localized around the sphere. When the mass of the sphere is varied, its terminal velocity is observed to depend exponentially on the buoyancy. Qualitatively distinct behavior is found when a lid is present on the surface of the material, and in this case, a sublinear time dependence of the displacement is found. Linear motion of the sphere is accompanied by flow at the surface of the material whereas fluid movement is suppressed when a lid is applied. Other boundary condition variations are consistent with the perspective that constant speed motion is induced by the presence of a free boundary.</description>

      <title>Transient segregation of bi-disperse granular mixtures in a periodic chute flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient size segregation of a bi-disperse granular mixture flowing over a periodic chute is studied using the Discrete Element Method and continuum simulations. A recently developed particle force-based size segregation model is used to predict the time-dependent flow properties of binary mixtures starting from rest. A two-way coupled continuum model that solves the momentum balance and convection-diffusion equations by incorporating the mixture segregation model along with the generalized inertial number-based rheological model is developed for predicting the evolution of segregation. The predicted concentration profiles and other flow properties of the mixture are found to be in good agreement with the DEM data for a variety of compositions. The evolution of the centre of mass of the two species with time is also very well captured for different initial configurations and size ratios using the particle force-based segregation model.</description>

      <title>Shear flow of frictional spheroids: lentil-like grains slide more than rice-like</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rheology of dense granular shear flows is influenced by friction and particle shape. We investigate numerically the impact of non-spherical particle geometries under shear on packing fraction, stress ratios, velocity fluctuations, force distribution, and dissipation mechanisms, for a wide range of inertial numbers, friction coefficients and aspect ratios. We obtain a regime diagram for the dissipation which shows that lentil-like (oblate) particles exhibit an extended sliding regime compared to rice-like (prolate) particles with the same degree of eccentricity. Additionally, we identify non-monotonic behaviour of slightly aspherical particles at low friction, linking it to their higher fluctuating rotational kinetic energy. We find that angular velocity fluctuations are generally reduced when particles align with the flow, except in highly frictional rolling regimes, where fluctuations collapse onto a power-law distribution and motion becomes less correlated. Moreover, for realistic friction coefficients power dissipation tends to concentrate along the major axis aligned with the flow, where slip events are more frequent. We also show that flat particles develop stronger fabric anisotropy than elongated ones, influencing macroscopic stress transmission. These findings provide new insights into the role of particle shape in granular mechanics, with implications for both industrial and geophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for doublet craters formed by low-velocity impacts of unequal-mass spheres into a granular bed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the formation mechanism of doublet craters is an important challenge for advancing knowledge in astronomy and granular physics. In this study, we investigated craters formed by low-velocity impacts of two steel spheres with different masses into a granular bed. Even when the masses were different, a figure-eight-shaped doublet crater and a central ridge were observed, similar to the case with equal masses. However, the resulting shape became asymmetric even without a time delay between impacts. The total length of the doublet crater increased depending on the spacing between the two spheres and the ratio of their impact energies. These results followed a theoretical model based on a scaling law, where the crater diameter is proportional to the one-fourth power of the impact energy. A model was also developed to describe the crater overlap, which increases as the spheres become closer. It was also shown that the crater diameters vary with the time difference, and that the second impact tends to form a larger crater due to fluidization induced by the first.</description>

      <title>Computing dielectric spectra in molecular dynamics simulations: using a cavity to disentangle self and cross correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric spectra are typically obtained in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by analyzing the fluctuations, in the absence of an applied electric field, of the total dipole moment of the simulation box. We compare this standard method with a protocol that focuses on a virtual cavity whose size is chosen to include short-range dipolar cross-correlations, while excluding long-range correlations that are affected by the choice of electrostatic boundary conditions. We tested this protocol on three non-polarizable systems with different dielectric permittivities. We showed that it produces the same dielectric spectra as the standard method while being less sensitive to noise. The question of the decomposition of a dielectric spectrum into self and cross contributions is discussed in the context of both methods. We propose that, for a liquid with a sufficiently high dielectric permittivity, the cavity protocol yields a self-spectrum consistent with the electrostatic boundary conditions applicable to the experimental situation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the size and shape of assembled structures is a fundamental challenge in self-assembly, and is highly relevant in material design and biology. Here, we show that specific, but promiscuous, short-range binding interactions make it possible to economically assemble linear filaments of user-defined length. Our approach leads to independent control over the mean and width of the filament size distribution and allows us to smoothly explore design trade-offs between assembly quality (spread in size) and cost (number of particle species). We employ a simple hierarchical assembly protocol to minimize assembly times, and show that multiple stages of hierarchy make it possible to extend our approach to the assembly of higher-dimensional structures. Our work provides a simple and experimentally straightforward solution to size control that is immediately applicable to a broad range of systems, from DNA origami assemblies to supramolecular polymers and beyond.</description>

      <title>Particle-scale origin of quadrupolar non-affine displacement fields in granular solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05038v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we identify the local structural defects that control the non-affine displacement fields in jammed disk packings subjected to athermal, quasistatic (AQS) simple shear. While complex non-affine displacement fields typically occur during simple shear, isolated effective quadrupoles are also observed and their probability increases with increasing pressure. We show that the emergence of an isolated effective quadrupole requires the breaking of an interparticle contact that is aligned with low-frequency, spatially extended vibrational modes. Since the Eshelby inhomogeneity problem gives rise to quadrupolar displacement fields in continuum materials, we reformulate and implement Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method (EIM) for jammed disk packings. Using EIM, we show that we can reconstruct the non-affine displacement fields for jammed disk packings in response to applied shear as a sum of discrete Eshelby-like defects that are caused by mismatches in the local stiffnesses of triangles formed from Delaunay triangulation of the disk centers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over nearly two decades, Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) has become a standard technique for extracting dynamic correlation functions from time-lapse microscopy data, with applications spanning colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions, active fluids, and biological systems. In its most common implementation, DDM analyzes image sequences acquired with a conventional microscope equipped with a digital camera, yielding time- and wavevector-resolved information analogous to that obtained in multi-angle Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). With a widening array of applications and a growing, heterogeneous user base, lowering the technical barrier to performing DDM has become a central objective. In this tutorial article, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting DDM experiments -- from planning and acquisition to data analysis -- and introduce the open-source software package fastDDM, designed to efficiently process large image datasets. fastDDM employs optimized, parallel algorithms that reduce analysis times by up to four orders of magnitude on typical datasets (e.g., 10,000 frames), thereby enabling high-throughput workflows and making DDM more broadly accessible across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear ferroelectric characteristics of barium titanate nanocrystals determined via a polymer nanocomposite approach</title>

Abstract: The growing demand for high energy storage materials has garnered substantial attention towards lead-free ferroelectric nanocrystals (NCs), such as BaTiO3 (BTO), for next-generation multilayer ceramic capacitors. Notably, it remains challenging to accurately measure the dielectric constant and polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loop for BTO NCs. Herein, we report on nonlinear ferroelectric characteristics of BTO NCs via a polymer nanocomposite approach. Specifically, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)(PVP)/BTO nanocomposite films of 3-10 {\mu}m thickness, containing 380 nm tetragonal-phased and 60 nm cubic-phased BTO NCs with uniform particle dispersion, were prepared. Theoretical deconvolution of the broad experimental P-E loops of the PVP/BTO NC composite films revealed three contributions, that is, the linear deformational polarization of the nanocomposites, the polarization of BTO NCs (Pp ), and the polarization from strong particle-particle interactions. Using different mixing rules and nonlinear dielectric analysis, the overall dielectric constants of BTO NCs were obtained, from which the internal field in the BTO NCs (Ep ) was estimated. Consequently, the Pp-Ep hysteresis loops were obtained for the BTO380 and BTO60 NCs. Interestingly, BTO380 exhibited square-shaped ferroelectric loops, whereas BTO60 displayed slim paraelectric loops. This work presents a robust and versatile route to extract the Pp-Ep loops of ferroelectric NCs from polymer/ceramic nanocomposites.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Trapping of Tracer Particles Induced by Spatially Correlated Noise in Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuating Stokes equation in the presence of spatially correlated noise -- characterized by a single length scale -- while preserving thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation-dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends nonmonotonically on the ratio $\ell/r$ between the correlation length $\ell$ and the particle radius $r$: the MSD decreases as $\ell$ approaches $r$, reaches a minimum near $\ell\simeq r$, and rises again for $\ell &gt; r$. The initial suppression stems from transient trapping, where sluggish momentum diffusion at short wavelengths confines the particle. When $\ell&gt;r$, the particle hops between traps and eventually recovers normal diffusion ($\text{MSD}\propto t$) consistent with the fact that momentum diffusion crosses over to the standard Laplacian at long wavelengths. We further illustrate that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equations, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Domain Growth in Long-range Ising Models with Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the rich low-temperature kinetics of the long-range Ising model (LRIM). This study investigates domain growth in an LRIM with quenched disorder, following a deep low-temperature quench. Specifically, we consider an Ising model with interactions that decay as $J(r) \sim r^{-(D+\sigma)}$, where $D$ is the spatial dimension and $\sigma &gt; 0$ is the power-law exponent. The quenched disorder is introduced via random pinning fields at each lattice site. For nearest-neighbor models, we expect that domain growth during activated dynamics is logarithmic in nature: $R(t) \sim (\ln t)^{\alpha}$, with growth exponent $\alpha &gt;0$. Here, we examine how long-range interactions influence domain growth with disorder in dimensions $D = 1$ and $D = 2$. In $D = 1$, logarithmic growth is found to persist for various $\sigma &gt; 0$. However, in $D = 2$, the dynamics is more complex due to the non-trivial interplay between extended interactions, disorder, and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks To Inverse Design Metasurfaces For Incident Angle-Independent Unidirectional Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization of metasurface designs for specific functionality is a challenging problem due to the intricate relation between structural features and electromagnetic responses. Recently, many researchers resolved to inverse design of metasurfaces for efficient design parameters based on methods such as parameter optimization, evolutionary optimization and machine learning. In this paper a hybrid quantum machine learning method which uses quantum encoders to enhance the performance of a classical GAN is applied to implement inverse design of a metasurface. Aiming towards angle-independent unidirectional transmission, this approach combines a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to optimize metasurface designs. Incident-angle independent uni-directional transmission has potential applications in efficient solar cells, thermal cooling, non-reciprocal devices, etc. However, it is very challenging to achieve such a metasurface design via forward methods and hence very few studies exist till now in this direction. The methodology employed in this work reduces the data requirement for inverse design by 30% compared to conventional GAN-based methods. More importantly, the developed metasurface designs show high fidelity of 95% with regard to the targeted far-field radiation patterns. We also provide a material look-up table for feasible substitutes of the obtained material design with real materials and yet maintaining performance accuracy. Further, we embed the inverse-designed metasurfaces into Perovskite solar cell layers to demonstrate the improvement in its performance. We observe that the conversion efficiency of the example perovskite solar cell improves by 95% and remains independent of incident angle in the range -60$^\circ$ to 60$^\circ$ within the desired frequency range.</description>

      <title>Elastohydrodynamics of 3D chemically active filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active deformable filaments exhibit a large range of qualitatively different three-dimensional dynamics, depending on their flexibility, the strength of the active forcing, and the surrounding environment. For a sufficiently strong activity, the resulting forces buckle the filament into different shapes, altering its dynamic behaviour. We investigate the dynamic behaviour of elastic, chemically propelled phoretic filaments, combining two existing models; a local version of slender phoretic theory, which determines the resulting slip flows for chemically propelled filaments with a given shape and chemical patterning, is paired with an efficient method for capturing the elastohydrodynamics of a deformable filament in viscous flow to study the chemoelastohydrodynamics of filaments. As the activity increases, or equivalently the filament stiffness decreases, these filaments undergo buckling instabilities that alter their behaviour from rigid rods. We follow their behaviour well beyond the buckling threshold to find a rich array of dynamics, including motions that may be described as planar swimming, circling, pinwheeling, flapping and diffusive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local entropy production rate and the local entropy flow in active systems composed of non-interacting run-and-tumble particles in a thermal bath. After providing generic time-dependend expressions, we focus on the stationary regime. Remarkably, in this regime the two entropies are equal and depend only on the distribution function and its spatial derivatives. We discuss in details two case studies, relevant to real situations. First, we analyze the case of space dependent speed,describing photokinetic bacteria, cosidering two different shapes of the speed, piecewise constant and sinusoidal. Finally, we investigate the case of external force fields, focusing on harmonic and linear potentials, which allow analytical treatment. In all investigated cases, we compare exact and approximated analytical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that long-wavelength interfacial fluctuations are strongly suppressed in non-equilibrium phase coexistence between bulk hyperuniform systems. Using simulations of three distinct microscopic models, we demonstrate that hyperuniform interfaces are much smoother than equilibrium ones, with a universal reduction of height fluctuations at large scale. We derive a non-equilibrium interface equation from the field theory of the bulk order parameter, and predict a reduction in height fluctuations, $S_h(\boldsymbol k)\equiv \langle |h(\boldsymbol k)|^2\rangle\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-1}$, in stark contrast to equilibrium capillary wave theory where $S_h(\boldsymbol k)\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-2}$. Our results establish a new universality class for non-equilibrium interfaces, highlighting the fundamental role of suppressed bulk fluctuations in shaping interfacial dynamics far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>CEMP: a platform unifying high-throughput online calculation, databases and predictive models for clean energy materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of materials science is undergoing a shift from empirical approaches to data-driven and algorithm-oriented research paradigm. The state-of-the-art platforms are confined to inorganic crystals, with limited chemical space, sparse experimental data and a lack of integrated online computation for rapid validation. Here, we introduce the Clean Energy Materials Platform (CEMP), an open-access platform that integrates high-throughput computing workflows, multi-scale machine learning (ML) models and a comprehensive materials database tailored for clean energy applications. A key feature of CEMP is the online calculation module, which enables fully automatic quantum and molecular dynamics simulations via structured table uploads. CEMP harmonizes heterogeneous data from experimental measurements, theoretical calculation and AI-based predictions for four material classes, including small molecules, polymers, ionic liquids, and crystals. The platform hosts ~ 376,000 entries, including ~6,000 experimental records, ~50,000 quantum-chemical calculations and ~320,000 AI-predicted properties. The database covers 12 critical properties and the corresponding ML models demonstrate robust predictive power with R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.94, thus ensures rapid material screening, structure-property relationship analysis and multi-objective optimization for clean energy applications. CEMP aims to establish a digital ecosystem for clean energy materials, enabling a closed-loop workflow from data acquisition to material discovery and real-time online validation.</description>

      <title>Stealthy-Hyperuniform Wave Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform structures are spatial patterns whose fluctuations disappear on long length scales, making them effectively homogeneous when observed from afar. Mathematically, this means that their spectral density, $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, approaches zero for low wavenumber, $|\textbf{k}|$. Crystalline lattices are hyperuniform, as are certain quasicrystals, maximally random jammed packing of spheres, and electrons in the fractional quantum Hall state. Stealthy-hyperuniformity is an even stronger constraint on the spectral density: it requires that $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$ is strictly zero in a finite range of wavevectors around $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}$, called the stealthy regime, or exclusion region. Since the degree of scattering by disorder is, to leading order, proportional to $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, waves propagating through such structures may do so without scattering for sufficiently long wavelengths and short distances. Here, we measure scattering by disorder in photonic crystal slabs with stealthy-hyperuniform disorder by measuring the linewidths of the photonic bands. We observe the transition between the stealthy and non-stealthy regimes, marked by a sharp increase in linewidth. We also observe the effects of multiple scattering in the stealthy regime, which implies diminishing transparency. Moreover, we show that residual single scattering in the stealthy regime arises from an intrinsically non-Hermitian effect: propagating light has a complex effective mass due to radiative loss out of the slab.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Morphology of Cellulose Nanocrystals via Controlled Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04171v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated nanoparticles derived from natural cellulose, with potential applications ranging from rheological modifiers and emulsion stabilizers to photonic pigments and sensors. For most applications, precise control over CNC morphology and surface chemistry is essential, but the relationship between process parameters, CNC characteristics, and their resulting behavior is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of centrifugation and ionic strength on CNC morphology after dialysis using transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning electron diffraction. We find that the centrifugation step commonly applied during CNC purification promotes the formation of compact composite nanoparticles made of aligned crystallites, referred to as 'bundles', that are associated preferentially along their hydrophobic faces. In stark contrast, transient exposure to high ionic strength leads to fractal-like, irregular composite nanoparticles. We then examine the consequence of these morphological differences on the cholesteric self-organization of the CNCs: aligned bundles reduce the cholesteric pitch in suspension, causing a blue-shift in the color of dish-cast photonic films, while misaligned particles promote gelation, producing colorless films. This study reveals the importance of sample history, in particular, the often-disregarded purification steps, on CNC characteristics and their ensemble behavior, thereby unlocking new routes for tailoring this promising nanomaterial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to control the morphology of the nanotube deposit formed during the evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate is of theoretical and practical interest. Such deposits are required for various applications including nanotechnology, medicine, biotechnology, and optronics. In the experiment of Zhao et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 440, 68 (2015)], an annular deposit was formed near the contact line. The deposition geometry is caused by the coffee ring effect. This deposit is unusual in its morphology. It changes gradually in space from a disordered structure in the inner part of the ring to an aligned structure of nanotubes close to the periphery. To understand the mechanisms that lead to this, we have developed a mathematical model that takes into account the effects of advection, diffusion, and electrostatic interactions on particle transport. Results of numerical calculations have confirmed that all these factors together have an influence on the formation of such a variable morphology. Qualitative agreement with the experiment is shown for some values of the model parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions between active individuals in animal collectives lead to emergent responses that remain elusive in synthetic soft matter. Here, shape-morphing polymers are used to create bio-inspired transient solids that self-assemble with controlled mechanical properties and disassemble on demand. Dilute-suspensions of magnetic, heat-responsive liquid crystal elastomer ribbons mechanically interlock, inducing reversible aggregation. A mathematical model is developed that sheds light on the role of topological mechanisms in aggregation. Aggregation was favored for ribbons with moderate curvature at 25C above crosslinking temperature as compared to flat ribbons or higher curvature ribbons at higher temperatures. The ribbon suspensions reversibly transition between fluid- and solid-like states, exhibiting up to 6 orders-of-magnitude increase in the storage moduli of the entangled aggregates compared with the liquid dispersions. Controlled dissociation is induced by imparting kinetic energy to the individual ribbons at high magnetic field rotation speeds (&gt; 200 RPM). Ribbon shape and the medium in which dissociation occurs were shown to govern disassembly. Imparting dynamic collective behaviors into synthetic systems may enable a range of potential applications from bio-inspired soft robotics to injectable biomaterials.</description>

      <title>Free energy of self-avoiding polymer chain confined between parallel walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and computing the entropic forces exerted by polymer chains under confinement is important for many reasons, from research to applications. However, extracting properties related to the free energy, such as the force (or pressure) on confining walls, does not readily emerge from conventional polymer dynamics simulations due to the entropic contributions inherent in these free energies. Here we propose an alternative method to compute such forces, and the associated free energies, based on empirically measuring the average force required to confine a polymer chain between parallel walls connected by an artificial elastic spring. This measurement enables us to interpolate the expression for the free energy of a confined self-avoiding chain and offer an analytical expression to complement the classical theory of ideal chains in confined spaces. Therefore, the significance of our method extends beyond the findings of this paper: it can be effectively employed to investigate the confinement free energy across diverse scenarios where all kinds of polymer chains are confined in a gap between parallel walls.</description>

Abstract: It is frequent for active or living entities to find themselves embedded in a surrounding medium. Resulting composite systems are usually classified as either active fluids or active solids. Yet, in reality, particularly in the biological context, a broad spectrum of viscoelasticity exists in between these two limits. There, both viscous and elastic properties are combined. To bridge the gap between active fluids and active solids, we here systematically derive a unified continuum-theoretical framework. It covers viscous, viscoelastic, and elastic active materials. Our continuum equations are obtained by coarse-graining a discrete, agent-based microscopic dynamic description. In our subsequent analysis, we mainly focus on thin active films on supporting substrates. Strength of activity and degree of elasticity are used as control parameters that control the overall behavior. We concentrate on the analysis of transitions between spatially uniform analytical solutions of collective migration. These include isotropic and polar, orientationally ordered states. A stationary polar solution of persistent directed collective motion is observed for rather fluid-like systems. It corresponds to the ubiquitous swarming state observed in various kinds of dry and wet active matter. With increasing elasticity, persistent motion in one direction is prevented by elastic anchoring and restoring forces. As a consequence, rotations of the spatially uniform migration direction and associated flow occur. Our unified description allows to continuously tune the material behavior from viscous, via viscoelastic, to elastic active behavior by variation of a single parameter. Therefore, it allows in the future to investigate the time evolution of complex systems and biomaterials such as biofilms within one framework.</description>

Abstract: While many living biological media combine both viscous and elastic properties, most theoretical studies employ either purely fluid- or solid-like descriptions. We here use a unified framework for active films on substrates capable of describing a broad range of viscoelastic behavior to explore the interplay between activity and rheology. The core of the study is a comprehensive state diagram showing a rich world of spatiotemporal dynamic states. Our results demonstrate the potential of tunable rheology to realize modes of controlled active transport on the microscale.</description>

      <title>Active wetting transitions induced by rotational noise at solid interfaces</title>

Abstract: We investigate the wetting transitions displayed by the collection of active Brownian particles (ABPs) confined within rigid, impenetrable, flat walls. In our computational study using Brownian dynamics simulations, the wall-particle interactions are implemented with a short-range repulsive potential. An enhanced rotational diffusion at the walls is used as a control parameter for wetting transitions. Increasing the wall rotational diffusion destabilizes complete wetting, and the aggregate shows morphological transitions. We observe a sequence of morphological transitions with an increase in wall rotational diffusion: symmetric complete wetting (SCW), asymmetric complete wetting (ACW), partial wetting (PW) with droplet formation, and drying. In the PW state, we compute the contact angle as a function of activity and rotational noise. Our analysis indicates that these transitions are linked to enhanced kinetic energy fluctuations of particles and bubble formations in the dense state. We further characterize the nature of these transitions by systematically analyzing an order parameter. Our work shows that modifying local reorientation rates alone is sufficient to induce wetting transitions in active systems.</description>

      <title>Lift force in chiral, compressible granular matter</title>

Abstract: Micropolar fluid theory, an extension of classical Newtonian fluid dynamics, incorporates angular velocities and rotational inertias and has long been a foundational framework for describing granular flows. We propose a macroscopic model of granular matter based on active micropolar fluid dynamics, which incorporates internal rotations, couple stresses, and broken parity through odd viscosity. Our framework extends traditional micropolar theory to describe chiral granular flows driven far from equilibrium, where energy is continuously injected and dissipated. In particular, we focus on steady states and explicitly neglect energy conservation, reflecting the dissipative nature of granular systems maintained in non-equilibrium by external forcing. Within this setup, we study the lift force experienced by a test bead embedded in a compressible, parity-breaking granular flow. We analyze how odd viscosity and microrotation modify the transverse forces, using both analytical results in the linearized Stokes regime and nonlinear finite element simulations. Our results demonstrate that active micropolar fluids provide a physically consistent and symmetry-informed continuum description of chiral granular matter, capable of capturing lift forces that emerge uniquely from odd transport effects.</description>

Abstract: The growth of viscous two-dimensional lipid domains in contact with a viscoelastic actin network was recently shown to exhibit unusual lipid domain ripening due to the geometry and anisotropy of the actin network [Arnold &amp; Takatori. Langmuir. 40, 26570-26578 (2024)]. In this work, we interpret previous experimental results on lipid membrane-actin composites with a theoretical model that combines the Cahn-Hilliard and Landau-de Gennes liquid crystal theory. In our model, we incorporate fiber-like characteristics of actin filaments and bundles through a nematic order parameter, and elastic anisotropy through cubic nematic gradients. Numerical simulations qualitatively agree with experimental observations, by reproducing the competition between the thermodynamic forces that coarsen lipid domains versus the elastic forces generated by the surrounding actin network that resist domain coarsening. We observe a decrease in the growth of domain sizes, finding $R(t) \sim t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha &lt; 1/4$ for different actin network stiffnesses, in sharp contrast to the $\sim t^{1/3}$ scaling for diffusive growth of domains in the absence of the actin network. Our findings may serve as a foundation for future developments in modeling elastic ripening in complex systems.</description>

      <title>A unifying approach to self-organizing systems interacting via conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.</description>

      <title>The Basins of Attraction of Soft Sphere Packings Are Not Fractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy landscape plays a central role in understanding the dynamics of low-temperature and athermal systems, which are characterized by a plethora of minima and the intricate geometry of their basins of attraction. Due to their complexity, these landscapes resist analytical treatment and must instead be studied numerically. We focus on jammed soft spheres, a paradigmatic model of glasses and granulars, to expose the limitations of standard numerical methods in resolving the true structure of energy landscapes. We show that CVODE is the ODE solver with the best time-for-error trade-off, outperforming commonly used steepest-descent solvers by several orders of magnitude. Using this numerical approach, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies of soft sphere packings destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderately low dimensions. Employing a range of geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that earlier claims on the fractality of basins of attraction originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies. In reality, the basins of attraction of soft sphere packings are smooth structures with well-defined length scales.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of decentralized learning for smart active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smart active matter has the ability to control its motion guided by individual policies to achieve collective goals. We introduce a theoretical framework to study a decentralized learning process in which agents can locally exchange policies to adapt their behavior and maximize a predefined reward function. We use our formalism to derive explicit hydrodynamic equations for the policy dynamics. We apply the theory to two different microscopic models where policies correspond either to fixed parameters similar to evolutionary dynamics, or to state-dependent controllers known from the field of robotics. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and agent-based simulations. By deriving fundamental control parameters and uncertainty relations, our work lays the foundations for a statistical physics analysis of decentralized learning.</description>
