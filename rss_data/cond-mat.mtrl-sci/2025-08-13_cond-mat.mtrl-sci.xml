      <title>DiffractGPT: Atomic Structure Determination from X-ray Diffraction Patterns using Generative Pre-trained Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure determination from powder diffraction patterns is a complex challenge in materials science, often requiring extensive expertise and computational resources. This study introduces DiffractGPT, a generative pre-trained transformer model designed to predict atomic structures directly from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. By capturing the intricate relationships between diffraction patterns and crystal structures, DiffractGPT enables fast and accurate inverse design. Trained on thousands of atomic structures and their simulated XRD patterns from the JARVIS-DFT dataset, we evaluate the model across three scenarios: (1) without chemical information, (2) with a list of elements, and (3) with an explicit chemical formula. The results demonstrate that incorporating chemical information significantly enhances prediction accuracy. Additionally, the training process is straightforward and fast, bridging gaps between computational, data science, and experimental communities. This work represents a significant advancement in automating crystal structure determination, offering a robust tool for data-driven materials discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Electronic transport and Fermi surface of Weyl semimetal WTe2: quantum oscillations and first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, topological semimetals are being actively investigated from both theoretical and experimental perspectives due to their unique physical properties, including topologically protected states, large magnetoresistivity, and high carrier mobility, which make these materials promising for various applications in electronics. In this work, we present experimental and theoretical studies of the electronic structure and electronic transport in the Weyl semimetal $WTe_2$. Band structure of $WTe_2$ was scrutinized with DFT+U+SOC method showing the semimetallic nature and sensitivity of the structure to the value of U and to changes in the Fermi energy. Our results demonstrate that $WTe_2$ is in a near-compensated state and exhibits an almost quadratic non-saturating magnetoresistivity. It is found that $WTe_2$ violates the classical Kohler's rule, which is attributed to the coexistence of multiple scattering mechanisms and a strong temperature dependence of the current carrier concentration. Analysis of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations reveals three distinct frequencies corresponding to two electron and one hole Fermi surface pockets, which are well reproduced in Fermi surface calculations. Using the Lifshitz-Kosevich formalism, we determined the electronic structure parameters for each Fermi surface pocket. Additionally, we discuss the relationship between the g-factor and the Berry phase extracted from quantum oscillations.</description>

      <title>When Surface Dynamics Fakes Symmetry -- Oxygen on Rh(100) Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heating a long-range ordered adsorbate phase beyond its stability temperature does not necessarily result in a disordered phase, it can also break up into heavily fluctuating ordered domains. Temporal and/or spatial averaging over these fluctuations may give the impression of both a wrong periodicity and a false local symmetry. This can happen even below liquid-nitrogen temperature, so that the true nature of the phase might remain undetected. We demonstrate this scenario at the catalytically active Rh(100) surface covered by 1/2 monolayer (ML) of oxygen, using quantitative low energy electron diffraction (LEED), variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). Using the example of CO adsorption, we show that local symmetry can have a decisive influence on the binding energy and thus the chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Mitigation of structural defects during the growth of two-dimensional van der Waals chalcogenides by molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of wafer-scale van der Waals (vdW) thin films and heterostructures by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is important for future applications in quantum technologies, next generation optoelectronic devices, and fundamental physics investigations. When grown using co-deposition methods that are typically used for compound semiconductor MBE, vdW materials typically show a high density of structural defects including twin or antiphase domains, spiral growth, and pyramidal growth. These defects are caused by the relatively weak film/substrate interaction and/or the poor wettability of typical substrates by many vdW materials. These difficulties can be mitigated using a multi-step growth procedure in which growth stages including nucleation and coalescence can be rigorously controlled, resulting in high-quality deposition of vdW thin films. This article will describe a general recipe for the growth of highly-crystalline wafer-scale vdW thin films by MBE.</description>

      <title>Fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal in the electric-field-tuned $\mathrm{Hf_2S}$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully-compensated ferrimagnet has garnered widespread attention due to its zero-net total magnetic moment and non-relativistic global spin splitting. In general, for a fully-compensated ferrimagnet, at least one spin channel should be gapped to ensure a zero-net total magnetic moment, which would lead to a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic semiconductor or half-metal, and appears to limit the existence of a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal. Here, we propose to start with a spin-degenerate two-dimensional antiferromagnetic metal with spin-layer locking and achieve a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Using first-principles calculations, we have validated our proposal by taking monolayer $\mathrm{Hf_2S}$ as an example. Without considering spin-orbit coupling (SOC), monolayer $\mathrm{Hf_2S}$ indeed has a zero-net total magnetic moment, exhibits spin splitting, and is metallic within a reasonable range of electric field strength. Therefore, monolayer $\mathrm{Hf_2S}$ under an applied electric field can indeed become a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal. When SOC is included, the application of an electric field can induce an asymmetric band structure. Our work offers an alternative route to realize the originally forbidden fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal, paving the way for further exploration of fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Relaxation-Time Approach for Size-Dependent Conductivity in Anisotropic Metallic Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shrinking CMOS interconnect dimensions to the nanometer scale intensifies electron scattering at surfaces, interfaces, and grain boundaries, causing severe conductivity loss and challenging copper-based designs. Here we present a momentum-resolved relaxation time framework that integrates density functional theory with the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation to predict size-dependent resistivity in metallic thin films. Electron phonon interactions are computed from first principles, and anisotropic surface and grain boundary scattering is captured through a momentum dependent mean free path, allowing relaxation times to vary spatially and directionally without empirical fitting. Applied to isotropic (Cu, Ag, Au) and anisotropic (W, Ti$_2$GeC) metals, the model achieves excellent agreement with experiments and uncovers the critical role of crystallographic anisotropy in transport. We further identify layered MAX phase compounds as promising ultrathin interconnects. This work provides a predictive, physically rigorous, and computationally efficient route to designing high-performance conductors for next generation nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Degradation of LATP Solid Electrolyte in High Alkaline Li-$O_2$ Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of electrolyte degradation in all-solid-state humidified Li-$O_2$ batteries, which offer high theoretical energy density and potential cost advantages over conventional lithium-ion batteries. Combining STEM-EELS, and XPS characterizations with DFT calculations, we reveal the leaching of $(PO_4)^{3+}$ and $Al^{3+}$ ions from the $Li_{1.3}Al_{0.3}Ti_{1.7}(PO_4)_3$ (LATP) solid electrolyte upon battery discharge, caused by the highly alkaline environment. Upon charging, the leached ions precipitate as $Li_3PO_4$ and $AlPO_4$, which accumulate on the LATP surface and contribute to battery degradation. A Ti-rich layer is observed at the surface after a few cycles due to depletion of other cations. Our findings suggest that the degradation products are formed through repeated dissolution and precipitation in the discharge-charge cycles. Furthermore, our results indicate that the Ti-rich layer on the LATP surface can potentially reduce parasitic reactions. Our study provides mechanistic understanding of LATP solid electrolyte degradation in humidified Li-$O_2$ cell, paving the way for designing more durable and efficient Li-$O_2$ batteries.</description>

      <title>Load-Dependent Sliding behavior of WSe2-x solid lubricant coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are commonly used as solid lubricants in various environments. Molybdenum disulfide is the most studied and applied TMD solid lubricant, but other members may have similar or even better sliding properties. Tungsten diselenide is one of the materials that has rarely been investigated in terms of tribological properties. This paper provides a comprehensive tribological characterization of substoichiometric tungsten diselenide and molybdenum disulfide coatings deposited by magnetron sputtering. We focused on tribological properties at a macroscopic scale, particularly friction and wear dependence on applied load; however, a nanoscale frictional assessment of worn surfaces was performed as well to identify the major wear mechanisms. Substoichiometric tungsten diselenide outperformed traditional molybdenum disulfide, exhibiting much lower friction in humid air, suggesting lower coating sensitivity to the humid atmosphere. Moreover, a combination of nanotribological experiments in the wear tracks with sliding under different environmental conditions suggests that the key factor causing frictional load-dependence (deviation from Amonton's law) is frictional heating of the surface.</description>

      <title>The spontaneous Nernst coefficient of ferromagnets from the interplay of electron scattering and Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Boltzmann transport approach to derive the spontaneous Nernst coefficient for ferromagnetic metals, explicitly treating the transverse current density due to Berry curvature as a Fermi surface property. We find that the spontaneous Nernst coefficient is proportional to the inverse of the scattering time constant, implying that efficient spontaneous Nernst materials should exhibit relatively strong scattering, a stark contrast to ordinary Nernst materials. Furthermore, we establish a direct connection between the strength and sign of the spontaneous Nernst coefficient and the itinerant contribution to orbital angular momentum density arising from the Bloch bands. Finally we construct a rigid two-bands model to evaluate the thermoelectric coefficients by which we find a good agreement with the signs and orders of magnitude of the experimental coefficients of magnetic 3d transition metal ferromagnets. We finally propose some practical recipes for maximizing the spontaneous Nernst effect through electronic band structure tailoring.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Sodium Insertion in Highly Oriented Graphite: Thermodynamics, Kinetics and Evidence for Two-Sided Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difficult intercalation of sodium (Na) into graphite is studied by systematic and long-time investigations (of up to 2 years) using highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). By studying chemical insertion of solid, liquid and gaseous Na at low and high temperatures (LT, HT) as well as using electrochemical insertion at 25 degree Celsius into uncoated and coated HOPG, it became clear that insertion equilibrium requires HT. On decreasing chemical intercalation temperature from HT (500 degree Celsius) to LT (25 degree Celsius), thermodynamic control was found to change to diffusion control and finally to interfacial control. For the electrochemical insertion, coating (TiO2) proved advisable (to avoid co-intercalation) and efficient in reducing the interfacial resistance. Measured saturation values were found to be not higher than about 1 mol %. Towards room temperature higher equilibrium values cannot be excluded but would in view of the very low driving force kinetically be very difficult to reach. The reversible cell voltage of the saturated composition (versus alkali metal) is distinctly lower than for the analogous cells using lithium (Li) or potassium (K). Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies reveal the unexpected fact that at HT Na predominantly enters HOPG in the form of two-sided intercalation sandwiching carbon layers (bilayers), while at LT more highly aggregated layers appear to a comparable degree, accompanied with the formation of higher-dimensional crystal imperfections. The reasons for this peculiar feature and the non-monotonic thermodynamics in the sequence Li-Na-K-Rb-Cs are discussed not only from an energetic but also from an entropic point of view.</description>

      <title>Optimal Autonomous MLIP Dataset Building</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for constructing training databases for Machine Learning Interatomic Potential (MLIP) models, specifically designed to capture phase properties across a wide range of conditions. The framework is uniquely appealing due to its ease of automation, its suitability for iterative learning, and its independence from prior knowledge of stable phases, avoiding bias towards pre-existing structural data. The approach uses Nested Sampling (NS) to explore the configuration space and generate thermodynamically relevant configurations, forming the database which undergoes ab-initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) evaluation. We use the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) architecture to fit a model on the resulting database. To demonstrate the efficiency of the framework, we apply it to magnesium, developing a model capable of accurately describing behaviour across pressure and temperature ranges of 0-600 GPa and 0-8000 K, respectively. We benchmark the model's performance by calculating phonon spectra and elastic constants, as well as the pressure-temperature phase diagram within this region. The results showcase the power of the framework to produce robust MLIPs while maintaining transferability and generality, for reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Control of Interlayer Excitons in 3R-MoS$_{2}$ / MoSe$_{2}$ Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures, constructed by stacking two-dimensional materials, have enabled the study of interlayer coupling between different materials. One example is the formation of interlayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures. The integration of 2D sliding ferroelectric materials introduces new opportunities for manipulating excitonic properties in these systems. In this work, we investigate the interaction between interlayer excitons and ferroelectric domains in hBN-encapsulated 3R-MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterostructures, combining photoluminescence experiments with density functional theory and many-body calculations. Photoluminescence spectroscopy at low temperature reveals a strong redshift of the interlayer exciton energy with increasing MoS$_2$ layer thickness, attributed to band renormalization and dielectric environment changes. Additionally, local variations in photoluminescence energy correlate with local ferroelectric domain polarization, showcasing distinct domain-dependent interlayer exciton behavior. Gate voltage experiments further demonstrate tunable shifts in interlayer exciton energy, driven by switching ferroelectric domains. These results highlight the potential of interlayer excitons being controlled by local ferroelectric polarization and establish a foundation for future ferroelectric optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>The alloying of first-principles calculations with quasiparticle methodologies for the converged solution of the quantum many-electron states in the correlated compound Iron monoxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal oxides belong to a genre of quantum materials essential for the exploration of theoretical methods for quantifying electronic correlation. Finding an efficient and accurate first principles method for the assertion of such physical properties is momentous for the predictive modelling of physics based thermoelectric and photovoltaic devices. Prior investigations have suggested that incorporation of the so called random phase approximation for the electronic screening interaction by adding up the electron hole pairs leads to significant improvement in the accuracy of first principle calculations. Nonetheless the method has seldom been adapted systematically for studying the properties of prototypical transition metal oxides, particularly that of the correlated compound Iron monoxide. In this work, we provide a benchmarking study of a variety of first principles methods such as the density functional theory artificially stabilized by Coulomb interactions, Hybrid functionals as well as the quasiparticle Greens function approach to self-energy interactions. A rigorous convergence of the self-consistent Dysons equations have been provided addressing the importance of initial choice of wavefunctions guided by first principles on the converged solutions and the interplay of various orbital degrees of freedom adjacent to the Fermi level. It is momentous to obtain accurate wavefunctions and many-electronic energy states for the quantification of correlation and efficient modelling of oxide interfaces for quantum applications. The study establishes the hybrid functional scheme as the optimal approach for the ideal trade-off between accuracy of the ground state wavefunctions and computational efficiency for large-scale simulations towards the efficient convergence of correlated electronic wavefunctions and low energy electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Copper-based Chalcopyrite Semiconductors Cu$MX_2$ ($M$ = Al, Ga, and In; $X$ = S, Se, and Te) from First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper-based chalcopyrite semiconductors have attracted sustained interest owing to their promising thermoelectric (TE) performance, yet the microscopic origins of their TE behavior remain incompletely understood. Here, we systematically investigate the TE properties of Cu$MX_2$ ($M=$ Al, Ga, and In; $X=$ S, Se, and Te) using first-principles calculations. For $p$-type doping, the calculated electrical conductivities ($\sigma$), hole mobilities ($\mu$), Seebeck coefficients ($S$), and power factors (PFs) of CuGaTe$_2$ and CuInTe$_2$ show excellent agreement with experimental data. At fixed temperature and hole concentration, as $X$ varies from S to Te, the hole mobility increases markedly due to progressively weaker polar--optical--phonon scattering, reflecting the reduced ionic contribution to the dielectric response in compounds with heavier chalcogens. Combined with smaller transport effective masses, Cu$M$Te$_2$ compounds therefore exhibit high $\sigma$ and large PFs. Across the Cu$MX_2$ family, the anomalously lower $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ of Cu$M$Se$_2$ relative to Cu$M$Te$_2$ arises primarily from enhanced three-phonon scattering at low-frequency region. For a given $M$, Cu$M$S$_2$ displays the steepest temperature-induced decrease in $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ and attains a smaller $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ than Cu$M$Se$_2$ and Cu$M$Te$_2$ at 800~K. Given the low band degeneracy and comparatively modest hole mobilities of Cu$MX_2$ compounds, the most effective routes to further improve their TE performance are to enhance $\sigma$ and reduce $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ through doping.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Irradiation Damage in Fe3Cr and Fe5Cr: A Study on the Effects of Chromium Content and Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09018v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fe-Cr binary alloys serve as simplified model systems to study irradiation damage relevant to fusion structural materials. Here, Fe-3%Cr and Fe-5%Cr samples were irradiated with 4 MeV Fe ions under a dose rate of 4x10^5 dpa/s across a linear thermal gradient (120C to 480C) in a single experiment, enabling direct comparison of temperature and Cr content effects under identical conditions. Depth-resolved Laue micro-diffraction (~10^4 strain sensitivity), nanoindentation, and AFM reveal non-monotonic evolution of lattice strain and hardness: both decrease with temperature up to ~300C, then increase beyond. This turning point reflects a shift from enhanced defect mobility and partial recovery to solute-defect clustering and cavity formation, which stabilize damage. Fe-3%Cr shows consistently higher strain and hardening than Fe-5%Cr, especially at lower temperatures. Minimal change in post-indentation pile-up indicates limited softening or localization. These results highlight how Cr content and temperature jointly affect irradiation response, offering new insights into defect evolution in fusion-relevant alloys.</description>

      <title>Polar Express: Rapid Functionalization of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes in High Dipole Moment Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescent semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) hold considerable promise for photonics. Furthermore, the optical characteristics of the material can be significantly improved by covalent modification, which generates new spectral features in the near-infrared region and enhances its photoluminescence quantum yield. However, despite the dynamic development of this research domain, the importance of the solvent environment in which the SWCNT functionalization is conducted remains relatively unexplored. In this work, the complex relationships between solvent, dispersant, and SWCNTs were untangled to unravel the underlying phenomena. Through a systematic investigation of SWCNT reactivity in a broad spectrum of solvents, supported by multi-scale modeling enabled by our new implementation of a hybrid functional within SIESTA, we discovered that both the solvent medium and the dispersant enabling SWCNT solubilization affect not only the kinetics but also the course of the covalent modification of SWCNTs. Polar solvents proved to induce significant structural reorganization of polymer molecules on the SWCNT surface and enhance charge redistribution at the polymer-SWCNT interface. Consequently, we achieved a high degree of control over the optical properties of SWCNTs, and the tailored SWCNTs enabled facile optical detection of cholesterol, a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>Design Rules and Discovery of Face-Sharing Hexagonal Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal face-sharing perovskites are a promising but underexplored class of materials. We propose quantitative design principles for stabilizing hexagonal face-sharing ABX3 perovskites, based on a comparative analysis of oxides and sulfides. By mapping structural preferences across the phase space defined by a unified, electronegativity-corrected tolerance factor and the Shannon A-site radius, we identify distinct thresholds that separate hexagonal phases from competing cubic polymorphs. Our analysis reveals that sulfides differ significantly from oxides due to the increased covalency of transition metal-sulfur bonds, enabling broader compositional flexibility. Applying these principles, we predict a set of thermodynamically stable ABO3 and ABS3 compounds that are likely to adopt face-sharing octahedral connectivity. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing hexagonal perovskites, highlighting sulfides as promising candidates for obtaining quasi-one-dimensional materials having transition metal cations for novel ferroic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Phonon Spectra for Fast and Accurate Optical Lineshapes of Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical properties of defects in solids produce rich physics, from gemstone coloration to single-photon emission for quantum networks. Essential to describing optical transitions is electron-phonon coupling, which can be predicted from first principles but requires computationally expensive evaluation of all phonon modes in simulation cells containing hundreds of atoms. We demonstrate that this bottleneck can be overcome using machine learning interatomic potentials with negligible accuracy loss. A key finding is that atomic relaxation data from routine first-principles calculations suffice as a dataset for fine-tuning, though additional data can further improve models. The efficiency of this approach enables studies of defect vibrational properties with high-level theory. We fine-tune to hybrid functional calculations to obtain highly accurate spectra, comparing with explicit calculations and experiments for various defects. Notably, we resolve fine details of local vibrational mode coupling in the luminescence spectrum of the T center in Si, a prominent quantum defect.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Topological Phase Transition in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and present a concept of Topological Distance (TD), obtained from the integration of trace distance over the generalized Brillouin zone, in order to characterize the topological transitions of non-Hermitian systems. Specifically, such a quantity is used to measure the overall dissimilarity between eigen wavefunctions upon traversing all possible matter states, and confirms the phase boundaries through observing the divergences of both TD and its partial derivatives; we clarify its origin and also offer a theoretical explanation. The method is developed to characterize the non-Hermitian topology in a novel way, and shows its generality and effectiveness in 1D non-Hermitian Kitaev systems, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians under periodic or open boundary conditions, and even generalizable to higher-order topological systems, providing a novel perspective to understand topological physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have demonstrated very promising properties as sources of single photons and entangled photons on-demand. Among different growth methods, droplet etching epitaxy has allowed the growth of almost strain-free QDs, with low and controllable surface densities, small excitonic fine structure splitting (FSS), and fast radiative decays. Here, we extend the local droplet etching technique to In(Ga)As QDs in AlGaAs, thereby increasing the achievable emission wavelength range beyond that accessible to GaAs/AlGaAs QDs, while benefiting from the aforementioned advantages of this growth method. We observe QD densities of $\sim 0.2\ \mu\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, FSS values as small as $3\ \mu\mathrm{eV}$, and short radiative lifetimes of $\sim 300\ \mathrm{ps}$, while extending the achievable emission range to $\sim 920\ \mathrm{nm}$ at cryogenic temperatures. We envision these QDs to be particularly suitable for integrated quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Crystalline water intercalation into the Kitaev honeycomb cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We herein report the successful intercalation of water molecules into the layered honeycomb lattice of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, a Kitaev-candidate compound, to obtain the hydrated phase Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$$\cdot$$y$H$_2$O ($y \sim$ 2.4). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and Rietveld refinements indicate that crystalline water resides between the cobalt-based honeycomb layers. This insertion of neutral molecules significantly alters the crystal structure, increasing the interlayer spacing and modifying the local bonding environment. Magnetization measurements reveal an antiferromagnetic transition at $T_N \sim 17.2$ K, accompanied by a discernible weak ferromagnetic component. The application of moderate magnetic fields induces a spin-flop reorientation at $\mu_0H \sim 5.7$ T. The $\lambda$-type anomaly and long-range order persist up to 9 T, showing the reconfiguration of the ground state as opposed to its suppression. Heat-capacity analysis reveals the full $2R\ln2$ magnetic entropy expected for two $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ moments per formula unit, confirming the pseudospin description. These findings demonstrate that water intercalation is a robust strategy for tuning the magnetic properties of honeycomb lattice materials. Overall, this study highlights neutral-molecule insertion as a promising route toward the discovery and engineering of quantum magnets based on layered transition metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Giant Magnetocaloric Effect in a Honeycomb Spiral Spin-Liquid Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike conventional magnetic states, which lack degeneracy, the spiral spin liquid (SSL) fluctuates among degenerate spiral configurations, with ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space. At low temperatures, the field-induced crossover from the polarized ferromagnetic state to the SSL results in a large entropy increase and decalescence, indicating its potential for magnetic cooling. However, magnetic cooling using a SSL has yet to be reported. Here, we investigate the magnetocaloric effect and cooling performance of single-crystal GdZnPO, a spin-7/2 honeycomb-lattice SSL candidate, under a magnetic field $H$ $&lt;$ $H_\mathrm{c}$ ($\mu_0H_\mathrm{c}$ $\sim$ 12 T) applied perpendicular to the honeycomb plane and below the crossover temperature ($\sim$2 K). For $H$ $\geq$ $H_\mathrm{c}$, GdZnPO enters a polarized non-degenerate ferromagnetic state. Our results demonstrate that GdZnPO exhibits a giant low-temperature magnetocaloric effect near $H_\mathrm{c}$, surpassing other magnetocaloric materials. This giant magnetocaloric effect is well-explained by the frustrated honeycomb spin model of GdZnPO, suggesting the stability of the SSL below $H_\mathrm{c}$ down to very low temperatures. Additionally, its magnetic cooling performance remains robust up to at least 4.5 K, making GdZnPO a promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration down to $\sim$36 mK through cycling the applied magnetic field within a narrow range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) are anharmonic magnetic structures typically found in uniaxial chiral magnets. In this study, we report the observation of CSL in bulk Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, a chiral insulator known for its magnetoelectric properties. Using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments, we demonstrate the formation of CSLs in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ at low temperatures, driven by the competition between cubic anisotropy and magnetic field. Our observations of higher harmonics in the SANS signal clearly indicate the anharmonic nature of the spiral. This finding underscores the complex interplay between magnetic interactions in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, offering insights for potential applications of CSLs in electric-field controlled spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carried out high-resolution (0.02 cm-1) measurements of the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CaWO4:Ho3+, including in magnetic field, and performed spectra modeling. Well-resolved hyperfine structure was observed in the luminescence spectra of CaWO4:Ho3+ for the first time. Energies of several crystal-field levels were specified, g-factors were determined. Variations of a magnetic field as small as several tenths of mT can be detected from the PL spectra. We show that the PL spectra are much more sensitive to lattice strains in CaWO4:Ho3+ than the absorption spectra. The spectra were simulated using refined crystal-field parameters and taking into account both hyperfine and deformation interactions. Here, we used the previously obtained distribution function of random strains induced by point lattice defects in an elastically anisotropic CaWO4 crystal. A luminescence thermometer for temperatures around 20 K based on CaWO4:Ho3+ is suggested.</description>

Abstract: Imprinting magnetism into graphene makes an important step to its applications in spintronics. An actively explored approach is proximity coupling of graphene to a 2D magnet. In these endeavors, the use of epitaxial graphene may bring significant advantages due to its superiority over the exfoliated counterpart and natural integration with the substrate but the problem of attaining magnetism persists. Here, we report synthesis and analysis of a heterostructure coupling epitaxial graphene with a regular lattice of magnetic atoms formed by Eu intercalation. The magnetization measurements reveal easy-plane 2D magnetism in the material, with the transition temperature controlled by low magnetic fields. The emerging negative magnetoresistance and anomalous Hall effect point at spin polarization of the carriers in graphene. In the paramagnetic phase, the magnetoresistance in graphene exhibits critical exponential behavior of the induced magnetic state. The intercalation does not compromise the parental electronic structure - quantum oscillations in the resistivity manifest low-mass carriers in graphene. The results are set against those for an isostructural material based on intercalated nonmagnetic Sr. Overall, the study expands the family of 2D magnets and establishes a prospective material for graphene-based spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ShearView, a compact, cost-effective, and open-source rheometer that enables both strain- and stress-controlled oscillatory shear experiments, while being fully compatible with high-resolution optical microscopy. Designed for transparency and modularity, the device integrates mechanical simplicity, dual feedback control, and real-time synchronization of rheological and optical data, thereby enabling simultaneous investigation of macroscopic mechanical response and microscopic structural dynamics across a wide range of soft matter systems. ShearView is primarily constructed from off-the-shelf components and operated via custom LabVIEW software. Calibration procedures and feedback algorithms allow for the accurate application of arbitrary stress or strain waveforms in both linear and nonlinear regimes. We validate the instrument against a commercial rheometer (Anton Paar MCR 702e), demonstrating excellent agreement in frequency sweeps performed in the linear viscoelastic regime and large-amplitude oscillatory shear for the materials and frequency ranges tested here. In addition, we implement non-standard rheological protocols such as chirped oscillations and recovery rheology. We further illustrate the system capabilities through synchronized imaging during echo and shear-cessation protocols, highlighting its potential to link bulk rheological response with underlying microscopic dynamics. All hardware designs, control software, and example datasets are freely available to facilitate reuse, customization, and educational deployment.</description>

      <title>Millisecond-scale Volatile Memory in HZO Ferroelectric Capacitors for Bio-inspired Temporal Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the broad recent research on ferroelectric hafnium oxide for non-volatile memory technology, depolarization effects in HfO2-based ferroelectric devices gained a lot of interest. Understanding the physical mechanisms regulating the retention of these devices provides an excellent opportunity for device optimization both towards non-volatile memory applications and towards real-time signal processing applications in which controlled time constants are of paramount importance. Indeed, we argue that ferroelectric devices, particularly HfO2-based, are an elegant solution to realize possibly arbitrary time constants in a single scaled memory device, which paves the way for temporal and brain-inspired computing in hardware. Here we present a ferroelectric capacitor stack realizing volatile memory due to its unique interface configuration. We provide electrical characterization of the device to motivate its use for realizing time constants in hardware, followed by an investigation of the electronic mechanisms and their possible relation to the observed retention times to facilitate further modeling of the retention process in HfO2-based ferroelectric capacitors. In the presented device, internal electric fields stabilize one polarization of the ferroelectric film, opening the possibility for unipolar operation with millisecond retention for the unstable polarization state. We show a dependence of the retention on both the polarization as well as the electrical stimuli, allowing us to exploit a range of time scales in a single device. Further, the intentionally defective interface in the presented material stack allows an insight into the interplay between retention loss in HfO2-based ferroelectric devices and the internal bias field, which we relate to the interface composition and the role of oxygen vacancies as a possible source of the internal bias fields.</description>

Abstract: We report quantum oscillations in magnetoresistance that are periodic in magnetic field ($B$), observed at the interface between (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)O$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$. Unlike Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, which appear at magnetic fields $ &gt; 7$ T and diminish quickly as the temperature rises, these $B$-periodic oscillations emerge at low fields and persist up to 10 K. Their amplitude decays exponentially with both temperature and field, specifying dephasing of quantum interference. Increasing the carrier density through electrostatic gating results in a systematic reduction in both the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations, with complete suppression beyond a certain gate voltage. We attribute these oscillations to the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect, likely arising from naturally formed closed-loop paths due to the interconnected quasi-one-dimensional conduction channels along SrTiO$_3$ domain walls. The relatively long phase coherence length ($\sim$ 1.8 $\mu$m at 0.1 K), estimated from the oscillation amplitude, highlights the potential of complex oxide interfaces as a promising platform for exploring quantum interference effects and advancing device concepts in quantum technologies, such as mesoscopic interferometers and quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>A note on thermomechanical coupling effects in the indentation of pseudoelastic shape memory alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While macroscopic experiments on polycrystalline shape memory alloys (SMAs) reveal significant thermomechanical coupling effects arising from the latent heat of transformation, the relevance of thermomechanical couplings in indentation tests remains ambiguous. This ambiguity is further emphasized by the rate effects observed in a number of micro/nano-indentation experiments, thus highlighting the need for a more careful investigation of the thermomechanical interactions at such small scales. With this in mind, the present study aims to demonstrate the role of thermomechanical couplings in indentation-induced martensitic transformation in SMAs. To this end, a simple phenomenological model of pseudoelasticity is employed and finite-element simulations are performed to address two key questions. (1) At which spatial and temporal scales do the thermomechanical couplings arising from the latent heat become effective? (2) To what extent do these couplings influence the indentation response? In connection with the latter, our analysis quantifies the maximal thermal effects that emerge during adiabatic indentation and compares them with those of isothermal indentation.</description>

      <title>Atomically Modulating Competing Exchange Interactions in Centrosymmetric Skyrmion Hosts GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge)</title>

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin states enabling high-density, low-power spin electronics. Despite growing efforts to find new skyrmion host systems, the microscopic mechanisms leading to skyrmion phase transitions at specific temperatures and magnetic fields remain elusive. Here, we systematically study the isostructural centrosymmetric magnets- GdRu2X2 (X = Si and Ge), and the role of X-p orbitals in modifying magnetic exchange interactions. GdRu2Ge2 single crystals, synthesized by arc melting, exhibit two high-entropy pockets associated with skyrmion phases at 0.9 T &lt; H &lt; 1.2 T and 1.3 T &lt; H &lt; 1.7 T, 2 K &lt; T &lt; 30 K-more accessible condition at lower fields and higher temperatures than that in the Si counterpart. Entropy estimations from heat capacity measurements align with magnetization data, and transport studies confirm a topological Hall effect, highlighting the system's nontrivial spin textures and Berry curvature. Compared to GdRu2Si2, electronic structure and exchange interaction evaluations reveal the more extended Ge-4p orbitals enhance competing exchange interactions in GdRu2Ge2, thereby manifesting the rich skyrmion behavior. This work demonstrates how modifying exchange interactions at the atomic level enables the tunability of topologically nontrivial electronic states while advancing our understanding of skyrmion formation mechanisms for future spintronics.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanostructures in High-Entropy Alloys via Machine-Learning Accelerated Scalable Monte Carlo Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational cost of traditional first-principles method quickly becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of atoms increases. This challenge is further amplified by the need to evaluate finite-temperature properties with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which is inherently challenging to parallelize due to sequential Markov chain updates. Here, we introduce Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC), an efficient MC simulation method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks in conventional MC simulation, reducing the computational complexity of a MC sweep from quadratic to linear. We present a GPU implementation of the SMC method, SMC-GPU, which simultaneously harnesses the thousands of processing cores on a GPU to accelerate the computation. By adopting a data-driven workflow that surrogates the computationally expensive density functional theory (DFT) with ML models, we demonstrate that SMC-GPU is capable of simulating systems of more than one-billion atoms, while maintaining the accuracy of first-principles methods. Using this unprecedented capability, we performed billion-atom MC simulations to investigate the nanostructure evolution of two important high-entropy alloys (HEAs), FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW, in which the nanostructures are believed to be responsible for their superb mechanical properties. Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanostructures, including nanoparticles (NP), 3D-connected NP, and disorder protected nanophases. We quantitatively analyze the size, composition, and morphology of the nanostructures, as well as directly simulate the atom-probe-tomography (APT) needle. The results align well with available experimental observations. This work underscores the promising potential of leveraging large-scale MC simulation to explore the largely uncharted territory of nanostructure evolution in HEAs.</description>

      <title>Above room temperature multiferroic tunnel junction with the altermagnetic metal CrSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets with nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, nonferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308%, TER of 707%, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. The transport performance is robust under bias voltage. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic sensing, and quantum logic nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Magnetization Reversal in Ferromagnetic Spin Valves Enabled via Heat Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study laser induced ultrafast magnetization reversal in a ferromagnetic spin valve by comparing the effects of direct laser excitation and ultrashort hot electron pulses. A wedged Cu layer is deposited atop the spin valve to tune energy transmission to the magnetic stack for both optical and hot-electron excitation. We demonstrate single shot magnetization reversal of the free layer using hot electron pulses. Moreover, such reversal is achieved even with picosecond laser pulses. The influence of laser fluence, Cu thickness ($t_{\mathrm{Cu}}$), and pulse duration is investigated in detail. Our results indicate that the key factor enabling magnetization reversal is full demagnetization of the free layer, driven by a rapid rise in its electronic temperature achieved via either direct laser or hot electron excitation. This work advances the understanding of ultrafast magnetization reversal via nonlocal heat and spin transport under strongly out of equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Sliding Ferroelectrics Induced Hybrid-Order Topological Phase Transitions</title>

Abstract: We propose ferroelectric layer sliding as a new approach to realize and manipulate topological quantum states in two-dimensional (2D) bilayer magnetic van der Waals materials. We show that stacking monolayer ferromagnetic topological states into layer-spin-locked bilayer antiferromagnetic structures, and introducing sliding ferroelectricity leads to asynchronous topological evolution of different layers (spins) owing to existence of polarization potentials, thereby giving rise to rich layer-resolved topological phases. As a specific example, by means of a lattice model, we show that a bilayer magnetic 2D second order topological insulator (SOTI) reveals an unrecognized spin-hybrid-order topological insulator after undergoing ferroelectric sliding. Interestingly, in such phase, the spin-up (top layer) and spin-down (bottom layer) channels exhibit first-order and second-order topological properties, respectively. Moreover, other topological phases such as SOTI, quantum spin Hall insulator, quantum anomalous Hall insulator, and trivial insulator can also emerge through changes in the parameters of the system, and the relevant topological indices are also discussed. In terms of materials, based on first principles calculations, we predict material ScI2 can serve as an ideal platform to realize our proposal. Further, we predict that the anomalous Nernst effect of these several topological phases exhibits distinct differences, and therefore can be used as a signal for experimentally probing.</description>

Abstract: Entropy-stabilized oxides (ESOs), driven by high configurational entropy, have gained phenomenological research interest due to their potential for tailoring structure property relationships. However, the chemical short range ordering (SRO) and its interplay with local lattice distortion (LD) remain to be explored, although they could diminish the configurational entropy and potentially impact structure property relationships. A combination of experimental and theoretical approaches are employed to investigate the SRO and LD in the prototype ESO, Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O, generally referred to as J14. We demonstrate that the efficiency and accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) relaxed special quasirandom structures (SQS) enhances the analysis of the local structure of J14, unveiling the unique local cationic environments. Importantly, this joint experimental and computational approach sheds light on the understanding of local structure and structure property relationships in J14, demonstrating the necessity for further research into other high entropy and compositionally complex materials.</description>

Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials with coexisting and coupled ferroelectric and magnetic orders are rare. Here we show, using density functional theory calculations, that inducing Fe$_\mathrm{La}$ antisites into non-ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic LaFeO$_3$ renders the material at the same time ferroelectric and ferrimagnetic. Even more excitingly, we observe a direct coupling between the ferroelectric and ferrimagnetic polarization, the latter being switchable by the former. While on average the magnetic moments of antisites would cancel, we envision that preparing defective LaFeO$_3$ under simultaneous electric and magnetic fields will lead to a net magnetic moment due to magnetic domain reconfiguration. Moreover, ferroelectric switching under a static magnetic field can lead to 180$^\circ$ switching of the antiferromagnetic order in LaFeO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Dealloyed Brass as Li-Metal Battery Current Collector: Effect of Zinc and Porosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Anode-free" lithium-metal batteries promise significantly higher energy density than conventional graphite-based lithium-ion batteries; however, lithium dendrite growth can lead to internal short circuits with associated safety risks. While porous current collectors can suppress dendrite growth, optimal porosity and composition remain unknown. Here, we show that the temperature during vapor phase dealloying (VPD) of alpha-brass (Cu63Zn37) controls the surface Zn concentration, decreasing from 8 percent to below 1 percent from 500 to 800 degrees C. The surface composition is controlled by the temperature-dependent diffusion. A battery cell maintains greater than 90 percent Coulombic efficiency (CE) over 100 cycles when the Zn content is the lowest, whereas the higher-Zn samples degraded to approximately 70 percent CE. The difference in surface composition has hence dramatic effects on battery performance, and our results demonstrate how precise compositional control enables stable lithium-metal battery operation, establishing about 1 atomic percent surface Zn as optimal for preventing capacity fading and uniform lithium plating, while establishing predictive relationships between processing temperature and surface composition. This work provides design rules for multifunctional current collectors and demonstrates scalable VPD production for next-generation batteries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the competition between light-mediated and intrinsic matter-matter interactions in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. For this, we couple a superconducting transmission line to a model magnetic material, made of organic free radical molecules with a spin $S=1/2$ and a $g_{S}$ factor very close to that of a free electron. The microwave transmission has been measured in a wide range of temperatures ($0.013$ K $\leq T \leq 2$ K), magnetic fields ($0\leq B \leq 0.5$ T) and frequencies ($0 \leq \omega/2 \pi \leq 14$ GHz). We find that molecules belonging to one of the two crystal sublattices form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls the intrinsic correlations along these chains in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region ($T &gt; 0.7$ K), the microwave transmission shows evidences for the collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As $T$ decreases, the growth of spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, tend to suppress the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the spin visibility in transmission reflects also a gradual change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single spin flips to bosonic magnons.</description>

Abstract: The LnSbTe (Ln = Lanthanides) family, like isostructural ZrSiS type compounds, has emerged as a fertile playground for exploring the interaction of electronic correlations and magnetic ordering with the nodal line band topology. Here, we report a detailed electronic band structure investigation of TbSbTe, corroborated by electrical transport, thermodynamic, and magnetic studies. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility and thermodynamic transport studies indicate the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering below TN = 5.1 K. The electronic band structure study, carried out with high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements aided with density functional theory based first-principles calculations reveals presence of nodal lines in the GammaX high symmetry direction, forming a diamond-shaped nodal plane around Gamma high symmetry point. A strongly photon energy dependent nodal feature located at the X point of the surface Brillouin zone, indicating an extended nodal line along X R direction, is also observed. This study elucidates the intricate interplay among symmetry-protected band characteristics, the influence of spin orbit coupling, magnetism, and topological properties.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by recent experiments, we present a phase-field model of microphase separation in an elastomer swollen with a solvent. The imbalance between the molecular scale of demixing and the mesoscopic scale beyond which elasticity operates produces effective long-range interactions, forming stable finite-sized domains. Our predictions concerning the dependence of the domain size and transition temperature on the stiffness of the elastomer are in good agreement with the experiments. Analytical phase diagrams, aided by numerical findings, capture the richness of the microphase morphologies, paving the way to create stable, patterned elastomers for various applications.</description>

Abstract: The random packing fraction of binary particles in D-dimensional Euclidean space R^D is studied using a geometric approach. First, the binary packing fraction of assemblies with small size difference are studied, using the excluded volume model by Onsager for particles in three-dimensional space (D = 3). According to this model the packing increase by bidispersity is proportional to (1 - f)(u^D - 1)^2, with f as monosized packing fraction, u as size ratio and D as space dimension. The model predictions are compared with computational results for disks in two dimensions (D = 2) and hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit (D to infinity), yielding good agreement. Subsequently, the packing of hyperspheres with large size difference is modeled, employing the classic theory of Furnas. This theory, developed for three dimensions, starts from an infinite size ratio of larger and smaller particles (u to infinity). Here, the pertaining equations are applied to hyperspheres, and successfully compared with computational results for hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation of the binary packing fraction for large size ratio is derived, which shows that the first order variation of the Furnas packing fraction (u^-1 = 0) is proportional to (2 - f)u^-1. Finally, a scaled D-dimensional binary packing graph is presented, governing a simplified phase diagram that borders the binary random packing fraction of amorphous assemblies. To summarize, basic space-filling and geometric (athermal) theories on simple hard spheres appear to be a valuable tool for the study of hyperspheres packing and amorphization.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Description of Strongly Correlated Materials by Combining Downfolding Techniques and Tensor Networks</title>

Abstract: We present a high-accuracy procedure for electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated materials. To address limitations in current electronic structure methods, we employ density functional theory in combination with the constrained random phase approximation to construct an effective multi-band Hubbard model, which is subsequently solved using tensor networks. Our work focuses on one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional materials, for which we employ the machinery of matrix product states. We apply this framework to the conjugated polymers trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene, as well as the quasi-one-dimensional charge-transfer insulator Sr2CuO3. The predicted band gaps show quantitative agreement with state-of-the-art computational techniques and experimental measurements. Beyond band gaps, tensor networks provide access to a wide range of physically relevant properties, including spin magnetization and various excitation energies. Their flexibility supports the implementation of complex Hamiltonians with longer-range interactions, while the bond dimension enables systematic control over accuracy. Furthermore, the computational cost scales efficiently with system size, demonstrating the framework's scalability.</description>
