      <title>Operator-isometry pairs and Zak transform methods for the study of Gabor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We collect and summarize results on the unitary equivalence of Gabor systems by pairs of unitary operators and global isometries. The methods are then used to study Gabor systems with Hermite functions. We provide new proofs of some known results and an outlook on double over-sampling.</description>

      <title>Second Quantization and Evolution Operators in infinite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space $X$, we study compactness properties and the hypercobtractivity of the realizations of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck evolution operators $P_{s,t}$ in the spaces $L^p(X,\gamma_t)$, $\{\gamma_t\}_{t\in\R}$ being a suitable evolution system of measures for $P_{s,t}$. Moreover we study the asymptotic behavior of $P_{s,t}$. All these results are produced thank to a representation of $P_{s,t}$ through the second quantization operator. Among the examples we consider the transition evolution operator associated to a non-autonomous stochastic parabolic PDE.</description>

      <title>Effects of oscillation scales in discrete brittle damage models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the asymptotic analysis of a sequence of variational models of brittle damage in the context of linearized elasticity in the two-dimensional discrete setting. We consider a discrete version of Francfort and Marigo's brittle damage model, where the total energy is restricted to continuous and piecewise affine displacements; within different regimes where the damaged regions concentrate on vanishingly small sets while the stiffness of the damaged material degenerates to $0$. In this setting, the convergence of the space discretization, the concentration of the damaged regions, and the decay of the elastic properties of the damaged phase all compete simultaneously in non-trivial ways according to the scaling law under consideration. The mesh size turns out to be a crucial feature of the analysis, as it induces a minimal scale of spatial oscillations for admissible displacements. This study was motivated by the numerical investigations performed in [2] on the one hand, where Allaire-Jouve-Van Goethem have shown that forcing the stiffness decay on sets of arbitrarily small measure seems to lead to concentrations phenomena such as in brittle fracture; and by the static analysis performed in [10] on the other hand, where Babadjian-Iurlano-Rindler addressed the rigorous asymptotic analysis of this observation in terms of the $\Gamma$-convergence of the total energies, in the continuous setting in space. Surprisingly, they showed that fracture-type models were not obtained asymptotically, thus raising the question of the dependence of the effective models with respect to the scaling of a spatial discretization in Francfort and Marigo's model. This is the content of the present work, where we show that concentrations phenomena are only captured asymptotically in regimes where the mesh size and the concentration of damaged regions are of same order.</description>

      <title>Embedding and compact embedding between Bergman and Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For Hardy spaces and weighted Bergman spaces on the open unit ball in ${\mathbb C}^n$, we determine exactly when $A^p_\alpha\subset H^q$ or $H^p\subset A^q_\alpha$, where $0&lt;q&lt;\infty$, $0&lt;p&lt;\infty$, and $-\infty&lt;\alpha&lt;\infty$. For each such inclusion we also determine exactly when it is a compact embedding. Although some special cases were known before, we are able to completely cover all possible cases here. We also introduce a new notion called {\it tight fitting} and formulate a conjecture in terms of it, which places several prominent known results about contractive embeddings in the same framework.</description>

      <title>Solving the Stieltjes Integral Equation in Explicit Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to its convolution nature, the Stieltjes integral equation can be diagonalized by Mellin transform. Several explicit resolvent kernels were obtained over the years, all of convolution type. The conditions on the given function under which these convolution kernels are able to solve the equation, are rather restrictive. Purpose of this paper is to solve the Stieltjes integral equation - in explicit form - under more general conditions than has been done so far. In fact, we merely bestow upon the given function the same integrability as upon the unknown function. To solve the equation under this mild condition, we construct a new explicit resolvent kernel. For the solutions obtained, we derive interesting growth properties. The new kernel demonstrates that combining known convolution kernels may well lead to a non-convolution kernel that is more effective.</description>

      <title>On linearisation and uniqueness of preduals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study strong linearisations and the uniqueness of preduals of locally convex Hausdorff spaces of scalar-valued functions. Strong linearisations are special preduals. A locally convex Hausdorff space $\mathcal{F}(\Omega)$ of scalar-valued functions on a non-empty set $\Omega$ is said to admit a strong linearisation if there are a locally convex Hausdorff space $Y$, a map $\delta\colon\Omega\to Y$ and a topological isomorphism $T\colon\mathcal{F}(\Omega)\to Y_{b}'$ such that $T(f)\circ \delta= f$ for all $f\in\mathcal{F}(\Omega)$. We give sufficient conditions that allow us to lift strong linearisations from the scalar-valued to the vector-valued case, covering many previous results on linearisations, and use them to characterise the bornological spaces $\mathcal{F}(\Omega)$ with (strongly) unique predual in certain classes of locally convex Hausdorff spaces.</description>

      <title>Existence of Unconditional Frames Formed By System of Translates in Modulation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $1\leq p\leq 2$ and let $\Lambda = \{\lambda_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an arbitrary subset. We prove that for any $g\in M^p(\mathbb{R})$ with $1\leq p\leq 2$ the system of translates $\{g(x-\lambda_n)\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is never an unconditional basis for $M^q(\mathbb{R})$ for $p\leq q\leq p'$, where $p'$ is the conjugate exponent of $p.$ In particular, $M^1(\mathbb{R})$ does not admit any Schauder basis formed by a system of translates. We also prove that for any $g\in M^p(\mathbb{R})$ with $1&lt; p\leq 2$ the system of translates $\{g(x-\lambda_n)\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is never an unconditional frame for $M^p(\mathbb{R}).$ Several results regarding the existence of unconditional frames formed by a system of translates in $M^1(\mathbb{R})$ as well as in $M^p(\mathbb{R})$ with $2&lt;p&lt;\infty$ will be presented as well.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Inequality for Local Log-Polyak-Lojasiewicz Measures : Non-asymptotic Analysis in Low-temperature Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potential functions in highly pertinent applications, such as deep learning in over-parameterized regime, are empirically observed to admit non-isolated minima. To understand the convergence behavior of stochastic dynamics in such landscapes, we propose to study the class of \logPLmeasure\ measures $\mu_\epsilon \propto \exp(-V/\epsilon)$, where the potential $V$ satisfies a local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P\L) inequality, and its set of local minima is provably \emph{connected}. Notably, potentials in this class can exhibit local maxima and we characterize its optimal set S to be a compact $\mathcal{C}^2$ \emph{embedding submanifold} of $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary. The \emph{non-contractibility} of S distinguishes our function class from the classical convex setting topologically. Moreover, the embedding structure induces a naturally defined Laplacian-Beltrami operator on S, and we show that its first non-trivial eigenvalue provides an \emph{$\epsilon$-independent} lower bound for the \Poincare\ constant in the \Poincare\ inequality of $\mu_\epsilon$. As a direct consequence, Langevin dynamics with such non-convex potential $V$ and diffusion coefficient $\epsilon$ converges to its equilibrium $\mu_\epsilon$ at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. Here $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides logarithmic terms.</description>
