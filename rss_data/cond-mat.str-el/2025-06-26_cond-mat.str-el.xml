      <title>Geometrically Frustrated Quadrupoles on the Pyrochlore Lattice and Generalized Spin Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an instance of geometrical frustration with non-magnetic degrees of freedom, we explore the physics of local spin $S\geq 1$ moments on the pyrochlore lattice that interact via pure quadrupolar couplings. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, there are nine allowed couplings between nearest neighbor quadrupoles. We determine the semi-classical phases and survey the phase diagram of the model. One may view the Hamiltonian as being composed of two copies of the well-studied dipolar model with couplings between the copies, and we find that each easy-plane dipolar phase has two quadrupolar counterparts. As geometrical frustration is important over broad swathes of the parameter space, there are many classical quadrupolar liquids and regions with order-by-disorder selection of discrete states. Order-by-disorder with quadrupoles admits cubic terms in the Landau theory whose effects appear in Monte Carlo simulations and flavor wave calculations for fixed spin $S$. We showcase a number of examples of quadrupolar spin liquids, including one realizing a rank-3 symmetric tensor gauge theory exhibiting 6-fold pinch point singularities. We discuss remarkable differences between the quadrupolar physics of different spin quantum number. We also discuss connections to the non-Kramers rare earth pyrochlore materials.</description>

      <title>Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for variational Monte Carlo calculations of fermion PEPS in the swap gates formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) calculations of projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has emerged as a competitive method for computing the ground states of many-body quantum systems. This method is particularly important for fermion systems where sign problems are abundant. We derive and explain the algorithms for the VMC calculations of fermion PEPS in the swap gates formulation. It is the purpose of this paper to be as concise and precise as possible. Diagramatic tensor notation is used whenever possible to serve this purpose. As a separate result, we prove the detailed balance of sequential sampling of tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Transport Evidence for Wigner Crystals in Monolayer MoTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystallization of charge carriers, dubbed the Wigner crystal, is anticipated at low densities in clean two-dimensional electronic systems (2DES). While there has been extensive investigation across diverse platforms, probing spontaneous charge and spin ordering is hindered by disorder effects and limited interaction energies. Here, we report transport evidence for Wigner crystals with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions in high-quality, hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated monolayer MoTe2, a system that achieves a large interaction parameter (r_s) at proper hole densities. A density-tuned metal-insulator transition (MIT) occurring at 3.1E10^11 cm-2 (corresponding to r_s~32) and pronounced nonlinear charge transport in the insulating regime at low temperatures signify the formation of Wigner crystals. Thermal melting of the crystalline phase is observed below approximately 2 K via temperature-dependent nonlinear transport. Magnetoresistance measurements further reveal a substantial enhancement of spin susceptibility as approaching the MIT. The temperature dependence of spin susceptibility in the Wigner crystal phase closely follows the Curie-Weiss law, with the extracted negative Weiss constant illustrating antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. Furthermore, we have found the system exhibits metallic-like differential resistivity under finite DC bias, possibly indicating the existence of a non-equilibrium coherent state in the depinning of Wigner crystals. Our observations establish monolayer MoTe2 as a promising platform for exploring magnetic and dynamic properties of Wigner crystals.</description>

      <title>Floquet operator dynamics and orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator spreading under stroboscopic time evolution due to a unitary is studied. An operator Krylov space is constructed and related to orthogonal polynomials on a unit circle (OPUC), as well as to the Krylov space of the edge operator of the Floquet transverse field Ising model with inhomogeneous couplings (ITFIM). The Verblunsky coefficients in the OPUC representation are related to the Krylov angles parameterizing the ITFIM. The relations between the OPUC and spectral functions are summarized and several applications are presented. These include derivation of analytic expressions for the OPUC for persistent $m$-periodic dynamics, and the numerical construction of the OPUC for autocorrelations of the homogeneous Floquet-Ising model as well as the $Z_3$ clock model. The numerically obtained Krylov angles of the $Z_3$ clock model with long-lived period tripled autocorrelations show a spatial periodicity of six, and this observation is used to develop an analytically solvable model for the ITFIM that mimics this behavior.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transition under Infinite Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In clean and weakly disordered systems, topological and trivial phases having a finite bulk energy gap can transit to each other via a quantum critical point. In presence of strong disorder, both the nature of the phases and the associated criticality can fundamentally change. Here we investigate topological properties of a strongly disordered fermionic chain where the bond couplings are drawn from normal probability distributions which are defined by characteristic standard deviations. Using numerical strong disorder renormalization group methods along with analytical techniques, we show that the competition between fluctuation scales renders both the trivial and topological phases gapless with Griffiths like rare regions. Moreover, the transition between these phases is solely governed by the fluctuation scales, rather than the means, rendering the critical behavior to be determined by an infinite randomness fixed point with an irrational central charge. Our work points to a host of novel topological phases and atypical topological phase transitions which can be realized in systems under strong disorder.</description>

      <title>Holography for bulk-boundary local topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous article [arXiv:2307.12552], we introduced local topological order (LTO) axioms for quantum spin systems which allowed us to define a physical boundary manifested by a net of boundary algebras in one dimension lower. This gives a formal setting for topological holography, where the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules of the physical boundary algebra captures the bulk topological order.
  In this article, we extend the LTO axioms to quantum spin systems equipped with a topological boundary, again producing a physical boundary algebra for the bulk-boundary system, whose category of (topological) boundary DHR bimodules recovers the topological boundary order. We perform this analysis in explicit detail for Levin-Wen and Walker-Wang bulk-boundary systems.
  Along the way, we introduce a 2D braided categorical net of algebras built from a unitary braided fusion category (UBFC). Such nets arise as boundary algebras of Walker-Wang models. We consider the canonical state on this braided categorical net corresponding to the standard topological boundary for the Walker-Wang model. Interestingly, in this state, the cone von Neumann algebras are type I with finite dimensional centers, in contrast with the type II and III cone von Neumann algebras from the Levin-Wen models studied in [arXiv:2307.12552]. Their superselection sectors recover the underlying unitary category of our UBFC, and we conjecture the superselection category also captures the fusion and braiding.</description>

      <title>Interfacial reconstruction effects in insulating double perovskite Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$/SrTiO$_3$ and Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$/NdGaO$_3$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic insulating (FMI) double perovskite oxides (DPOs) $A_2BB'$O$_6$ with near-room-temperature Curie temperatures are promising candidates for ambient-temperature spintronics applications. To realize their potential, epitaxial stabilization of DPO films and understanding the effect of multiple broken symmetries across the film/substrate interface are crucial. This study investigates ultrathin films of the FMI Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ (NNMO) grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and NdGaO$_3$ (NGO) substrates. By comparing growth on these substrates, we examine the influence of polarity and structural symmetry mismatches, which are absent in the NGO system. The interface exhibits immeasurable resistance in both cases. Using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we show that films have three octahedral rotational domains because of the structural symmetry mismatch with the STO substrate. Furthermore, our coherent Bragg rod analysis of specular X-ray diffraction reveals a significant modification of the out-of-plane lattice parameter within a few unit cells at the film/substrate interface and the surface. This arises from polarity compensation and surface symmetry breaking, respectively. These structural alterations influence the Mn orbital symmetry, a dependence that we further confirm through X-ray linear dichroism measurements. Since the ferromagnetism in insulating DPOs is mediated by orbital-dependent superexchange interactions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 186402 (2008)], our study provides a framework for understanding the evolution of magnetism in ultrathin geometry.</description>

      <title>Interplay of magnetic ordering and charge transport in a distorted ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type GdZn$_3$As$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the synthesis and characterization of GdZn$_3$As$_3$, a previously unreported variant of the $RM_3X_3$ family ($R$ = lanthanides; $M$ = Zn, Cd; $X$ = P, As), prepared in both single-crystal and polycrystalline forms. Unlike other $RM_3X_3$ compounds that crystallize in undistorted hexagonal structures, GdZn$_3$As$_3$ adopts a distorted ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type orthorhombic structure with $Cmcm$ space group. Magnetic measurements demonstrate that GdZn$_3$As$_3$ undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at the Curie temperature ($T_{\mathrm{C}}$) of 6.3~K, which is unique among known $RM_3X_3$ materials. This magnetic transition is further confirmed by specific heat and electrical resistivity measurements. GdZn$_3$As$_3$ displays metallic behavior with a pronounced resistivity peak near $T_{\mathrm{C}}$, which is strongly suppressed by magnetic fields, leading to significant negative magnetoresistance. Hall effect measurements reveal a low carrier density and a clear nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in GdZn$_3$As$_3$. Furthermore, both specific heat and resistivity data suggest the presence of additional magnetic transition(s) below $T_{\mathrm{C}}$, requiring further investigation. These results demonstrate that GdZn$_3$As$_3$ possesses distinct structural, magnetic, and electronic transport properties within the $RM_3X_3$ family, establishing it as an exceptional platform for investigating competing magnetic interactions in low-carrier-density rare-earth triangular-lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Quantized and nonquantized Hall response in topological Hatsugai-Kohmoto systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the robustness of Hall conductivity quantization in several insulating systems, exhibiting one scenario where the quantization is not preserved. Specifically, we apply the Kubo formula to topological models with the Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction. Starting from the many-body degeneracy induced by this interaction in the topological Kane-Mele model, we consider Zeeman fields to select specific states within the ground-state manifold that reveal a non-quantized Hall response, precisely for the case with a Zeeman field diagonal in the bands of the Kane-Mele model. From a physical point of view, this term may mimic a ferromagnetic order that arises naturally when couplings beyond the Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on ambient pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films : structural analysis, model construction, and robustness of $s\pm$-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study ambient pressure superconductivity in thin films of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Comparison between Causal and Acausal Diffusion: a Schwinger-Keldysh Effective Field Theory Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Fick's time-honored theory of diffusion, the system responds instantaneously to external perturbations, resulting in acausal behavior. Maxwell-Cattaneo theory addresses this issue by introducing a relaxation time, rendering the diffusion process causal. We focus on systems where this relaxation time is comparable to the diffusion time and significantly larger than the relaxation times of all other non-conserved operators. In such systems, late-time diffusion is influenced by this relaxation process, leading to a theory of quasi-diffusion. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh Effective Field Theory (SK-EFT) framework, we compare the theories of diffusion and quasi-diffusion by analyzing the real-time dynamics of correlation functions both in linear response and at one-loop order. In particular, we show that the one-loop corrections in the causal (quasi-diffusion) theory, in both the underdamped and the overdamped cases, are governed by two universal functions. In the overdamped case, the behavior mirrors that of the acausal (diffusion) theory, which has recently been applied for precision tests of SK-EFT in diffusive systems. We suggest that our results in the underdamped limit can also be used for precision tests in quasi-diffusive systems.</description>

      <title>How to use quantum computers for biomolecular free energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free energy calculations are at the heart of physics-based analyses of biochemical processes. They allow us to quantify molecular recognition mechanisms, which determine a wide range of biological phenomena from how cells send and receive signals to how pharmaceutical compounds can be used to treat diseases. Quantitative and predictive free energy calculations require computational models that accurately capture both the varied and intricate electronic interactions between molecules as well as the entropic contributions from motions of these molecules and their aqueous environment. However, accurate quantum-mechanical energies and forces can only be obtained for small atomistic models, not for large biomacromolecules. Here, we demonstrate how to consistently link accurate quantum-mechanical data obtained for substructures to the overall potential energy of biomolecular complexes by machine learning in an integrated algorithm. We do so using a two-fold quantum embedding strategy where the innermost quantum cores are treated at a very high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the viability of this approach for the molecular recognition of a ruthenium-based anticancer drug by its protein target, applying traditional quantum chemical methods. As such methods scale unfavorable with system size, we analyze requirements for quantum computers to provide highly accurate energies that impact the resulting free energies. Once the requirements are met, our computational pipeline FreeQuantum is able to make efficient use of the quantum computed energies, thereby enabling quantum computing enhanced modeling of biochemical processes. This approach combines the exponential speedups of quantum computers for simulating interacting electrons with modern classical simulation techniques that incorporate machine learning to model large molecules.</description>

      <title>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20635</link>

Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, and at the base of extensive molecular and materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in chemistry and materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r r2SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r2SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r2SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r2SCANY@r2SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r2SCANY@r2SCANX utilizes different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r2SCANY@r2SCANX enhances the r2SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+U method. The O2 overbinding in r2SCAN (~0.3 eV/O2) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r2SCAN10@r2SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r2SCAN10@r2SCAN50, minimizing r2SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r2SCAN10@r2SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r2SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r2SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r2SCAN10@r2SCAN, which is 10 to 300 times faster than r2SCAN10.</description>

      <title>Buckyballs directly probe inter-valley coherence in moire heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moire materials like twisted bilayer graphene have emerged as a rich playground of strongly correlated physics, where the effect of interactions can be drastically enhanced by tuning the non-interacting density of states via twist angle. A key feature of bilayer graphene at small twist angles is that the two valleys of graphene are effectively decoupled at the non-interacting level, leading to an emergent U(1) symmetry corresponding to the conservation of valley-charge. Theoretical studies invariably find that short-ranged interactions tend to break this symmetry, leading to inter-valley coherence (IVC). Here, I propose an experimental signature of IVC order by coupling with a closely related system where valley-mixing is guaranteed - the pentagonal disclinations of graphene. Such disclinations are naturally found in fullerenes. The tunneling current between twisted bilayer graphene and an appropriately oriented large buckyball has a sharp signature of the onset of IVC order. Successfully integrating these fullerenes in a scanning tunneling microscope would allow spatial resolution of the IVC order parameter on a sub-moire scale. Experimentally constraining the broken symmetries and order parameters in the multitude of emerging correlated insulators is a crucial first step to understanding the superconductivity that develops on doping these exotic `normal' states.</description>

      <title>Alteration of Topology in Quantum Phase Transitions via Symmetry Enrichment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology plays a cardinal role in explaining phases and quantum phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. In this study, we formulate a set of models of Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions with SU($N$)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry that have the potential to host critical points described by field theories with topological terms. For $N=2$ it shows a rich phase diagram containing semimetallic, quantum spin Hall insulating, Kekul\'e valence bond solid and s-wave superconducting phases and features multiple Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson phase transitions driven by interaction strength. At $N=1$ a deconfined quantum critical point is observed. At $N=2$ one expects the critical theory to correspond to a level 2 Wess-Zumino-Witten theory in 2+1 dimensions. Here the numerical results however show a strong first order transition. Another transition can be governed by a topological $\theta$-term which is rendered irrelevant for even values of $N$ thus leading to Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson behaviour.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Thermal Hall Effect in Mott Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of recent experimental data indicating a substantial thermal Hall effect in square lattice antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, we investigate whether a simple Mott insulator can sustain a finite thermal Hall effect. We verify that the answer is "no" if one performs calculations within a spin-only low-energy effective spin model with non-interacting magnons. However, by performing determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show the single-band $t$-$t'$-$U$ Hubbard model coupled to an orbital magnetic field does support a finite thermal Hall effect when $t' \neq 0$ and $B \neq 0$ in the Mott insulating phase. We argue that the (carrier agnostic) necessary conditions for observing a finite thermal Hall effect are time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry breaking. By considering magnon-magnon scattering using a semi-classical Boltzmann analysis, we illustrate a physical mechanism by which finite transverse thermal conductivity may arise, consistent with our symmetry argument and numerical results. Our results contradict the conventional wisdom that square and triangular lattices with SU(2) symmetry do not support a finite thermal Hall effect and call for a critical re-examination of thermal Hall effect data in insulating magnets, as the magnon contribution should not be excluded a priori.</description>

      <title>Design and benchmarks for emulating Kondo dynamics on a quantum chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum simulation and the overall prospective of solving correlated many-electron problems using quantum algorithms, we design a gate-based quantum circuit that emulates the dynamics of the Kondo impurity model. We numerically determine the impurity magnetization, entanglement between impurity and fermionic sites and energy as a function of time (i.e.~circuit depth) for various initial states and find universal long-time dynamics. We complement the numerical simulations for moderate system size with an asymptotically exact analytical solution that is effective in the limit of large system sizes and for starting states corresponding to a filled Fermi sea. This work opens up the perspective of studying the dynamics of electronic quantum many-body states on quantum chips of the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Preparing Code States via Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuits: Application to Tetra-Digit Topological Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified and efficient quantum circuit framework, termed the \emph{Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuit} (SEESQC) to prepare quantum states in code space of topological error-correcting codes. Specifically, we apply SEESQC to prepare code states of Tetra-Digit models -- a broad class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes indexed by a four-digit parameter. These models are not rare but encompass Toric Codes across arbitrary dimensions and subsume the X-cube fracton code as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of generalized entanglement renormalization group, many Tetra-Digit models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. In this work, we first graphically and algebraically demonstrate quantum circuits for computational basis states, before generalizing to broader cases. Central to this framework is a key ingredient termed the \emph{seed-entangler} acting on a small number of qubits termed \textit{seeds}, enabling a systematic scheme to achieve arbitrary code states. Remarkably, the number of available seeds equals the number of logical qubits for the constructed examples, which leaves plenty of room for future investigation in theoretical physics, mathematics and quantum information science. With experimental feasibility via synthetic dimensions in modern quantum simulators, this framework transcends spatial dimensions, bridges liquid and non-liquid states, unifies gapped phases governed by distinct entanglement renormalization group schemes, and offers a pathway toward engineering topological phases and manipulating logical qubits.</description>

      <title>Disturbing news about the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. We investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch while preserving a connection between the two theories. We also explore an alternative scenario in which the NLSM $O(N)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(N)$ CFT, and instead corresponds to a different universality class. For $N=3$, this could be related to the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, which describes the N\'eel-VBS phase transition in 3D.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans\"atze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) \textit{a.k.a.} Feed Forward Neural Networks, when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.</description>
