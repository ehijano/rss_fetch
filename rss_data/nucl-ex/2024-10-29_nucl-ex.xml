      <title>Estimation of Ru-97 Half-Life Using the Most Frequent Value Method and Bootstrapping Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new and robust statistics was applied to previous measurements of the 97Ru half-life. This process incorporates the most frequent value (MFV) technique along with hybrid parametric bootstrap (HPB) method to deliver a more precise estimate of the 97Ru half-life. The derived value is T1/2,MFV(HPB) = 2.8385+0.0022-0.0075 days. This estimate corresponds to a 68.27% confidence interval ranging from 2.8310 to 2.8407 days, and a 95.45% confidence interval ranging from 2.8036 to 2.8485 days, calculated using the percentile method. This level of uncertainty is significantly lower-over 30 times-than the uncertainty in the previously recognized half-life value found in nuclear data sheets. Employing an alternate approach to minimization could further cut down the statistical uncertainty by 44% for the 97Ru half-life. In particular, the HPB method accounts for uncertainties in small datasets when determining the confidence interval. When the HPB method, in combination with the MFV approach, was used to review a four-element dataset of the specific activity of 39Ar based on underground data, the result was SA_MFV(HPB) = 0.966 +0.027 -0.020 Bq/kg_atmAr. This value results in a 68.27% confidence interval of 0.946 to 0.993, along with a 95.45% confidence interval of 0.921 to 1.029, also determined using the percentile method.</description>

      <title>Medium recoil mode of $\Delta$ production in single isobaric charge-exchange reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic mechanisms underlying single charge-exchange reactions have been investigated using a theoretical framework that combines the Isospin-dependent Quantum Molecular Dynamics (IQMD) model with the statistical decay model GEMINI++. Two distinct channels contribute to the single isobaric charge-exchange reaction: quasi-elastic channel, where neutron-proton scattering drives the charge-exchange, and inelastic channel, where the $\Delta$ particle is produced during the process. In a referenced study [Phys.RevC 106.014618(2022)], experimental data have revealed that the inelastic channel accounts for approximately 50 percent of the single isobaric charge-exchange reaction. However, our current model fails in reproducing the significant contribution of inelastic channel unless the novel medium recoil mode associated with $\Delta$ production is considered in the calculations. Notably, this in-medium effect arising from inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions is not yet incorporated into mainstream microscopic transport models. The dynamical properties of protons and pions emitting in the single isobaric charge-exchange reactions are predicted. This exploration of in-medium effects adds a valuable dimension to our understanding of the intricate dynamics involved in single charge-exchange reactions.</description>

      <title>Particle Identification with the ePIC detector at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ePIC detector is being designed as a general-purpose detector to deliver the full physics program of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) in BNL USA. Particle Identification (PID) plays a crucial role in the EIC physics program. Over a wide phase-space the PID systems provide excellent hadron identification required for the EIC physics program. Additionally, the PID systems have to provide low momentum electron-pion separation to support the calorimeter performance. The ePIC experiment employs different advanced PID technologies to reach the physics goals. The compact set-up the collider and the presence of high magnetic field of the experimental solenoid impose numerous technical challenges. In this article we will describe the PID subsystems of the ePIC detector, with a specific emphasis on high momentum PID system using RICH technology. The article will report about the studies performed with SiPMs as the photo-sensor candidate for forward RICH detector. Also, studies made with novel LAPPD detectors and standard MCP- PMTs chosen as baseline photo-sensor candidates for the backward RICH and barrel DIRC system respectively. This article will include a discussion on the simulation studies made with stand-alone Geant4 simulations and official ePIC software framework.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and correlations of quark spin in hot and dense QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the impact of phase transitions on quark spin fluctuation and correlation. We propose a novel observable for quark-antiquark correlation that relates to vector meson spin alignment and $\Lambda-\bar\Lambda$ correlation. Using the Nambu-Jona-Lanisio model, we qualitatively study the properties of quark-antiquark spin correlation. Our findings reveal a peak structure near the critical end point (CED) of chiral phase transition, which may serve as an experimental signature of the CEP and help explain the non-monotonic behavior of $\phi$ meson alignment at low collision energies.</description>

      <title>Elastic Dijet Production in Electron Scattering on a Longitudinally Polarized Proton at Small $x$: A Portal to Orbital Angular Momentum Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the elastic production of dijets from electron collisions with a longitudinally polarized proton target at small values of the Bjorken $x$ variable. Building on the pioneering proposals of \cite{Hatta:2016aoc,Bhattacharya:2022vvo, Bhattacharya:2023hbq, Bhattacharya:2024sck} for measuring the quark and gluon orbital angular momentum (OAM) distributions, our focus is on both the longitudinal double spin asymmetry (DSA) and longitudinal single spin asymmetry (SSA). We compute the numerators of these asymmetries in the small-$x$ formalism of the light-cone operator treatment (LCOT). Utilizing the small-$x$ expressions for the OAM distributions derived in our earlier paper, we demonstrate that the DSA provides a robust probe for both the quark and gluon OAM distributions within the proton. In contrast, we find that while the SSA is also sensitive to the OAM distributions, extraction of the latter from the SSA would require new developments in small-$x$ theory and phenomenology, and is probably not feasible at this point in time. These findings highlight the potential of DSA measurements in elastic dijet production at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) to provide the first-ever direct access to the quark and gluon OAM distributions at small $x$, paving the way for new insights into the proton spin puzzle.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal anisotropy of jet particles in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The azimuthal anisotropy of particles associated with jets (jet particles) at midrapidity is measured for the first time in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV down to transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) of 0.5 GeV/$c$ and 2 GeV/$c$, respectively, with ALICE. The results obtained in p-Pb collisions are based on a novel three-particle correlation technique. The azimuthal anisotropy coefficient $v_2$ in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions is positive, with a significance reaching 6.8$\sigma$ at low $p_{\rm T}$, and its magnitude is smaller than in semicentral Pb-Pb collisions. In contrast to the measurements in Pb-Pb collisions, the $v_2$ coefficient is also found independent of $p_{\rm T}$ within uncertainties. Comparisons with the inclusive charged-particle $v_2$ and with AMPT calculations are discussed. The predictions suggest that parton interactions play an important role in generating a non-zero jet-particle $v_2$ in p-Pb collisions, even though they overestimate the reported measurement. These observations shed new insights on the understanding of the origin of the collective behaviour of jet particles in small systems such as p-Pb collisions, and provide significant stringent new constraints to models.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the impact-parameter dependent azimuthal anisotropy in coherent $\rho^0$ photoproduction in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter presents the first measurement of the impact-parameter dependent angular anisotropy in the decay of coherently photoproduced $\rho^0$ mesons. The $\rho^0$ mesons are reconstructed through their decay into pion pairs. The measured anisotropy corresponds to the amplitude of the $\cos(2\phi)$ modulation, where $\phi$ is the angle between the two vectors formed by the sum and the difference of the transverse momenta of the pions, respectively. The measurement was performed by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC using data from ultraperipheral Pb$-$Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~5.02$ TeV per nucleon pair. Different impact-parameter regions are selected by classifying the events in nuclear-breakup classes. The amplitude of the $\cos(2\phi)$ modulation is found to increase by about one order of magnitude from large to small impact parameters. Theoretical calculations describe the measured $\cos(2\phi)$ anisotropy and its impact-parameter dependence as the result of a quantum interference effect at the femtometer scale, arising from the ambiguity regarding which of the nuclei is the photon source in the interaction.</description>

      <title>Measurement of beauty-quark production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV via non-prompt D mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $p_{\rm T}$-differential production cross sections of non-prompt ${\rm D^0}$, ${\rm D^+}$, and ${\rm D_s^+}$ mesons originating from beauty-hadron decays are measured in proton$-$proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The measurements are performed at midrapidity, $|y| &lt; 0.5$, with the data sample collected by ALICE from 2016 to 2018. The results are in agreement with predictions from several perturbative QCD calculations. The fragmentation fraction of beauty quarks to strange mesons divided by the one to non-strange mesons, $f_{\rm{s}}/(f_{\rm{u}} + f_{\rm{d}})$, is found to be $0.114 \pm 0.016~{\rm (stat.)} \pm 0.006~{\rm (syst.)} \pm 0.003~{\rm (BR)} \pm 0.003~{\rm (extrap.)}$. This value is compatible with previous measurements at lower centre-of-mass energies and in different collision systems in agreement with the assumption of universality of fragmentation functions. In addition, the dependence of the non-prompt D meson production on the centre-of-mass energy is investigated by comparing the results obtained at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ and 13 TeV, showing a hardening of the non-prompt D-meson $p_{\rm T}$-differential production cross section at higher $\sqrt{s}$. Finally, the ${\rm b\overline{b}}$ production cross section per unit of rapidity at midrapidity is calculated from the non-prompt ${\rm D^0}$, ${\rm D^+}$, ${\rm D_s^+}$, and $\Lambda_{\rm c}^+$ hadron measurements, obtaining ${\rm d}\sigma/{\rm d}y = 75.2\pm 3.2~(\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 5.2~(\mathrm{syst.})^{+12.3}_{-3.2} ~(\mathrm{extrap.})\text{ } \rm \mu b \;.$</description>

      <title>A Bayesian mixture model approach to quantifying the empirical nuclear saturation point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) in the limit of infinite symmetric nuclear matter exhibits an equilibrium density, $n_0 \approx 0.16 \, \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$, at which the pressure vanishes and the energy per particle attains its minimum, $E_0 \approx -16 \, \mathrm{MeV}$. Although not directly measurable, the saturation point $(n_0,E_0)$ can be extrapolated by density functional theory (DFT), providing tight constraints for microscopic interactions derived from chiral effective field theory (EFT). However, when considering several DFT predictions for $(n_0,E_0)$ from Skyrme and Relativistic Mean Field models together, a discrepancy between these model classes emerges at high confidence levels that each model prediction's uncertainty cannot explain. How can we leverage these DFT constraints to rigorously benchmark saturation properties of chiral interactions? To address this question, we present a Bayesian mixture model that combines multiple DFT predictions for $(n_0,E_0)$ using an efficient conjugate prior approach. The inferred posterior for the saturation point's mean and covariance matrix follows a Normal-inverse-Wishart class, resulting in posterior predictives in the form of correlated, bivariate $t$-distributions. The DFT uncertainty reports are then used to mix these posteriors using an ordinary Monte Carlo approach. At the 95\% credibility level, we estimate $n_0 \approx 0.157 \pm 0.010 \, \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ and $E_0 \approx -15.97 \pm 0.40 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ for the marginal (univariate) $t$-distributions. Combined with chiral EFT calculations of the pure neutron matter EOS, we obtain bivariate normal distributions for the symmetry energy and its slope parameter at $n_0$: $S_v \approx 32.0 \pm 1.1 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ and $L\approx 52.6\pm 8.1 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ (95\%), respectively. Our Bayesian framework is publicly available, so practitioners can readily use and extend our results.</description>

      <title>Universality in the Near-Side Energy-Energy Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the energy-energy correlator (EEC) of hadrons produced on the same side in $e^+e^-$ annihilation or in leading jets in $pp$ collisions. We observe a remarkable universality of the correlator. Using a non-perturbative transverse momentum dependent (TMD) fragmentation function to model the transition from the ``free-hadron" region to the perturbative collinear region, we are able to describe the near-side shapes and peaks over a wide range of energy for both the $e^+e^-$ annihilation and the $pp$ jet substructure measurements in terms of just two parameters. We present further predictions for the ratio of the projected three-point energy correlator to the EEC. The excellent agreement between our calculations and the experimental data may provide new insights into the role of non-perturbative physics for EECs, and suggests the possibility of exploring non-perturbative TMDs using theoretical tools developed for the energy correlators.</description>
