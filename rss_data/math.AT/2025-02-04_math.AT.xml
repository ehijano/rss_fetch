      <title>Homotopy connectivity of \v{C}ech complexes of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S^n$ be the $n$-sphere with the geodesic metric and of diameter $\pi$. The intrinsic \v{C}ech complex of $S^n$ at scale $r$ is the nerve of all open balls of radius $r$ in $S^n$. In this paper, we show how to control the homotopy connectivity of \v{C}ech complexes of spheres at each scale between $0$ and $\pi$ in terms of coverings of spheres. Our upper bound on the connectivity, which is sharp in the case $n=1$, comes from the chromatic numbers of Borsuk graphs of spheres. Our lower bound is obtained using the conicity (in the sense of Barmak) of \v{C}ech complexes of the sufficiently dense, finite subsets of $S^n$. Our bounds imply the new result that for $n\ge 1$, the homotopy type of the \v{C}ech complex of $S^n$ at scale $r$ changes infinitely many times as $r$ varies over $(0,\pi)$; we conjecture only countably many times. Additionally, we lower bound the homological dimension of \v{C}ech complexes of finite subsets of $S^n$ in terms of their packings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the main properties of the $RO(C_2\times \Sigma_2)$-graded cohomology ring of a point and apply the results to compute the subring of motivic classes given by the Bredon motivic cohomology of real numbers and to compute $RO(C_2\times \Sigma_2)$-graded cohomology ring of $E_{\Sigma_2}C_2$.
  This generalizes Voevodsky's identification of motivic cohomology of real numbers with the positive cone of $RO(C_2)$ graded cohomology of a point.</description>

Abstract: We construct an explicit and calculable models for rational U(2)-spectra. This is obtained by assembling seven blocks obtained in previous work: the toral part and earlier work on small toral groups. The assembly process requires detailed input on fusion and Weyl groups.</description>

      <title>Branched coarse coverings and transfer maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concepts of branched coarse coverings and transfers between coarse homology theories along them. We show that various versions of coarse $K$-homology theories admit the additional structure of transfers. We show versions of Atiyah's $L^{2}$-index theorem in coarse homotopy theory and apply them to give a new argument for the corresponding step in Higson's counterexample to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Relative Homology Theory of Representation in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous research has proven that the set of maps implemented by neural networks with a ReLU activation function is identical to the set of piecewise linear continuous maps. Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which the network $\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.
  In this work, we leverage these properties to define the equivalence class of inputs $\sim_\Phi$, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\cap \text{Im}\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the overlap decomposition $O_\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and the input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to relative homology groups $H_k(\Phi(M)) \simeq H_k(M,O_\Phi)$. This lets us compute Betti numbers without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.
  Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our relative homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on various classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.</description>

      <title>$C_2$-Equivariant Orthogonal Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a version of orthogonal calculus for functors from $C_2$-representations to $C_2$-spaces, where $C_2$ is the cyclic group of order 2. For example, the functor $BO(-)$, that sends a $C_2$-representation to the classifying space of its orthogonal group, which has a $C_2$-action induced by the action on the $C_2$-representation. We obtain a bigraded sequence of approximations to such a functor, and via a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences, we prove that the homotopy fibres of maps between approximations are fully determined by orthogonal spectra with a genuine action of $C_2$ and a naive action of the orthogonal group $O(p,q):=O(\mathbb{R}^{p+q\delta})$.</description>

      <title>Cohomology on the centric orbit category of a fusion system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study here the higher derived limits of mod $p$ cohomology on the centric orbit category of a saturated fusion system on a finite $p$-group. It is an open problem whether all such higher limits vanish. This is known in many cases, including for fusion systems realized by a finite group and for many classes of fusion systems which are not so realized. We prove that the higher limits of $H^j$ vanish provided $j \leq p-2$, by showing that the same is true for the contravariant part of a simple Mackey composition factor of $H^j$ under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Recovering generalized homology from Floer homology: the complex oriented case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We associate an invariant called the completed Tate cohomology to a filtered circle-equivariant spectrum and a complex oriented cohomology theory. We show that when the filtered spectrum is the spectral symplectic cohomology of a Liouville manifold, this invariant depends only on the stable homotopy type of the underlying manifold. We make explicit computations for several complex oriented cohomology theories, including Eilenberg-Maclane spectra, Morava K-theories, their integral counterparts, and complex K-theory. We show that the result for Eilenberg-Maclane spectra depends only on the rational homology, and we use the computations for Morava K-theory to recover the integral homology (as an ungraded group). In a different direction, we use the completed Tate cohomology computations for the complex K-theory to recover the complex K-theory of the underlying manifold from its equivariant filtered Floer homotopy type. A key Floer theoretic input is the computation of local equivariant Floer theory near the orbit of an autonomous Hamiltonian, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this article we describe the $T_{comp}$-equivariant topological $K$-ring of a $T$-{\it cellular} complete toric variety.

Furthermore, we compute a basis for $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ as a $R(T_{comp})$-module and multiplicative structure constants with respect to this basis.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>K-theoretic Tate-Poitou duality at prime 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the result of Blumberg and Mandell on K-theoretic Tate-Poitou duality at odd primes which serves as a spectral refinement of the classical arithmetic Tate-Poitou duality. The duality is formulated for the $K(1)$-localized algebraic K-theory of the ring of $p$-integers in a number field and its completion using the $\bZ_p$-Anderson duality. This paper completes the picture by addressing the prime 2, where the real embeddings of number fields introduce extra complexities. As an application, we identify the homotopy type at prime 2 of the homotopy fiber of the cyclotomic trace for the sphere spectrum in terms of the algebraic K-theory of the integers.</description>

      <title>Bounded cohomology and scl of verbal wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a countable group $A$ with trivial bounded cohomology for all semi-separable coefficients and any group $\Gamma$, we prove that the bounded cohomology of certain restricted verbal wreath products $\Gamma \wr^{_W} A$ vanishes in positive degrees, for all semi-separable coefficients. Examples of such verbal wreath products include the standard restricted wreath product (extending a recent result by Monod for lamplighters groups) as well as verbal wreath products arising from $n$-solvable, $n$-nilpotent and $k$-Burnside ($k = 2,3,4,6$) verbal products. Moreover, we prove that the stable commutator length of any verbal wreath product $\Gamma \wr^{_W} A$ vanishes. As an application, we show that every group of type $F_p$ isometrically embeds into a group of type $F_p$ with vanishing bounded cohomology in degree $n\geq 1$ for all semi-separable coefficients.</description>
