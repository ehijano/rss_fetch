      <title>Federated Learning with Quantum Computing and Fully Homomorphic Encryption: A Novel Computing Paradigm Shift in Privacy-Preserving ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of products powered by machine learning models is raising concerns around data privacy and information security worldwide. To address this issue, Federated Learning was first proposed as a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional methods that allow multiple learning clients to share model knowledge without disclosing private data. A complementary approach known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a quantum-safe cryptographic system that enables operations to be performed on encrypted weights. However, implementing mechanisms such as these in practice often comes with significant computational overhead and can expose potential security threats. Novel computing paradigms, such as analog, quantum, and specialized digital hardware, present opportunities for implementing privacy-preserving machine learning systems while enhancing security and mitigating performance loss. This work instantiates these ideas by applying the FHE scheme to a Federated Learning Neural Network architecture that integrates both classical and quantum layers.</description>

      <title>Size and Shape of Fuzzy Spheres from Matrix/Membrane Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the size and shape statistics of ground state fuzzy spheres when projected onto the transverse plane, utilizing the regularized SU(N=2) matrix model in D=(1+3)-dimensional spacetime. We show that they appear as ellipses, from matrix/membrane correspondence. With our numerical and analytical approximation for the ground state wavefunction, we provide estimations for their expected surface areas, perimeters, eccentricities, and shape-parameters. These geometric constants of quantum membranes deviate drastically from classical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Harvesting magic from the vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic is the quantum resource allowing a quantum computer to perform operations that cannot be simulated efficiently by classical computation. As such, generating magic in a quantum system is crucial for achieving quantum advantage. This letter shows that magic can be harvested by a three-level Unruh-DeWitt detector (a qutrit) interacting with a quantum field in an initial vacuum state. While the idea of extracting resources from Quantum Field Theories (QFT) was born from the harvesting of entanglement, our result extends the protocol to evolve a qutrit from a non-magical state to a magical one, making it possible to generate magic from QFT.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton interference in a single-spatial-mode quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphoton interference is crucial to many photonic quantum technologies. In particular, interference forms the basis of optical quantum information processing platforms and can lead to significant computational advantages. It is therefore interesting to study the interference arising from various states of light in large interferometric networks. Here, we implement a quantum walk in a highly stable, low-loss, multiport interferometer with up to 24 ultrafast time bins. This time-bin interferometer comprises a sequence of birefringent crystals which produce pulses separated by 4.3\,ps, all along a single optical axis. Ultrafast Kerr gating in an optical fiber is employed to time-demultiplex the output from the quantum walk. We measure one-, two-, and three-photon interference arising from various input state combinations, including a heralded single-photon state, a thermal state, and an attenuated coherent state at one or more input ports. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast time bins are a promising platform to observe large-scale multiphoton interference.</description>

      <title>A remark on quantum measuring systems and the holographic principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a sort of ultimate question to examine the continuity of a quantum measurement subject theoretically and has not yet been resolved within a scientific framework. In this article, we approach this question and argue that the continuity of a quantum measurement subject follows as a fundamental consequence of the holographic principle after the classicalization of the quantum state of the bulk space.</description>

      <title>Flexible Fault Tolerant Gate Gadgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design flexible fault tolerant gate gadgets that allow the data and the ancilla to be encoded using different codes. By picking a stabilizer code for the ancilla we are able to perform both Clifford and non-Clifford gates fault tolerantly on generic quantum codes, including both stabilizer and non-additive codes. This allows us to demonstrate the first universal fault tolerant gate set for non-additive codes. We consider fault tolerance both with respect to a dephasing channel and a depolarizing channel.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of Gaussian unitary transformations for bosonic and fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian unitary transformations are generated by quadratic Hamiltonians, i.e., Hamiltonians containing quadratic terms in creations and annihilation operators, and are heavily used in many areas of quantum physics, ranging from quantum optics and condensed matter theory to quantum information and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. They are known to form a representation of the metaplectic and spin group for bosons and fermions, respectively. These groups are the double covers of the symplectic and special orthogonal group, respectively, and our goal is to analyze the behavior of the sign ambiguity that one needs to deal with when moving between these groups and their double cover. We relate this sign ambiguity to expectation values of the form $\langle 0|\exp{(-i\hat{H})}|0\rangle$, where $|0\rangle$ is a Gaussian state and $\hat{H}$ an arbitrary quadratic Hamiltonian. We provide closed formulas for $\langle 0|\exp{(-i\hat{H})}|0\rangle$ and show how we can efficiently describe group multiplications in the double cover without the need of going to a faithful representation on an exponentially large or even infinite-dimensional space. Our construction relies on an explicit parametrization of these two groups (metaplectic, spin) in terms of symplectic and orthogonal group elements together with a twisted U(1) group.</description>

      <title>Rapid initial state preparation for the quantum simulation of strongly correlated molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies on quantum algorithms for ground state energy estimation often assume perfect ground state preparation; however, in reality the initial state will have imperfect overlap with the true ground state. Here we address that problem in two ways: by faster preparation of matrix product state (MPS) approximations, and more efficient filtering of the prepared state to find the ground state energy. We show how to achieve unitary synthesis with a Toffoli complexity about $7 \times$ lower than that in prior work, and use that to derive a more efficient MPS preparation method. For filtering we present two different approaches: sampling and binary search. For both we use the theory of window functions to avoid large phase errors and minimise the complexity. We find that the binary search approach provides better scaling with the overlap at the cost of a larger constant factor, such that it will be preferred for overlaps less than about $0.003$. Finally, we estimate the total resources to perform ground state energy estimation of Fe-S cluster systems, including the FeMo cofactor by estimating the overlap of different MPS initial states with potential ground-states of the FeMo cofactor using an extrapolation procedure. {With a modest MPS bond dimension of 4000, our procedure produces an estimate of $\sim 0.9$ overlap squared with a candidate ground-state of the FeMo cofactor, producing a total resource estimate of $7.3 \times 10^{10}$ Toffoli gates; neglecting the search over candidates and assuming the accuracy of the extrapolation, this validates prior estimates that used perfect ground state overlap. This presents an example of a practical path to prepare states of high overlap in a challenging-to-compute chemical system.</description>

      <title>A Computation-Enhanced High-Dimensional Quantum Gate for Silicon-Vacancy Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qudit-based quantum gates in high-dimensional Hilbert space can provide a viable route towards effectively accelerating the speed of quantum computing and performing complex quantum logic operations. In the paper, we propose a 2-qudit $4\times4$-dimensional controlled-not (CNOT) gate for four silicon-vacancy spins, in which the first two electron-spin states in silicon-vacancy centers are encoded as the control qudits, and the other ones as the target qudits. The proposed protocol is implemented with assistance of an ancillary photon that serves as a common-data bus linking four motionless silicon-vacancy spins placed in four independent single-sided optical nanocavities. Moreover, the CNOT gate works in a deterministic manner by performing the relational feed-forward operations corresponding to the diverse outcomes of the single-photon detectors to be directed against the ancillary photon. Further, it can be potentially generalized to other solid-state quantum system. Under current technological conditions, both the efficiency and fidelity of the 2-qudit CNOT gate are high.</description>

      <title>A no-go theorem for sequential and retro-causal hidden-variable theories based on computational complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Bell's no-go theorem rules out the hidden-variable theories falling in the hypothesis of locality and causality, by requiring the theory to model the quantum correlation-at-a-distance phenomena. Here I develop an independent no-go theorem, by inspecting the ability of a theory to model quantum \emph{circuits}. If a theory is compatible with quantum mechanics, then the problems of solving its mathematical models must be as hard as calculating the output of quantum circuits, i.e., as hard as quantum computing. Rigorously, I provide complexity classes capturing the idea of sampling from sequential (causal) theories and from post-selection-based (retro-causal) theories; I show that these classes fail to cover the computational complexity of sampling from quantum circuits. The result is based on widely accepted conjectures on the superiority of quantum computers over classical ones. The result represents a no-go theorem that rules out a large family of sequential and post-selection-based theories. I discuss the hypothesis of the no-go theorem and the possible ways to circumvent them. In particular, I discuss the Schulman model and its extensions, which is retro-causal and is able to model quantum correlation-at-a-distance phenomena: I provides clues suggesting that it escapes the hypothesis of the no-go theorem.</description>

      <title>The Cram\'{e}r-Rao approach and global quantum estimation of bosonic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state estimation is a fundamental task in quantum information theory, where one estimates real parameters continuously embedded in a family of quantum states. In the theory of quantum state estimation, the widely used Cram\'er Rao approach which considers local estimation gives the ultimate precision bound of quantum state estimation in terms of the quantum Fisher information. However practical scenarios need not offer much prior information about the parameters to be estimated, and the local estimation setting need not apply. In general, it is unclear whether the Cram\'er-Rao approach is applicable for global estimation instead of local estimation. In this paper, we find situations where the Cram\'er-Rao approach does and does not work for quantum state estimation problems involving a family of bosonic states in a non-IID setting, where we only use one copy of the bosonic quantum state in the large number of bosons setting. Our result highlights the importance of caution when using the results of the Cram\'er-Rao approach to extrapolate to the global estimation setting.</description>

      <title>QUBO-based SVM for credit card fraud detection on a real QPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among all the physical platforms for the realization of a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), neutral atom devices are emerging as one of the main players. Their scalability, long coherence times, and the absence of manufacturing errors make them a viable candidate.. Here, we use a binary classifier model whose training is reformulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and implemented on a neutral atom QPU. In particular, we test it on a Credit Card Fraud (CCF) dataset. We propose several versions of the model, including exploiting the model in ensemble learning schemes. We show that one of our proposed versions seems to achieve higher performance and lower errors, validating our claims by comparing the most popular Machine Learning (ML) models with QUBO SVM models trained with ideal, noisy simulations and even via a real QPU. In addition, the data obtained via real QPU extend up to 24 atoms, confirming the model's noise robustness. We also show, by means of numerical simulations, how a certain amount of noise leads surprisingly to enhanced results. Our results represent a further step towards new quantum ML algorithms running on neutral atom QPUs for cybersecurity applications.</description>

      <title>Spin amplification in realistic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin amplification is the process that ideally increases the number of excited spins if there was one excited spin to begin with. Using optimal control techniques to find classical drive pulse shapes, we show that spin amplification can be done in the previously unexplored regime with amplification times comparable to the timescale set by the interaction terms in the Hamiltonian. This is an order of magnitude faster than the previous protocols and makes spin amplification possible even with significant decoherence and inhomogeneity in the spin system. The initial spin excitation can be delocalized over the entire ensemble, which is a more typical situation when a photon is collectively absorbed by the spins. We focus on the superconducting persistent-current artificial atoms as spins, but this approach can be applied to other kinds of strongly-interacting spins, including the Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VQITE) is a leading technique for ground state preparation on quantum computers. A significant computational challenge of VQITE is the determination of the quantum geometric tensor. We show that requiring the imaginary-time evolution to be correct only when projected onto a chosen set of operators allows to achieve a twofold reduction in circuit depth by bypassing fidelity estimations, and reduces measurement complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of parameters. We demonstrate by a simulation of the transverse-field Ising model that our algorithm achieves a several orders of magnitude improvement in the number of measurements required for the same accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered classical light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs, ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate and degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry approaches. We present a "quantum-like" nonlinear optical method that reaches super-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by replacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes two high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater signal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the potential applications of this pathway.</description>

Abstract: We study the emergence of chaos in a 2d system corresponding to a classical Hamiltonian system $V= \frac{1}{2}(\omega_x^2x^2+\omega_y^2y^2)+\epsilon xy^2$ consisting of two interacting harmonic oscillators and compare the classical and the Bohmian quantum trajectories for increasing values of $\epsilon$. In particular we present an initial quantum state composed of two coherent states in $x$ and $y$, which in the absence of interaction produces ordered trajectories (Lissajous figures) and an initial state which contains {both chaotic and ordered} trajectories for $\epsilon=0$. In both cases we find that, in general, Bohmian trajectories become chaotic in the long run, but chaos emerges at times which depend on the strength of the interaction between the oscillators.</description>

      <title>Krylov Expressivity in Quantum Reservoir Computing and Quantum Extreme Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning utilizes the high-dimensional space of quantum systems, attracting significant research interest. This study employs Krylov complexity to analyze task performance in quantum machine learning. We calculate the spread complexity and effective dimension of the Krylov space, introducing the effective dimension as an easy-to-compute, measurable, and upper-bounded expressivity measure. Our analysis covers quantum reservoir computers and quantum extreme learning machines, showing that increasing effective dimension correlates with improved performance. We validate this with the Lorenz cross-prediction task, observing reduced error with higher effective dimensions. Lastly, we compare the spread complexity, the effective dimension, and the fidelity as expressivity measures and show that fidelity is not suitable, while spread complexity can qualitatively explain task performance. Only the effective dimension captures the phase space accurately and exhibits the same saturation as task performance for similar evolution times.</description>

      <title>Towards practical secure delegated quantum computing with semi-classical light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure Delegated Quantum Computation (SDQC) protocols are a vital piece of the future quantum information processing global architecture since they allow end-users to perform their valuable computations on remote quantum servers without fear that a malicious quantum service provider or an eavesdropper might acquire some information about their data or algorithm. They also allow end-users to check that their computation has been performed as they have specified it.
  However, existing protocols all have drawbacks that limit their usage in the real world. Most require the client to either operate a single-qubit source or perform single-qubit measurements, thus requiring them to still have some quantum technological capabilities albeit restricted, or require the server to perform operations which are hard to implement on real hardware (e.g isolate single photons from laser pulses and polarisation-preserving photon-number quantum non-demolition measurements). Others remove the need for quantum communications entirely but this comes at a cost in terms of security guarantees and memory overhead on the server's side.
  We present an SDQC protocol which drastically reduces the technological requirements of both the client and the server while providing information-theoretic composable security. More precisely, the client only manipulates an attenuated laser pulse, while the server only handles interacting quantum emitters with a structure capable of generating spin-photon entanglement. The quantum emitter acts as both a converter from coherent laser pulses to polarisation-encoded qubits and an entanglement generator. Such devices have recently been used to demonstrate the largest entangled photonic state to date, thus hinting at the readiness of our protocol for experimental implementations.</description>

      <title>Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However, achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date, paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin properties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the realization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the proposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits with long-range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly developed quantum low-density parity-check codes in solid-state systems.</description>

Abstract: We compare the performance of protective quantum measurements to that of standard projective measurements. Performance is quantified in terms of the uncertainty in the measured expectation value. We derive an expression for the relative performance of these two types of quantum measurements and show explicitly that protective measurements can provide a significant performance advantage over standard projective measurements.</description>

Abstract: We use a combinatorial approach to obtain exact expressions for the many-body density of states of fermionic and bosonic gases with equally spaced single-particle spectra. We identify a mapping that reveals a remarkable property, namely, fermionic and bosonic gases have the same many-body density of states, up to a shift corresponding to ground state energy. Additionally, we show that there is a regime, comprising the validity range of the Bethe approximation, where the many-body density of states becomes independent of the number of particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore indefinite causal order between events in the context of quasiclassical spacetimes in superposition. We introduce several new quantifiers to measure the degree of indefiniteness of the causal order for an arbitrary finite number of events and spacetime configurations in superposition. By constructing diagrammatic and knot-theoretic representations of the causal order between events, we find that the definiteness or maximal indefiniteness of the causal order is topologically invariant. This reveals an intriguing connection between the field of quantum causality and knot theory. Furthermore, we provide an operational encoding of indefinite causal order and discuss how to incorporate a measure of quantum coherence into our classification.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a center-of-mass-conserving Brownian complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with long-range (power-law) interactions characterized by $1/r^\eta$. The kinetic constraint and long-range interactions conspire to yield rich hydrodynamics associated with the conserved charge, which we reveal by computing the Schwinger-Keldysh effective action. Our result shows that charge transport in this system can be subdiffusive, diffusive, or superdiffusive, with the dynamical exponent controlled by $\eta$. We further employ a doubled Hilbert space methodology to derive an effective action for the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), from which we obtain the phase diagram delineating regimes where the lightcone is linear or logarithmic. Our results provide a concrete example of a quantum many-body system with kinetic constraint and long-range interactions in which the emergent hydrodynamic modes and OTOC can be computed analytically.</description>

      <title>Multifold Majorana corner modes arising from multiple pairs of helical edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators with a pair of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity have been shown to support second-order topological superconductors with Majorana corner modes. As the Majorana corner modes are originated from the helical edge states of the quantum spin Hall insulators, whether quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity can give rise to second-order topological superconductors with multifold Majorana corner modes is an interesting question to address. In this work, we consider a quantum spin Hall insulator with two pairs of helical edge states. We find robust twofold Majorana corner modes can be achieved when the helical edge states are gapped by a combined action of a magnetic exchange field and an $s$-wave pairing, or an $s+p$ mixed-parity pairing. The stability of two Majorana zero modes per corner under the action of magnetic exchange fields is attributed to the protection from the chiral symmetry. Our study reveals that heterostructures composed of superconductors and quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states could serve as a platform to pursue multifold Majorana corner modes.</description>

      <title>Spin resolved momentum spectra for vacuum pair production via a generalized two level model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have formulated a generalized two level model for studying the pair production in multidimensional time-dependent electric fields. It can provide momentum spectra with fully spin resolved components for all possible combined spin states of the particle and anti-particle simultaneously. Moreover, we have also investigated the validity of the two level model for fermions (scalar particles) by comparing the results with those by equal-time Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (Feshbach-Villars-Heisenberg-Wigner) formalism in different regimes of pair creation, i.e., multiphoton and tunneling dominated mechanisms. It is found that the results are consistent with each other, indicating the good approximation of the two level model. In particular, in terms of the two level model, we found that the contribution of the particle momentum spectra is the greatest when the spin states of the particle and anti-particle are parallel with $S=1$. It is believed that by this two level model one can extend researches on pair production for more different background fields, such as a slowly varying spatial-temporal one. Many other interesting phenomena may also be revealed, including the spin-resolved vortex structure that is contained in the phase feature of the distribution function of the created pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atoms excited to Rydberg states have recently emerged as a valuable resource in neutral atom platforms for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum information processing. Atoms in Rydberg states have large polarizabilities, making them highly sensitive to electric fields. Therefore, stray electric fields can decohere these atoms, in addition to compromising the fidelity of engineered interactions between them. It is therefore essential to cancel these stray electric fields. Here we present a novel, simple, and highly-compact electrode assembly, implemented in a glass cell-based vacuum chamber design, for stray electric field cancellation. The electrode assembly allows for full 3D control of the electric field in the vicinity of the atoms while blocking almost no optical access. We experimentally demonstrate the cancellation of stray electric fields to better than 10 mV/cm using this electrode assembly.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Origin of Spacetime Non-Commutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic interpretation of spacetime non-commutativity starting from the path integral formulation of quantum mechanical commutation relations. We discuss how the (non-)commutativity of spacetime is inherently related to the continuity or discontinuity of paths in the path integral formulation. Utilizing Wiener processes, we demonstrate that continuous paths lead to commutative spacetime, whereas discontinuous paths correspond to non-commutative spacetime structures. As an example we introduce discontinuous paths from which the $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime commutators can be obtained. Moreover we focus on modifications of the Leibniz rule for differentials acting on discontinuous trajectories. We show how these can be related to the deformed action of translation generators focusing, as a working example, on the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra. Our findings suggest that spacetime non-commutativity can be understood as a result of fundamental discreteness of spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic QED (MQED) is the field theory for computing quantum electromagnetic effects in dispersive media. Here we extend MQD to treat time-varying, dispersive media. For a time dependent Drude model, we find that the expected replacement ${\epsilon}({\omega}) {\to} {\epsilon}(t,{\omega})$ within standard MQED leads to nonphysical polarization currents, becoming singular in the limit of a step change in the carrier density. We show this singular behaviour can be removed through modifying the reservaoir dynamics, quantizing the resulting theory and finding the non-equilibrium, time-varying noise currents, which exhibit extra correlations due to temporal reflections within the material dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the difference between thermalization in open and isolated quantum systems: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to fermionic lead, we show by characterizing its spectral form factor and level spacing distribution, that the system falls in the twilight zone between integrable and non-integrable regimes, which we call partially non-integrable. We further evidence that, despite being only partially non-integrable and thereby falling outside the remit of the standard eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, it nevertheless experiences IQS as well as OQS thermalization.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Collisions of false-vacuum bubble walls in a quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.07243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate, using nonperturbative methods, the real-time dynamics of small bubbles of "false vacuum" in a quantum spin chain near criticality, where the low-energy physics is described by a relativistic (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theory. We consider bubbles whose walls are kink and antikink quasiparticle excitations, so that wall collisions are kink-antikink scattering events. To construct these bubbles in the presence of strong correlations, we extend a recently proposed matrix product state (MPS) ansatz for quasiparticle wavepackets. We simulate dynamics within a window of about 1000 spins embedded in an infinite chain at energies of up to about 5 times the mass gap. By choosing the wavepacket width and the bubble size appropriately, we avoid strong lattice effects and observe relativistic kink-antikink collisions. We use the MPS quasiparticle ansatz to detect scattering outcomes. (i) In the Ising model, with transverse and longitudinal fields, we do not observe particle production despite nonintegrability (supporting recent observations of nonthermalizing states in this model). (ii) Switching on an additional interaction, we see production of confined and unconfined particle pairs. We characterize the amount of entanglement generated as a function of energy and time and conclude that our classical simulation methods will ultimately fail as these increase. We anticipate that kink-antikink scattering in 1+1 dimensions will be an instructive benchmark problem for future quantum computers and analog quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model has been at the forefront of quantum optics for almost six decades to date, providing one of the simplest yet intricately nonlinear formulations of light-matter interaction in modern physics. Laying most of the emphasis on the omnipresence of the model across a range of disciplines, this monograph brings up the fundamental generality of its formalism, looking at a wide gamut of applications in specific physical systems among several realms, including atomic physics, quantum optics, solid-state physics and quantum information science. When bringing the various pieces together to assemble our narrative, we have primarily targeted researchers in quantum physics and quantum optics. The monograph also comprises an accessible introduction for graduate students engaged with non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions, quantum computing and simulation, and quantum many-body physics. In that framework, we aim to reveal the common ground between physics and applications scattered across literature and different technological advancements. The exposition guides the reader through a vibrant field interlacing quantum optics and condensed-matter physics. All sections are devoted to the strong interconnection between theory and experiment, historically linked to the development of the various modern research directions stemming from JC physics. This is accompanied by a comprehensive list of references to the key publications that have shaped its evolution since the early 1960s. Finally, we have endeavored to keep the presentation of such a multi-sided material as concise as possible, interspersing continuous text with various illustrations alongside an economical use of mathematical expressions.</description>

      <title>Optimal light cone for macroscopic particle transport in long-range systems: A quantum speed limit approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the ultimate rate at which information propagates is a pivotal issue in nonequilibrium physics. Nevertheless, the task of elucidating the propagation speed inherent in quantum bosonic systems presents challenges due to the unbounded nature of their interactions. In this study, we tackle the problem of macroscopic particle transport in a long-range generalization of the lattice Bose-Hubbard model through the lens of the quantum speed limit. By developing a unified approach based on optimal transport theory, we rigorously prove that the minimum time required for macroscopic particle transport is always bounded by the distance between the source and target regions, while retaining its significance even in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound for the probability of observing a specific number of bosons inside the target region, thereby providing additional insights into the dynamics of particle transport. Our results hold true for arbitrary initial states under both long-range hopping and long-range interactions, thus resolving an open problem of particle transport in generic bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Error-tolerant quantum convolutional neural networks for symmetry-protected topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of noisy quantum states prepared on current quantum computers is getting beyond the capabilities of classical computing. Quantum neural networks based on parametrized quantum circuits, measurements and feed-forward can process large amounts of quantum data to reduce measurement and computational costs of detecting non-local quantum correlations. The tolerance of errors due to decoherence and gate infidelities is a key requirement for the application of quantum neural networks on near-term quantum computers. Here we construct quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) that can, in the presence of incoherent errors, recognize different symmetry-protected topological phases of generalized cluster-Ising Hamiltonians from one another as well as from topologically trivial phases. Using matrix product state simulations, we show that the QCNN output is robust against symmetry-breaking errors below a threshold error probability and against all symmetry-preserving errors provided the error channel is invertible. This is in contrast to string order parameters and the output of previously designed QCNNs, which vanish in the presence of any symmetry-breaking errors. To facilitate the implementation of the QCNNs on near-term quantum computers, the QCNN circuits can be shortened from logarithmic to constant depth in system size by performing a large part of the computation in classical post-processing. These constant-depth QCNNs reduce sample complexity exponentially with system size in comparison to the direct sampling using local Pauli measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13450v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the complexity for the mixed state density operator derived from a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). The complexity is computed using a two-qubit quantum circuit obtained from canonically purifying the mixed state. We demonstrate that the Nielson complexity for the unitary evolution oscillates around a mean circuit depth of $k$. Further, the complexity of the step-wise evolution operator grows cumulatively and linearly with the steps. From a quantum circuit perspective, this implies a succession of circuits of (near) constant depth to be applied to reach the final state.</description>

      <title>Efficient Long-Range Entanglement using Dynamic Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation traditionally relies on unitary dynamics, inherently imposing efficiency constraints on the generation of intricate entangled states. In principle, these limitations can be superseded by non-unitary, dynamic circuits. These circuits exploit measurements alongside conditional feed-forward operations, providing a promising approach for long-range entangling gates, higher effective connectivity of near-term hardware, and more efficient state preparations. Here, we explore the utility of shallow dynamic circuits for creating long-range entanglement on large-scale quantum devices. Specifically, we study two tasks: CNOT gate teleportation between up to 101 qubits by feeding forward 99 mid-circuit measurement outcomes, and the preparation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states with genuine entanglement. In the former, we observe that dynamic circuits can outperform their unitary counterparts. In the latter, by tallying instructions of compiled quantum circuits, we provide an error budget detailing the obstacles that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of dynamic circuits. Looking forward, we expect dynamic circuits to be useful for generating long-range entanglement in the near term on large-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information-Assisted Complete Active Space Optimization (QICAS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated active space selection is arguably one of the most challenging and essential aspects of multiconfigurational methods. In this work we propose an effective quantum information-assisted complete active space optimization (QICAS) scheme. What sets QICAS apart from other correlation-based selection schemes is (i) the use of unique measures from quantum information that assess the correlation in electronic structures in an unambiguous and predictive manner, and (ii) an orbital optimization step that minimizes the correlation discarded by the active space approximation. Equipped with these features QICAS yields for smaller correlated molecules sets of optimized orbitals with respect to which the CASCI energy reaches the corresponding CASSCF energy within chemical accuracy. For more challenging systems such as the Chromium dimer, QICAS offers an excellent starting point for CASSCF by greatly reducing the number of iterations required for numerical convergence. Accordingly, our study validates a profound empirical conjecture: the energetically optimal non-active spaces are predominantly those that contain the least entanglement.</description>

      <title>Ergodic and mixing quantum channels: From two-qubit to many-body quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02740v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of classical ergodic theory has had a significant impact in the areas of mathematics, physics, and, in general, applied sciences. The quantum ergodic theory of Hamiltonian dynamics has its motivations to understand thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Quantum channel, a completely positive trace-preserving map, represents a most general representation of quantum dynamics and is an essential aspect of quantum information theory and quantum computation. In this work, we study the ergodic theory of quantum channels by characterizing different levels of ergodic hierarchy from integrable to mixing. The quantum channels on single systems are constructed from the unitary operators acting on bipartite states and tracing out the environment. The interaction strength of these unitary operators measured in terms of operator entanglement provides sufficient conditions for the channel to be mixing. By using block diagonal unitary operators, we construct a set of non-ergodic channels. By using canonical form of two-qubit unitary operator, we analytically construct the channels on single qubit ranging from integrable to mixing. Moreover, we also study interacting many-body quantum systems that include the famous Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and show that they display mixing within the framework of the quantum channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the constant flow of data from vast sources over the past decades, a plethora of advanced analytical techniques have been developed to extract relevant information from different data types ranging from labeled data, quasi-labeled data, and data with no labels known a priori. For data with at best quasi-labels, graphs are a natural representation of these data types and have important applications in many industries and scientific disciplines. Specifically, for unlabeled data, anomaly detection on graphs is a method to determine which data points do not posses the latent characteristics that is present in most other data. There have been a variety of classical methods to compute an anomalous score for the individual vertices of a respected graph, such as checking the local topology of a node,random walks, and complex neural networks. Leveraging the structure of the graph, we propose a first quantum algorithm to calculate the anomaly score of each node by continuously traversing the graph with a uniform starting position of all nodes. The proposed algorithm incorporates well-known characteristics of quantum random walks, and, taking into consideration the NISQ era and subsequent ISQ era, an adjustment to the algorithm is given to mitigate the increasing depth of the circuit. This algorithm is rigorously shown to converge to the expected probability, with respect to the initial condition.</description>

Abstract: The time evolution of quantum Fisher information, quantum coherence, and non-Markovianity of a V-type three-level atom embedded in free space or a photonic band gap crystal have been investigated. It has been demonstrated that the photonic band gap crystal, as a structured environment, significantly influences the preservation and enhancement of these quantum features. Additionally, we observe that by manipulating the initial relative phase values encoded in the atomic state and the relative positions of the upper levels within the forbidden gap, control over the dynamics of quantum features can be achieved. These findings highlight the potential benefits of utilizing photonic band gap crystals in quantum systems, offering improved preservation and manipulation of quantum information. The ability to control quantum features opens new avenues for applications in quantum information processing and related technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions, this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition, we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different degrees of non-locality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the dynamics of quantum coherence serves as an effective probe for identifying dephasing, which is a distinctive signature of many-body localization (MBL). Quantum coherence can be utilized to measure both the local coherence of specific subsystems and the total coherence of the whole system in a consistent manner. Our results reveal that the local coherence of small subsystems decays over time following a power law in the MBL phase, while it reaches a stable value within the same time window in the Anderson localized (AL) phase. In contrast, the total coherence of the whole system exhibits logarithmic growth during the MBL phase and reaches a stable value in the AL phase. Notably, this dynamic characteristic of quantum coherence remains robust even with weak interactions and displays unbounded behavior in infinite systems. Our results provide insights into understanding many-body dephasing phenomena in MBL systems and propose a novel feasible method for identifying and characterizing MBL phases in experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Markov Decision Processes: General Theory, Approximations, and Classes of Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the aim is to develop a quantum counterpart to classical Markov decision processes (MDPs). Firstly, we provide a very general formulation of quantum MDPs with state and action spaces in the quantum domain, quantum transitions, and cost functions. Once we formulate the quantum MDP (q-MDP), our focus shifts to establishing the verification theorem that proves the sufficiency of Markovian quantum control policies and provides a dynamic programming principle. Subsequently, a comparison is drawn between our q-MDP model and previously established quantum MDP models (referred to as QOMDPs) found in the literature. Furthermore, approximations of q-MDPs are obtained via finite-action models, which can be formulated as QOMDPs. Finally, classes of open-loop and classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies for q-MDPs are introduced, along with structural results for these policies. In summary, we present a novel quantum MDP model aiming to introduce a new framework, algorithms, and future research avenues. We hope that our approach will pave the way for a new research direction in discrete-time quantum control.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted classical capacities of some channels acting as radial multipliers on fermion algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$, acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$ with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender to a receiver when they share an unlimited amount of entanglement. Our approach relies on new connections between fermion algebras with the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a dimension-independent context.</description>

      <title>Brick Wall Quantum Circuits with Global Fermionic Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18440v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study brick wall quantum circuits enjoying a global fermionic symmetry. The constituent 2-qubit gate, and its fermionic symmetry, derive from a 2-particle scattering matrix in integrable, supersymmetric quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions. Our 2-qubit gate, as a function of three free parameters, is of so-called free fermionic or matchgate form, allowing us to derive the spectral structure of both the brick wall unitary $U_F$ and its, non-trivial, hamiltonian limit $H_{\gamma}$ in closed form. We find that the fermionic symmetry pins $H_{\gamma}$ to a surface of critical points, whereas breaking that symmetry leads to non-trivial topological phases. We briefly explore quench dynamics for this class of circuits.</description>

      <title>QubiCSV: An Open-Source Data Storage and Visualization Platform for Collaborative Qubit Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing collaborative research platforms for quantum bit control is crucial for driving innovation in the field, as they enable the exchange of ideas, data, and implementation to achieve more impactful outcomes. Furthermore, considering the high costs associated with quantum experimental setups, collaborative environments are vital for maximizing resource utilization efficiently. However, the lack of dedicated data management platforms presents a significant obstacle to progress, highlighting the necessity for essential assistive tools tailored for this purpose. Current qubit control systems are unable to handle complicated management of extensive calibration data and do not support effectively visualizing intricate quantum experiment outcomes. In this paper, we introduce QubiCSV (Qubit Control Storage and Visualization), a platform specifically designed to meet the demands of quantum computing research, focusing on the storage and analysis of calibration and characterization data in qubit control systems. As an open-source tool, QubiCSV facilitates efficient data management of quantum computing, providing data versioning capabilities for data storage and allowing researchers and programmers to interact with qubits in real time. The insightful visualization are developed to interpret complex quantum experiments and optimize qubit performance. QubiCSV not only streamlines the handling of qubit control system data but also improves the user experience with intuitive visualization features, making it a valuable asset for researchers in the quantum computing domain.</description>

      <title>Operator growth and spread complexity in open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commonly, the notion of "quantum chaos'' refers to the fast scrambling of information throughout complex quantum systems undergoing unitary evolution. Motivated by the Krylov complexity and the operator growth hypothesis, we demonstrate that the entropy of the population distribution for an operator in time is a useful way to capture the complexity of the internal information dynamics of a system when subject to an environment and is, in principle, agnostic to the specific choice of operator basis. We demonstrate its effectiveness for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, examining the dynamics of the system in both its Krylov basis and the basis of operator strings. We prove that the former basis minimises spread complexity while the latter is an eigenbasis for high dissipation. In both cases, we probe the long-time dynamics of the model and the phenomenological effects of decoherence on the complexity of the dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field result in two signatures on a harmonically trapped charged particle: a shift from the natural trap frequency and generation of quantum coherences. We assess the role of the long-wavelength and rotating-wave approximations in estimating this frequency shift. We estimate the magnitude of the frequency shift using parameters from a single-electron cyclotron experiment and also demonstrate how the dependence of the frequency shift on the magnetic field of the cyclotron is tied to the rotating-wave approximation. We expect the frequency shift to be observable in future experiments. We also suggest a possible route to detecting vacuum-generated quantum coherences. These experiments should settle the debate on the choice of approximations and gauge in capturing the effect of the quantum vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Quantum computational advantage with constant-temperature Gibbs sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum system coupled to a bath at some fixed, finite temperature converges to its Gibbs state. This thermalization process defines a natural, physically-motivated model of quantum computation. However, whether quantum computational advantage can be achieved within this realistic physical setup has remained open, due to the challenge of finding systems that thermalize quickly, but are classically intractable. Here we consider sampling from the measurement outcome distribution of quantum Gibbs states at constant temperatures, and prove that this task demonstrates quantum computational advantage. We design a family of commuting local Hamiltonians (parent Hamiltonians of shallow quantum circuits) and prove that they rapidly converge to their Gibbs states under the standard physical model of thermalization (as a continuous-time quantum Markov chain). On the other hand, we show that no polynomial time classical algorithm can sample from the measurement outcome distribution by reducing to the classical hardness of sampling from noiseless shallow quantum circuits. The key step in the reduction is constructing a fault-tolerance scheme for shallow IQP circuits against input noise.</description>

      <title>Oscillating-mode gap: an indicator of phase transition in open quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It presents a significant challenge to elucidate the relationship between the phases of open quantum many-body systems and the spectral structure of their governing Liouvillian, which determines how the density matrix evolves. Previous studies have focused on the Liouvillian gap, defined as the decay rate of the most slowly-decaying mode, as a key indicator of dissipative phase transition, noting its closure in symmetry-broken phases and opening in disordered phases. In this work, we propose an additional spectral gap, termed the oscillating-mode gap, defined as the decay rate of the most slowly-decaying oscillating mode. Through the analysis of a prototype dissipative boson system, we demonstrate the necessity of both the Liouvillian gap and the oscillating-mode gap for the comprehensive characterization of the system's phases and the transitions between them.</description>

      <title>MEMO-QCD: Quantum Density Estimation through Memetic Optimisation for Quantum Circuit Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a strategy for efficient quantum circuit design for density estimation. The strategy is based on a quantum-inspired algorithm for density estimation and a circuit optimisation routine based on memetic algorithms. The model maps a training dataset to a quantum state represented by a density matrix through a quantum feature map. This training state encodes the probability distribution of the dataset in a quantum state, such that the density of a new sample can be estimated by projecting its corresponding quantum state onto the training state. We propose the application of a memetic algorithm to find the architecture and parameters of a variational quantum circuit that implements the quantum feature map, along with a variational learning strategy to prepare the training state. Demonstrations of the proposed strategy show an accurate approximation of the Gaussian kernel density estimation method through shallow quantum circuits illustrating the feasibility of the algorithm for near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>SUPER excitation of quantum emitters is a multi-photon process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The swing-up of quantum emitter population (SUPER) scheme allows to populate the excited state of a quantum emitter with near-unity fidelity using two red-detuned laser pulses. Its off-resonant, yet fully coherent nature has attracted significant interest in quantum photonics as a valuable tool for preparing single-photon sources in their excited state on demand, while simultaneously ensuring straightforward spectral filtering of the laser. However, the physical understanding of this mechanism in terms of energy exchange between the electromagnetic field and the emitter is still lacking. Here, we present a fully quantized model of the swing-up excitation and demonstrate that it is in fact a multi-photon process, where one of the modes loses two or more photons while the other gains at least one. Our findings provide an unexpected physical interpretation of the SUPER scheme and unveil a new non-linear interaction between single emitters and multiple field modes.</description>

      <title>From Maximum Cut to Maximum Independent Set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Maximum Cut (Max-Cut) problem could be naturally expressed either in a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation, or as an Ising model. It has long been known that the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem could also be related to a specific Ising model. Therefore, it would be natural to attack MIS with various Max-Cut/Ising solvers. It turns out that this strategy greatly improves the approximation for the independence number of random Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs. It also exhibits perfect performance on a benchmark arising from coding theory. These results pave the way for further development of approximate quantum algorithms on MIS, and specifically on the corresponding coding problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, quantifying circuit complexity remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces Character Complexity, a novel measure that bridges Group-theoretic concepts with practical quantum computing concerns. By leveraging tools from representation theory, I prove several key properties of character complexity and establish a surprising connection to the classical simulability of quantum circuits. This new measure offers a fresh perspective on the complexity landscape of quantum algorithms, potentially reshaping our understanding of quantum-classical computational boundaries. I present innovative visualization methods for character complexity, providing intuitive insights into the structure of quantum circuits. The empirical results reveal intriguing scaling behaviors with respect to qubit and gate counts, opening new avenues for quantum algorithm design and optimization. This work not only contributes to the theoretical foundations of quantum complexity but also offers practical tools for the quantum computing community. As quantum hardware continues to advance, character complexity could play a crucial role in developing more efficient quantum algorithms and in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Periodic classical trajectories and quantum scars in many-spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) provides a systematic framework for implementing a polynomial transformation of a linear operator, and unifies nearly all known quantum algorithms. In parallel, recent works have developed randomized compiling, a technique that promotes a unitary gate to a quantum channel and enables a quadratic suppression of error (i.e., $\epsilon \rightarrow O(\epsilon^2)$) at little to no overhead. Here we integrate randomized compiling into QSP through Stochastic Quantum Signal Processing. Our algorithm implements a probabilistic mixture of polynomials, strategically chosen so that the average evolution converges to that of a target function, with an error quadratically smaller than that of an equivalent individual polynomial. Because nearly all QSP-based algorithms exhibit query complexities scaling as $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ -- stemming from a result in functional analysis -- this error suppression reduces their query complexity by a factor that asymptotically approaches $1/2$. By the unifying capabilities of QSP, this reduction extends broadly to quantum algorithms, which we demonstrate on algorithms for real and imaginary time evolution, phase estimation, ground state preparation, and matrix inversion.</description>

Abstract: Controlling the flow of photons is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. We introduce the concept of spatiotemporal photon blockade for nonreciprocal quantum absorption, utilizing space-time-periodic metasurfaces. Our study presents a methodology for experimentally realizing this effect, where photon frequency coherence with the metasurface's space-time modulation enables one-way quantum absorption. In this system, forward-traveling photons are energetically modulated and absorbed within the slab, while backward-traveling photons are transmitted without interaction. Our analysis includes band structure, isofrequency diagrams, and nonreciprocal absorption results. These findings lay the groundwork for developing nonreciprocal quantum devices and enhancing photon management in milli-Kelvin temperature quantum systems.</description>

      <title>TR-ARPES Signal in Pumped Semiconductors within Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, after discussing in detail the internals of our recently developed method, the dynamical projective operatorial approach (DPOA), we provide the framework to apply this method to pumped semiconductor lattice systems and, in particular, to study and analyze their electronic excitations and TR-ARPES signal. The expressions for relevant out-of-equilibrium Green's functions and TR-ARPES signal are given within the DPOA framework and, defining a retarded TR-ARPES signal, it is shown that it is possible to obtain an out-of-equilibrium version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We clarify how single- and multi-photon resonances, rigid shifts, band dressings, and different types of sidebands emerge in the TR-ARPES signal. We also propose protocols for evaluating the strength of single- and multi-photon resonances and for assigning the residual excited electronic population at each crystal momentum and band to a specific excitation process. Hamiltonians, where intra- and inter-band transitions are selectively inhibited, are defined and used to analyze the effects on the TR-ARPES signal and the residual electronic excited population. Three relevant cases of light-matter coupling are examined within the dipole gauge: only a local dipole, only the Peierls substitution in the hopping term, and both terms at once. The transient and residual pump effects are studied in detail, including the consequences of the lattice symmetries at different crystal momenta on the TR-ARPES signal. A detailed study of the dependence of the TR-ARPES signal on the probe-pulse characteristics is also reported. To provide a guideline for understanding the complex effects and interplays and the variety of possible physical phenomena without being limited by the characteristics of a single particular real material, we have chosen to study a prototypical pumped two-band semiconductor lattice system.</description>

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, primarily affecting the elderly population and leading to significant cognitive decline. This decline manifests in various mental faculties such as attention, memory, and higher-order cognitive functions, severely impacting an individual's ability to comprehend information, acquire new knowledge, and communicate effectively. One of the tasks influenced by cognitive impairments is handwriting. By analyzing specific features of handwriting, including pressure, velocity, and spatial organization, researchers can detect subtle changes that may indicate early-stage cognitive impairments, particularly AD. Recent developments in classical artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise in detecting AD through handwriting analysis. However, as the dataset size increases, these AI approaches demand greater computational resources, and diagnoses are often affected by limited classical vector spaces and feature correlations. Recent studies have shown that quantum computing technologies, developed by harnessing the unique properties of quantum particles such as superposition and entanglement, can not only address the aforementioned problems but also accelerate complex data analysis and enable more efficient processing of large datasets. In this study, we propose a variational quantum classifier with fewer circuit elements to facilitate early AD diagnosis based on handwriting data. Our model has demonstrated comparable classification performance to classical methods and underscores the potential of quantum computing models in addressing cognitive problems, paving the way for future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations of Spectrum Form Factor and Krylov Complexity at Finite Temperature</title>

Abstract: In the study of quantum chaos diagnostics, considerable attention has been attributed to the Krylov complexity and spectrum form factor (SFF) for systems at infinite temperature. These investigations have unveiled universal properties of quantum chaotic systems. By extending the analysis to include the finite temperature effects on the Krylov complexity and SFF, we demonstrate that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$, which are associated with the Wightman inner product, display consistency with the universal hypothesis presented in PRX 9, 041017 (2019). This result contrasts with the behavior of Lanczos coefficients associated with the standard inner product. Our results indicate that the slope $\alpha$ of the $b_n$ is bounded by $\pi k_BT$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature. We also investigate the SFF, which characterizes the two-point correlation of the spectrum and encapsulates an indicator of ergodicity denoted by $g$ in chaotic systems. Our analysis demonstrates that as the temperature decreases, the value of $g$ decreases as well. Considering that $\alpha$ also represents the operator growth rate, we establish a quantitative relationship between ergodicity indicator and Lanczos coefficients slope. To support our findings, we provide evidence using the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble and a random spin model. Our work deepens the understanding of the finite temperature effects on Krylov complexity, SFF, and the connection between ergodicity and operator growth.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole coupling of circular Rydberg qubits to inner shell excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Divalent atoms provide excellent means for advancing control in Rydberg atom-based quantum simulation and computing, due to the second optically active valence electron available. Particularly promising in this context are circular Rydberg atoms, for which long-lived ionic core excitations can be exploited without suffering from detrimental autoionization. Here, we report the implementation of electric quadrupole coupling between the metastable 4D$_{3/2}$ level and a very high-$n$ ($n=79$) circular Rydberg qubit, realized in doubly excited $^{88}$Sr atoms prepared from an optical tweezer array. We measure the kHz-scale differential level shift on the circular Rydberg qubit via beat-node Ramsey interferometry comprising spin echo. Observing this coupling requires coherent interrogation of the Rydberg states for more than one hundred microseconds, which is assisted by tweezer trapping and circular state lifetime enhancement in a black-body radiation suppressing capacitor. Further, we find no noticeable loss of qubit coherence under continuous photon scattering on the ion core, paving the way for laser cooling and imaging of Rydberg atoms. Our results demonstrate access to weak electron-electron interactions in Rydberg atoms and expand the quantum simulation toolbox for optical control of highly excited circular state qubits via ionic core manipulation.</description>

      <title>Non-maximal entanglement of photons from positron-electron annihilation demonstrated using a novel plastic PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the state-of-the-art Positron Emission Tomography (PET), information about the polarization of annihilation photons is not available. Current PET systems track molecules labeled with positron-emitting radioisotopes by detecting the propagation direction of two photons from positron-electron annihilation. However, annihilation photons carry more information than just the site where they originated. Here we present a novel J-PET scanner built from plastic scintillators, in which annihilation photons interact predominantly via the Compton effect, providing information about photon polarization in addition to information on photon direction of propagation. Theoretically, photons from the decay of positronium in a vacuum are maximally entangled in polarization. However, in matter, when the positron from positronium annihilates with the electron bound to the atom, the question arises whether the photons from such annihilation are maximally entangled. In this work, we determine the distribution of the relative angle between polarization orientations of two photons from positron-electron annihilation in a porous polymer. Contrary to prior results for positron annihilation in aluminum and copper, where the strength of observed correlations is as expected for maximally entangled photons, our results show a significant deviation. We demonstrate that in porous polymer, photon polarization correlation is weaker than for maximally entangled photons but stronger than for separable photons. The data indicate that more than 40% of annihilations in Amberlite resin lead to a non-maximally entangled state. Our result indicates the degree of correlation depends on the annihilation mechanism and the molecular arrangement. We anticipate that the introduced Compton interaction-based PET system opens a promising perspective for exploring polarization correlations in PET as a novel diagnostic indicator.</description>

      <title>Parity-deformed $su(2)$ and $so(3)$ Algebras: a Basis for Quantum Optics and Quantum Communications Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Having in mind the significance of parity (reflection) in various areas of physics, the single-mode and two-mode Wigner algebras are considered adding to them a reflection operator. The associated deformed $su(2)$ algebra, $su_{\nu}(2)$, and the deformed $so(3)$ algebra, $so_{\nu}(3)$, are constructed for the widely used Jordan-Schwinger and Holstein-Primakoff realizations, commenting on various aspects and ingredients of the formalism for both single-mode and two-mode cases. Finally, in this framework the parity-deformed $so_{\nu}(3)$ representation is analyzed, due to its potential application in the study of qubit and qutrit systems.</description>
