      <title>Blending Ensemble for Classification with Genetic-algorithm generated Alpha factors and Sentiments (GAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing maturity and expansion of the cryptocurrency market, understanding and predicting its price fluctuations has become an important issue in the field of financial engineering. This article introduces an innovative Genetic Algorithm-generated Alpha Sentiment (GAS) blending ensemble model specifically designed to predict Bitcoin market trends. The model integrates advanced ensemble learning methods, feature selection algorithms, and in-depth sentiment analysis to effectively capture the complexity and variability of daily Bitcoin trading data. The GAS framework combines 34 Alpha factors with 8 news economic sentiment factors to provide deep insights into Bitcoin price fluctuations by accurately analyzing market sentiment and technical indicators. The core of this study is using a stacked model (including LightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest Classifier) for trend prediction which demonstrates excellent performance in traditional buy-and-hold strategies. In addition, this article also explores the effectiveness of using genetic algorithms to automate alpha factor construction as well as enhancing predictive models through sentiment analysis. Experimental results show that the GAS model performs competitively in daily Bitcoin trend prediction especially when analyzing highly volatile financial assets with rich data.</description>

      <title>Time-Causal VAE: Robust Financial Time Series Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a time-causal variational autoencoder (TC-VAE) for robust generation of financial time series data. Our approach imposes a causality constraint on the encoder and decoder networks, ensuring a causal transport from the real market time series to the fake generated time series. Specifically, we prove that the TC-VAE loss provides an upper bound on the causal Wasserstein distance between market distributions and generated distributions. Consequently, the TC-VAE loss controls the discrepancy between optimal values of various dynamic stochastic optimization problems under real and generated distributions. To further enhance the model's ability to approximate the latent representation of the real market distribution, we integrate a RealNVP prior into the TC-VAE framework. Finally, extensive numerical experiments show that TC-VAE achieves promising results on both synthetic and real market data. This is done by comparing real and generated distributions according to various statistical distances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the generated data for downstream financial optimization tasks, as well as showcasing that the generated data reproduces stylized facts of real financial market data.</description>
