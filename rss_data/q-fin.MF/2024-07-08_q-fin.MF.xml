      <title>Optimal hedging with variational preferences under convex risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expose a theoretical hedging optimization framework with variational preferences under convex risk measures. We explore a general dual representation for the composition between risk measures and utilities. We study the properties of the optimization problem as a convex and monotone map per se. We also derive results for optimality and indifference pricing conditions. We also explore particular examples inside our setup.</description>

      <title>The second-order Esscher martingale densities for continuous-time market models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the second-order Esscher pricing notion for continuous-time models. Depending whether the stock price $S$ or its logarithm is the main driving noise/shock in the Esscher definition, we obtained two classes of second-order Esscher densities called linear class and exponential class respectively. Using the semimartingale characteristics to parametrize $S$, we characterize the second-order Esscher densities (exponential and linear) using pointwise equations. The role of the second order concept is highlighted in many manners and the relationship between the two classes is singled out for the one-dimensional case. Furthermore, when $S$ is a compound Poisson model, we show how both classes are related to the Delbaen-Haenzendonck's risk-neutral measure. Afterwards, we restrict our model $S$ to follow the jump-diffusion model, for simplicity only, and address the bounds of the stochastic Esscher pricing intervals. In particular, no matter what is the Esscher class, we prove that both bounds (upper and lower) are solutions to the same linear backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE hereafter for short) but with two different constraints. This shows that BSDEs with constraints appear also in a setting beyond the classical cases of constraints on gain-processes or constraints on portfolios. We prove that our resulting constrained BSDEs have solutions in our framework for a large class of claims' payoffs including any bounded claim, in contrast to the literature, and we single out the monotonic sequence of BSDEs that ``naturally" approximate it as well.</description>

      <title>Modelling Uncertain Volatility Using Quantum Stochastic Calculus: Unitary vs Non-Unitary Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we look at stochastic processes with uncertain parameters, and consider different ways in which information is obtained when carrying out observations. For example we focus on the case of a the random evolution of a traded financial asset price with uncertain volatility. The quantum approach presented, allows us to encode different volatility levels in a state acting on a Hilbert space. We consider different means of defining projective measurements in order to track the evolution of a traded market price, and discuss the results of different Monte-Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Block-diagonal idiosyncratic covariance estimation in high-dimensional factor models for financial time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of high-dimensional covariance matrices in latent factor models is an important topic in many fields and especially in finance. Since the number of financial assets grows while the estimation window length remains of limited size, the often used sample estimator yields noisy estimates which are not even positive definite. Under the assumption of latent factor models, the covariance matrix is decomposed into a common low-rank component and a full-rank idiosyncratic component. In this paper we focus on the estimation of the idiosyncratic component, under the assumption of a grouped structure of the time series, which may arise due to specific factors such as industries, asset classes or countries. We propose a generalized methodology for estimation of the block-diagonal idiosyncratic component by clustering the residual series and applying shrinkage to the obtained blocks in order to ensure positive definiteness. We derive two different estimators based on different clustering methods and test their performance using simulation and historical data. The proposed methods are shown to provide reliable estimates and outperform other state-of-the-art estimators based on thresholding methods.</description>

      <title>Fluid-Limits of Fragmented Limit-Order Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maglaras, Moallemi, and Zheng (2021) have introduced a flexible queueing model for fragmented limit-order markets, whose fluid limit remains remarkably tractable. In the present study we prove that, in the limit of small and frequent orders, the discrete system indeed converges to the fluid limit, which is characterized by a system of coupled nonlinear ODEs with singular coefficients at the origin. Moreover, we establish that the fluid system is asymptotically stable for an arbitrary number of limit order books in that, over time, it converges to the stationary equilibrium state studied by Maglaras et al. (2021).</description>

      <title>Unwinding Toxic Flow with Partial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a central trading desk which aggregates the inflow of clients' orders with unobserved toxicity, i.e. persistent adverse directionality. The desk chooses either to internalise the inflow or externalise it to the market in a cost effective manner. In this model, externalising the order flow creates both price impact costs and an additional market feedback reaction for the inflow of trades. The desk's objective is to maximise the daily trading P&amp;L subject to end of the day inventory penalization. We formulate this setting as a partially observable stochastic control problem and solve it in two steps. First, we derive the filtered dynamics of the inventory and toxicity, projected to the observed filtration, which turns the stochastic control problem into a fully observed problem. Then we use a variational approach in order to derive the unique optimal trading strategy. We illustrate our results for various scenarios in which the desk is facing momentum and mean-reverting toxicity. Our implementation shows that the P&amp;L performance gap between the partially observable problem and the full information case are of order $0.01\%$ in all tested scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal ratcheting of dividend payout under Brownian motion surplus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a long standing optimal dividend payout problem subject to the so-called ratcheting constraint, that is, the dividend payout rate shall be non-decreasing over time and is thus self-path-dependent. The surplus process is modeled by a drifted Brownian motion process and the aim is to find the optimal dividend ratcheting strategy to maximize the expectation of the total discounted dividend payouts until the ruin time. Due to the self-path-dependent control constraint, the standard control theory cannot be directly applied to tackle the problem. The related Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is a new type of variational inequality. In the literature, it is only shown to have a viscosity solution, which is not strong enough to guarantee the existence of an optimal dividend ratcheting strategy. This paper proposes a novel partial differential equation method to study the HJB equation. We not only prove the the existence and uniqueness of the solution in some stronger functional space, but also prove the strict monotonicity, boundedness, and $C^\infty$-smoothness of the dividend ratcheting free boundary. Based on these results, we eventually derive an optimal dividend ratcheting strategy, and thus solve the open problem completely. Economically speaking, we find that if the surplus volatility is above an explicit threshold, then one should pay dividends at the maximum rate, regardless the surplus level. Otherwise, by contrast, the optimal dividend ratcheting strategy relays on the surplus level and one should only ratchet up the dividend payout rate when the surplus level touches the dividend ratcheting free boundary. Moreover, our numerical results suggest that one should invest into those companies with stable dividend payout strategies since their income rates should be higher and volatility rates smaller.</description>

      <title>Cost-efficiency in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the topic of cost-efficiency in incomplete markets. A payoff is called cost-efficient if it achieves a given probability distribution at some given investment horizon with a minimum initial budget. Extensive literature exists for the case of a complete financial market. We show how the problem can be extended to incomplete markets and how the main results from the theory of complete markets still hold in adapted form. In particular, we find that in incomplete markets, the optimal portfolio choice for non-decreasing preferences that are diversification-loving (a notion introduced in this paper) must be "perfectly" cost-efficient. This notion of perfect cost-efficiency is shown to be equivalent to the fact that the payoff can be rationalized, i.e., it is the solution to an expected utility problem.</description>

      <title>Optimal stopping of Gauss-Markov bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the non-discounted, finite-horizon optimal stopping problem of a Gauss-Markov bridge by using a time-space transformation approach. The associated optimal stopping boundary is proved to be Lipschitz continuous on any closed interval that excludes the horizon, and it is characterized by the unique solution of an integral equation. A Picard iteration algorithm is discussed and implemented to exemplify the numerical computation and geometry of the optimal stopping boundary for some illustrative cases.</description>
