      <title>Winning Strategy Templates for Stochastic Parity Games towards Permissive and Resilient Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic games play an important role for many purposes such as the control of cyber-physical systems (CPS), where the controller and the environment are modeled as players. Conventional algorithms typically solve the game for a single winning strategy in order to develop a controller. However, in applications such as CPS control, permissive controllers are crucial as they allow the controlled system to adapt if additional constraints need to be imposed and also remain resilient to system changes at runtime. In this work, we generalize the concept of permissive winning strategy templates, introduced by Anand et al. at TACAS and CAV 2023 for deterministic games, to encompass stochastic games. These templates represent an infinite number of winning strategies and can adapt strategies to system changes efficiently. We focus on five key winning objectives -- safety, reachability, B\"uchi, co-B\"uchi, and parity -- and present algorithms to construct templates for each objective. In addition, we propose a novel method to extract a winning strategy from a template and provide discussions on template comparison.</description>

      <title>Rice-like complexity lower bounds for Boolean and uniform automata networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automata networks are a versatile model of finite discrete dynamical systems composed of interacting entities (the automata), able to embed any directed graph as a dynamics on its space of configurations (the set of vertices, representing all the assignments of a state to each entity). In this world, virtually any question is decidable by a simple exhaustive search. We lever the Rice-like complexity lower bound, stating that any non-trivial monadic second order logic question on the graph of its dynamics is NP-hard or coNP-hard (given the automata network description), to bounded alphabets (including the Boolean case). This restriction is particularly meaningful for applications to "complex systems", where each entity has a restricted set of possible states (its alphabet). For the non-deterministic case, trivial questions are solvable in constant time, hence there is a sharp gap in complexity for the algorithmic solving of concrete problems on them. For the non-deterministic case, non-triviality is defined at bounded treewidth, which offers a structure to establish metatheorems of complexity lower bounds.</description>

      <title>On Higher-Order Reachability Games vs May Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.08416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the reachability problem for higher-order functional programs and study the relationship between reachability games (i.e., the reachability problem for programs with angelic and demonic nondeterminism) and may-reachability (i.e., the reachability problem for programs with only angelic nondeterminism). We show that reachability games for order-n programs can be reduced to may-reachability for order-(n+1) programs, and vice versa. We formalize the reductions by using higher-order fixpoint logic and prove their correctness. We also discuss applications of the reductions to higher-order program verification.</description>
