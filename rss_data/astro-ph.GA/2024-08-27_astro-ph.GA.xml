      <title>A Break In the Size-Stellar Mass Relation: Evidence for Quenching and Feedback in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping stars and gas in nearby galaxies is fundamental for understanding their growth and the impact of their environment. This issue is addressed by comparing the stellar "edges" of galaxies $D_{\rm stellar}$, defined as the outermost diameter where in situ star formation significantly drops, with the gaseous distribution parameterized by the neutral atomic hydrogen diameter measured at 1 $M_{sun}$/pc$^2$, $D_{HI}$. By sampling a broad HI mass range $10^5 M_{sun} &lt; M_{HI} &lt; 10^{11} M_{sun}$, we find several dwarf galaxies with $M_{HI} &lt; 10^9 M_{sun}$ from the field and Fornax Cluster which are distinguished by $D_{\rm stellar} &gt;&gt; D_{HI}$. For the cluster dwarfs, the average HI surface density near $D_{\rm stellar}$ is $\sim$0.3 $M_{sun}$/pc$^2$, reflecting the impact of quenching and outside-in gas removal from ram pressure and tidal interactions. In comparison, $D_{\rm stellar}/D_{HI}$ ranges between 0.5-2 in dwarf field galaxies, consistent with the expectations from stellar feedback. Only more massive disk galaxies in the field can thus be characterized by the common assumption that $D_{\rm stellar} \lesssim D_{HI}$. We discover a break in the $D_{\rm stellar}-M_{\rm stellar}$ relation at $m_{break} \sim 4\times10^8 M_{sun}$ that potentially differentiates the low mass regime where the influence of stellar feedback and environmental processes more prominently regulates the sizes of nearby galaxies. Our results highlight the importance of combining deep optical and HI imaging for understanding galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The Ultraviolet Slopes of Early Universe Galaxies: The Impact of Bursty Star Formation, Dust, and Nebular Continuum Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has enabled the detection of the UV continuum of galaxies at z&gt;10, evidencing a population of extremely blue, potentially dust-free galaxies. Interpreting the UV spectra of galaxies as they redden is complicated by the well-known degeneracy between stellar ages, dust, and nebular continuum. The main goal of this paper is to develop a theoretical model for the relationship between galaxy UV slopes, bursty star formation histories, dust evolution, and the contribution from nebular regions. We accomplish this via cosmological zoom-in simulations, and in specific, build a layered model where we simulate the UV slopes of galaxies with increasingly complex physics. Our main results follow. (i) Unattenuated stellar populations with no nebular emission exhibit a diverse range of intrinsic UV slopes, with values ranging from beta ~ -3 --&gt; -2.2 due to long delays between bursts. This is manifested by an inverse correlation between the intrinsic UV slope and sSFR for early galaxies such that higher sSFR corresponds to bluer UV slopes. (ii) When including dust, our model galaxies demonstrate a rapid rise in dust obscuration between z ~ 8-10. This increase in dust mass is due to high grain-grain shattering rates, and enhanced growth per unit dust mass in very small grains, resulting in UV-detected galaxies at z ~ 12 descending into ALMA-detectable galaxies by z ~ 6. The rapid rise in dust content at z ~ 8-10 leads to a systematic reddening of the UV slopes during this redshift range. (iii) The inclusion of nebular continuum reddens the UV slope by a median factor Delta beta ~ 0.2-0.4. However, when including nebular continuum, our highest redshift galaxies (z~12) are insufficiently blue compared to observations; this may imply an evolving escape fraction from HII regions with redshift.</description>

      <title>Counter-Rotation and Slow Precession in Aligned Eccentric Nuclear Disks due to Gravitational Wave Recoil Kicks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M31 nucleus contains a supermassive black hole embedded in a massive stellar disk of apsidally-aligned eccentric orbits. It has recently been shown that this disk is slowly precessing at a rate consistent with zero. Here we demonstrate using N-body methods that apsidally-aligned eccentric disks can form with a significant (~0.5) fraction of orbits counter-rotating as the result of a gravitational wave recoil kick of merging supermassive black holes. Higher amplitude kicks map to a larger retrograde fraction in the surrounding stellar population which in turns results in slow precession. We furthermore show that disks with significant counter-rotation are more stable (that is, apsidal-alignment is most pronounced and long lasting), more eccentric, and have the highest rates of stars entering the black hole's tidal disruption radius</description>

      <title>Unveiling galaxy chemical enrichment mechanisms out to cosmic dawn from direct determination of O &amp; Ar abundances from JWST/NIRSPEC spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy chemical enrichment mechanisms have primarily been constrained by [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H] measurements of individual stars and integrated light from stellar populations. However such measurements are limited at higher redshifts (z&gt;1). Recently, we proposed an analogous diagram of the oxygen-to-argon abundance ratio, log(O/Ar), vs Ar abundance, 12+log(Ar/H), as a new diagnostic window for emission nebulae. In this Letter, using robust line flux measurements including temperature sensitive auroral lines, we present direct determination of O and Ar abundances in nine SFGs from JWST/NIRSPEC spectra at z$\sim$1.3-7.7, and two more with Keck/MOSFIRE spectra at z$\sim$2.2. Utilising their positions on the log(O/Ar) vs 12+log(Ar/H) plane, we present the first inference of galaxy chemical enrichment mechanisms from an ensemble of galaxies. The SFGs at z$\sim$1.3-3.4 are consistent with the solar neighbourhood galactic chemical enrichment models of the Milky Way Galaxy that are driven by core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae. Such enrichment mechanisms thus occur at least out to z$\sim$3.4. However, the highest-redshift SFGs (z$\sim$3.6-7.7) have very low log(O/Ar) values, revealing a different enrichment process at z&gt;3.6. Such low log(O/Ar) values may be caused by a rapid but intermittent star-formation and/or additional sources. The new diagnostic window for SFGs enables us to reveal the unique fingerprints of galaxy chemical enrichment out to cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>A simple model of the radio-infrared correlation depending on gas surface density and redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple parametric model of the radio-infrared correlation (i.e., the ratio between the IR luminosity and the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity, $q_{\mbox{\tiny IR}}$) by considering the energy loss rate of high-energy cosmic ray (CR) electron governed by the radiative cooling (synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering), ionization, and adiabatic expansion. Each process of CR electron energy loss is explicitly computed and compared to each other. We rewrite the energy loss rate of each process to be dependent on the gas surface density and redshift using the relevant scaling relations. By combining each energy loss rate, the fraction of the synchrotron energy loss rate is computed as a function of gas surface density and redshift, and used to extrapolate the well-established `local' radio-infrared correlation to the high-redshift universe. The locally established $q_{\mbox{\tiny IR}}$ is reformulated to be dependent upon the redshift and the gas surface density and applied for understanding the observed distribution of the radio-infrared correlation of high-redshift galaxies in \cite{delvecchio_etal_2021}. Our model predicts that $q_{\mbox{\tiny IR}}$ value is anti-correlated with gas surface density and the redshift dependency of $q_{\mbox{\tiny IR}}$ value changes by gas surface density of galaxies, which captures the observed trend of $q_{\mbox{\tiny IR}}$ values for stellar mass selected star forming galaxies with a minimal impact of radio-infrared selection bias.</description>

      <title>X-ray observations of Blueberry galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact star-forming galaxies were dominant galaxy types in the early Universe. Blueberry galaxies (BBs) represent their local analogues being very compact and having intensive star formation. Motivated by high X-ray emission recently found in other analogical dwarf galaxies, called Green Peas, we probe into the X-ray properties of BBs to determine if their X-ray emission is consistent with the empirical laws for star-forming galaxies. We performed the first X-ray observations of a small sample of BBs with the XMM-Newton satellite. Spectral analysis for detected sources and upper limits measured via Bayesian-based analysis for very low-count measurements were used to determine the X-ray properties of our galaxy sample. Clear detection was obtained only for 2 sources, with one source exhibiting an enhanced X-ray luminosity to the scaling relations. For the remaining 5 sources, only an upper limit was constrained, suggesting BBs to be rather underluminous as a whole. Our analysis shows that the large scatter cannot be easily explained by the stochasticity effects. While the bright source is above and inconsistent at almost the 99% confidence level, the upper limits of the two sources are below the expected distribution. These results indicate that the empirical relations between the star formation rate, metallicity, and X-ray luminosity might not hold for BBs with uniquely high specific star formation rates. One possible explanation could be that the BBs may not be old enough to have a significant X-ray binary population. The high luminosity of the only bright source can be then caused by an additional X-ray source, such as a hidden active galactic nucleus or more extreme ultraluminous X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Search and analysis of giant radio galaxies with associated nuclei (SAGAN) V. Study of giant double-double radio galaxies from LoTSS DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To test the hypothesis that megaparsec-scale giant radio galaxies (GRGs) have multiple epochs of recurrent activity which lead to their giant sizes and to understand the nature of double-double radio galaxies (DDRGs), we have built the largest sample of giant DDRGs from the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). The sample consists of 111 sources, of which 76 are newly identified. Their redshift and total projected size ranges are between 0.06 to 1.6 and 0.7 Mpc to 3.2 Mpc, respectively. We conducted a detailed analysis to characterise their properties, including arm-length ratios, flux density ratios of pairs of lobes, and misalignment angles. These measurements allow us to study the symmetry parameters, which are influenced by the immediate and large-scale environments of DDRGs. Our study conclusively shows that the cocoons in which the inner lobes of DDRGs grow are often contaminated with surrounding material from the external medium, leading to observed asymmetries in the inner lobes. Our analysis also reveals highly misaligned DDRGs, which could be due to environmental factors and/or changes in the supermassive black hole jet ejection axes. By studying the misalignment angles, we assess the stability of the jets in these systems in relation to their environment. Additionally, we have also characterised the large-scale environments of DDRGs, identifying them within dense galaxy clusters and studying how cluster weather significantly affects their morphologies. Interestingly, we have identified two gigahertz peaked-spectrum (GPS) candidates in the unresolved cores of the DDRGs, as well as one triple-double candidate, which, if confirmed, would be only the fifth known case. Additionally, we have discovered a DDRG in a distant galaxy cluster at $z\sim$\,1.4. Abridged.</description>

      <title>Influence of selection criteria on the interpretation of rotational behaviour of wide-binary star systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary star systems are expected to follow Newtonian dynamics similarly to planetary systems. However, reports have been made of wide binary systems with separations around 0.01 pc and larger, showing potential deviations from standard Newtonian motion. This phenomenon, suggestive of the flattening of galactic rotation curves, calls for closer inspection. This study presents an analysis of wide binary stars using data from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), a space-based astrometry mission funded by the European Space Agency. The study compares different choices of selection criteria to examine the nature of these apparent anomalous kinematics within the solar neighbourhood. The Gaia data set furnishes detailed parameters, including radial velocity, mass, age, and binary probability in addition to standard parameters. A custom Python tool named BYNARY facilitated both data processing and analysis. This report reveals that the signs of any anomalous signals systematically diminish as the initial selection criteria are relaxed for degrouping while subsequent filtering remains stringent, leading to the complete elimination of any apparent non-Newtonian motion for binary separations within 0.5 pc. The study shows that an y observ ed anomalous behaviour in solar neighbourhood wide binaries within 130 pc must be produced either by faint companion stars orbiting primary or secondary stars, or by flyby stars. The findings emphasize the importance of the choice of selection criteria in disentangling genuine binary dynamics from external influences. The conclusions align with the predictions of Newtonian mechanics and general relativity, though they do not exclude other phenomena at larger scales.</description>

      <title>Gravity or turbulence? VI. The physics behind the Kennicutt-Schmidt relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain the large variety of star formation laws in terms of one single, simple law that can be inferred from the definition of the star formation rate and basic algebra. The resulting equation, $\SFR = \eff\ \Mcollapsing/\tauff$, although it has been presented elsewhere, is interpreted in terms of clouds undergoing collapse { rather than being turbulence-supported, an idea that different groups have pursued this century}. Under such assumption, one can explain the constancy of $\eff$, the different intra-cloud correlations observed in Milky Way's molecular clouds, as well as the resolved and unresolved extragalactic relationships between SFR and a measurement of the mass in CO, HCN, and CO+HI. We also explain why the slope of the correlation changes when the orbital time $\tauorb$ is considered instead of the free-fall time, and why estimations of the free-fall time from extragalactic observations skew the correlation, providing a false sublinear correlation. We furthermore show that the apparent nearly linear correlation between the star formation rate and the dynamical equilibrium pressure in the midplane of the galaxies, $\PDE$, is just a consequence of $\PDE$ values being dominated by the variation of the column density of molecular gas. All in all, we argue that the star formation law is driven by the collapse of cold, dense gas, which happens to be primarily molecular in the present Universe, and that the role of stellar feedback is just to shut down the star formation process, not to shape the star formation law.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of local halo building blocks: Thamnos and Sequoia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial aspect of galaxy evolution is the pace at which galaxies build up their mass. We can investigate this hierarchical assembly by uncovering and timing accretion events that our galaxy has experienced. In the Milky Way, accreted debris has been previously identified in the local halo, thanks to the advent of Gaia data. We aim to couple this dataset with advancements in colour-magnitude diagram fitting techniques to characterise the building blocks of the Galaxy. Here we focus on the retrograde halo, specifically Thamnos and Sequoia. We do this as part of the ChronoGal project by fitting absolute colour-magnitude diagrams (using CMDft.Gaia) of samples of stars associated with these substructures, extracted from a local 5D Gaia DR3 dataset. Comparing their derived age and metallicity distributions with those of the expected contamination, from the dominant Gaia Enceladus and low energy in-situ populations, we can unveil the stellar population signatures of the progenitors of Sequoia and Thamnos. We show that both Thamnos and Sequoia have a metal-poor population ([Fe/H]&lt;-1.5 dex) that is distinct from the expected contamination. The age distributions allow us to see that Sequoia formed half of its stars by a lookback time of 12 Gyr, while Thamnos is on average older, having formed half its stars at 12.3 Gyr. Gaia Enceladus and the low energy in-situ populations formed half of their stars by 12.1 Gyr and 12.9 Gyr respectively. This suggests that Thamnos was accreted earlier than Gaia Enceladus and Sequoia is the most recent accretion event. We have presented, for the first time, age distributions of the retrograde halo substructures: Sequoia and Thamnos. These are derived purely photometrically using CMD fitting techniques, which also provide metallicity distributions that successfully reproduce the spectroscopic distributions, highlighting the capability of CMDft.Gaia.</description>

      <title>Bipolar blobs as evidence of hidden AGN activities in the low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the evidence of a hidden black hole (BH) in a low-mass galaxy, MaNGA 9885-9102, and provide a new method to identify active BH in low mass galaxies. This galaxy is originally selected from the MaNGA survey with distinctive bipolar H$\alpha$ blobs at the minor axis. The bipolar feature can be associated with AGN activity, while the two blobs are classified as the H II regions on the BPT diagram, making the origins confusing. The Swift UV continuum shows that the two blobs do not have UV counterparts, suggesting that the source of ionization is out of the blobs. Consistent with this, the detailed photoionization models prefer to AGN rather than star-forming origin with a significance of 5.8$\sigma$. The estimated BH mass is $M_{\rm BH}\sim$7.2$\times 10^5 M_\odot$ from the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relationship. This work introduces a novel method for detecting the light echo of BHs, potentially extending to intermediate mass, in low metallicity environments where the traditional BPT diagram fails.</description>

      <title>The Calibration of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Dust Emission as a Star Formation Rate Indicator in the AKARI NEP Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dust emission has been proposed as an effective extinction-independent star formation rate (SFR) indicator in the mid-infrared (MIR), but this may depend on conditions in the interstellar medium. The coverage of the AKARI/Infrared Camera (IRC) allows us to study the effects of metallicity, starburst intensity, and active galactic nuclei on PAH emission in galaxies with $f_{\nu}(L18W)\lesssim 19$ AB mag. Observations include follow-up, rest-frame optical spectra of 443 galaxies within the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole survey that have IRC detections from 7-24 $\mu$m. We use optical emission line diagnostics to infer SFR based on H$\alpha$ and [O II]$\lambda\lambda 3726,3729$ emission line luminosities. The PAH 6.2 $\mu$m and PAH 7.7 $\mu$m luminosities ($L(PAH\ 6.2\ \mu m)$ and $L(PAH\ 7.7\ \mu m)$, respectively) derived using multi-wavelength model fits are consistent with those derived from slitless spectroscopy within 0.2 dex. $L(PAH\ 6.2\ \mu m)$ and $L(PAH\ 7.7\ \mu m)$ correlate linearly with the 24 $\mu$m-dust corrected H$\alpha$ luminosity only for normal, star-forming ``main-sequence" galaxies. Assuming multi-linear correlations, we quantify the additional dependencies on metallicity and starburst intensity, which we use to correct our PAH SFR calibrations at $0&lt;z&lt;1.2$ for the first time. We derive the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) per comoving volume from $0.15 \lesssim z \lesssim 1$. The PAH SFRD is consistent with that of the far-infrared and reaches an order of magnitude higher than that of uncorrected UV observations at $z\sim1$. Starburst galaxies contribute $\gtrsim 0.7$ of the total SFRD at $z\sim1$ compared to main-sequence galaxies.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the Hierarchical Formation of the Galactic Disk in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the hierarchical clustering scenario, galaxies like the Milky Way form hierarchically, and many supporting evidences have been found in the Galactic halo. However, most stars in the Milky Way are disk stars. Disk stars have almost lost their spatial distribution and kinematic features at birth, retaining solely chemical signatures. Identifying such substructures using abundances of iron or light elements is difficult due to their high degeneracy. Heavy elements, especially neutron capture elements have limited sources so have lower degeneracy, but spectral line fitting of these elements is tough, requiring mid to high resolution spectra, which are currently limited in sample size. This work utilizes the overall effect of changing in abundances to introduce the information of heavy elements, especially neutron capture elements to weaken the degeneracy of [Fe/H]. The analysis suggests the presence of at least 12 clusters, proves that the Galactic Disk form hierarchically. We excluded giants to prevent the possibly impact of mixing effects and that of too large differences in surface gravity, so the conclusions were all drawn from the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Morphology of molecular clouds at kiloparsec scale in the Milky Way: Shear-induced alignment and vertical confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of the cold interstellar molecular gas is determined by several processes, including self-gravity, tidal force, turbulence, magnetic field, and galactic shear. Based on the 3D dust extinction map derived by Vergely et al., we identify a sample of 550 molecular clouds (MCs) within $3\hspace{0.2em}\rm kpc$ of the solar vicinity in the Galactic disk. Our sample contains clouds whose size ranges from pc to kiloparsec, which enables us to study the effect of Galactic-scale processes, such as shear, on cloud evolution. We find that our sample clouds follow a power-law mass-size relation of $M\propto 32.00\hspace{0.2em}{R_{\rm{max}}}^{1.77}$, $M\propto 20.59\hspace{0.2em}{R_S}^{2.04}$ and $M\propto 14.41\hspace{0.2em}{R_V}^{2.29}$, where $R_{\rm{max}}$ is the major axis-based cloud radius, $R_S$ is the area-based radius, and $R_V$ is the volume-based radius, respectively. These clouds have a mean constant surface density of $\sim 7 \hspace{0.2em} \rm {M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$, and follow a volume density-size relation of $\rho \propto 2.60\hspace{0.2em}{R_{\rm{max}}}^{-0.55}$. As cloud size increases, their shapes gradually transition from ellipsoidal to disk-like to bar-like structures. Large clouds tend to have a pitch angle of $28^{\circ} - 45^{\circ}$, where the angle is measured concerning the Galactic tangential direction. These giant clouds also tend to stay parallel to the Galactic disk plane and are confined within the Galactic molecular gas disk. Our results show that large molecular clouds in the Milky Way can be shaped by Galactic shear and confined in the vertical direction by gravity.</description>

      <title>Large diffuse dwarfs in the dynamically cold triple system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of three large diffuse dwarf (LDD) galaxies located in isolated triple systems. They have effective diameters of (3.6-10.0) kpc and effective surface brightness of (26.2--27.3)$^m/$sq.arcsec. We note that the LDD galaxies tend to occur in small groups with a very low dispersion of radial velocities. The total (orbital) mass of the triplets approximately equals to their integral stellar mass within velocity measurement errors. The presence of LDD galaxies in cold multiple systems seems mysterious.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within some theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass of galaxy clusters (GCs) can be determined by calculating the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. In this work, we revisit the derivation of hydrostatic mass of GCs within modified emergent Newtonian gravity (MENG) with generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) correction, Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, and beyond Horndeski gravity (BHG). We apply the formulations on the masses of 10 GCs. We compare our results with the Newtonian mass of GCs and their baryonic masses $M_{bar}$. We find that all formulations could match with the Newtonian mass and the impact of the modified theories of gravity used in this work can be neglected. The noteworthy impact for MENG starts if we set $\beta_0=-1.656\times10^{110}$, $\kappa=5\times10^{40}$ for EiBI theory, and $\Upsilon=-0,1655\times10^{69}$ for BHG. In contrast, for the comparison with baryonic mass, only the MENG formulation produces the best linear fit with the slope $\frac{M_{MENG}}{M_{bar}}=0.755\pm0.061$. It means that in this work, MENG is the best theory of gravity that alleviates the mass discrepancy of hydrostatic mass and baryonic mass of GCs.</description>

      <title>X-ray AGN in Bo\"otes: Black Hole - Galaxy assembly in massive populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive Black Holes (BHs) are known to efficiently grow through gas accretion, but even sustained and intense mass build-up through this mechanism struggles to explain the assembly of the most massive BHs observed in the local Universe. Using the Chandra Deep-Wide Field Survey (CDFWS) in the Bo\"otes field, we measure BH-galaxy assembly in massive galaxies ($M_\star\gtrsim10^{10}\, \rm M_\odot$) through the AGN fraction and specific Black Hole accretion rate (sBHAR) distribution as a function of redshift and stellar mass. We determine stellar masses and star formation rates for a parent sample of optically selected galaxies as well as those with X-ray detections indicating the presence of an AGN through Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. We derive a redshift-dependent mass completeness limit and extract X-ray information for every galaxy as to identify AGN in various types of galaxies at low and high redshift providing a comprehensive picture of the AGN population in massive galaxies. While X-ray AGN samples are dominated by moderately massive host galaxies of $M_{\star} \geqslant 10^{10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, we do not find a strong stellar mass dependence in AGN fraction (to limits in sBHAR) or sBHAR distribution above this mass threshold, indicating a bias towards massive galaxies in the observed samples. A mild increase in AGN fraction is seen towards high stellar mass for low sBHAR AGN, as well as a suppression of high sBHAR events in the most massive galaxies. We derive BH-galaxy growth tracks over time, which reveal that while most BH mass has been accumulated since $z=4$ for lower mass BHs, the assembly of the most massive BHs is more complex, with little to no relative mass gain since $z=4$, implying that rapid and intense growth episodes prior to $z=4$ were necessary to form these massive BHs.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the $10^7$ K hot emitting gas in the Circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of the $\approx 10^6$ K gas in the circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way has been well established. However, the location and the origin of the newly discovered hot gas at `super-virial' temperatures of $\approx 10^7$ K have been puzzling. This hot gas has been detected in both absorption and emission; here we focus on the emitting gas only. We show that both the `virial' and the `super-virial' temperature gas as observed in \emph{emission} occupy disk-like extraplanar regions, in addition to the diffuse virial temperature gas filling the halo of the Milky Way. We perform idealized hydrodynamical simulations to show that the $\approx 10^7$ K emitting gas is likely to be produced by stellar feedback in and around the Galactic disk. We further show that the emitting gas at both super-virial and virial temperatures in the extraplanar regions is metal enriched and is not in hydrostatic equilibrium with the halo but is continuously evolving.</description>

      <title>Can supernova from runaway stars mimic the signs of absorbing `super-virial' gas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of large column density absorption lines from highly ionized gas in a few directions through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way (MW) has been puzzling. The inferred temperature from these absorption lines far exceeds the virial temperature of the MW, and the column densities are also too large to be easily explained. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to explain these observations and claim that they may not have originated from the CGM, but from a totally different type of source, namely, stellar ejecta from supernovae (SNe) above the Galactic disk that happen to lie in the line of sight to the background quasars. About $\sim 20\%$ of massive OB stars (progenitors of core-collapse supernovae) are known to be runaway stars that have high ejection velocities near the Galactic plane and can end up exploding as SNe above the Galactic disk. We show that the associated reverse shock in the supernova remnant in the early non-radiative phase can heat the ejecta to temperatures of $\gtrsim 10^7\,{\rm K}$ and can naturally explain the observed high column density of ions in the observed `super-virial' phase along with $\alpha$-enriched super-solar abundance that is typical of core-collapse supernovae. However, SNe from runaway stars has a covering fraction of $\lesssim 0.7 \%$ and thus can only explain the observations along limited sightlines.</description>

      <title>Filamentary Molecular Cloud Formation via Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection in Cold Neutral Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the possibility of molecular cloud formation via the Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection (CMR) mechanism of the cold neutral medium (CNM). Two atomic gas clouds with conditions typical of the CNM were set to collide at the interface of reverse magnetic fields. The cloud-cloud collision triggered magnetic reconnection and produced a giant 20pc filamentary structure which was not seen in the control models without CMR. The cloud, with rich fiber-like sub-structures, developed a fully molecular spine at 5Myr. Radiative transfer modeling of dust emission at far infrared wavelengths showed that the middle part of the filament contained dense cores over a span of 5pc. Some of the cores were actively forming stars and typically exhibited both connecting fibers in dust emission and high-velocity gas in CO line emission, indicative of active accretion through streamers. Supersonic turbulence was present in and around the CMR-filament due to inflowing gas moving at supersonic velocities in the collision mid-plane. The shocked gas was condensed and transported to the main filament piece by piece by reconnected fields, making the filament and star formation a bottom-up process. Instead of forming a gravitationally bounded cloud which then fragments hierarchically (top-down) and forms stars, the CMR process creates dense gas pieces and magnetically transports them to the central axis to constitute the filament. Since no turbulence is manually driven, our results suggest that CMR is capable of self-generating turbulence. Finally, the resulting helical field should show field-reversal on both sides of the filament from most viewing angles.</description>

      <title>DESI Peculiar Velocity Survey -- Fundamental Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Peculiar Velocity Survey aims to measure the peculiar velocities of early and late type galaxies within the DESI footprint using both the Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations. Direct measurements of peculiar velocities can significantly improve constraints on the growth rate of structure, reducing uncertainty by a factor of approximately 2.5 at redshift 0.1 compared to the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey's redshift space distortion measurements alone. We assess the quality of stellar velocity dispersion measurements from DESI spectroscopic data. These measurements, along with photometric data from the Legacy Survey, establish the Fundamental Plane relation and determine distances and peculiar velocities of early-type galaxies. During Survey Validation, we obtain spectra for 6698 unique early-type galaxies, up to a photometric redshift of 0.15. 64\% of observed galaxies (4267) have relative velocity dispersion errors below 10\%. This percentage increases to 75\% if we restrict our sample to galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts below 0.1. We use the measured central velocity dispersion, along with photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, to fit the Fundamental Plane parameters using a 3D Gaussian maximum likelihood algorithm that accounts for measurement uncertainties and selection cuts. In addition, we conduct zero-point calibration using the absolute distance measurements to the Coma cluster, leading to a value of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 76.05 \pm 0.35$(statistical) $\pm 0.49$(systematic FP) $\pm 4.86$(statistical due to calibration) $\mathrm{km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. This $H_0$ value is within $2\sigma$ of Planck Cosmic Microwave Background results and within $1\sigma$, of other low redshift distance indicator-based measurements.</description>

      <title>Superluminal proper motion in the X-ray jet of Centaurus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of the jet in Cen A is likely better revealed in X-rays than in the radio band, which is usually used to investigate jet proper motions. In this paper, we analyze Chandra ACIS observations of Cen A from 2000 to 2022 and develop an algorithm for systematically fitting the proper motions of its X-ray jet knots. Most of the knots had an apparent proper motion below the detection limit. However, one knot at a transverse distance of $520~\mathrm{pc}$ had an apparent superluminal proper motion of $2.7\pm0.4~\mathrm{c}$. This constrains the inclination of the jet to be $i&lt;41\pm6^{\circ}$, and the velocity of this knot to be $\beta&gt;0.94\pm0.02$. This agrees well with the inclination measured in the inner jet by the EHT, but contradicts previous estimates based on jet and counterjet brightness. It also disagrees with the proper motion of the corresponding radio knot, of $0.8\pm0.1~\mathrm{c}$, which further indicates that the X-ray and radio bands trace distinct structures in the jet. There are four prominent X-ray jet knots closer to the nucleus, but only one of these is inconsistent with being stationary. A few jet knots also have a significant proper motion component in the non-radial direction. This component is typically larger closer to the center of the jet. We also detect brightness and morphology variations at a transverse distance of $100~\mathrm{pc}$ from the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Cosmic dance in the Shapley Concentration Core II. The uGMRT-MeerKAT view of filaments in the brightest cluster galaxies and tailed radio galaxies in the A3528 cluster complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superclusters are the largest-scale environments where a number of galaxy clusters interact with each other through minor/major mergers and grow via accretion along cosmic filaments. We focus on the A3528 complex in the core of the Shapley Supercluster. This system includes three clusters, A3528 (composed itself by two sub-clusters, namely A3528N and A3528S), A3532 and A3530, and presents a mildly active dynamical state. We study how minor mergers affect the evolution of radio galaxies and whether they are able to re-accelerate relativistic electrons in the ICM. We used observations from the uGMRT (Band 3, 4 and 5) and MeerKAT (L-band) telescopes to obtain images and spectral index maps over a wide frequency band and spatial resolutions. We compare these data with those from the SRG/eROSITA X-ray telescope. We detect faint diffuse radio emission associated with the radio galaxies. The BCGs in A3528S and A3532 show filaments of diffuse radio emission which extend for $\sim200-400$ kpc out of the radio galaxy. The spectral index of these filaments is extremely steep and almost constant ($\alpha\sim -2, -2.5$). Contrary to the radio tails in A3528N, the spectral properties of these radio filaments are not consistent with standard models of plasma ageing. We also detect roundish diffuse radio emission around the BCG in A3528S which could be classified as a radio mini-halo. The radio tail in this cluster appears longer that in earlier detections, being $\sim300$ kpc long at all frequencies. We linked the presence of extended radio emission in the form of filaments and threads in the A3528 complex with the effect of minor mergers. This is reinforced by the increasing X-ray fluctuations in correspondence with the radio extended emission in A3528S. Despite the less energy involved, our findings support the hypothesis that these events can re-energise plasma originating from radio galaxies.</description>

Abstract: We study the statistics and properties of microlensing events that can be detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite(TESS) based on Monte Carlo simulations. We simulate potential microlensing events from a sample of the TESS Candidate Target List(CTL) stars by assuming different observational time spans(or different numbers of sectors for each star) and a wide range of lens masses, i.e., $M_{\rm l}\in [0.1M_{\oplus},~2 M_{\odot}]$. On average, the microlensing optical depth and the event rate for CTL stars are $\simeq 0.2\times 10^{-9}$, and $\Gamma_{\rm{TESS}}\simeq0.6\times10^{-9}$ per star per day, respectively. The microlensing optical depth decreases by increasing the CTL priority, whereas the efficiency for detecting their microlensing signals enhances with the priority. Additionally, we simulate the microlensing events from the TESS Full-Frame Images(FFIs) stars extracted from the \texttt{TESS}-\texttt{SPOC} pipeline. The optical depth and event rate for these stars are on average $\simeq 1$-$3\times 10^{-9}$, and $\Gamma_{\rm{TESS}}\simeq 1$-$4\times 10^{-9}$ per star per day, and their highest values occur for sector $12$. The total number of microlensing events for the CTL stars is $N_{\rm e, \rm{tot}}\sim0.03$, whereas for the FFIs' stars number of events per star during $27.4$-day observing windows is $\hat{N}_{\rm e, \rm{tot}}\simeq1.4 \times 10^{-6}$. Based on four criteria we extract the detectable microlensing events and evaluate the detection efficiencies. The highest efficiency for detecting microlensing events from the TESS data occurs for the lens mass $\log_{10}[M_{\rm l}(M_{\odot})] \in [-4.5$,~$-2.5]$, i.e., super-Earth to Jupiter-mass Free Floating Planets(FFPs). The detectable microlensing events from the TESS stars are significantly affected by both finite-source and parallax effects.</description>

      <title>XRISM Spectroscopy of the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ Emission Line in the Seyfert AGN NGC 4151 Reveals the Disk, Broad Line Region, and Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the first two XRISM/Resolve spectra of the well-known Seyfert-1.5 active galactic nucleus in NGC 4151, obtained in December 2023. Our work focuses on the nature of the narrow Fe K$_{\alpha}$ emission line at 6.4 keV, the strongest and most common X-ray line observed in AGN. The total line is found to consist of three components. Even the narrowest component of the line is resolved with evident Fe K$_{\alpha,1}$ (6.404 keV) and K$_{\alpha,2}$ (6.391 keV) contributions in a 2:1 flux ratio, fully consistent with neutral gas with negligible bulk velocity. Subject to the limitations of our models, the narrowest and intermediate-width components are consistent with emission from optically thin gas, suggesting that they arise in a disk atmosphere and/or wind. Modeling the three line components in terms of Keplerian broadening, they are readily associated with (1) the inner wall of the ``torus,'' (2) the innermost optical ``broad line region'' (or, ``X-ray BLR''), and (3) a region with a radius of $r\simeq 100~GM/c^{2}$ that may signal a warp in the accretion disk. Viable alternative explanations of the broadest component include a fast wind component and/or scattering; however, we find evidence of variability in the narrow Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line complex on time scales consistent with small radii. The best-fit models are statistically superior to simple Voigt functions, but when fit with Voigt profiles the time-averaged lines are consistent with a projected velocity broadening of FWHM$=1600^{+400}_{-200}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$. Overall, the resolution and sensitivity of XRISM show that the narrow Fe K line in AGN is an effective probe of all key parts of the accretion flow, as it is currently understood. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of AGN accretion, future studies with XRISM, and X-ray-based black hole mass measurements.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 118 New Ultracool Dwarf Candidates Using Machine Learning Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 118 new ultracool dwarf candidates, discovered using a new machine learning tool, named \texttt{SMDET}, applied to time series images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We gathered photometric and astrometric data to estimate each candidate's spectral type, distance, and tangential velocity. This sample has a photometrically estimated spectral class distribution of 28 M dwarfs, 64 L dwarfs, and 18 T dwarfs. We also identify a T subdwarf candidate, two extreme T subdwarf candidates, and two candidate young ultracool dwarfs. Five objects did not have enough photometric data for any estimations to be made. To validate our estimated spectral types, spectra were collected for 2 objects, yielding confirmed spectral types of T5 (estimated T5) and T3 (estimated T4). Demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning tools as a new large-scale discovery technique.</description>

      <title>Effects of Bursty Star Formation on [CII] Line Intensity Mapping of High-redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bursty star formation -- a key prediction for high-redshift galaxies from cosmological simulations explicitly resolving stellar feedback in the interstellar medium -- has recently been observed to prevail among galaxies at redshift $z \gtrsim 6$. Line intensity mapping (LIM) of the 158 $\mu$m [CII] line as a star formation rate (SFR) indicator offers unique opportunities to tomographically constrain cosmic star formation at high redshift, in a way complementary to observations of individually detected galaxies. To understand effects of bursty star formation on [CII] LIM, which remain unexplored in previous studies, we present an analytic modeling framework for high-$z$ galaxy formation and [CII] LIM signals that accounts for bursty star formation histories induced by delayed supernova feedback. We use it to explore and characterize how bursty star formation can impact and thus complicate the interpretation of the [CII] luminosity function and power spectrum. Our simple analytic model indicates that bursty star formation mainly affects low-mass galaxies by boosting their average SFR and [CII] luminosity, and in the [CII] power spectrum it can create a substantial excess in the large-scale clustering term. This distortion results in a power spectrum shape which cannot be explained by invoking a mass-independent logarithmic scatter. We conclude that burstiness must be accounted for when modeling and analyzing [CII] datasets from the early universe, and that in the extreme, the signature of burstiness may be detectable with first-generation experiments such as TIME, CONCERTO, and CCAT-DSS.</description>

      <title>JWST PRIMER: A new multi-field determination of the evolving galaxy UV luminosity function at redshifts $\mathbf{z \simeq 9-15}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new determination of the evolving galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) over the redshift range $8.5&lt;z&lt;15.5$ using a combination of several major Cycle-1 JWST imaging programmes - PRIMER, JADES and NGDEEP. This multi-field approach yields a total of $\simeq370$ sq. arcmin of JWST/NIRCam imaging, reaching (5-$\sigma$) depths of $\simeq30$ AB mag in the deepest regions. We select a sample of 2548 galaxies with a significant probability of lying at high redshift ($p(z&gt;8.5)&gt;0.05$) to undertake a statistical calculation of the UV LF. Our new measurements span $\simeq4$ magnitudes in UV luminosity at $z=9-12.5$, placing new constraints on both the shape and evolution of the LF at early times. Our measurements yield a new estimate of the early evolution of cosmic star-formation rate density ($\rho_{\rm{SFR}}$) confirming the gradual decline deduced from early JWST studies, at least out to $z \simeq 12$. Finally we show that the observed early evolution of the galaxy UV LF (and $\rho_{\rm{SFR}}$) can be reproduced in a ${\rm \Lambda}$CDM Universe, with no change in dust properties or star-formation efficiency required out to $z \simeq 12$. Instead, a progressive trend towards younger stellar population ages can reproduce the observations, and the typical ages required at $z \simeq$ 8, 9, 10, and 11 all converge on $\simeq 380-330$ Myr after the Big Bang, indicative of a rapid emergence of early galaxies at $z \simeq 12 - 13$. This is consistent with the first indications of a steeper drop-off in $\rho_{\rm{SFR}}$ we find beyond $z \simeq 13$, possibly reflecting the rapid evolution of the halo mass function at earlier times.</description>

      <title>Balmer Decrement Anomalies in Galaxies at z ~ 6 Found by JWST Observations: Density-Bounded Nebulae or Excited H I Clouds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the physical origins of the Balmer decrement anomalies in GS-NDG-9422 (Cameron et al. 2023) and RXCJ2248-ID (Topping et al. 2024) galaxies at $z\sim 6$ whose $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta$ values are significantly smaller than $2.7$, the latter of which also shows anomalous $\mathrm{H}\gamma/\mathrm{H}\beta$ and $\mathrm{H}\delta/\mathrm{H}\beta$ values beyond the errors. Because the anomalous Balmer decrements are not reproduced under the Case B recombination, we explore the nebulae with the optical depths smaller and larger than the Case B recombination by physical modeling. We find two cases quantitatively explaining the anomalies; 1) density-bounded nebulae that are opaque only up to around Ly$\gamma$-Ly8 transitions and 2) ionization-bounded nebulae partly/fully surrounded by optically-thick excited H{\sc i} clouds. The case of 1) produces more H$\beta$ photons via Ly$\gamma$ absorption in the nebulae, requiring fine tuning in optical depth values, while this case helps ionizing photon escape for cosmic reionization. The case of 2) needs the optically-thick excited H{\sc i} clouds with $N_2\simeq 10^{12}-10^{13}$ $\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, where $N_2$ is the column density of the hydrogen atom with the principal quantum number of $n=2$. Interestingly, the high $N_2$ values qualitatively agree with the recent claims for GS-NDG-9422 with the strong nebular continuum requiring a number of $2s$-state electrons and for RXCJ2248-ID with the dense ionized regions likely coexisting with the optically-thick clouds. While the physical origin of the optically-thick excited H{\sc i} clouds is unclear, these results may suggest gas clouds with excessive collisional excitation caused by an amount of accretion and supernovae in the high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>Strong He I Emission Lines in High N/O Galaxies at $z \sim 6$ Identified in JWST Spectra: High He/H Abundance Ratios or High Electron Densities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present HeI/H$\beta$-flux and He/H-abundance ratios in three JWST galaxies with significant constraints on N/O-abundance ratios, GS-NDG-9422, RXCJ2248-ID, and GLASS150008 at $z\sim 6$ mostly with the spectroscopic coverage from HeI$\lambda$4471 and HeII$\lambda$4686 to HeI$\lambda$7065, comparing with 68 local-dwarf galaxies. We find that these high-$z$ galaxies present strong HeI emission with HeI/H$\beta$ flux ratios generally larger than those of local-dwarf galaxies. We derive He/H with all of the detected HeI, HeII, and $2-3$ hydrogen Balmer lines in the same manner as the local He/H determination conducted for cosmology studies. These high-$z$ galaxies show He overabundance He/H$\gtrsim 0.10$ or high electron density $n_\mathrm{e}\sim 10^{3-4}$ cm$^{-3}$ much larger than local values at low O/H, $12+\log \mathrm{(O/H)}=7-8$. In contrast, we obtain low He/H and $n_\mathrm{e}$ values for our local-dwarf galaxies by the same technique with the same helium and hydrogen lines, and confirm that the difference between the high-$z$ and local-dwarf galaxies are not mimicked by systematics. While two scenarios of 1) He overabundance and 2) high electron density are not clearly concluded, we find that there is a positive correlation on the He/H-N/O or $n_\mathrm{e}$-N/O plane by the comparison of the high-$z$ and local-dwarf galaxies. The scenario 1) suggests that the overabundant helium and nitrogen are not explained by the standard chemical enrichment of core-collapse supernovae, but the CNO-cycle products and equilibrium ratios, respectively. The scenario 2) indicates that the strong helium lines are originated from the central dense clouds of the high-$z$ galaxies by excessive collisional excitation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of MgS and NaS in the Interstellar Medium and tentative detection of CaO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first detection of the metal-bearing molecules sodium sulfide (NaS) and magnesium sulfide (MgS) and the tentative detection of calcium monoxide (CaO) in the interstellar medium (ISM) towards the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The derived column densities are (5.0+-1.1) x 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, (6.0+-0.6) x $^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (2.0+-0.5) x $^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. This translates into fractional abundances with respect to H$_2$ of (3.7+-1.0) x $10^{-13}$, (4.4+-0.8) x $10^{-13}$, and (1.5+-0.4) x $10^{-13}$, respectively. We have also searched for other Na-, Mg- and Ca-bearing species towards this source but none of them have been detected and thus we provide upper limits for their abundances. We discuss the possible chemical routes involved in the formation of these molecules containing metals under interstellar conditions. Finally, we compare the ratio between sulfur-bearing and oxygen-bearing molecules with and without metals, finding that metal-bearing sulfur molecules are much more abundant than metal-bearing oxygen ones, in contrast with the general trend found in the ratios between other non metal- oxygen- and sulfur-bearing molecules. This further strengthen the idea that sulfur may be little depleted in G+0.693-0.027 as a result of the low velocity shocks present in this source sputtering large amounts of material from dust grains.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the central mass contents of Omega Centauri from combined stellar kinematics and pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a combined analysis of stellar kinematics and line-of-sight accelerations of millisecond pulsars to investigate the mass contents of Omega Centauri. We consider multiple mass components: the visible photometric distribution, a central cluster of dark remnants, an intermediate-mass black hole, and a distribution of intermediate extension traced by the pulsars. By self-consistently incorporating multiple independent datasets, including the effects of different centers, we obtain significant constraints on these mass distributions. Our results strongly favor an extended central mass of ~ 2 - 3 x 10^5 Msun, emulating a cluster of heavy stellar remnants, over an IMBH, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 6 x 10^3 Msun on its mass. Pulsar timing observations provide significant constraints, favoring a central mass distribution that is ~ 20% more massive and extended. Notably, we observe a clear linear scaling between the pulsar distribution and stellar encounter rates, showing excellent agreement with the expectation from millisecond pulsar formation models and motivating a profile for their distribution, providing the first validation of its kind where positions are linked to their place of formation in globular clusters. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of this novel methodology in exploring the structure of star clusters, setting a promising precedent amid the advent of the rapidly growing number of observations and discoveries currently being experienced in this field.</description>

      <title>Galactic Gas Models Strongly Affect the Determination of the Diffusive Halo Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The height of the Milky Way diffusion halo, above which cosmic-rays can freely escape the galaxy, is among the most critical, yet poorly known, parameters in cosmic-ray physics. Measurements of radioactive secondaries, such as $^{10}$Be or $^{26}$Al, which decay equivalently throughout the diffusive volume, are expected to provide the strongest constraints. This has motivated significant observational work to constrain their isotopic ratios, along with theoretical work to constrain the cross-section uncertainties that are thought to dominate radioactive secondary fluxes. In this work, we show that the imprecise modelling of the Milky Way spiral arms significantly affects our ability to translate $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al fluxes into constraints on the diffusive halo height, biasing our current results. Utilizing state-of-the-art spiral arms models we produce new predictions for the $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al fluxes that motivate upcoming measurements by AMS-02 and HELIX.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Echoes of Ambiguous Nuclear Transients Reveal High Dust Covering Fractions: Evidence for Dusty Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alongside the recent increase in discoveries of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have come an increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs). These ANTs are characterized by hot blackbody-like UV/optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and smooth photometric evolution, often with hard powerlaw-like X-ray emission. ANTs are likely exotic TDEs or smooth flares originating in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While their emission in the UV/optical and X-ray has been relatively well-explored, their infrared (IR) emission has not been studied in detail. Here we use the NEOWISE mission and its low-cadence mapping of the entire sky to study mid-infrared dust reprocessing echoes of ANTs. We study 19 ANTs, finding significant MIR flares in 18 objects for which we can estimate an IR luminosity and temperature evolution. The dust reprocessing echoes show a wide range in IR luminosities ($\sim10^{42} - 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) with blackbody temperatures largely consistent with sublimation temperature of graphite grains. Excluding the two sources possibly associated with luminous supernovae (ASASSN-15lh and ASASSN-17jz), the dust covering fractions (f$_c$) for detected IR flares lie between 0.05 and 0.91, with a mean of f$_c$ = 0.29 for all ANTs (including limits) and f$_c$ = $0.38 \pm 0.04$ for detections. These covering fractions are much higher than optically-selected TDEs and similar to AGNs. We interpret the high covering fractions in ANT host galaxies as evidence for the presence of a dusty torus.</description>

Abstract: We performed numerical simulations of the common envelope (CE) interaction between thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of 1.7~\Msun and 3.7~\Msun, respectively, and a 0.6~\Msun compact companion. We use tabulated equations of state to take into account recombination energy. For the first time, formation and growth of dust is calculated explicitly, using a carbon dust nucleation network with a C/O abundance ratio of 2.5 (by number). The first dust grains appear within $\sim$1--3~yrs after the onset of the CE, forming an optically thick shell at $\sim$10--20~au, growing in thickness and radius to values of $\sim$400--500~au over $\sim$40~yrs, with temperatures around 400~K. Most dust is formed in unbound material, having little effect on mass ejection or orbital evolution. By the end of the simulations, the total dust yield is $\sim8.4\times10^{-3}$~\Msun and $\sim2.2\times10^{-2}$~\Msun for the CE with a 1.7~\Msun and a 3.7~\Msun AGB star, respectively, corresponding to a nucleation efficiency close to 100\%, if no dust destruction mechanism is considered. Despite comparable dust yields to single AGB stars, \textit{in CE ejections the dust forms a thousand times faster, over tens of years as opposed to tens of thousands of years}. This rapid dust formation may account for the shift in the infrared of the spectral energy distribution of some optical transients known as luminous red novae. Simulated dusty CEs support the idea that extreme carbon stars and "water fountains" may be objects observed after a CE event.</description>

      <title>Weighing Milky Way and Andromeda in an expanding $\Lambda$CDM Universe: Decreasing the Local Group mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the Local Group (LG), especially the contribution of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies, is sensitive to the presence of dark energy. This work analyzes the evolution of the LG by considering it as a two-body problem in a homogeneous and isotropic expanding spacetime in a full $\Lambda$ cold dark matter $(\Lambda$CDM) background. Using the timing argument (TA), which links LG dynamics to LG mass, we find that the complete $\Lambda$CDM background predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ lower mass for the LG; while $\Lambda$ alone predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ higher mass. The TA mass is modified by (i) simulations and (ii) the effect of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to alleviate the poorly constrained internal mass distributions of M31 and the MW, their time evolution, and the unknown distribution of dark matter between them. First, using IllustrisTNG simulations, we accounted for the effects of two extended halos and their environment (rather than point particles) and predicted their mass $\left(3.89 \pm 0.62\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. Second, the LMC effectively changes the separation and velocities of M31 toward the MW and reduces the predicted mass to $\left(2.33 \pm 0.72\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_\odot$. Despite the uncertainties around dark matter between these galaxies, the overall estimated mass is compatible with the mere sum of the MW and M31 masses. The total mass of the TA is compatible with other estimates, such as the Hubble flow and the Virial Theorem with other dwarf galaxies. The combined result shows, for the first time, that a lower mass estimate can be obtained from the TA, with a consistent embedding and other systematic effects, and without an additional dark matter halo around the galaxies.</description>

      <title>The fast transient AT 2023clx in the nearby LINER galaxy NGC 3799 as a tidal disruption of a very low-mass star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extensive analysis of the optical and UV properties of AT2023clx, the closest TDE to date, that occurred in the nucleus of the interacting LINER galaxy, NGC3799 (z=0.01107). After correcting for the host reddening (E(B-V) = 0.179 mag), we find its peak absolute g-band magnitude to be -18.03{+/-}0.07 mag, and its peak bolometric luminosity to be L=(1.57{+/-}0.19)x10^43 erg/s. AT2023clx displays several distinctive features: first, it rose to peak within 10.4{+/-}2.5 days, making it the fastest rising TDE to date. Our SMBH mass estimate of M_BH ~ 10^6 Msol rules out the possibility of an intermediate-mass BH as the reason for the fast rise. Dense spectral follow-up reveals a blue continuum that cools slowly and broad Balmer and HeII lines as well as weak HeI 5876,6678 emission features that are typically seen in TDEs. The early, broad (width ~ 15000 km/s) profile of Ha matches theoretical expectations from an optically thick outflow. A flat Balmer decrement (~ 1.58) suggests that the lines are collisionally excited rather than being produced via photoionisation, in contrast to typical active galactic nuclei. A second distinctive feature, seen for the first time in TDE spectra, is a sharp, narrow emission peak at a rest wavelength of ~ 6353 A. This feature is clearly visible up to 10d post-peak; we attribute it to clumpy material preceding the bulk outflow, which manifests as a high-velocity component of Ha (-9584 km/s). Its third distinctive feature is the rapid cooling during the first ~ 20 days after peak, reflected as a break in the temperature evolution. Combining these findings, we propose a scenario for AT2023clx involving the disruption of a very low-mass star (&lt;=0.1 Msol) with an outflow launched in our line of sight and with disruption properties that led to efficient circularisation and prompt accretion disc formation, observed through a low-density photosphere.</description>

      <title>High-redshift, small-scale tests of ultralight axion dark matter using Hubble and Webb galaxy UV luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11071v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We set limits on axion DM using both Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) data. We exclude a single axion as all the DM for $m_{ax} &lt; 10^{-21.6}$ eV and limit axions with $-26 &lt; \log( m_{ax}/{eV}) &lt; -23$ to be less than $22\%$ of the DM (both limits at $95\%$ credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that probe small-scale structure at redshifts $4 &lt; z &lt; 10$. We marginalize over a parametric model that connects halo mass and UV luminosity that has been shown to match hydrodynamical simulations. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and DM fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale CMB and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. These high-$z$ measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-$z$ tests of axion DM, which include the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed high-$z$ galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these data are consistent with the HST UVLF assuming $\Lambda$CDM and our flexible parametric model of UV luminosity. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results significantly. We also find an excess of low-mass halos ($&lt; 10^9 M_\odot$) at $z &lt; 3$, which could be probed by sub-galactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies and strong lensing).</description>

      <title>General non-linear fragmentation with discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dust grains play a significant role in several astrophysical processes, including gas/dust dynamics, chemical reactions, and radiative transfer. Replenishment of small-grain populations is mainly governed by fragmentation during pair-wise collisions between grains. The wide spectrum of fragmentation outcomes, from complete disruption to erosion and/or mass transfer, can be modelled by the general non-linear fragmentation equation. Efficiently solving this equation is crucial for an accurate treatment of the dust fragmentation in numerical modelling. However, similar to dust coagulation, numerical errors in current fragmentation algorithms employed in astrophysics are dominated by the numerical over-diffusion problem -- particularly in 3D hydrodynamic simulations where the discrete resolution of the mass density distribution tends to be highly limited. With this in mind, we have derived the first conservative form of the general non-linear fragmentation with a mass flux highlighting the mass transfer phenomenon. Then, to address cases of limited mass density resolution, we applied a high-order discontinuous Galerkin scheme to efficiently solve the conservative fragmentation equation with a reduced number of dust bins. An accuracy of 0.1 -1% is reached with 20 dust bins spanning a mass range of 9 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Protostellar spin-up and fast rotator formation through binary star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Edited) Many fast rotator stars (rotation periods of &lt; 2 days) are found in unresolved binaries with separations of tens of au. This correlation leads to the question of whether the formation of binary stars inherently produces fast rotators. We aim to understand whether the formation of companions plays a role in spinning up stars. We use magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation of multiple star systems from turbulent and non-turbulent protostellar cores. We track the angular momentum accreted by individual star and inner disc systems by using a sink particle technique. We run a resolution study to extrapolate protostellar properties. We find in all simulations that the primary star can experience spin-up events that are correlated with the formation of companions. The primary star can spin up by up to 84% of its pre-fragmentation angular momentum and by up to 18% of its pre-fragmentation mass-specific angular momentum. The mechanism for the spin-up is gravitational disc instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star, leading to the accretion of material with high specific angular momentum. The simulations that experience the strongest disc instabilities fragment to form companions. Simulations with weaker spin-up events experience disc instabilities triggered by a companion flyby, and the disc instability in these cases does not produce further fragments. We conclude that the primary star in multiple star systems may end up with a higher spin than single stars. This is because gravitational instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star can trigger a spin-up event. In the strongest spin-up events, the instability is likely to cause disc fragmentation and the formation of companions. This companion formation coupled with shorter disc lifetimes, because the companion truncates the circumstellar disc, can help produce fast rotators.</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Acceleration of PSR J2043+1711: Long-Period Orbital Companion or Stellar Flyby?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the rate of change of its orbital period, PSR J2043+1711 has a substantial peculiar acceleration of 3.5 $\pm$ 0.8 mm/s/yr, which deviates from the acceleration predicted by equilibrium Milky Way models at a $4\sigma$ level. The magnitude of the peculiar acceleration is too large to be explained by disequilibrium effects of the Milky Way interacting with orbiting dwarf galaxies ($\sim$1 mm/s/yr), and too small to be caused by period variations due to the pulsar being a redback. We identify and examine two plausible causes for the anomalous acceleration: a stellar flyby, and a long-period orbital companion. We identify a main-sequence star in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and Pan-STARRS DR2 with the correct mass, distance, and on-sky position to potentially explain the observed peculiar acceleration. However, the star and the pulsar system have substantially different proper motions, indicating that they are not gravitationally bound. However, it is possible that this is an unrelated star that just happens to be located near J2043+1711 along our line of sight (chance probability of 1.6\%). Therefore, we also constrain possible orbital parameters for a circumbinary companion in a hierarchical triple system with J2043+1711; the changes in the spindown rate of the pulsar are consistent with an outer object that has an orbital period of 80 kyr, a companion mass of 0.3 $M_\odot$ (indicative of a white dwarf or low-mass star), and a semi-major axis of 2000 AU. Continued timing and/or future faint optical observations of J2043+1711 may eventually allow us to differentiate between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Testing the sources of the peculiar abundances in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to analyze some of the polluters proposed in the self-enrichment scenarios put forward to explain the multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs), extending previous studies. Three scenarios with different polluter stars were tested: asymptotic giant branch stars, high-mass interacting binaries, and fast rotating massive stars. With abundance data available from the APOGEE survey and $\Delta Y$ estimates from precise HST photometry, twenty-six clusters were studied. We also included the study of the abundances of N, C, Mg and Al, extending previous studies that focused mainly on the abundances of He, O and Na. In addition, we constructed an empirical model to test whether one could explain the chemical signatures of the 'enriched' population of GC stars with a fixed source and dilution process based on empirical data. In agreement with work by other authors, we found that the proposed polluters can generally predict the qualitative abundance patterns in GC stars and in some cases quantitatively predict some elements, but in most cases when we compare the model yields with the observations, we find that they can not explain the entire set of observed abundance patterns. The empirical model succeeds in reproducing the abundances of Al for a given $\Delta Y$ (and vice versa), showing that there is a direct relationship between Al and He, with one increasing proportionally to the other. However, the empirical model fails to reproduce the observed abundances of Na and N, in agreement with the results of previous works. The observed decoupling between the maximum abundances of CNO-cycle elements like N and Na with those of Al and He provides new information and constraints for future models and could take us a step closer to understanding the origin of the peculiar abundance variations of globular cluster stars.</description>
