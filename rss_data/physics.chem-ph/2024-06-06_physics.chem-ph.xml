      <title>Photodesorption efficiency of OH radical on the ice surface in the wavelength range from ultraviolet to visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photodesorption efficiencies of the hydroxyl (OH) radical from the water ice surface were measured in the range of 310-700 nm for the first time. Although isolated H$_2$O molecules and OH radicals do not absorb visible photons, the photodesorption of OH interacting with the ice surface was found to occur by a one-photon process in the entire visible range. The photodesorption efficiency strongly depended on the wavelength, and the analyses of photodesorption cross sections indicated that only strongly bound OH radicals were desorbed at longer wavelengths, whereas both weakly and strongly bound OH radicals were desorbed at shorter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Molecules Interacting with Metal Surfaces: Extending the Hierarchical Equations of Motion and Langevin Dynamics Approach to Position-Dependent Metal-Molecule Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic friction and Langevin dynamics is a popular mixed quantum-classical method for simulating the nonadiabatic dynamics of molecules interacting with metal surfaces, as it can be computationally more efficient than fully quantum approaches. Previous approaches to calculating the electronic friction and other forces, however, have been limited to either noninteracting molecular models or position-independent metal-molecule couplings. In this work, we extend the theory of electronic friction within the hierarchical equations of motion formalism to models with a position-dependent metal-molecule coupling. We show that the addition of a position-dependent metal-molecule coupling adds new contributions to the electronic friction and other forces, which are highly relevant for many physical processes. Our expressions for the electronic forces within the Langevin equation are valid both in and out of equilibrium and for molecular models containing strong interactions. We demonstrate the approach by applying it to different models of interest.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic fragments in periodic solids: Eliminating the need for supercells and background charges in electronic structure calculations of defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, computational methods for modeling defects (vacancies, adsorbates, etc.) rely on periodic supercells in which the defect is far enough from its repeated image such that they can be assumed non-interacting. Defects in real solids, however, can be spaced microns or more apart, whereas affordable supercells for density functional theory calculations are no wider than a few nanometers. The relative proximity and periodic repetition of the defect's images may lead to unphysical artifacts, especially if the defect is charged and/or open-shell. Furthermore, to avoid divergence of the periodic electrostatics, a compensating background charge must be introduced if the defect is charged. Even if post-hoc corrections are used, this is a source of unquantifiable error and, in some cases, renders energies useless. In this communication, we introduce an embedding formalism such that a pristine, primitive unit cell may be used for the periodic mean field, after which atoms may be moved or charged within an embedded fragment. This fragment can then be treated with a post-Hartree Fock method to capture important electron correlations pertaining to the defect. By eliminating the need for compensating background charges and periodicity of the defect, we circumvent all associated unphysicalities and numerical issues. Furthermore, the primitive cell calculations drastically reduce computational expense compared to supercell approaches. This method is size-intensive with respect to energy differences and can be routinely applied even to multireference defects, localized excited states, etc. using a variety of fragment solvers. In examining with this approach bond-breaking in a fluorine-substituted graphane monolayer, a difficult testing ground for condensed-phase electronic structure methods, we observe key aspects of the dissociation pathway, specifically a covalent-to-ionic avoided crossing.</description>

      <title>Changes in boiling controlled by molar concentration-dependent diffusion of surfactants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boiling is a prevalent phase-change process that plays a vital role in facilitating efficient heat transfer from a heating surface. While this heat transfer mechanism is generally effective, a rapid increase in surface temperature can lead to hydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in a boiling crisis. Previous studies have shown that surfactants often improve boiling performance and change the boiling crisis behavior. Conventional wisdom in this field attributes that these changes in boiling behavior are tied to the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the particular surfactant. However, our work reveals that these changes in boiling behavior are independent of the CMC for three nonionic surfactants across a wide range of molar concentrations. In addition, visual snapshots of the bubbling behavior indicate changes in bubble formation, such as bubble size and nucleation site density, influenced by the molar concentration-dependent diffusion timescale of surfactants. Hence, these findings offer compelling evidence that boiling behavior, encompassing both boiling performance and boiling crisis, is governed by the dynamic adsorption of surfactants rather than dictated by the CMC. This becomes evident when quantifying the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF) using the logarithm of molar concentration, as predicted by theory. Building upon these findings, we propose insights for controlling when CHF modification occurs in specific scenarios involving any surfactants. These insights hold significant potential for optimizing heat transfer processes and leveraging surfactants in energy-related applications to maximize boiling efficiency.</description>

      <title>Theory and Modeling of Transport in Nanoporous Materials: From Microscopic to Coarse-Grained Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review presents the state of the art on the theory, molecular simulation, and coarse-grained strategies applied to the transport of gases and liquids in nanoporous materials (pore size in the range 1 - 100 nm). Recent advances in the understanding of molecular diffusion and transport under thermodynamic gradients in nanoporous adsorbents are discussed with special emphasis on small molecules in zeolites, active carbons, metal organic frameworks, but also in nanoporous materials with larger pores such as ordered and disordered mesoporous oxides. We provide a description of the fundamentals and principles of the different atom-scale and mesoscopic methods as well as of the theoretical formalisms that can be used to address such an important problem. Special attention is paid to the investigation of different molecular transport coefficients - including the so-called self, collective and transport diffusivities - but also to the determination of free energy barriers and their role in overall adsorption/separation process rates. We also introduce other available approaches such as hierarchical simulations and upscaling strategies.</description>

      <title>Using GNN property predictors as molecule generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools to accurately predict materials and molecular properties in computational discovery pipelines. In this article, we exploit the invertible nature of these neural networks to directly generate molecular structures with desired electronic properties. Starting from a random graph or an existing molecule, we perform a gradient ascent while holding the GNN weights fixed in order to optimize its input, the molecular graph, towards the target property. Valence rules are enforced strictly through a judicious graph construction. The method relies entirely on the property predictor; no additional training is required on molecular structures. We demonstrate the application of this method by generating molecules with specific DFT-verified energy gaps and octanol-water partition coefficients (logP). Our approach hits target properties with rates comparable to or better than state-of-the-art generative models while consistently generating more diverse molecules.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Metholodgy Shows Molecular Interactions Protect 2D Polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce stochastic techniques that enable the simulations of polaritons resulting from placing giant 2D molecular aggregate crystals with $10^8$ interacting excitonic dyes in realistic multi-mode cavities. We show that the intermolecular coupling protects the formation of polariton states in the face of strong molecular disorder due to persistent delocalization of the dark molecular states. This demonstrates the nontrivial role of internal aggregate Hamiltonian in polariton properties, and the new computational method opens horizons for stochastic simulations of related systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular integral equations theory in the near critical region of CO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14667v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental concerns are driving the search for greener yet efficient solvents. Supercritical CO2 (scCO2) is a promising candidate due to its non-toxicity and the potential for reusing CO2 emissions. It also offers a versatile range of properties that can be finely tuned by pressure adjustments. This adaptability is exploited in chemical industry processes such as separation or extraction. The development of new green processes using scCO2 requires an efficient tool for predicting the solvation properties under different conditions. Existing parametric equations for solubility prediction depend on known experimental data, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain expensive for studying different conditions. Both methods are unsuitable for advancing new technologies. The molecular density functional theory (MDFT) offers a promising alternative, combining an accurate microscopic modeling with fast calculations. MDFT necessitates the bulk direct correlation functions, which can be calculated from expensive MD simulations or from approximate yet rapid molecular integral equations. The development of MDFT as a powerful tool to study the solvation in scCO2 will require the construction of an accurate molecular integral equations for scCO2.This paper presents the exact direct correlation functions of scCO2 obtained from MD and compares them with the results of the simplest molecular integral equations, the hypernetted chain approximation (HNC). If HNC fails to provide correct long-range correlations and thermodynamics, it succeeds in reproducing the short-range structure. By using the direct correlation functions obtained from MD and HNC, we demonstrate the efficacy of MDFT in calculating the chemical potential of CO2 in scCO2. The results open the door to the application of MDFT to a wider range of solutes dissolved in scCO2 with different thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Predicting The One-Particle Density Matrix With Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two of the most widely used electronic structure theory methods, namely Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham density functional theory, both requires the iterative solution of a set of Schr\"odinger-like equations. The speed of convergence of such self-consistent field process depends on the complexity of the system under investigation and on the initial guess for the density matrix. An initial density matrix close to the ground-state one will effectively allow one to cut out many of the self-consistent steps necessary to achieve convergence. Here, we predict the density matrix of Kohn-Sham density functional theory by constructing a neural network, which uses the atomic positions as only information. Such neural network provides an initial guess for the density matrix far superior to any other recipes available, in particular for molecules with metallic bonds. Furthermore, the quality of such neural-network density matrix is good enough for the evaluation of interatomic forces. This allows us to run accelerated {\it ab-initio} molecular dynamics with little to no self-consistent steps.</description>

Abstract: The application of deep learning techniques on aroma-chemicals has resulted in models more accurate than human experts at predicting olfactory qualities. However, public research in this domain has been limited to predicting the qualities of single molecules, whereas in industry applications, perfumers and food scientists are often concerned with blends of many molecules. In this paper, we apply both existing and novel approaches to a dataset we gathered consisting of labeled pairs of molecules. We present graph neural network models capable of accurately predicting the odor qualities arising from blends of aroma-chemicals, with an analysis of how variations in architecture can lead to significant differences in predictive power.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistency Training for Density-Functional-Theory Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the mean-field Hamiltonian matrix in density functional theory is a fundamental formulation to leverage machine learning for solving molecular science problems. Yet, its applicability is limited by insufficient labeled data for training. In this work, we highlight that Hamiltonian prediction possesses a self-consistency principle, based on which we propose self-consistency training, an exact training method that does not require labeled data. It distinguishes the task from predicting other molecular properties by the following benefits: (1) it enables the model to be trained on a large amount of unlabeled data, hence addresses the data scarcity challenge and enhances generalization; (2) it is more efficient than running DFT to generate labels for supervised training, since it amortizes DFT calculation over a set of queries. We empirically demonstrate the better generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios, and the better efficiency over DFT labeling. These benefits push forward the applicability of Hamiltonian prediction to an ever-larger scale.</description>
