      <title>HD 144812: A transition-phase massive star in a binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we shed light on the evolutionary phase of HD 144812, a Galactic yellow supergiant showing infrared excess that is typically expected for evolved stars undergoing enhanced mass-loss activity. We present high-resolution spectroscopy of the star in the $H-$ and $K-$band acquired with the GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) and further explore multi-band imaging of the wider field of view from the ultraviolet to the radio regime. The IGRINS data reveal several lines from the hydrogen series and iron in a double-peaked emission and we here suggest, that HD 144812 is orbited by a disk-hosting companion. Furthermore, we report emission in the CO band heads of the star that is modeled to arise from a circum-stellar/binary disk (or ring) of ejected gas. The latter consists of material that is expected to have been dredged up from the core of the star to its surface during a prior phase as a red supergiant (RSG). These findings together suggest that HD 144812 is a rare, post-RSG star in a binary system, encouraging further investigation on the effect that the stellar encounters have on triggering instabilities and driving the evolution of the primary star shortly prior to the supernova event.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Stars II: Revisiting Bolometric Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development line of bolometric corrections within the brief history of photometry was described from the perspective of the Kuhnian philosophy of science. The luminous efficiency and heat index were two previous concepts to imply visual and bolometric brightness difference of a star, which was mainly suggested and used as auxiliary tools for calibrating stellar temperature scales before the term ``bolometric correction'' (BC) was also introduced for the same purpose by Kuiper in 1938, as $BC = M_{\rm bol} - M_{\rm V} = m_{\rm {bol}} - V$. Despite its ill-posed nature imposing no zero-point constant ($C_2=0$) for the BC scale and $L_{\rm V} = L \times 10^{BC/2.5}$, if $BC&gt;0$, $L_{\rm V}$ is unphysical, for the luminosity of a star from which ``BC of a star must always be negative,'' ``the bolometric magnitude of a star ought to be brighter than its $V$-magnitude,'' and ``the zero point of bolometric corrections are arbitrary'' (paradigms) were extracted. The newest of the first three definitions of BC was accepted and used throughout the century. Therefore, the part of the development line of BC before Kuiper could be considered a prescience period. The rest could be named the normal science period in which astrophysicists work under the three paradigms. The rise of BC as a concept, how the ill-posed definition BC emerged/used, how inconsistencies (paradigms) of BC developed, and how the Resolution B2 of the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union imposing $C_{\rm bol} = 71.197\,425\,\ldots$ mag, and $C_2&gt;0$, for the zero-point constants of the $M_{\rm {Bol}}$ and BC scales resolve the long-lasting problems were discussed. Generalized new definition of BC implying $L_{\rm V}=L \times 10^\frac{({\rm BC}-C_2)}{2.5}$ were given to replace $L = L_{\rm V} \times 10^{BC/2.5}$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Bifurcated Blue Straggler Sequences in NGC 2173: Insights from Binary Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying bifurcated blue straggler (BS) sequences in color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of star clusters has long been regarded as a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing different BS formation mechanisms. While such bifurcations are typically associated with core-collapsed clusters, their detection in dynamically young clusters raises new questions about their origins. In this study, using high-precision proper motion data derived from Hubble Space Telescope multi-epoch observations, we confirm the existence of two distinct BS sequences in the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 2173 (~ 1.58 Gyr): a well-defined, narrow blue sequence and a sparser red sequence. The extended core region excludes collisional formation as a viable channel for BS formation. Our binary evolution models suggest that non-conservative mass transfer (MT) is essential for shaping the distribution of BS binaries in the CMD. The red sequence primarily comprises BS binaries formed through conservative ongoing MT. In contrast, the blue sequence BS binaries are formed through non-conservative post-MT processes, all involving white dwarf (WD) companions. These BS+WD binary systems may subsequently undergo a second MT phase, leading to the formation of double WD systems.</description>

      <title>The importance of Berry phase in solar acoustic modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytic expression for the frequencies of standing waves in stars, applicable to any radial order n, is derived from ray-tracing equations by the mean of Wigner-Weyl calculus. A correction to previous formulas currently employed in asteroseismology is identified as the Berry phase, which accounts for the vectorial nature of wave propagation in stars. Accounting for this quantity significantly improves upon previous laws for low n modes of the Sun, and we show that the Berry phase is indeed present in the available observational data of solar modes. This phase is due to inhomogeneities of the medium.</description>

      <title>Kozai Lidov Cycles = Simple Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadrupole Kozai mechanism, which describes the hierarchical three-body problem in the leading order, is shown to be equivalent to a simple pendulum where the change in the eccentricity squared equals the height of the pendulum from its lowest point: $e_{\text{max}}^2-e^2=h=l\left(1-\cos{\theta}\right)$. In particular, this results in useful expressions for the KLC period, and the maximal and minimal eccentricities in terms of orbital constants. We derive the equivalence using the vector coordinates $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=\textbf{j}+\textbf{e}, \boldsymbol{\beta}=\textbf{j}-\textbf{e}$ for the inner Keplerian orbit, where $\textbf{j}$ is the normalized specific angular momentum, and $\textbf{e}$ is the eccentricity vector. The equations of motion for $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ simplify to $\dot{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}=2\partial_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \phi \times \boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\dot{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=2\partial_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \phi \times \boldsymbol{\beta}$, where $\phi$ is the normalized averaged interaction potential and are symmetric to replacing $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ for the KLC quadratic potential. Their constraints simplify to $\boldsymbol{\alpha}^2=\boldsymbol{\beta}^2=1$, and they are distributed uniformly and independently on the unit sphere for a uniform distribution in phase space (with a fixed energy).</description>

      <title>A morphological catalogue of Nova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the first optical imaging catalogue of resolved Galactic nova remnants. It compiles images from proprietary observations carried out at the Nordic Optical Telescope and public archives using different telescopes and instruments. The catalogue includes images spanning from 1950 to 2024 of 66 novae out of the more than 550 novae detected to date. Diffuse emission from a nova shell is detected in 45 sources, with another 16 sources been stellar and five more been barely resolved. We used the catalogue to introduce a main morphological classification of the nova remnants (R - round, E - elliptical, B - bipolar, A - asymmetric, I - irregular, S - stellar, and G - barely resolved) with secondary features (s - smooth, c - clumpy, m - mixed, f - filaments, t - tails, m - multiple shells, e - equatorial brightness enhancement). Resolved nova remnants are mostly round (27%) or elliptical (56%), with very few bipolar or with equatorial brightness enhancement (13%). Most nova remnants are younger than 150 yr, with about 80% of nova remnant detection rate among those younger than 60 yr. The physical size of nova remnants increases with age at a rate of 0.0725 pc per century up to a median value of 0.03 pc. This relationship seems to apply even to the few known ancient nova shells with ages up to a few millennia. The aspect ratio of nova remnants can be described by a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation $\sigma$ of 0.18 from round morphologies (major to minor axes ratio of unity).</description>

      <title>Abrupt Pulsation Resumptions in Deneb: An Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deneb, the prototype Alpha Cygni variable, is a bright A2 Ia supergiant which shows irregular variability with a 12-day quasi-period, presumed to be caused by pulsations. At the 2023 AAVSO Annual Meeting we discussed radial velocity and photometry data from several sources showing that the 12-day variations begin abruptly at an arbitrary phase, damp out after several cycles, and resume at intervals of around 75 days. Additional data with more frequent time sampling and longer time series were needed to verify the existence and precision of the 75-day interval. We have identified additional data sets and have intensified ground-based observing programs. Here we present analysis of 1) an 8.6-year photometric data set from the Solar Mass Ejection Imager; 2) BRITE Constellation light curves from six observing seasons of 60 to 180 days each, 2014-2021; 3) 4.6 years of radial velocity data from Morrison; 4) 1.4 years of radial velocity data from Eaton; and 5) additional V-band photometry from the AAVSO Photoelectric Photometry (PEP) section. Examining the SMEI data set, we find a most common 100 to 125 day interval between `pulsation' resumptions. These resumptions sometimes skip intervals. We also find sudden large excursions in brightness and radial velocity which are distinct from the `pulsation' resumptions and may or may not be data artifacts. We point out changes in the average level of Deneb's radial velocity which appear to be real given the accuracy of the measurements but are not explained.</description>

      <title>Impact of Spectral Resolution on S-index and Its Application to Spectroscopic Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the PHOENIX synthetic spectra, we investigated the impact of spectral resolution on the calculation of $S$-indices. We found that for spectra with a resolution lower than $\approx$30,000, it is crucial to calibrate $S$-indices for accurate estimations. This is especially essential for low-resolution spectral observations. We provided calibrations for several ongoing or upcoming spectroscopic surveys such as the LAMOST low-resolution survey, the SEGUE survey, the SDSS-V/BOSS survey, the DESI survey, the MSE survey, and the MUST survey. Using common targets between the HARPS and MWO observations, we established conversions from spectral $S$-indices to the well-known $S_{\rm MWO}$ values, applicable to stars with [Fe/H] values greater than $-$1. These calibrations offer a reliable approach to convert $S$-indices obtained from various spectroscopic surveys into $S_{\rm{MWO}}$ values and can be widely applied in studies on chromospheric activity.</description>

      <title>Common envelopes in massive stars III: The obstructive role of radiation transport in envelope ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of common-envelope (CE) evolution involving a 12 solar mass red supergiant donor and a 3 solar mass companion. Existing 3D simulations are predominantly adiabatic, focusing strongly on low-mass donors on the red giant and asymptotic giant branches. However, the adiabatic assumption breaks down once the perturbed CE material becomes optically thin or when entering a longer-timescale evolutionary phase after the dynamical plunge-in. This is especially important for high-mass red supergiant donors, which have short thermal timescales, adding significant uncertainty in understanding how massive binary stars evolve into gravitational-wave sources, X-ray binaries, stripped-envelope supernovae, and more. We compare our radiation hydrodynamics simulations with an adiabatic simulation from Paper I that is otherwise identical, finding that radiative diffusion strongly inhibits CE ejection. The fraction of ejected mass is roughly half that of the adiabatic case when recombination energy release is not included. Almost no material is ejected during the dynamical plunge-in, and longer-timescale ejection during the slow spiral-in is suppressed. However, the orbital separation reached at the end of the dynamical plunge-in does not differ significantly. The large amount of remaining bound mass tentatively supports the emerging view that the dynamical plunge-in is followed by a non-adiabatic phase, during which a substantial fraction of the envelope is ejected and the binary orbit may continue to evolve.</description>

      <title>Small-scale energetic phenomena in H{\epsilon}: Ellerman bombs, UV bursts, and small flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We investigated the potential of using Hepsilon to diagnose small-scale energetic phenomena such as Ellerman bombs, UV bursts, and small-scale flares. Our focus is to understand the formation of the line and how to use its properties to get insight into the dynamics of small-scale energetic phenomena. Methods. We carried out a forward modeling study, combining simulations and detailed radiative transfer calculations. The 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations were run with the Bifrost code and included energetic phenomena. We employed a Markovian framework to study the Hepsilon multilevel source function, used relative contribution functions to identify its formation regions, and correlated the properties of synthetic spectra with atmospheric parameters. Results. Ellerman bombs are predominantly optically thick in Hepsilon, appearing as well-defined structures. UV bursts and small flares are partially optically thin and give rise to diffuse structures. The Hepsilon line serves as a good velocity diagnostic for small-scale heating events in the lower chromosphere. However, its emission strength is a poor indicator of temperature, and its line width offers limited utility due to the interplay of various broadening mechanisms. Compared to Halpha, Hepsilon exhibits greater sensitivity to phenomena such as Ellerman bombs, as its line core experiences higher extinction than the Halpha wing. Conclusions. Hepsilon is a valuable tool for studying small-scale energetic phenomena in the lower chromosphere. It provides more reliable estimates of velocities than those extracted from wing emission in Halpha or Hbeta. Maps of Hepsilon emission show more abundant energetic events than the Halpha counterpart. Our findings highlight Hepsilons potential to advance our understanding of dynamic processes in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Period--Luminosity Relations for Double-mode $\delta$ Sct Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies of the Period--Luminosity relations (PLRs) of Delta Scuti ($\delta$ Sct) stars have focused on those with a single pulsation mode. However, for $\delta$ Sct stars with many different pulsation modes, classifying a single mode is difficult. In this study, an all-sky dataset is constructed using double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars from ZTF and OGLE, and is used to determine F-mode and 1O-mode PLRs for eight single bands and six Wesenheit bands. In the $W1$ band, the PLR dispersion is about 0.171 mag and the total zero point error is 1\%. Our results show that to accurately classify the 1O modes of $\delta$ Sct stars requires authentication based on multiple modes. Classification based on amplitude alone leads to impure 1O-mode $\delta$ Sct stars and significant deviations in the PLRs. We compare the PLRs of the different sequences in the Petersen diagram and find that they are consistent after a strict criterion filtering, suggesting that their evolutionary state is similar. In addition, we find a weak period--metallicity relation for double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars, unlike double-mode RR Lyrae stars. As distance tracers, large-amplitude F-mode $\delta$ Sct and double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars are the most suitable of the $\delta$ Sct family.</description>

      <title>Spectral evolution of the narrow emission line components in optical during the 2022 nova eruption of U Scorpii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There remains debate over whether the accretion disk survives or is entirely disrupted after the nova eruption. In our previous paper, Muraoka et al. (2024, PASJ, 76, 293) have photometrically demonstrated that the surviving accretion disk was expanded close to the L1 point during the optical plateau stage and then drastically shrank to the tidal truncation radius after the optical plateau stage ended. To approach the clarification of the physical mechanism that drives these structural changes, we have then conducted systematic analyses of the spectral evolution of the narrow emission line components in optical over 22 d following the optical peak during the 2022 nova eruption of U Scorpii (U Sco). Additionally, we present its optical spectrum in quiescence 794 d after the 2022 nova eruption. We find that the single-peaked narrow components of H$\alpha$ and He II 4686 appeared almost simultaneously between roughly days 6 and 8, preceding the onset of the disk eclipses observed after day 11. This finding suggests that the nova wind near the binary system may be the primary origin of these narrow components and even remained active several days after the nova eruption with a velocity of approximately 1000 km s$^{-1}$, likely driving the expansion of the accretion disk until the end of the optical plateau stage. While the contribution of the rotating accretion disk might be dominated by that of the nova wind in the H$\alpha$ line profile, the outward surface flow from the expanded disk might also contribute to these narrow features during the optical plateau stage, making the single-peaked narrow line profiles more pronounced.</description>

Abstract: The problem of the formation of exoplanets in inclined orbits relative to the equatorial plane of the parent star or the main plane of the protoplanetary disk can be solved by introducing a smaller inclined disk. However, the question of the nature of such an internal disk remains open. In the paper, we successfully tested the hypothesis about the formation of an inclined inner disk in a protoplanetary disk near a T Tau type star as a result of a gas stream falling on it. To test the hypothesis, three-dimensional gas-dynamic calculations were performed taking into account viscosity and thermal conductivity using the PLUTO package. In the course of the analysis of calculations, it was shown that a single intersection of the matter stream with the plane of the disk cannot ensure the formation of an inclined disk near the star, while a double intersection can. In addition, in the case of a retrograde fall of matter, the angle of inclination of the resulting inner disk is significantly greater. An analysis of the observational manifestations of this event was also carried out: the potential change in the brightness of the star, the distribution of optical thickness in angles, the evolution of the accretion rate. It is shown that the decrease in brightness can reach up to $5^m$, taking into account scattered light, and such a decrease in brightness will last several decades. In addition, a sharp increase in the accretion rate by two orders of magnitude could potentially trigger an FU Ori-like outburst.</description>

      <title>The planetary nebula NGC 3132 revisited: high definition 3D photoionization model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed 3D photoionization model of the planetary nebula NGC 3132, constrained by the latest observations. Using the MOCASSIN code, the model incorporates integrated and spatially resolved spectroscopy, velocity-resolved line profiles, emission line maps, and photometry, including recent high-quality data from MUSE (VLT) and JWST among others. Based on new data from the SAMFP instrument at SOAR, the three-dimensional density structure of the nebula was obtained by assuming homologous expansion of the surrounding nebular gas. The final fitted model successfully reproduces all key observational constraints available, particularly in terms of the detailed emission line integrated fluxes and ionization structures across different ionic stages. The results of the model show that the progenitor star had a mass of $(2.7 \pm 0.2)M_{\odot}$ and is surrounded by a He poor shell of dust and gas. The abundances of He, C, N, O, and S determined by the model show that the nebula has C/O=$(2.02 \pm 0.28)$ and N/O=$(0.39 \pm 0.38)$ consistent with the progenitor mass found.</description>

      <title>Study of extragalactic HII regions with echelle spectroscopy: The A2 region in the irregular galaxy IC4662</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present the results of echelle spectroscopy of a bright HII region in the irregular galaxy IC4662 and their comparison with results from long-slit spectroscopy of the same region. All observations were obtained with the standard spectrographs of the SALT telescope: (1) low and medium spectral resolution spectrograph RSS (R~800) and (2) echelle spectrograph HRS (R=16000-17000). In both types of data the intensities of most of the emission lines were measured and abundances of oxygen and N, Ne, S, Ar, Cl and Fe were determined as well as physical parameters of the \ion{H}{ii} region. The chemical abundances were obtained from both types of data with the Te-method. Abundances calculated from both types of data agree to within the cited uncertainties. The analysis of the echelle data revealed three distinct kinematic subsystems within the studied \ion{H}{ii} region: a narrow component (NC, $\sigma ~ 12$~km/s), a broad component (BC, $\sigma ~ 40$~km/s), and a very broad component (VBC, $\sigma ~ 60-110$~km/s, detected only in the brightest emission lines). The velocity dispersion dependence on the ionisation potential of elements showed no correlation for the NC, indicating a well-mixed turbulent medium, while the BC exhibited pronounced stratification, characteristic of an expanding shell. Based on a detailed analysis of the kinematics and chemical composition, it was concluded that the BC is associated with the region surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star of spectral type WN7-8. The stellar wind from this WR star interacts with a shell ejected during an earlier evolutionary stage (either as a red supergiant or a luminous blue variable, LBV), which is enriched in nitrogen. These findings highlight the importance of high spectral resolution for detecting small-scale (~25 pc) chemical inhomogeneities and for understanding the feedback mechanisms of massive stars in low-metallicity environments.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: A multidimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability to run HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future developments will extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>

      <title>Recovering Pulsar Braking Index from a Population of Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The braking index, $n$, of a pulsar is a measure of its angular momentum loss and the value it takes corresponds to different spin-down mechanisms. For a pulsar spinning down due to gravitational wave emission from the principal mass quadrupole mode alone, the braking index would equal exactly 5. Unfortunately, for millisecond pulsars, it can be hard to measure observationally due to the extremely small second time derivative of the rotation frequency, $\ddot{f}$. This paper aims to examine whether it could be possible to extract the distribution of $n$ for a whole population of pulsars rather than measuring the values individually. We use simulated data with an injected $n=5$ signal for 47 millisecond pulsars and extract the distribution using hierarchical Bayesian inference methods. We find that while possible, observation times of over 20 years and RMS noise of the order of $10^{-5}$ ms are needed, which can be compared to the mean noise value of $3\times10^{-4}$ ms for the recent wideband 12.5-year NANOGrav sample, which provided the pulsar timing data used in this paper.</description>

      <title>Helicity effect on turbulent passive and active scalar diffusivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows are known to produce enhanced effective magnetic and passive scalar diffusivities, which can fairly accurately be determined with numerical methods. It is now known that, if the flow is also helical, the effective magnetic diffusivity is reduced relative to the nonhelical value. Neither the usual second-order correlation approximation nor the various $\tau$ approaches have been able to capture this. Here we show that the helicity effect on the turbulent passive scalar diffusivity works in the opposite sense and leads to an enhancement. This effect has not previously been seen. We have also demonstrated that the correlation time of the turbulent velocity field increases by the kinetic helicity. This is a key point in the theoretical interpretation of the obtained numerical results. Simulations in which helicity is being produced self-consistently by stratified rotating turbulence, resulted in a turbulent passive scalar diffusivity that was found to be decreasing with increasing rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Theory of the kinetic helicity effect on turbulent diffusion of magnetic and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristics of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence. One of the crucial reasons for the difference between the kinetic helicity effect on magnetic and scalar fields is related to the helicity dependence of the correlation time of a turbulent velocity field.</description>
