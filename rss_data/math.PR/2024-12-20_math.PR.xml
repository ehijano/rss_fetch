      <title>Central limit theorem for superdiffusive reflected Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the second-order asymptotics around the superdiffusive strong law~\cite{MMW} of a multidimensional driftless diffusion with oblique reflection from the boundary in a generalised parabolic domain. In the unbounded direction we prove the limit is Gaussian with the usual diffusive scaling, while in the appropriately scaled cross-sectional slice we establish convergence to the invariant law of a reflecting diffusion in a unit ball. Using the separation of time scales, we also show asymptotic independence between these two components. The parameters of the limit laws are explicit in the growth rate of the boundary and the asymptotic diffusion matrix and reflection vector field. A phase transition occurs when the domain becomes too narrow, in which case we prove that the central limit theorem for the unbounded component fails.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limit Theorems for Multivariate Hawkes Processes and Stochastic Volterra Equations with Measure Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to establishing the full scaling limit theorems for multivariate Hawkes processes. Under some mild conditions on the exciting kernels, we develop a new way to prove that after a suitable time-spatial scaling, the asymptotically critical multivariate Hawkes processes converge weakly to the unique solution of a multidimensional stochastic Volterra equation with convolution kernel being the potential measure associated to a matrix-valued extended Bernstein function. Also, based on the observation of their affine property and generalized branching property, we provide an exponential-affine representation of the Fourier-Laplace functional of scaling limits in terms of the unique solutions of multidimensional Riccati-Volterra equations with measure kernel. The regularity of limit processes and their alternate representations are also investigated by using the potential theory of L\'evy subordinators.</description>

      <title>Permutation recovery of spikes in noisy high-dimensional tensor estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of gradient flow in high dimensions for the multi-spiked tensor problem, where the goal is to estimate $r$ unknown signal vectors (spikes) from noisy Gaussian tensor observations. Specifically, we analyze the maximum likelihood estimation procedure, which involves optimizing a highly nonconvex random function. We determine the sample complexity required for gradient flow to efficiently recover all spikes, without imposing any assumptions on the separation of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). More precisely, our results provide the sample complexity required to guarantee recovery of the spikes up to a permutation. Our work builds on our companion paper [Ben Arous, Gerbelot, Piccolo 2024], which studies Langevin dynamics and determines the sample complexity and separation conditions for the SNRs necessary for ensuring exact recovery of the spikes (where the recovered permutation matches the identity). During the recovery process, the correlations between the estimators and the hidden vectors increase in a sequential manner. The order in which these correlations become significant depends on their initial values and the corresponding SNRs, which ultimately determines the permutation of the recovered spikes.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction for path signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the mathematical framework for reducing the complexity of models using path signatures. The structure of these signatures, which can be interpreted as collections of iterated integrals along paths, is discussed and their applications in areas such as stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and financial modeling are pointed out. In particular, exploiting the rough paths view, solutions of SDEs continuously depend on the lift of the driver. Such continuous mappings can be approximated using (truncated) signatures, which are solutions of high-dimensional linear systems. In order to lower the complexity of these models, this paper presents methods for reducing the order of high-dimensional truncated signature models while retaining essential characteristics. The derivation of reduced models and the universal approximation property of (truncated) signatures are treated in detail. Numerical examples, including applications to the (rough) Bergomi model in financial markets, illustrate the proposed reduction techniques and highlight their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Recovering semipermeable barriers from reflected Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the recovery of one-dimensional semipermeable barriers for a stochastic process in a planar domain. The considered process acts like Brownian motion when away from the barriers and is reflected upon contact until a sufficient but random amount of interaction has occurred, determined by the permeability, after which it passes through. Given a sequence of samples, we wonder when one can determine the location and shape of the barriers.
  This paper identifies several different recovery regimes, determined by the available observation period and the time between samples, with qualitatively different behavior. The observation period $T$ dictates if the full barriers or only certain pieces can be recovered, and the sampling rate significantly influences the convergence rate as $T\to \infty$. This rate turns out polynomial for fixed-frequency data, but exponentially fast in a high-frequency regime.
  Further, the environment's impact on the difficulty of the problem is quantified using interpretable parameters in the recovery guarantees, and is found to also be regime-dependent. For instance, the curvature of the barriers affects the convergence rate for fixed-frequency data, but becomes irrelevant when $T\to \infty$ with high-frequency data.
  The results are accompanied by explicit algorithms, and we conclude by illustrating the application to real-life data.</description>

      <title>Time-changed Markov processes and coupled non-local equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a financial valuation problem on an asset-pricing model with dependent trade duration and returns, in this paper we study coupled fully non-local equations, where a linear non-local operator jointly acts on the time and space variables. We prove existence and uniqueness of the solution. Existence is established by providing a stochastic representation based on anomalous processes constructed as a time change via the undershooting of an independent subordinator. This leads to general non-stepped processes with intervals of constancy representing a sticky or trapping effect (i.e., constant price in financial applications). Our theory allows these intervals to be dependent on the immediately subsequent jump. A maximum principle is then proved and used to derive uniqueness. Based on these general results, we consider a particular case: a non-local analog of the Black and Scholes equation, addressing the problem of determining the seasoned price of a derivative security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a well established theory that links semi-Markov chains having Mittag-Leffler waiting times to time-fractional equations. We here go beyond the semi-Markov setting, by defining some non-Markovian chains whose waiting times, although marginally Mittag-Leffler, are assumed to be stochastically dependent. This creates a long memory tail in the evolution, unlike what happens for semi-Markov processes. As a special case of our chains, we study a particular counting process which extends the well-known fractional Poisson process, the last one having independent, Mittag-Leffler waiting times.</description>

      <title>First contact percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a version of first passage percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ where the random passage times on the edges are replaced by contact times represented by random closed sets on $\mathbb{R}$. Similarly to the contact process without recovery, an infection can spread into the system along increasing sequences of contact times. In case of stationary contact times, we can identify associated first passage percolation models, which in turn establish shape theorems also for first contact percolation. In case of periodic contact times that reflect some reoccurring daily pattern, we also present shape theorems with limiting shapes that are universal with respect to the within-one-day contact distribution. In this case, we also prove a Poisson approximation for increasing numbers of within-one-day contacts. Finally, we present a comparison of the limiting speeds of three models -- all calibrated to have one expected contact per day -- that suggests that less randomness is beneficial for the speed of the infection. The proofs rest on coupling and subergodicity arguments.</description>

      <title>A functional Hungarian construction for sums of independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Hungarian construction for the partial sum process of independent non-identically distributed random variables. The process is indexed by functions $f$ from a class $\mathcal{H}$, but the supremum over $f\in $ $\mathcal{H}$ is taken outside the probability. This form is a prerequisite for the Koml\'{o}s-Major-Tusn\'{a}dy inequality in the space of bounded functionals $l^{\infty }(\mathcal{H})$, but contrary to the latter it essentially preserves the classical $n^{-1/2}\log n$ approximation rate over large functional classes $\mathcal{H}$ such as the H\"{o}lder ball of smoothness $1/2$. This specific form of a strong approximation is useful for proving asymptotic equivalence of statistical experiments.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity in one-dimensional Coulomb gases and related ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove log-concavity of the lengths of the top rows of Young diagrams under Poissonized Plancherel measure. This is the first known positive result towards a conjecture of Chen that the length of the top row of a Young diagram under the Plancherel measure is log-concave. This is done by showing that the ordered elements of several discrete ensembles have log-concave distributions. In particular, we show the log-concavity of passage times in last passage percolation with geometric weights, using their connection to Meixner ensembles.
  In the continuous setting, distributions of the maximal elements of beta ensembles with convex potentials on the real line are shown to be log-concave. As a result, log-concavity of the $\beta$ versions of Tracy-Widom distributions follows; in fact, we also obtain log-concavity and positive association for the joint distribution of the $k$ smallest eigenvalues of the stochastic Airy operator. Our methods also show the log-concavity of finite dimensional distributions of the Airy-2 process and the Airy distribution. A log-concave distribution with full-dimensional support must have density, a fact that was apparently not known for some of these examples.</description>

      <title>Metastability in the stochastic nearest-neighbor Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model (KM) of $n$ coupled phase-oscillators is analyzed in this work. The KM on a Cayley graph possesses a family of steady state solutions called twisted states. Topologically distinct twisted states are distinguished by the winding number $q\in\mathbb{Z}$. These states are known to be stable for small enough $q$. In the presence of small noise, the KM exhibits metastable transitions between $q$-twisted states: A typical trajectory remains in the basin of attraction of a given $q$-twisted state for an exponentially long time, but eventually transitions to the vicinity of another such state. In the course of this transition, it passes in close proximity of a saddle of Morse index $1$, called a relevant saddle. In this work, we provide an exhaustive analysis of metastable transitions in the stochastic KM with nearest-neighbor coupling. We start by analyzing the equilibria and their stability. First, we identify all equilibria in this model. Using the discrete Fourier transform and eigenvalue estimates for rank-1 perturbations of symmetric matrices, we classify the equilibria by their Morse indices. In particular, we identify all stable equilibria and all relevant saddles involved in the metastable transitions. Further, we use Freidlin-Wentzell theory and the potential-theoretic approach to metastability to establish the metastable hierarchy and sharp estimates of Eyring-Kramers type for the transition times. The former determines the precise order, in which the metastable transitions occur, while the latter characterizes the times between successive transitions. The theoretical estimates are complemented by numerical simulations and a careful numerical verification of the transition times. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for the KM with other coupling types including nonlocal coupling and the continuum limit as $n$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Optimizing over iid distributions and the Beat the Average game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A casino offers the following game. There are three cups each containing a die. You are being told that the dice in the cups are all the same, but possibly nonstandard. For a bet of \$1, the game master shakes all three cups and lets you choose one of them. You win \$2 if the die in your cup displays at least the average of the other two, and you lose otherwise. Is this game fair? If not, how should the casino design the dice to maximize their profit?
  This problem is a special case of the following more general question: given a measurable space $X$ and a bounded measurable function $f : X^n \to \mathbb{R}$, how large can the expectation of $f$ under probability measures of the form $\mu^{\otimes n}$ be? We develop a general method to answer this kind of question. As an example application that is harder than the casino problem, we show that the maximal probability of the event $X_1 + X_2 + X_3 &lt; 2 X_4$ for nonnegative iid random variables lies between $0.4$ and $0.422$, where the upper bound is obtained by mixed integer linear programming. We conjecture the lower bound to be the exact value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of Gaussian random band matrices of dimension $N \times N$ and band-width $W$. We show that delocalization holds for bulk eigenvectors and that quantum diffusion holds for the resolvent, all under the assumption that $W \gg N^{8/11}$.

      <title>Reaching the equilibrium: Long-term stable approximations for stochastic non-Newtonian Stokes equations with transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a novel, fully discrete numerical algorithm for the approximation of the generalised Stokes system forced by transport noise -- a prototype model for non-Newtonian fluids including turbulence. Utilising the Gradient Discretisation Method, we show that the algorithm is long-term stable for a broad class of particular Gradient Discretisations. Building on the long-term stability and the derived continuity of the algorithm's solution operator, we construct two sequences of approximate invariant measures. At the moment, each sequence lacks one important feature: either the existence of a limit measure, or the invariance with respect to the discrete semigroup. We derive an abstract condition that merges both properties, recovering the existence of an invariant measure. We provide an example for which invariance and existence hold simultaneously, and characterise the invariant measure completely. We close the article by conducting two numerical experiments that show the influence of transport noise on the dynamics of power-law fluids; in particular, we find that transport noise enhances the dissipation of kinetic energy, the mixing of particles, as well as the size of vortices.</description>

      <title>Coupling and Tensorization of Kinetic Theory and Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a non-exchangeable multi-agent system and rigorously derive a strong form of the mean-field limit. The convergence of the connection weights and the initial data implies convergence of large-scale dynamics toward a deterministic limit given by the corresponding extended Vlasov PDE, at any later time and any realization of randomness. This is established on what we call a bi-coupling distance defined through a convex optimization problem, which is an interpolation of the optimal transport between measures and the fractional overlay between graphs. The proof relies on a quantitative stability estimate of the so-called observables, which are tensorizations of agent laws and graph homomorphism densities. This reveals a profound relationship between mean-field theory and graph limiting theory, intersecting in the study of non-exchangeable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an interacting particle system on star graphs. As in the case of the Kdv equation, we have infinitely many invariants ( martingale invariants). It enables us to obtain the limiting distribution of the Markov chain. Each of the martingale invariants is a homogeneous polynomial with coefficients of Narayana numbers.The identity for the enumeration of plane unlabeled trees, which gives Narayana numbers, becomes the key identity to obtain the probability of death states by a change of variables.</description>

Abstract: We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equation on a high-dimensional sphere and other compact Riemannian manifolds. We extend the equivalence of the energetic problem formulation to the manifold setting and characterize critical points of the corresponding free energy functional. On a sphere, we employ the properties of spherical convolution to study the bifurcation branches around the uniform state. We also give a sufficient condition for an existence of a discontinuous transition point in terms of the interaction kernel and compare it to the Euclidean setting. We illustrate our results on a range of system, including the particle system arising from the transformer models and the Onsager model of liquid crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k\geq 2$ and fix a $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{F}$. Consider the random process that, starting from a $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ on $n$ vertices, repeatedly deletes the edges of a copy of $\mathcal{F}$ chosen uniformly at random and terminates when no copies of $\mathcal{F}$ remain. Let $R(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{F})$ denote the number of edges that are left after termination. We show that $R(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{F})=n^{k-1/\rho\pm o(1)}$, where $\rho:=(\lvert E(\mathcal{F})\rvert-1)/(\lvert V(\mathcal{F})\rvert -k)$, holds with high probability provided that $\mathcal{F}$ is strictly $k$-balanced and $\mathcal{H}$ is sufficiently dense with pseudorandom properties. Since we may in particular choose $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ to be complete graphs, this confirms the major folklore conjecture in the area in a very strong form.</description>

Abstract: We provide the final step in the resolution of Bourgain's slicing problem in the affirmative. Thus we establish the following theorem: for any convex body $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of volume one, there exists a hyperplane $H \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $$ Vol_{n-1}(K \cap H) &gt; c, $$ where $c &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Our proof combines Milman's theory of $M$-ellipsoids, stochastic localization with a recent bound by Guan, and stability estimates for the Shannon-Stam inequality by Eldan and Mikulincer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.02438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(g_{n})_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) $d\times d$ real random matrices. Set $G_n = g_n g_{n-1} \ldots g_1$ and $X_n^x = G_n x/|G_n x|$, $n\geq 1$, where $|\cdot|$ is an arbitrary norm in $\mathbb R^d$ and $x\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a starting point with $|x|=1$. For both invertible matrices and positive matrices, under suitable conditions we prove a Berry-Esseen type theorem and an Edgeworth expansion for the couple $(X_n^x, \log |G_n x|)$. These results are established using a brand new smoothing inequality on complex plane, the saddle point method and additional spectral gap properties of the transfer operator related to the Markov chain $X_n^x$. Cram\'{e}r type moderate deviation expansions are derived for the couple $(X_n^x, \log |G_n x|)$ with a target function $\varphi$ on the Markov chain $X_n^x$. A local limit theorem with moderate deviations is also obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.09579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hartman-Watson distribution with density $f_r(t)$ is a probability distribution defined on $t \geq 0$ which appears in several problems of applied probability. The density of this distribution is expressed in terms of an integral $\theta(r,t)$ which is difficult to evaluate numerically for small $t\to 0$. Using saddle point methods, we obtain the first two terms of the $t\to 0$ expansion of $\theta(\rho/t,t)$ at fixed $\rho &gt;0$. An error bound is obtained by numerical estimates of the integrand, which is furthermore uniform in $\rho$. As an application we obtain the leading asymptotics of the density of the time average of the geometric Brownian motion as $t\to 0$. This has the form $\mathbb{P}(\frac{1}{t} \int_0^t e^{2(B_s+\mu s)} ds \in da) \sim (2\pi t)^{-1/2} g(a,\mu) e^{-\frac{1}{t} J(a)} da/a$, with an exponent $J(a)$ which reproduces the known result obtained previously using Large Deviations theory.</description>

      <title>Label propagation on binomial random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03569v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of a label propagation algorithm (LPA) on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. Initially, given a network, each vertex starts with a random label in the interval $[0,1]$. Then, in each round of LPA, every vertex switches its label to the majority label in its neighborhood (including its own label). At the first round, ties are broken towards smaller labels, while at each of the next rounds, ties are broken uniformly at random. The algorithm terminates once all labels stay the same in two consecutive iterations. LPA is successfully used in practice for detecting communities in networks (corresponding to vertex sets with the same label after termination of the algorithm). Perhaps surprisingly, LPA's performance on dense random graphs is hard to analyze, and so far convergence to consensus was known only when $np\ge n^{3/4+\varepsilon}$, where LPA converges in three rounds. By defining an alternative label attribution procedure which converges to the label propagation algorithm after three rounds, a careful multi-stage exposure of the edges allows us to break the $n^{3/4+\varepsilon}$ barrier and show that, when $np \ge n^{5/8+\varepsilon}$, a.a.s.\ the algorithm terminates with a single label. Moreover, we show that, if $np\gg n^{2/3}$, a.a.s.\ this label is the smallest one, whereas if $n^{5/8+\varepsilon}\le np\ll n^{2/3}$, the surviving label is a.a.s.\ not the smallest one. En passant, we show a presumably new monotonicity lemma for Binomial random variables that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of continuous time symmetric stochastic differential games in open loop strategies, we introduce a generalization of mean field game solution, called coarse correlated solution. This can be seen as the analogue of a coarse correlated equilibrium in the $N$-player game, where a moderator randomly generates a strategy profile and asks the players to pre-commit to such strategies before disclosing them privately to each one of them; such a profile is a coarse correlated equilibrium if no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate. We justify our definition by showing that a coarse correlated solution for the mean field game induces a sequence of approximate coarse correlated equilibria with vanishing error for the underlying $N$-player games. Existence of coarse correlated solutions for the mean field game is proved by means of a minimax theorem. An example with explicit solutions is discussed as well.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the existence and uniqueness of a classical solution to a type of Robin boundary problems on the nonnegative orthant. We propose a new decomposition-homogenization method for the Robin boundary problem based on probabilistic representations, which leads to two auxiliary Robin boundary problems admitting some simplified probabilistic representations. The auxiliary probabilistic representations allow us to establish the existence of a unique classical solution to the original Robin boundary problem using some stochastic flow analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a self-interacting diffusion $X$ on a smooth compact Riemannian manifold $\mathbb M$, described by the stochastic differential equation \[ dX_t = \sqrt{2} dW_t(X_t)- \beta(t) \nabla V_t(X_t)dt, \] where $\beta$ is suitably lower-bounded and grows at most logarithmically, and $V_t(x)=\frac{1}{t}\int_0^t V(x,X_s)ds$ for a suitable smooth function $V\colon \mathbb M^2\to\mathbb R$ that makes the term $-\nabla V_t(X_t)$ self-repelling. We prove that almost surely the normalized occupation measure $\mu_t$ of $X$ converges weakly to the uniform distribution $\mathcal U$, and we provide a polynomial rate of convergence for smooth test functions. The key to this result is showing that if $f\colon\mathbb M\to\mathbb R$ is smooth, then $\mu_{e^t}(f)$ shadows the flow generated by the ordinary differential equation \[
  \dot\nu_t(f)=-\nu_t(f)+\mathcal U(f). \]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical beta-splitting tree, introduced by Aldous, is a Markov branching phylogenetic tree. Aldous and Pittel recently proved, amongst other results, a central limit theorem for the height of a random leaf. We give an alternative proof, via contraction methods for random recursive structures. These methods were developed by Neininger and R\"{u}schendorf, motivated by Pittel's article "Normal convergence problem? Two moments and a recurrence may be the clues." Aldous and Pittel estimated the leading order terms in the first two moments. More recently, Aldous and Janson obtained an asymptotic expansion for the average height. We show that a central limit theorem follows, and bound the distance to normality. Our results also apply to the continuous version of the model, in which branching times are exponential.</description>

Abstract: We study semi-infinite particle systems on the one-dimensional integer lattice, where each particle performs a continuous-time nearest-neighbour random walk, with jump rates intrinsic to each particle, subject to an exclusion interaction which suppresses jumps that would lead to more than one particle occupying any site. Under appropriate hypotheses on the jump rates (uniformly bounded rates is sufficient) and started from an initial condition that is a finite perturbation of the close-packed configuration, we give conditions under which the particles evolve as a single, semi-infinite "stable cloud". More precisely, we show that inter-particle separations converge to a product-geometric stationary distribution, and that the location of every particle obeys a strong law of large numbers with the same characteristic speed.</description>

      <title>A functional central limit theorem for weighted occupancy processes of the Karlin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A functional central limit theorem is established for weighted occupancy processes of the Karlin model. The weighted occupancy processes take the form of, with $D_{n,j}$ denoting the number of urns with $j$-balls after the first $n$ samplings, $\sum_{j=1}^na_jD_{n,j}$ for a prescribed sequence of real numbers $(a_j)_{j\in\mathbb N}$. The main applications are limit theorems for random permutations induced by Chinese restaurant processes with $(\alpha,\theta)$-seating with $\alpha\in(0,1), \theta&gt;-\alpha$. An example is briefly mentioned here, and full details are provided in an accompanying paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the random permutation matrices induced by the Chinese restaurant processes with $(\alpha,\theta)$-seating. When $\alpha=0,\theta&gt;0$, the permutations are those following Ewens measures on symmetric groups, and have been extensively studied in the literature. Here, we consider $\alpha\in(0,1)$ and $\theta&gt;-\alpha$. In an accompanying paper, a functional central limit theorem is established for partial sum of weighted cycle counts in the form of $\sum_{j=1}^n a_jC_{n,j}$, where $C_{n,j}$ is the number of $j$-cycles of the permutation matrix of size $n$. Two applications are presented. One is on linear statistics of the spectrum, and the other is on the characteristic polynomials outside the unit circle.</description>

      <title>TASEP with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on $\mathbb{Z}$ with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall in front of the particles. Using colour-position symmetry, we express the one-point distributions in terms of particle positions in a TASEP with step initial condition along a space-like path.
  Based on this formula, we analyse the large-time asymptotics of the model under various scenarios. For initial conditions other than the step initial condition, we identify a distinct asymptotic behaviour at the boundary of the region influenced by the wall, differing from the observations made in [Borodin-Bufetov-Ferrari'24] and [Ferrari-Gernholt'24]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that product limit distributions are associated with shocks in the macroscopic empirical density.
  As a special case of our starting formula, we derive a variational expression for the one-point distributions of TASEP with arbitrary initial data. Focusing on non-random initial conditions, such as periodic ones with an arbitrary density, we leverage our analytical tools to characterise the limit distribution within the framework of particle positions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative particle approximation of nonlinear stochastic Fokker-Planck equations with singular kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive quantitative estimates for large stochastic systems of interacting particles perturbed by both idiosyncratic and environmental noises, as well as singular kernels. We prove that the (mollified) empirical process converges to the solution of the nonlinear stochastic Fokker-Planck equation. The proof is based on It\^o's formula for $H_{q}^{1}$-valued process, commutator estimates, and some estimations for the regularization of the empirical measure. Moreover, we show that the aforementioned equation admits a unique strong solution in the probabilistic sense. The approach applies to repulsive and attractive kernels.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Limits and Strong Consistency on Binary Non-uniform Hypergraph Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the unsupervised classification problem in random hypergraphs under the non-uniform Hypergraph Stochastic Block Model (HSBM) with two equal-sized communities, where each edge appears independently with some probability depending only on the labels of its vertices. In this paper, the information-theoretic limits on the clustering accuracy and the strong consistency threshold are established, expressed in terms of the generalized Hellinger distance. Below the threshold, it is impossible to assign all vertices to their own communities, and the lower bound of the expected mismatch ratio is derived. On the other hand, the problem space is (sometimes) divided into two disjoint subspaces when above the threshold. When only the contracted adjacency matrix is given, with high probability, one-stage spectral algorithms succeed in assigning every vertex correctly in the subspace far away from the threshold but fail in the other one. Two subsequent refinement algorithms are proposed to improve the clustering accuracy, which attain the lowest possible mismatch ratio, previously derived from the information-theoretical perspective. The failure of spectral algorithms in the second subspace arises from the loss of information induced by tensor contraction. The origin of this loss and possible solutions to minimize the impact are presented. Moreover, different from uniform hypergraphs, strong consistency is achievable by aggregating information from all uniform layers, even if it is impossible when each layer is considered alone.</description>

      <title>Langevin dynamics for high-dimensional optimization: the case of multi-spiked tensor PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonconvex optimization in high dimensions through Langevin dynamics, focusing on the multi-spiked tensor PCA problem. This tensor estimation problem involves recovering $r$ hidden signal vectors (spikes) from noisy Gaussian tensor observations using maximum likelihood estimation. We study the number of samples required for Langevin dynamics to efficiently recover the spikes and determine the necessary separation condition on the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for exact recovery, distinguishing the cases $p \ge 3$ and $p=2$, where $p$ denotes the order of the tensor. In particular, we show that the sample complexity required for recovering the spike associated with the largest SNR matches the well-known algorithmic threshold for the single-spike case, while this threshold degrades when recovering all $r$ spikes. As a key step, we provide a detailed characterization of the trajectory and interactions of low-dimensional projections that capture the high-dimensional dynamics.</description>
