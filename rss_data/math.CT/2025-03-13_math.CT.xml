      <title>On biadjoint triangles with additional modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lucatelli Nunes obtained a 2-categorical version of the adjoint triangle theorem of Dubuc using the descent object of a specific diagram. In some cases, such a diagram can be filled with an extra cell. We show then how to obtain a biadjoint as an inverter of this additional datum (under suitable hypotheses). The problem addressed here is slightly different however: we still have a triangle of pseudofunctors but the lifted biadjoint is not the same. The construction is simplified when the pseudofunctor whose left biadjoint is sought is fully faithful. As an example, we get the biadjoint of the inclusion pseudofunctor of a bicategory associated to a KZ-monad preserving pseudomonicity.</description>

      <title>On the computation of the vanishing locus of a finitely presented functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss invariants which are helpful for the computation of the vanishing locus of a finitely presented functor $\mathcal{G}$, i.e., the set of points in the Ziegler spectrum on which $\mathcal{G}$ vanishes. These invariants are: the rank of $\mathcal{G}$, the supports of its co- and contravariant defect, and the class of $\mathcal{G}$ in the Grothendieck group of the category of finitely presented functors. We show that these invariants determine the vanishing locus in the case of a finitely presented functor over a Dedekind domain.</description>

      <title>A categorical perspective on constraint satisfaction: The wonderland of adjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called algebraic approach to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) has been a prevalent method of the study of complexity of these problems since early 2000's. The core of this approach is the notion of polymorphisms which determine the complexity of the problem (up to log-space reductions). In the past few years, a new, more general version of the CSP emerged, the promise constraint satisfaction problem (PCSP), and the notion of polymorphisms and most of the core theses of the algebraic approach were generalised to the promise setting. Nevertheless, recent work also suggests that insights from other fields are immensely useful in the study of PCSPs including algebraic topology.
  In this paper, we provide an entry point for category-theorists into the study of complexity of CSPs and PCSPs. We show that many standard CSP notions have clear and well-known categorical counterparts. For example, the algebraic structure of polymorphisms can be described as a set-functor defined as a right Kan extension. We provide purely categorical proofs of core results of the algebraic approach including a proof that the complexity only depends on the polymorphisms. Our new proofs are substantially shorter and, from the categorical perspective, cleaner than previous proofs of the same results. Moreover, as expected, are applicable more widely. We believe that, in particular in the case of PCSPs, category theory brings insights that can help solve some of the current challenges of the field.</description>

      <title>Structure of Virasoro tensor categories at central charge $13-6p-6p^{-1}$ for integers $p &gt; 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.02170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{O}_c$ be the category of finite-length central-charge-$c$ modules for the Virasoro Lie algebra whose composition factors are irreducible quotients of reducible Verma modules. Recently, it has been shown that $\mathcal{O}_c$ admits vertex algebraic tensor category structure for any $c\in\mathbb{C}$. Here, we determine the structure of this tensor category when $c=13-6p-6p^{-1}$ for an integer $p&gt;1$. For such $c$, we prove that $\mathcal{O}_{c}$ is rigid, and we construct projective covers of irreducible modules in a natural tensor subcategory $\mathcal{O}_{c}^0$. We then compute all tensor products involving irreducible modules and their projective covers. Using these tensor product formulas, we show that $\mathcal{O}_c$ has a semisimplification which, as an abelian category, is the Deligne product of two tensor subcategories that are tensor equivalent to the Kazhdan-Lusztig categories for affine $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at levels $-2+p^{\pm 1}$. Next, as a straightforward consequence of the braided tensor category structure on $\mathcal{O}_c$ together with the theory of vertex operator algebra extensions, we rederive known results for triplet vertex operator algebras $\mathcal{W}(p)$, including rigidity, fusion rules, and construction of projective covers. Finally, we prove a recent conjecture of Negron that $\mathcal{O}_c^0$ is braided tensor equivalent to the $PSL(2,\mathbb{C})$-equivariantization of the category of $\mathcal{W}(p)$-modules.</description>

      <title>Trace methods for coHochschild homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hochschild homology is a classical invariant of rings that plays an important role because of its connection to algebraic $K$-theory via the Dennis trace. At level zero, the Dennis trace is induced by the Hattori-Stallings trace. In this paper, we introduce new algebraic $K$-theories of coalgebras and obtain coalgebraic refinements of the Hattori-Stallings trace that connect these algebraic $K$-theories to coHochschild homology (the invariant analogous to Hochschild homology but for coalgebras). We employ bicategorical methods of Ponto to show that coHochschild homology is a shadow. Consequently, we obtain that coHochschild homology is Morita-Takeuchi invariant.</description>

      <title>A Deligne conjecture for prestacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an analog of the Deligne conjecture for prestacks. We show that given a prestack $\mathbb A$, its Gerstenhaber--Schack complex $\mathbf{C}_{\mathsf{GS}}(\mathbb A)$ is naturally an $E_2$-algebra. This structure generalises both the known $\mathsf{L}_\infty$-algebra structure on $\mathbf{C}_{\mathsf{GS}}(\mathbb A)$, as well as the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on its cohomology $\mathbf{H}_{\mathsf{GS}}(\mathbb A)$. The main ingredient is the proof of a conjecture of Hawkins \cite{hawkins}, stating that the dg operad $\mathsf{Quilt}$ has vanishing homology in positive degrees. As a corollary, $\mathsf{Quilt}$ is quasi-isomorphic to the operad $\mathsf{Brace}$ encoding brace algebras. In addition, we improve the $L_\infty$-structure on $\mathsf{Quilt}$ by showing that it originates from a $\mathsf{PreLie}_\infty$-structure lifting the $\mathsf{PreLie}$-structure on $\mathsf{Brace}$ in homology.</description>
