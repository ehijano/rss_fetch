      <title>Effect of the avoided crossing on the rovibrational energy levels, resonances, and predissociation lifetimes within the ground and first excited electronic states of lithium fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the LiF spectrum up to $7800$ cm$^{-1}$ above the first dissociation limit. The ab initio calculations of the adiabatic potentials and other molecular functions are performed in a wide range of interatomic separations, $r=1$-17 bohr. We consider the model of two interacting electronic states including both the bound states and the resonances of two kinds, the tunneling resonances and the predissociative ones. The Born-Oppenheimer potentials are modeled with use of two functions imitating the diabatic terms whereas the coupling between them was set constant equal to the half of the minimum separation between the adiabatic terms, and then we define the final diabatic terms and the final diabatic coupling via the adiabatic potentials and the angle of the adiabatic-to-diabatic basis rotation obtained by integration of the nonadiabatic coupling matrix element. The energies of the bound states, as well as the positions and widths of the resonances are calculated. The observed transition frequencies are reproduced with the standard deviation of 0.0009 cm$^{-1}$ for $^7$LiF, 0.0006 cm$^{-1}$ for $^6$LiF, and within the experimental uncertainties for the most of the lines. The line lists for the bound-bound $X$-$X$ rovibrational transitions are calculated for quantum numbers $v\le50,\Delta v\le15,J\le170$ ($J\le200$ for the 0-0 and 1-0 bands).</description>

      <title>Demonstration of magic dressing of $^3$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common concern in high-precision neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) experiments is that of magnetic field stability. For static fields, this problem can be mitigated through the use of a superconducting holding field coil, which when operated in persistent current mode serves to stabilize the magnetic field. However, such a solution is not viable when time-varying magnetic fields are present, as is the case for the spin dressing mode of the proposed nEDMSF (nEDM super-fluid) experiment. This experiment features an oscillating magnetic field to dress the gyromagnetic ratios of $^3$He and neutrons to the same value, a condition known as critical dressing. Fluctuations in the dressing field amplitude have the potential to disrupt this condition. Here, we investigate a modification to spin dressing, termed ``magic dressing,'' which renders the system insensitive to small variations in dressing field amplitude. We further demonstrate the utility of this method for the single spin-species case using a sample of polarized $^3$He. We find a dramatic increase in transverse relaxation time in the presence of magnetic field gradients.</description>

      <title>Generation of strong ultralow-phase-noise microwave fields with tunable ellipticity for ultracold polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave(MW) fields with strong field strength, ultralow phase-noise and tunable polarization are crucial for stabilizing and manipulating ultracold polar molecules, which have emerged as a promising platform for quantum sciences. In this letter, we present the design, characterization, and performance of a robust MW setup tailored for precise control of molecular states. This setup achieves a high electric field intensity of 6.9 kV/m in the near-field from a dual-feed waveguide antenna, enabling a Rabi frequency as high as 71 MHz for the rotational transition of sodium-potassium molecules. In addition, the low noise signal source and controlled electronics provide ultralow phase-noise and dynamically tunable polarization. Narrow-band filters within the MW circuitry further reduce phase-noise by more than 20 dB at 20 MHz offset frequency, ensuring prolonged one-body molecular lifetimes up to 10 seconds. We also show practical methods to measure the MW field strength and polarization using a simple homemade dipole probe, and to characterize phase-noise down to -170 dBc/Hz with a commercial spectrum analyser and a notch filter. Those capabilities allowed us to evaporatively cool our molecular sample to deep quantum degeneracy. Furthermore, the polarization tunability enabled the observation of field-linked resonances and facilitated the creation of field-linked tetramers.These techniques advance the study of ultracold polar molecules and broaden the potential applications of MW tools in other platforms of quantum sciences.</description>

      <title>Detection of photon-level signals embedded in sunlight with an atomic photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of few-photon signals in a broadband background is an extreme challenge for photon counting, requiring filtering that accepts a narrow range of optical frequencies while strongly rejecting all others. Recent work [Zarraoa et. al, Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033338 (2024)] demonstrated that trapped single atoms can act as low dark-count narrow-band photodetectors. Here we show that this ``quantum jump photodetector'' (QJPD) approach can also detect photon-level signals embedded in strong sunlight. Using a single rubidium atom as a QJPD, we count arrivals of individual narrow-band laser photons embedded in sunlight powers of order $10^{10}$ photons/s. We derive a rate-equation model for the atom's internal-state dynamics in sunlight, and find quantitative agreement with experiment. Using this model, we calculate the channel capacity over a noisy communication channel when sending weak coherent states and detecting them in the presence of sunlight, achieving a representative rate of 0.5 bits per symbol when sending 150 probe photons per 10 ms time-bin, embedded in 1 nW of sunlight (of order $10^{10}$ photons/s in the visible and near-infrared bands). The demonstration may benefit background-limited applications such as daytime light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote magnetometry, and free-space classical and quantum optical communications.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic generation from two weakly coupled molecules: a simple tight-binding model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of high harmonics is a strongly nonlinear effect that allows to probe properties of the target and to study electron dynamics in matter. It has been investigated in many different kinds of targets, including molecular gases, liquids and solids. Recently, high-harmonic generation was studied in organic molecular crystals by Wiechmann et al. [Nat. Commun. 16, 9890 (2025)]. It was found that the laser-polarization-dependent harmonic yield is sensitive to the weak couplings between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor molecules. In this paper, the impact of the laser polarization angle and the intermolecular interaction on the harmonic yield is examined in detail using a simple but insightful two-dimensional tight-binding system that models a molecular dimer, i.e. two weakly coupled molecules. We find that the intensities of lower harmonic orders tend to maximize for a laser polarization direction aligning with the molecular axes, whereas higher harmonic orders rather show the strongest yield for a polarization direction along the intermolecular axis. We further demonstrate that the harmonic order at which the maximum flips from the molecular to the intermolecular direction strongly depends on the intermolecular coupling strength. To gain a deeper insight into the origins of the findings, we include a detailed adiabatic analysis, showing that the flipping of the maximum yield towards the intermolecular direction is already contained qualitatively in the adiabatically following states.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian many-body phase transition in a Rydberg-atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics with parity-time (PT) symmetry offers a powerful framework for exploring the complex interplay of dissipation and coherent interactions in open quantum systems. While PT-symmetry breaking has been studied in various physical systems, its observation on a quantum many-body level remains elusive. Here, we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian XY model in a strongly-interacting Rydberg-atom array. By measuring the Loschmidt Echo of a fully polarized state, we observe distinct dynamical signatures of a PT-symmetry-breaking phase transition. Dipole interactions are found to play a crucial role, not only determining the transition point but also triggering a non-Hermitian many-body blockade effect that protects the Loschmidt Echo from decay with a non-monotonic dependence on the system size. Our results reveal intricate interaction-induced effects on PT-symmetry breaking and open the door for exploring non-Hermitian many-body dynamics beyond single-particle and mean-field paradigms.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Anti-Stokes Luminescence Thermometry in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate temperature mapping at the nanoscale is a critical challenge in modern science and technology, as conventional methods fail at these dimensions. To address this challenge, we demonstrate a highly sensitive nanothermometer using anti-Stokes photoluminescence, also known as photoluminescence upconversion (UPL), in monolayer tungsten disulfide ($\mathrm{WS_2}$). Leveraging the direct band gap and strong exciton-phonon coupling in the two-dimensional monolayers, we achieve an exceptional relative sensitivity above $4\%\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ across the 300 K to 425 K range, ranking it among the best-performing materials reported. A strong resonantly enhanced UPL is observed, confirming the central role of optical phonons in the upconversion mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a new analytical model to quantitatively describe the UPL process, taking into account the interplay of phonon populations, bandgap narrowing, and substrate effects, which predicts resonant temperatures and provides a framework with broad applicability to any material exhibiting an anti-Stokes photoluminescence response. To demonstrate its use as a high-resolution optical thermometer, we map a $20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ thermal gradient across a $20\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ long monolayer with a spatial resolution of $1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. With its high sensitivity, strong signal, and excellent reproducibility, our work establishes monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide as a leading platform for non-invasive thermal sensing in advanced microelectronic and biological systems.</description>

      <title>SDQC: Distributed Quantum Computing Architecture Utilizing Entangled Ion Qubit Shuttling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Shuttling-based Distributed Quantum Computing (SDQC), a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of physical qubit shuttling and distributed quantum computing to enable scalable trapped-ion quantum computing. SDQC performs non-local quantum operations by distributing entangled ion qubits via deterministic shuttling, combining the high-fidelity and deterministic operations of shuttling-based architectures with the parallelism and pipelining advantages of distributed quantum computing. We present (1) a practical architecture incorporating quantum error correction (QEC), (2) pipelining strategies to exploit parallelism in entanglement distribution and measurement, and (3) a performance evaluation in terms of logical error rate and clock speed. For a 256-bit elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) instance, which requires 2,871 logical qubits at code distance 13, SDQC achieves a logical error rate which is $1.20^{+0.94}_{-0.45}\times10^{-8}$ of Photonic DQC error rate and $3.79^{+5.09}_{-2.84}\times10^{-3}$ of Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) error rate, while providing 2.82 times faster logical clock speed than QCCD.</description>

      <title>Formation of bosonic $^{23}$Na$^{41}$K Feshbach molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold Feshbach molecules are a crucial intermediate step for the creation of quantum degenerate gases of strongly dipolar molecules. After coherent transfer to the rovibrational ground state, these dimers can realize stable dipolar gases with strong, tunable long-range interactions. Here, we report the creation of bosonic $^{23}$Na$^{41}$K Feshbach molecules by radio-frequency (RF) association. An RF pulse applied on the molecular side of an interspecies Feshbach resonance at 73.6(1)~G associates up to $1.1(1)\times10^4$ molecules from a thermal mixture of $^{23}$Na and $^{41}$K atoms. Measurements of the binding energy reveal a broad resonance width of 5.1(2)~G, facilitating robust control over interspecies interactions. The molecule lifetime in the presence of background atoms exceeds 2~ms, extending to 7~ms after removal of $^{23}$Na. These results constitute a key step toward the production of ultracold $^{23}$Na$^{41}$K ground state molecules for the exploration of novel many-body phenomena in strongly dipolar Bose gases.</description>

Abstract: Trapped-ion quantum sensors have become highly sensitive tools for the search of physics beyond the Standard Model. Recently, stringent tests of local Lorentz-invariance (LLI) have been conducted with precision spectroscopy in trapped ions. We here elaborate on robust radio-frequency composite-pulse spectroscopy at second long coherence times in the magnetic sublevels of the long-lived $^{2}F_{7/2}$ state of a trapped $^{172}$Yb$^{+}$ ion which is scalable to spatially extended multi-ion systems. We compare two Ramsey-type composite rf pulse sequences, a GSE sequence and a UR10 that decouple the energy levels from magnetic field noise, enabling robust and accurate spectroscopy. Both sequences are characterized theoretically and experimentally in the spin-$1/2$\ $^{2}S_{1/2}$ electronic ground state of $^{172}$Yb$^+$ and results show that the UR10 sequence is 38 (13) times more robust against pulse duration (frequency detuning) errors than the GSE sequence. We extend our simulations to the eight-level manifold of the $^2F_{7/2}$ state, which is highly sensitive to a possible violation of LLI, and show that the UR10 sequence can be used for high-fidelity Ramsey spectroscopy in noisy environments. The UR10 sequence is implemented experimentally in the $^2F_{7/2}$ manifold and a coherent signal of up to 2.5\,s is reached. In reference we have implemented this sequence and used it to perform the most stringent test of LLI in the electron-photon sector to date with a single Yb$^{+}$ ion. Due to the high robustness of the UR10 sequence, it can be applied on larger ion crystals to improve tests of Lorentz symmetry further. We demonstrate that the sequence can also be used to extract the quadrupole moment of the meta-stable $^{2}F_{7/2}$ state, obtaining a value of $\Theta\,=\,-0.0298(38)\,ea^{2}_{0}$ which is in agreement with the value deduced from clock measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum-mechanical numerical model of interaction between dark atom and nucleus of substance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis of composite $XHe$ dark atoms may provide solution to the long-standing problem of direct searches for dark matter particles. The main problem of the $XHe$ dark atom is its ability to strongly interact with the nucleus of substance, arising from the unshielded nuclear attraction between the helium nucleus and the nucleus of matter. It is assumed that in order to prevent the destruction of the bound structure of dark atom, the effective potential of interaction between $XHe$ and the nucleus of substance must have dipole Coulomb barrier that prevents the fusion of dark matter atom particles with the nucleus of substance. The problem in describing the interaction between dark atom and substance nucleus is the three-body problem, for which an exact analytical solution is not available. Consequently, to assess the physical meaning of the proposed scenario, it is essential to develop a numerical approach. Our approach involves consistently developing an accurate quantum mechanical description of this three-body system, comprising bound dark atom and the external nucleus of substance. We incorporate the necessary effects and interactions to enhance the precision of the results, which helps to elucidate the most significant aspects of the proposed dark atom scenario.</description>
