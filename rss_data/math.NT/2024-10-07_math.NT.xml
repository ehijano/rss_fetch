      <description>arXiv:2410.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Kato's Swan conductor to systematically investigate the Brauer $p$-dimension of henselian discretely valued fields of residual characteristic $p&gt;0$. We transform the period-index problem of these fields into the symbol length problem for certain abelian groups relating to Kahler differentials of residue fields.</description>

      <title>First-order definability of Darmon points in number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given number field $K$, we give a $\forall\exists\forall$-first order description of affine Darmon points over $\mathbb{P}^1_K$, and show that this can be improved to a $\forall\exists$-definition in a remarkable particular case. Darmon points, which are a geometric generalization of perfect powers, constitute a non-linear set-theoretical filtration between $K$ and its ring of $S$-integers, the latter of which can be defined with universal formulas, as has been progressively proven by Koenigsmann, Park, and Eisentr\"ager &amp; Morrison. We also show that our formulas are uniform with respect to all possible $S$, with a parameter-free uniformity, and we compute the number of quantifiers and a bound for the degree of the defining polynomial.</description>

      <title>Non-vanishing for cubic Hecke $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-vanishing problem for the family of Hecke $L$-functions associated to primitive cubic characters defined over the Eisenstein quadratic number field $\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$. We prove unconditionally that a positive proportion of Hecke $L$-functions associated to the cubic residue symbols $\chi_q$ with $q \in \mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ squarefree and $q \equiv 1 \pmod{9}$ do not vanish at the central point.
  Our proof goes through the method of first and second mollified moments. The principal new contribution of this paper is the asymptotic evaluation of the mollified second moment with power saving error term. No asymptotic formula for the mollified second moment of a cubic family was previously known (even over function fields). Our new approach makes crucial use of Patterson's evaluation of the Fourier coefficients of the cubic metaplectic theta function, Heath-Brown's cubic large sieve, and a Lindel\"{o}f-on-average upper bound for the second moment of cubic Dirichlet series that we establish.
  The significance of our result is that the (unitary) family considered does not satisfy a perfectly orthogonal large sieve bound. This is quite unlike other families of Dirichlet $L$-functions in the literature for which unconditional results are known: the symplectic family of quadratic characters and the unitary family of all Dirichlet characters $\chi \pmod{q}$. Consequently, our proof has fundamentally different features from the corresponding works of Soundararajan and of Iwaniec and Sarnak.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conjecture due to Bertrand and Rodriguez Villegas asserts that the 1-norm of the nonzero element in an exterior power of the units of a number field has a certain lower bound. We prove this conjecture for the exterior square case when the number field is a real multi-quadratic Galois extension of any degree of the rationals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conjecture due to Bertrand and Rodriguez Villegas asserts that the 1-norm of the nonzero element in an exterior power of the units of a number field has a certain lower bound. For the exterior square case of totally real quartic extensions of the rationals, Costa and Friedman gave a lower bound of 0.802. We prove that the bound can be improved to 1.203 when the extension is further assumed to be Galois.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's Tenth Problem for some Noncommutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Hilbert's tenth problem for two families of noncommutative rings. Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $p$. We start by showing that Hilbert's tenth problem has a negative answer over the twisted polynomial ring $K\{\tau\}$ and its left division ring of fractions $K(\tau)$. We prove that the recursively enumerable sets and Diophantine sets of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}\{\tau\}$ coincide. We reduce Hilbert's tenth problem over $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}\{\!\{\tau\}\!\}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}(\!(\tau)\!)$, the twisted version of the power series and Laurent series, to the commutative case. Finally, we show that the different models of $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$ in $K\{\tau\}$ we created are all equivalent in some sense which we will define. We then move on to the second family of rings, coming from differential polynomials. We show that Hilbert's tenth problem over $K[\partial]$ has a negative answer. We prove that Hilbert's tenth problem over the left division ring of fractions $K(\partial_1,\ldots,\partial_k)$ can be reduced to Hilbert's tenth problem over $C(t_1,\ldots,t_k)$ where $C$ is the field of constants of $K$. This gives a negative answer for $k \geq 2$ if the field of constants is $\mathbb{C}$ and for $k\geq 1$ if it is $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of the error terms in the divisor and circle problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution functions of several classical error terms in analytic number theory, focusing on the remainder term in the Dirichlet divisor problem $\Delta(x)$. We first bound the discrepancy between the distribution function of $\Delta(x)$ and that of a corresponding probabilistic random model, improving results of Heath-Brown and Lau. We then determine the shape of its large deviations in a certain uniform range, which we believe to be the limit of our method, given our current knowledge about the linear relations among the $\sqrt{n}$ for square-free positive integers $n$. Finally, we obtain similar results for the error terms in the Gauss circle problem and in the second moment of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Kato's Swan conductor to study the Brauer $p$-dimension of fields of characteristic $p&gt;0$. We mainly investigate two types of fields: henselian discretely valued fields and semi-global fields. While investigating the Brauer $p$-dimension of semi-global fields, we use a Gersten-type sequence to analyse the ramification behavior of a Brauer class in a $2$-dimensional regular local ring. Using this result, we give a partial result on the Brauer $p$-dimension of function fields of algebraic curves over $\bar{k}((t))$ with good reduction.</description>

      <title>On the analytic extension of Random Riemann Zeta Functions for some probabilistic models of the primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first step in the formulation and study of the Riemann Hypothesis is the analytic continuation of the Riemann Zeta Function (RZF) in the full Complex Plane with a pole at $s=1$. In the current work, we study the analytic continuation of two random versions of RZF using, for $Re s&gt;1$, the Euler representation of ZF in terms of the product of functions over primes. In the first case, we substitute in the Euler product pseudo-prime numbers from the famous Cram\'er Model. In the second case, we use pseudo-primes with local symmetries. We show that in the Cram\'er case analytic continuation is possible $\mathbb{P}$-a.s. for $Res&gt;1/2$, but not through the critical line $Re s=1/2.$ In the second case, we show that the analytic continuation is possible in a larger domain. We also study for the Cram\'er pseudo-primes several problems from Additive Number Theory.</description>

      <title>Distinction of the Steinberg representation with respect to a symmetric pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a non-archimedean local field of residual characteristic $p\neq 2$. Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over $K$, let $\theta$ be an involution of $G$ over $K$, and let $H$ be the connected component of $\theta$-fixed subgroup of $G$ over $K$. By realizing the Steinberg representation of $G$ as the $G$-space of complex smooth harmonic cochains following the idea of Broussous--Court\`es, we study its space of distinction by $H$ as a finite dimensional complex vector space. We give an upper bound of the dimension, and under certain conditions, we show that the upper bound is sharp by explicitly constructing a basis using the technique of Poincar\'e series. Finally, we apply our general theory to the case where $G$ is a general linear group and $H$ a special orthogonal subgroup, which leads to a complete classification result.</description>

      <title>Dense generic well-rounded lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.00958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the densest lattice sphere packings also typically have large kissing numbers. The sphere packing density maximization problem is known to have a solution among well-rounded lattices, of which the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is the simplest example. The integer lattice is also an example of a generic well-rounded lattice, i.e., a well-rounded lattice with a minimal kissing number. However, the integer lattice has the worst density among well-rounded lattices. In this paper, the problem of constructing explicit generic well-rounded lattices with dense sphere packings is considered. To this end, so-called tame lattices recently introduced by Damir and Mantilla-Soler are utilized. Tame lattices came to be as a generalization of the ring of integers of certain abelian number fields. The sublattices of tame lattices constructed in this paper are shown to always result in either a generic well-rounded lattice or the lattice $A_n$, with density ranging between that of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $A_n$. In order to find generic well-rounded lattices with densities beyond that of $A_n$, explicit deformations of some known densest lattice packings are constructed, yielding a family of generic well-rounded lattices with densities arbitrarily close to the optimum. In addition to being an interesting mathematical problem on its own right, the constructions are also motivated from a more practical point of view. Namely, generic well-rounded lattices with high packing density make good candidates for lattice codes used in secure wireless communications.</description>

Abstract: We study linkage of $(d+1)$-fold quadratic Pfister forms over function fields in one variable over a henselian valued field of 2-cohomological dimension $d$. Specifically, we characterise this property in terms of linkage of quadratic Pfister forms over function fields over the residue field of the henselian valued field; in full generality in characteristic different from 2, and for most complete discretely valued fields in characteristic 2. As an application, we obtain a proof that $(d+2)$-fold quadratic Pfister forms over function fields in one variable over a $d$-dimensional higher local field are linked.</description>

      <title>On the set of stable primes for postcritically infinite maps over number fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many interesting questions in arithmetic dynamics revolve, in one way or another, around the (local and/or global) reducibility behavior of iterates of a polynomial. We show that for very general families of integer polynomials $f$ (and, more generally, rational functions over number fields), the set of stable primes, i.e., primes modulo which all iterates of $f$ are irreducible, is a density zero set. Compared to previous results, our families cover a much wider ground, and in particular apply to $100\%$ of polynomials of any given odd degree, thus adding evidence to the conjecture that polynomials with a "large" set of stable primes are necessarily of a very specific shape, and in particular are necessarily postcritically finite.</description>

Abstract: We explore distribution questions for rational maps on the projective line $\mathbb{P}^1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ within the framework of arithmetic dynamics, drawing analogies to elliptic curves. Specifically, we investigate counting problems for rational maps $\phi$ of fixed degree $d \geq 2$ with prescribed reduction properties. Our main result establishes that the set of rational maps with minimal resultant has positive density. Additionally, for degree 2 rational maps, we perform explicit computations demonstrating that over $32.7\%$ possess a squarefree, and hence minimal, resultant.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for complementary sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the n-th positive square number is easy, as it is simply $n^2$. But how do we find the complementary sequence, i.e. the n-th positive nonsquare number? For this case there is an explicit formula. However, for general constraints on a number, this is harder to find. In this paper, we study how to compute the n-th integer that does (or does not) satisfy a certain condition. In particular, we consider it as a fixed point problem, relate it to the iterative method of Lambek and Moser, study a bisection approach to this problem and provide formulas for various complementary sequences such as the non-k-gonal numbers, non-k-gonal pyramidal numbers, non-k-simplex numbers, non-sum-of-k-th powers and non-k-th powers.</description>

      <title>The tower property on the genericity of global theta lifts between orthogonal-symplectic dual pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tower property concerning the genericity of global theta lifts between quasi-split $O_{2n}$ and $Sp_{2m}$ inspired by Rallis's tower property. By examining the relationship between the poles of partial $L$-functions and special Bessel and Fourier-Jacobi periods, we prove that the first occurrence of theta lifts between quasi-split orthogonal groups and symplectic groups preserves genericity.</description>

      <title>Tropical invariants for binary quintics and reduction types of Picard curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We express the reduction types of Picard curves in terms of tropical invariants associated to binary quintics. We also give a general framework for tropical invariants associated to group actions on arbitrary varieties. The problem of finding tropical invariants for binary forms fits in this general framework by mapping the space of binary forms to symmetrized versions of the Deligne-Mumford compactification $\overline{M}_{0,n}$.</description>
