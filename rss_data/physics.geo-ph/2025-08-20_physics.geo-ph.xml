      <title>Modelling the Earth's magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Earth's magnetic field can be decomposed into spherical harmonics, and the exact coefficients of the decomposition can be determined through a few measurements of its value at different locations. Using measurements from a magnetometer on board the International Space Station, we computed the multipolar moments of an expansion in spherical harmonics to order 3, calculated the location of the magnetic dip poles, and produced an intensity map of the magnetic field across the globe. The accuracy of the results was evaluated by comparison with data from the International Geomagnetic Reference Field.</description>

      <title>Potential Global Sequestration of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide by Drylands Forestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10641v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drylands forestation offers the potential for significant long-term sequestration of atmospheric CO$_2$. Consider sequestration of both organic and inorganic carbon by a planted semi-arid forest, based on carbon that originates from atmospheric CO$_2$. Measurements at Israel's Yatir forest give a sequestration rate of $\sim$550 gram CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ as organic carbon in the tree's biomass. In addition, $\sim$216 gram CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ precipitates as calcite (CaCO$_3$) in the soil due to a combination of microbial activity on organic soil carbon, and the reaction of soil water with CO$_2$ exhaled from tree roots. The exhaled CO$_2$ is formed when glucose (produced by photosynthesis) is oxidized to supply energy for the trees' cellular processes. Significantly, low rainfall in drylands precludes dissolving precipitated calcite. Published estimates restrict the potential drylands surface available for sustainable forestation to $\sim$4.5 million km$^2$, only $\sim$10$\%$ of the global drylands. The dominant limitation is the apparent lack of water. However, immediately under many drylands, there are fossil waters that had recharged underlying aquifers during prior wetter climatic regimes. Conservatively, including this water, at least 9.0 million km$^2$ is available for afforestation. Such an area may yield a potential total annual sequestration rate of $\sim$7.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$, divided between $\sim$5.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$ (organic) and $\sim$2.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$ (inorganic); a respectable $\sim$35$\%$ of the annual rate of atmospheric CO$_2$ increase. However, considering the reduction in land surface albedo (reflectivity), the effective cooling would be $\sim$5.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$. Drylands reforestation would provide additional area for sequestration.</description>
