      <title>MobileRAG: A Fast, Memory-Efficient, and Energy-Efficient Method for On-Device RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective on server infrastructures, but its application on mobile devices is still underexplored due to limited memory and power resources. Existing vector search and RAG solutions largely assume abundant computation resources, making them impractical for on-device scenarios. In this paper, we propose MobileRAG, a fully on-device pipeline that overcomes these limitations by combining a mobile-friendly vector search algorithm, \textit{EcoVector}, with a lightweight \textit{Selective Content Reduction} (SCR) method. By partitioning and partially loading index data, EcoVector drastically reduces both memory footprint and CPU usage, while the SCR method filters out irrelevant text to diminish Language Model (LM) input size without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that MobileRAG significantly outperforms conventional vector search and RAG methods in terms of latency, memory usage, and power consumption, while maintaining accuracy and enabling offline operation to safeguard privacy in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Handling out-of-order input arrival in CEP engines on the edge combining optimistic, pessimistic and lazy evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Complex Event Processing, handling out-of-order, late, and duplicate events is critical for real-time analytics, especially on resource-constrained devices that process heterogeneous data from multiple sources. We present LimeCEP, a hybrid CEP approach that combines lazy evaluation, buffering, and speculative processing to efficiently handle data inconsistencies while supporting multi-pattern detection under relaxed semantics. LimeCEP integrates Kafka for efficient message ordering, retention, and duplicate elimination, and offers configurable strategies to trade off between accuracy, latency, and resource consumption. Compared to state-of-the-art systems like SASE and FlinkCEP, LimeCEP achieves up to six orders of magnitude lower latency, with up to 10 times lower memory usage and 6 times lower CPU utilization, while maintaining near-perfect precision and recall under high-disorder input streams, making it well-suited for non-cloud deployments.</description>

      <title>Data Agent: A Holistic Architecture for Orchestrating Data+AI Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Data+AI systems utilize data-driven techniques to optimize performance, but they rely heavily on human experts to orchestrate system pipelines, enabling them to adapt to changes in data, queries, tasks, and environments. For instance, while there are numerous data science tools available, developing a pipeline planning system to coordinate these tools remains challenging. This difficulty arises because existing Data+AI systems have limited capabilities in semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning. Fortunately, we have witnessed the success of large language models (LLMs) in enhancing semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning abilities. It is crucial to incorporate LLM techniques to revolutionize data systems for orchestrating Data+AI applications effectively.
  To achieve this, we propose the concept of a 'Data Agent' - a comprehensive architecture designed to orchestrate Data+AI ecosystems, which focuses on tackling data-related tasks by integrating knowledge comprehension, reasoning, and planning capabilities. We delve into the challenges involved in designing data agents, such as understanding data/queries/environments/tools, orchestrating pipelines/workflows, optimizing and executing pipelines, and fostering pipeline self-reflection. Furthermore, we present examples of data agent systems, including a data science agent, data analytics agents (such as unstructured data analytics agent, semantic structured data analytics agent, data lake analytics agent, and multi-modal data analytics agent), and a database administrator (DBA) agent. We also outline several open challenges associated with designing data agent systems.</description>

      <title>PathDB: A system for evaluating regular path queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PathDB is a Java-based graph database designed for in-memory data loading and querying. By utilizing Regular Path Queries (RPQ) and a closed path algebra, PathDB processes paths through its three main components: the parser, the logical plan, and the physical plan. This modular design allows for targeted optimizations and modifications without impacting overall functionality. Benchmark experiments illustrate PathDB's execution times and flexibility in handling dynamic and complex path queries, compared to baseline methods like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) guided by an automaton, highlighting its optimizations that contribute to its performance.</description>

      <title>Conversational LLMs Simplify Secure Clinical Data Access, Understanding, and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As ever-larger clinical datasets become available, they have the potential to unlock unprecedented opportunities for medical research. Foremost among them is Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), the world's largest open-source EHR database. However, the inherent complexity of these datasets, particularly the need for sophisticated querying skills and the need to understand the underlying clinical settings, often presents a significant barrier to their effective use. M3 lowers the technical barrier to understanding and querying MIMIC-IV data. With a single command it retrieves MIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance (or hooks into the hosted BigQuery), and-via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)-lets researchers converse with the database in plain English. Ask a clinical question in natural language; M3 uses a language model to translate it into SQL, executes the query against the MIMIC-IV dataset, and returns structured results alongside the underlying query for verifiability and reproducibility. Demonstrations show that minutes of dialogue with M3 yield the kind of nuanced cohort analyses that once demanded hours of handcrafted SQL and relied on understanding the complexities of clinical workflows. By simplifying access, M3 invites the broader research community to mine clinical critical-care data and accelerates the translation of raw records into actionable insight.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Explanation of Shapley Value in Data Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Shapley value is widely used for data valuation in data markets. However, explaining the Shapley value of an owner in a data coalition is an unexplored and challenging task. To tackle this, we formulate the problem of finding the counterfactual explanation of Shapley value in data coalitions. Essentially, given two data owners $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ has a higher Shapley value than $B$, a counterfactual explanation is a smallest subset of data entries in $A$ such that transferring the subset from $A$ to $B$ makes the Shapley value of $A$ less than that of $B$. We show that counterfactual explanations always exist, but finding an exact counterfactual explanation is NP-hard. Using Monte Carlo estimation to approximate counterfactual explanations directly according to the definition is still very costly, since we have to estimate the Shapley values of owners $A$ and $B$ after each possible subset shift. We develop a series of heuristic techniques to speed up computation by estimating differential Shapley values, computing the power of singular data entries, and shifting subsets greedily, culminating in the SV-Exp algorithm. Our experimental results on real datasets clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our method and the effectiveness of counterfactuals in interpreting the Shapley value of an owner.</description>

      <title>A bibliometric analysis on the current situation and hot trends of the impact of microplastics on soil based on CiteSpace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to comprehensively grasp the research status and development trends of soil microplastics (MPs). It collects studies from the Web of Science Core Collection covering the period from 2013 to 2024. Employing CiteSpace and VOSviewer, the paper conducts in - depth analyses of literature regarding the environmental impacts of microplastics. These analyses involve keyword co - occurrence, clustering, burst term identification, as well as co - occurrence analysis of authors and institutions. Microplastics can accumulate in soil, transfer through food chains, and ultimately affect human health, making the research on them essential for effective pollution control. Focusing on the international research on the impacts of microplastics on soil and ecosystems, the study reveals a steadily increasing trend in the number of publications each year, reaching a peak of 956 articles in 2024. A small number of highly productive authors contribute significantly to the overall research output. The keyword clustering analysis results in ten major clusters, including topics such as plastic pollution and microbial communities. The research on soil microplastics has evolved through three distinct stages: the preliminary exploration phase from 2013 to 2016, the expansion phase from 2017 to 2020, and the integration phase from 2021 to 2024. For future research, multi - level assessments of the impacts of microplastics on soil ecosystems and organisms should be emphasized, in order to fully uncover the associated hazards and develop practical solutions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Influence-aware Group Recommendation for Online Media Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group recommendation over social media streams has attracted significant attention due to its wide applications in domains such as e-commerce, entertainment, and online news broadcasting. By leveraging social connections and group behaviours, group recommendation (GR) aims to provide more accurate and engaging content to a set of users rather than individuals. Recently, influence-aware GR has emerged as a promising direction, as it considers the impact of social influence on group decision-making. In earlier work, we proposed Influence-aware Group Recommendation (IGR) to solve this task. However, this task remains challenging due to three key factors: the large and ever-growing scale of social graphs, the inherently dynamic nature of influence propagation within user groups, and the high computational overhead of real-time group-item matching.
  To tackle these issues, we propose an Enhanced Influence-aware Group Recommendation (EIGR) framework. First, we introduce a Graph Extraction-based Sampling (GES) strategy to minimise redundancy across multiple temporal social graphs and effectively capture the evolving dynamics of both groups and items. Second, we design a novel DYnamic Independent Cascade (DYIC) model to predict how influence propagates over time across social items and user groups. Finally, we develop a two-level hash-based User Group Index (UG-Index) to efficiently organise user groups and enable real-time recommendation generation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework, EIGR, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Thunderbolt: Concurrent Smart Contract Execution with Non-blocking Reconfiguration for Sharded DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09409v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharding has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing blockchain system scalability. However, existing sharding approaches face unique challenges when applied to Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based protocols that integrate expressive smart contract processing. Current solutions predominantly rely on coordination mechanisms like 2PC and require transaction read/write sets to optimize parallel execution. These requirements introduce two fundamental limitations: 1) additional coordination phases incur latency overhead, and 2) pre-declaration of read/write sets proves impractical for Turing-complete smart contracts with dynamic access patterns.
  This paper presents Thunderbolt, a novel sharding architecture for both single-shard transactions (Single-shard TXs) and cross-shard transactions (Cross-shard TXs) and enables nonblocking reconfiguration to ensure system liveness. Our design introduces 4 key innovations: 1) each replica serves dual roles as a full-shard representative and transaction proposer, employing the Execution-Order-Validation (EOV) model for Single-shard TXs and Order-Execution (OE) model for Cross-shard TXs. 2) we develop a DAG-based coordination protocol that establishes deterministic ordering between two transaction types while preserving concurrent execution capabilities. 3) we implement a dynamic concurrency controller that schedules Single-shard TXs without requiring prior knowledge of read/write sets, enabling runtime dependency resolution. 4) Thunderbolt introduces a nonblocking shard reconfiguration mechanism to address censorship attacks by featuring frequent shard re-assignment without impeding the construction of DAG nor blocking consensus. Thunderbolt achieves a 50x throughput improvement with 64 replicas compared to serial execution in the Tusk framework.</description>

      <title>SimBank: from Simulation to Solution in Prescriptive Process Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods. Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges, such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case, it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.</description>
