      <title>Employing the coupled EUHFORIA-OpenGGCM model to predict CME geoeffectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) is a physics-based data-driven solar wind and CME propagation model designed for space weather forecasting and event analysis investigations. Although EUHFORIA can predict the solar wind plasma and magnetic field properties at Earth, it is not equipped to quantify the geoeffectiveness of the solar transients in terms of the geomagnetic indices like the disturbance storm time (Dst) index and the eauroral indices that quantify the impact of the magnetized plasma encounters on Earth's magnetosphere. Therefore, we couple EUHFORIA with the Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM), a magnetohydrodynamic model of the response of Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere, to transient solar wind characteristics. In this coupling, OpenGGCM is driven by the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field obtained from EUHFORIA simulations to produce the magnetospheric and ionospheric response to the CMEs. This coupling is validated with two observed geoeffective CME events driven with the spheromak flux-rope CME model. We compare these simulation results with the indices obtained from OpenGGCM simulations driven by the measured solar wind data from spacecraft. We further employ the dynamic time warping (DTW) technique to assess the model performance in predicting Dst. The main highlight of this study is to use EUHFORIA simulated time series to predict the Dst and auroral indices 1 to 2 days in advance, as compared to using the observed solar wind data at L1, which only provides predictions 1 to 2 hours before the actual impact.</description>

      <title>Impact of solar wind disappearance event on Martian nightside ionospheric species: First results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, we report the impact of a rarest solar wind phenomenon, i.e., disappearing solar wind (DSW) event on the Martian nightside ionosphere using MAVEN spacecraft datasets. During an extremely low solar wind density event, the nightside ionospheric densities particularly above 200 km, including electrons and ions (NO+, O2+, CO2+, C+, N+, O+, and OH+) experience significant enhancement at a fixed altitude. The electron and ion densities increase by a factor of ~2.5 and 10-67, respectively, compared to average quiet time. The increased plasma density, during DSW, suggests the expansion of the Martian ionosphere under extremely low solar wind dynamic pressure (~1.4 $\times 10^{-11}$ Pa) contrasting with nightside ionospheric thermal pressure (&gt;$10^{-10}$ Pa). Further, the day-to-night plasma transport through cross-terminator magnetic topology may also be a contributing factor, causing the increased nightside ionospheric density. Therefore, this study sheds light on an unusual extreme state of the Mars-solar wind interaction.</description>
