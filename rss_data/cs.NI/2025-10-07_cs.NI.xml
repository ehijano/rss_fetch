      <title>Scalable Ground Station Selection for Large LEO Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective ground station selection is critical for low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellite constellations to minimize operational costs, maximize data downlink volume, and reduce communication gaps between access windows. Traditional ground station selection typically begins by choosing from a fixed set of locations offered by Ground Station-as-a-Service (GSaaS) providers, which helps reduce the problem scope to optimizing locations over existing infrastructure. However, finding a globally optimal solution for stations using existing mixed-integer programming methods quickly becomes intractable at scale, especially when considering multiple providers and large satellite constellations. To address this issue, we introduce a scalable, hierarchical framework that decomposes the global selection problem into single-satellite, short time-window subproblems. Optimal station choices from each subproblem are clustered to identify consistently high-value locations across all decomposed cases. Cluster-level sets are then matched back to the closest GSaaS candidate sites to produce a globally feasible solution. This approach enables scalable coordination while maintaining near-optimal performance. We evaluate our method's performance on synthetic Walker-Star test cases (1-10 satellites, 1-10 stations), achieving solutions within 95% of the global IP optimum for all test cases. Real-world evaluations on Capella Space (5 satellites), ICEYE (40), and Planet's Flock (96) show that while exact IP solutions fail to scale, our framework continues to deliver high-quality site selections.</description>

      <title>Short-circuiting Rings for Low-Latency AllReduce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient collective communication is critical for many distributed ML and HPC applications. In this context, it is widely believed that the Ring algorithm for the AllReduce collective communication operation is optimal only for large messages, while Recursive Doubling is preferable for small ones due to its logarithmic number of steps compared to the linear number for Ring. In this paper, we challenge this long-held assumption and show that the Ring algorithm can remain optimal even for short messages in ring-based GPU-to-GPU topologies, once realistic propagation delays and link capacity constraints are accounted for. We find that the total propagation delay for both Ring and Recursive Doubling essentially sums to the same value, but the latter incurs significantly higher congestion due to longer hop counts, leading to increased completion times. This surprising result motivates our case for in-collective adaptive topologies, particularly in the context of emerging photonic interconnects, which can break through the limitations of static topology designs at the collective communication granularity. We design a \emph{simple and fast} heuristic for circuit-switching that enables Recursive Doubling to exploit dynamically reconfigurable photonic paths, carefully balancing reconfiguration delays, propagation latencies, and link congestion to minimize overall completion time. Our preliminary evaluations, using realistic reconfiguration delays, show that our circuit-switching schedules enable faster completion times for Recursive Doubling, even compared to Ring AllReduce on static ring topologies. We conclude by highlighting key challenges and future research directions for realizing practical, in-collective photonic switching.</description>

      <title>A distributed routing protocol for sending data from things to the cloud leveraging fog technology in the large-scale IoT ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fog computing integrates cloud and edge resources. According to an intelligent and decentralized method, this technology processes data generated by IoT sensors to seamlessly integrate physical and cyber environments. Internet of Things uses wireless and smart objects. They communicate with each other, monitor the environment, collect information, and respond to user requests. These objects have limited energy resources since they use batteries to supply energy. Also, they cannot replace their batteries. As a result, the network lifetime is limited and short. Thus, reducing energy consumption and accelerating the data transmission process are very important challenges in IoT networks to reduce the response time. In the data transmission process, selecting an appropriate cluster head node is very important because it can reduce the delay when sending data to the fog. In this paper, cluster head nodes are selected based on several important criteria such as distance, residual energy, received signal strength, and link expiration time. Then, objects send the processed data to the server hierarchically through a balanced tree. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the energy-efficient centroid-based routing protocol (EECRP) and the Emergency Response IoT based on Global Information Decision (ERGID) in terms of packet delivery rate, delay, response time, and network lifetime.</description>

      <title>An efficient grey theory-driven path selection for energy efficiency control in the Internet of Things using fog and cloud computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the big data exchange on the Internet of Things, proper routing and selecting the best routes for fast data transmission improve network performance. There are major challenges, like high delay, when cloud computing is used. Therefore, one solution is to use other schemes, such as fog computing. In fog computing, all data is not sent to the cloud and the fog nodes close to objects are used for data processing. This reduces the network delay. In this paper, we propose an overlapping clustering method called MFCT-IoT to select the best cluster head nodes to guarantee the fast data transfer from objects to fog nodes. The selected cluster head nodes are responsible for sending the collected data to the closest fog nodes in the network edge. Upon receiving the data, the fog nodes process it, and if a response is ready, they respond immediately to the object. Otherwise, they merge and transmit the data to the cloud servers, which are considered as the root node of the proposed hierarchical tree. After processing, the merged data is sent to the object. We compare the proposed scheme with two schemes, including ERGID and EECRP. These schemes are evaluated based on various criteria, including the response time, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, network lifetime, and energy consumption. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms others in terms of all criteria.</description>

      <title>A Position- and Energy-Aware Routing Strategy for Subterranean LoRa Mesh Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although LoRa is predominantly employed with the single-hop LoRaWAN protocol, recent advancements have extended its application to multi-hop mesh topologies. Designing efficient routing for LoRa mesh networks remains challenging due to LoRa's low data rate and ALOHA-based MAC. Prior work often adapts conventional protocols for low-traffic, aboveground networks with strict duty cycle constraints or uses flooding-based methods in subterranean environments. However, these approaches inefficiently utilize the limited available network bandwidth in these low-data-rate networks due to excessive control overhead, acknowledgments, and redundant retransmissions. In this paper, we introduce a novel position- and energy-aware routing strategy tailored for subterranean LoRa mesh networks aimed at enhancing maximum throughput and power efficiency while also maintaining high packet delivery ratios. Our mechanism begins with a lightweight position learning phase, during which LoRa repeaters ascertain their relative positions and gather routing information. Afterwards, the network becomes fully operational with adaptive routing, leveraging standby LoRa repeaters for recovery from packet collisions and losses, and energy-aware route switching to balance battery depletion across repeaters. The simulation results on a representative subterranean network demonstrate a 185% increase in maximum throughput and a 75% reduction in energy consumption compared to a previously optimized flooding-based approach for high traffic.</description>

      <title>6G-Enabled Digital Twin Framework for Real-Time Cyber-Physical Systems: An Experimental Validation with Industrial Bearing Fault Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrated with Digital Twin (DT) technology face critical limitations in achieving real-time performance for mission-critical industrial applications. Existing 5G-enabled systems suffer from latencies exceeding 10ms, which are inadequate for applications requiring sub-millisecond response times, such as autonomous industrial control and predictive maintenance. This research aims to develop and validate a 6G-enabled Digital Twin framework that achieves ultra-low latency communication and real-time synchronization between physical industrial assets and their digital counterparts, specifically targeting bearing fault detection as a critical industrial use case. The proposed framework integrates terahertz communications (0.1-1 THz), intelligent reflecting surfaces, and edge artificial intelligence within a five-layer architecture. Experimental validation was conducted using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset, implementing comprehensive feature extraction (15 time and frequency domain features) and Random Forest classification algorithms. The system performance was evaluated against traditional WiFi-6 and 5G networks across multiple metrics, including classification accuracy, end-to-end latency, and scalability. It achieved 97.7% fault classification accuracy with 0.8ms end-to-end latency, representing a 15.6x improvement over WiFi-6 (12.5ms) and 5.25x improvement over 5G (4.2ms) networks. The system demonstrated superior scalability with sub-linear processing time growth and maintained consistent performance across four bearing fault categories (normal, inner race, outer race, and ball faults) with macro-averaged F1-scores exceeding 97%.</description>

      <title>A4FN: an Agentic AI Architecture for Autonomous Flying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This position paper presents A4FN, an Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) architecture for intent-driven automation in Flying Networks (FNs) using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as access nodes. A4FN leverages Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable real-time, context-aware network control via a distributed agentic system. It comprises two components: the Perception Agent (PA), which semantically interprets multimodal input -- including imagery, audio, and telemetry data -- from UAV-mounted sensors to derive Service Level Specifications (SLSs); and the Decision-and-Action Agent (DAA), which reconfigures the network based on inferred intents. A4FN embodies key properties of Agentic AI, including autonomy, goal-driven reasoning, and continuous perception-action cycles. Designed for mission-critical, infrastructure-limited scenarios such as disaster response, it supports adaptive reconfiguration, dynamic resource management, and interoperability with emerging wireless technologies. The paper details the A4FN architecture, its core innovations, and open research challenges in multi-agent coordination and Agentic AI integration in next-generation FNs.</description>

      <title>Analysis of LTE/5G Network Performance Parameters in Smartphone Use Cases: A Study of Packet Loss, Delay, and Slice Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses optimizing two of the most important performance parameters, packet loss, and delay, in the critical path optimization of LTE and 5G networks using metaheuristic algorithms to play a vital role in the smartphone user experience. In this context, nine metaheuristic algorithms, such as WOA, PSO, and ABC, have been studied for their effectiveness in various slices of networks: eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC. It can be seen from the results that WOA performed the best: it reduced packet loss by 31% and delay by 6.3 ms; PSO followed closely with a 30% packet loss reduction with a decrease of 6.1 ms in delay. In most scenarios, ABC accomplished good results with a packet loss reduction of 29% and a delay decrease of 6 ms in mMTC scenarios. These results emphasize how selecting appropriate algorithms based on the intended network slice is crucial for optimizing resource utilization and network efficiency. It provides a quantitative framework for assessing and improving the reliability and responsiveness of an LTE/5G network. It encourages more research in hybrid optimization techniques and real-time adaptation mechanisms for further improvements</description>

      <title>The Door to Policy Portability might be an IP Overlay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portable service mesh implementations enable layer 4 to layer 7 policy enforcement across diverse infrastructures, but they remain tied to infrastructure-specific layer 3 network policies. Network policies enable control over IP traffic flow regardless of whether traffic is authorized at the application level. However, not all infrastructure supports enforcing them, and achieving consistent enforcement across heterogeneous environments is challenging. For example, studies have shown that the majority of Kubernetes clusters do not enforce any network policies. We propose integrating network policy enforcement with service meshes to protect data-plane traffic in a portable, infrastructure-agnostic way. This enables developers to define integrated layer 3 to layer 7 policies and ensure they are enforced across any infrastructure. Additionally, due to its portability, our approach can be used outside the service environment to enforce policies on end-user traffic and provide an end-to-end secure extended overlay. Our solution builds an overlay layer 3 network and enforces layer 3 policies by routing traffic through specific policy enforcement points and utilizing authorization keys. We prototyped our idea using Kubernetes and Istio, and show that while it adds less than 1ms latency, it can implement complex policies comparable to Kubernetes native network policies.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Adaptive Federated Learning for mmWave Sector Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamforming techniques use massive antenna arrays to formulate narrow Line-of-Sight signal sectors to address the increased signal attenuation in millimeter Wave (mmWave). However, traditional sector selection schemes involve extensive searches for the highest signal-strength sector, introducing extra latency and communication overhead. This paper introduces a dynamic layer-wise and clustering-based federated learning (FL) algorithm for beam sector selection in autonomous vehicle networks called enhanced Dynamic Adaptive FL (eDAFL). The algorithm detects and selects the most important layers of a machine learning model for aggregation in the FL process, significantly reducing network overhead and failure risks. eDAFL also considers intra-cluster and inter-cluster approaches to reduce overfitting and increase the abstraction level. We evaluate eDAFL on a real-world multi-modal dataset, demonstrating improved model accuracy by approximately 6.76% compared to existing methods, while reducing inference time by 84.04% and model size by up to 52.20%.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Indoor LoRaWAN Path Loss: Parametric Regression Comparisons, Shadow Fading, and Calibrated Fade Margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor LoRaWAN propagation is shaped by structural and time-varying context factors, which challenge log-distance models and the assumption of log-normal shadowing. We present an environment-aware, statistically disciplined path loss framework evaluated using leakage-safe cross-validation on a 12-month campaign in an eighth-floor office measuring 240 m^2. A log-distance multi-wall mean is augmented with environmental covariates (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure), as well as the signal-to-noise ratio. We compare multiple linear regression with regularized variants, Bayesian linear regression, and a selective second-order polynomial applied to continuous drivers. Predictor relevance is established using heteroscedasticity-robust Type II and III analysis of variance and nested partial F tests. Shadow fading is profiled with kernel density estimation and non-parametric families, including Normal, Skew-Normal, Student's t, and Gaussian mixtures. The polynomial mean reduces cross-validated RMSE from 8.07 to 7.09 dB and raises R^2 from 0.81 to 0.86. Out-of-fold residuals are non-Gaussian; a 3-component mixture captures a sharp core with a light, broad tail. We convert accuracy into reliability by prescribing the fade margin as the upper-tail quantile of cross-validated residuals, quantifying uncertainty via a moving-block bootstrap, and validating on a held-out set. At 99% packet delivery ratio, the environment-aware polynomial requires 25.7 dB versus 27.7 to 27.9 dB for linear baselines. This result presents a deployment-ready, interpretable workflow with calibrated reliability control for indoor Internet of Things planning, aligned with 6G targets.</description>

      <title>Rethinking HTTP API Rate Limiting: A Client-Side Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HTTP underpins modern Internet services, and providers enforce quotas to regulate HTTP API traffic for scalability and reliability. When requests exceed quotas, clients are throttled and must retry. Server-side enforcement protects the service. However, when independent clients' usage counts toward a shared quota, server-only controls are inefficient; clients lack visibility into others' load, causing their retry attempts to potentially fail. Indeed, retry timing is important since each attempt incurs costs and yields no benefit unless admitted. While centralized coordination could address this, practical limitations have led to widespread adoption of simple client-side strategies like exponential backoff. As we show, these simple strategies cause excessive retries and significant costs. We design adaptive client-side mechanisms requiring no central control, relying only on minimal feedback. We present two algorithms: ATB, an offline method deployable via service workers, and AATB, which enhances retry behavior using aggregated telemetry data. Both algorithms infer system congestion to schedule retries. Through emulations with real-world traces and synthetic datasets with up to 100 clients, we demonstrate that our algorithms reduce HTTP 429 errors by up to 97.3% compared to exponential backoff, while the modest increase in completion time is outweighed by the reduction in errors.</description>

      <title>Impossible Cloud Network: A Decentralized Internet Infrastructure Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internet faces a sovereignty crisis due to power concentration and data growth among a few hyperscalers, leading to centralization and loss of user control. This consolidation risks censorship and creates single points of failure. While Web3 offers decentralized solutions, they often sacrifice either scalability, decentralization, or security, which are key elements in the blockchain trilemma. These solutions also struggle with limited access to enterprise-grade hardware and frequently rely on centralized infrastructure. The Impossible Cloud Network (ICN) addresses these issues by creating a multi-tiered, decentralized infrastructure layer. ICN offers a composable service layer, an enterprise-grade hardware resource layer, and a transparent, permissionless HyperNode network for performance enforcement. By strategically decoupling and decentralizing each layer, ICN aims to provide an open, extensively scalable infrastructure that ensures digital sovereignty, eliminates single points of trust, enables service programmability, and offers a decoupled architecture for limitless possibilities in the future internet.</description>

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and satellite direct-to-device (D2D) technology are at the heart of the next-generation global connectivity which promises direct access to space-based broadband services for unmodified 3GPP-compliant handsets. With a rapidly evolving ecosystem, it is important to evaluate the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and profitability of these services. By assessing the technological aspects as well as economic implications, stakeholders can make informed decisions about investment, development, and deployment strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive techno-economic analysis (TEA) framework for evaluating LEO-based satellite D2D systems. The framework integrates a global satellite constellation model, radio propagation aspects including atmospheric and rainfall attenuation models compliant with ITU-R recommendations, 3GPP-compliant capacity calculations, realistic global population data, and an all-encompassing cost model accounting for both capital and operational expenses associated with space and ground segments. Further, the framework evaluates three different architectural options for realizing a global non-terrestrial network (NTN) for satellite D2D services. With an emphasis on reproducibility, the framework has been implemented through significant enhancements to an open-source tool. The economic assessment reveals that global satellite D2D services can be provided at a monthly cost per subscriber which is comparable to terrestrial services while achieving a positive return on investment (ROI). Moreover, the results show the potential of Open RAN technology for realizing cost-effective satellite D2D services.</description>

      <title>Evaluating UORA-Based Polling Mechanism for Latency-Sensitive Uplink Traffic in Wi-Fi Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) introduced Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), which enables simultaneous transmissions through centralized resource allocation. However, effective uplink scheduling requires the Access Point (AP) to identify which stations (STAs) have data to transmit. This typically necessitates polling for buffer status reports, a process that becomes increasingly inefficient and unscalable with growing device density. In this paper, we study how the Uplink OFDMA-based Random Access (UORA) feature improves the scalability and delay experienced by latency-sensitive data streams. We show that UORA enables efficient uplink scheduling while opportunistically identifying buffered traffic from unscheduled STAs, striking a balance between coordination and scalability. Performance evaluation of different polling strategies is done by means of simulation in ns-3. The results indicate that UORA-based polling outperforms alternative schemes in densely deployed network environments with heterogeneous uplink traffic patterns. Furthermore, under highly sparse and sporadic traffic conditions, UORA-based polling yields over 40% delay reduction compared to Scheduled Access (SA) OFDMA.</description>

      <title>MECKD: Deep Learning-Based Fall Detection in Multilayer Mobile Edge Computing With Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rising aging population has increased the importance of fall detection (FD) systems as an assistive technology, where deep learning techniques are widely applied to enhance accuracy. FD systems typically use edge devices (EDs) worn by individuals to collect real-time data, which are transmitted to a cloud center (CC) or processed locally. However, this architecture faces challenges such as a limited ED model size and data transmission latency to the CC. Mobile edge computing (MEC), which allows computations at MEC servers deployed between EDs and CC, has been explored to address these challenges. We propose a multilayer MEC (MLMEC) framework to balance accuracy and latency. The MLMEC splits the architecture into stations, each with a neural network model. If front-end equipment cannot detect falls reliably, data are transmitted to a station with more robust back-end computing. The knowledge distillation (KD) approach was employed to improve front-end detection accuracy by allowing high-power back-end stations to provide additional learning experiences, enhancing precision while reducing latency and processing loads. Simulation results demonstrate that the KD approach improved accuracy by 11.65% on the SisFall dataset and 2.78% on the FallAllD dataset. The MLMEC with KD also reduced the data latency rate by 54.15% on the FallAllD dataset and 46.67% on the SisFall dataset compared to the MLMEC without KD. In summary, the MLMEC FD system exhibits improved accuracy and reduced latency.</description>

      <title>Toward Co-adapting Machine Learning Job Shape and Cluster Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allocating resources to distributed machine learning jobs in multi-tenant torus-topology clusters must meet each job's specific placement and communication requirements, which are typically described using shapes. There is an inherent tension between minimizing network contention and maximizing cluster utilization when placing various-shaped jobs. While existing schedulers typically optimize for one objective at the expense of the other, we demonstrate that both can be achieved simultaneously.
  Our proposed approach, RFold, adapts both job shapes and the underlying cluster topology at runtime. This is accomplished by combining two techniques: (1) identifying homomorphic job shapes that support the jobs communication needs, and (2) reconfiguring the optical circuit switch-enabled topology to support more diverse job shapes. Preliminary evaluation performed on a 4096-node torus cluster simulator indicates that RFold can improve absolute cluster utilization by 57% and reduce job completion time by up to 11x relative to existing methods</description>

      <title>The Role of ISAC in 6G Networks: Enabling Next-Generation Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The commencement of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks represents a fundamental shift in the integration of communication and sensing technologies to support next-generation applications. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key concept in this evolution, enabling end-to-end support for both communication and sensing within a unified framework. It enhances spectrum efficiency, reduces latency, and supports diverse use cases, including smart cities, autonomous systems, and perceptive environments. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of ISAC's role in 6G networks, beginning with its evolution since 5G and the technical drivers behind its adoption. Core principles and system variations of ISAC are introduced, followed by an in-depth discussion of the enabling technologies that facilitate its practical deployment. The paper further analyzes current research directions to highlight key challenges, open issues, and emerging trends. Design insights and recommendations are also presented to support future development and implementation. This work ultimately try to address three central questions: Why is ISAC essential for 6G? What innovations does it bring? How will it shape the future of wireless communication?</description>

      <title>PoS-CoPOR: Proof-of-Stake Consensus Protocol with Native Onion Routing Providing Scalability and DoS-Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocols often face a trade-off between performance and security. Protocols that pre-elect leaders for subsequent rounds are vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, which can disrupt the network and compromise liveness. In this work, we present PoS-CoPOR, a single-chain PoS consensus protocol that mitigates this vulnerability by integrating a native onion routing mechanism into the consensus protocol itself. PoS-CoPOR combines stake-weighted probabilistic leader election with an anonymization layer that conceals the network identity of the next block proposer. This approach prevents targeted DoS attacks on leaders before they produce a block, thus enhancing network resilience. We implemented and evaluated PoS-CoPOR, demonstrating its ability to achieve a throughput of up to 110 tx/s with 6 nodes, even with the overhead of the anonymization layer. The results show that native anonymization can provide robust DoS resistance with only a modest impact on performance, offering a solution to build secure and scalable PoS blockchains.</description>

      <title>Semantic Channel Equalization Strategies for Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for end-to-end semantic communications, jointly learning to compress and protect task-relevant features over noisy channels. However, existing DeepJSCC schemes assume a shared latent space at transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) - an assumption that fails in multi-vendor deployments where encoders and decoders cannot be co-trained. This mismatch introduces "semantic noise", degrading reconstruction quality and downstream task performance. In this paper, we systematize and evaluate methods for semantic channel equalization for DeepJSCC, introducing an additional processing stage that aligns heterogeneous latent spaces under both physical and semantic impairments. We investigate three classes of aligners: (i) linear maps, which admit closed-form solutions; (ii) lightweight neural networks, offering greater expressiveness; and (iii) a Parseval-frame equalizer, which operates in zero-shot mode without the need for training. Through extensive experiments on image reconstruction over AWGN and fading channels, we quantify trade-offs among complexity, data efficiency, and fidelity, providing guidelines for deploying DeepJSCC in heterogeneous AI-native wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Distributed Optimization With Feasible Set Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of decentralized constrained optimization with multiple agents $E_1,\ldots,E_N$ who jointly wish to learn the optimal solution set while keeping their feasible sets $\mathcal{P}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{P}_N$ private from each other. We assume that the objective function $f$ is known to all agents and each feasible set is a collection of points from a universal alphabet $\mathcal{P}_{alph}$. A designated agent (leader) starts the communication with the remaining (non-leader) agents, and is the first to retrieve the solution set. The leader searches for the solution by sending queries to and receiving answers from the non-leaders, such that the information on the individual feasible sets revealed to the leader should be no more than nominal, i.e., what is revealed from learning the solution set alone. We develop achievable schemes for obtaining the solution set at nominal information leakage, and characterize their communication costs under two communication setups between agents. In this work, we focus on two kinds of network setups: i) ring, where each agent communicates with two adjacent agents, and ii) star, where only the leader communicates with the remaining agents. We show that, if the leader first learns the joint feasible set through an existing private set intersection (PSI) protocol and then deduces the solution set, the information leaked to the leader is greater than nominal. Moreover, we draw connection of our schemes to threshold PSI (ThPSI), which is a PSI-variant where the intersection is revealed only when its cardinality is larger than a threshold value. Finally, for various realizations of $f$ mapped uniformly at random to a fixed range of values, our schemes are more communication-efficient with a high probability compared to retrieving the entire feasible set through PSI.</description>

      <title>Wall-Street: Smart Surface-Enabled 5G mmWave for Roadside Networking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 5G mmWave roadside networks promise high bandwidth but face significant challenges in maintaining reliable connections for users moving at high speed. Frequent handovers, complex beam alignment, and signal blockage from car bodies lead to service interruptions and degraded performance. We present Wall-Street, a vehicle-mounted smart surface that enhances 5G mmWave connectivity for in-vehicle users. Wall-Street improves mobility management by (1) steering outdoor mmWave signals into the vehicle for shared coverage, enabling a single, collective handover decision for all users; (2) enabling neighbor-cell search without interrupting data transfer, allowing for seamless handovers; and (3) connecting users to a new cell before disconnecting from the old cell for reliable handovers. We have implemented and integrated Wall-Street in the COSMOS testbed and evaluated its real-time performance with multiple gNBs and users inside a surface-mounted vehicle, driving on a nearby road. In multi-UE scenarios, Wall-Street improves TCP throughput by up to 78% and reduces RTT by up to 34% over the standard 5G Standalone handover protocol.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Viability of Quantum-Resistant IKEv2 over Constrained and Internet-Scale Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within 1-2 decades, quantum computers may become powerful enough to break current public-key cryptography, prompting authorities such as the IETF and NIST to push for adopting quantum-resistant cryptography (QRC) in ecosystems like Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). Yet, IPsec struggles to adopt QRC, primarily because Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2), which sets up IPsec sessions, cannot easily tolerate the large public keys and digital signatures of QRC. Many IETF RFCs have been proposed to integrate QRC into IKEv2, but their performance and interplay remain largely untested in practice. In this paper, we measure the performance of these RFCs over constrained links by developing a flexible, reproducible measurement testbed for IPsec with quantum-resistant IKEv2 proposals. Deploying our testbed in lossy wireless links and on the internationally distributed FABRIC testbed for Internet scenarios, we reveal that bottlenecks arise with quantum-resistant IKEv2 under high round-trip times, non-trivial packet loss, or other constraints. Our results, including the revelation of a 400-1000-fold increase in data overhead over high-loss wireless links, expose the shortcomings of today's RFCs and call for further work in this vital area of post-quantum network security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthesizing radio-frequency (RF) data given the transmitter and receiver positions, e.g., received signal strength indicator (RSSI), is critical for wireless networking and sensing applications, such as indoor localization. However, it remains challenging due to complex propagation interactions, including reflection, diffraction, and scattering. State-of-the-art neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods achieve high-fidelity RF data synthesis but are limited by long training times and high inference latency. We introduce GSRF, a framework that extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from the optical domain to the RF domain, enabling efficient RF data synthesis. GSRF realizes this adaptation through three key innovations: First, it introduces complex-valued 3D Gaussians with a hybrid Fourier-Legendre basis to model directional and phase-dependent radiance. Second, it employs orthographic splatting for efficient ray-Gaussian intersection identification. Third, it incorporates a complex-valued ray tracing algorithm, executed on RF-customized CUDA kernels and grounded in wavefront propagation principles, to synthesize RF data in real time. Evaluated across various RF technologies, GSRF preserves high-fidelity RF data synthesis while achieving significant improvements in training efficiency, shorter training time, and reduced inference latency.</description>

      <title>Scaling Data Center TCP to Terabits with Laminar</title>

Abstract: Laminar is the first TCP stack designed for the reconfigurable match-action table (RMT) architecture, widely used in high-speed programmable switches and SmartNICs. Laminar reimagines TCP processing as a pipeline of simple match-action operations, enabling line-rate performance with low latency and minimal energy consumption, while maintaining compatibility with standard TCP and POSIX sockets. Leveraging novel techniques like optimistic concurrency, pseudo segment updates, and bump-in-the-wire processing, Laminar handles the transport logic, including retransmission, reassembly, flow, and congestion control, entirely within the RMT pipeline.
  We prototype Laminar on an Intel Tofino2 switch, and demonstrate its scalability to terabit speeds, its flexibility, and robustness to network dynamics. Laminar delivers RDMA-equivalent performance, saving up to 16 host CPU cores versus the TAS kernel-bypass TCP stack with short RPC workloads, achieving 1.3$\times$ higher peak throughput at 5$\times$ lower 99.99p tail latency. At scale, Laminar drives nearly $1$Bpps of TCP processing while keeping RPC tail latency near $20\mu s$. For streaming workloads, Laminar achieves $25$Mpps per-core, enough to saturate the line-rate. It significantly benefits real applications: a key-value store on Laminar doubles throughput-per-watt while maintaining a 99.99p tail latency lower than TAS's best case tail latency, and SPDK's NVMe-oTCP reaches RDMA-level efficiency. Demonstrating Laminar's flexibility, we implement TCP stack extensions, including a sequencer API for a linearizable distributed shared log, Timely congestion control, and delayed ACKs. Finally, Laminar generalizes to FPGA SmartNICs, delivering $3\times$ ToNIC's packet rate under equal timing.</description>

      <title>Making Logic a First-Class Citizen in Network Data Generation with ML</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative ML models are increasingly popular in networking for tasks such as telemetry imputation, prediction, and synthetic trace generation. Despite their capabilities, they suffer from two shortcomings: (i) their output is often visibly violating well-known networking rules, which undermines their trustworthiness; and (ii) they are difficult to control, frequently requiring retraining even for minor changes.
  To address these limitations and unlock the benefits of generative models for networking, we propose a new paradigm for integrating explicit network knowledge in the form of first-order logic rules into ML models used for networking tasks. Rules capture well-known relationships among used signals, e.g., that increased latency precedes packet loss. While the idea is conceptually straightforward, its realization is challenging: networking knowledge is rarely formalized into rules, and naively injecting them into ML models often hampers ML's effectiveness. This paper introduces NetNomos a multi-stage framework that (1) learns rules directly from data (e.g., measurements); (2) filters them to distinguish semantically meaningful ones; and (3) enforces them through a collaborative generation between an ML model and an SMT solver.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained AI Model Caching and Downloading With Coordinated Multipoint Broadcasting in Multi-Cell Edge Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 6G networks are envisioned to support on-demand AI model downloading to accommodate diverse inference requirements of end users. By proactively caching models at edge nodes, users can retrieve the requested models with low latency for on-device AI inference. However, the substantial size of contemporary AI models poses significant challenges for edge caching under limited storage capacity, as well as for the concurrent delivery of heterogeneous models over wireless channels. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI model caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability, stemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a shared pre-trained model with frozen parameters. This system selectively caches model parameter blocks (PBs) at edge nodes, eliminating redundant storage of reusable parameters across different cached models. Additionally, it incorporates coordinated multipoint (CoMP) broadcasting to simultaneously deliver reusable PBs to multiple users, thereby enhancing downlink spectrum utilization. Under this arrangement, we formulate a model downloading delay minimization problem to jointly optimize PB caching, migration (among edge nodes), and broadcasting beamforming. To tackle this intractable problem, we develop a distributed multi-agent learning framework that enables edge nodes to explicitly learn mutual influence among their actions, thereby facilitating cooperation. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to adaptively generate synthetic training samples through a predictive model, boosting sample efficiency and accelerating policy learning. Both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments validate the superior convergence performance of the proposed learning framework.</description>

      <title>LUMION: Fast Fault Recovery for ML Jobs Using Programmable Optical Fabrics</title>

Abstract: When accelerators fail in modern ML datacenters, operators migrate the affected ML training or inference jobs to entirely new racks. This approach, while preserving network performance, is highly inefficient, requiring datacenters to reserve full racks of idle accelerators for fault tolerance. In this paper, we address this resource inefficiency by introducing LUMION, a novel reconfigurable optical fabric for connecting accelerators within a datacenter rack. Instead of migrating entire ML jobs, LUMION dynamically integrates spare accelerators into ongoing workloads as failures occur, thereby maintaining consistent performance without costly migrations. We show the benefits of LUMION by building an end-to-end hardware prototype. Our experiments fine-tune Llama 3.2 and show that LUMION swaps a failed GPU with a healthy one and restarts the ML job within ~ 1 second of the failure. LUMION achieves higher inter-GPU bandwidth compared to traditional electrical racks after replacing failed accelerators with spare ones, leading to nearly 2X improvement in fine-tuning throughput.</description>
