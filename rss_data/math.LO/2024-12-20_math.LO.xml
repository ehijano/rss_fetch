      <title>The adjacent Hindman's theorem and the $\mathbb Z$-Ramsey theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the weakening of Ramsey's theorem that arises from considering only translation-invariant colourings of pairs, and show that this has the same strength (both from the viewpoint of Reverse Mathematics and from the viewpoint of Computability Theory) as the "adjacent Hindman's theorem", proposed by L. Carlucci (Arch. Math. Log. 57 (2018), 381--359). We also investigate some higher dimensional versions of both of these statements.</description>

      <title>Canonical quotients in model theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study canonical quotients in model theory, mainly stable quotients of type-definable groups and invariant types in NIP theories. We extend the modelling property to continuous theories and use it to study $n$-dependence in hyperdefinable sets. Furthermore, we study maximal WAP and tame quotients of $S_X(\mathfrak{C})$, where $\mathfrak{C}$ is a monster model of a complete theory $T$ and $X$ is an $\emptyset$-type-definable set and show that the Ellis groups of the maximal WAP quotient flow and the maximal tame quotient flow do not depend on the choice of the monster model $\mathfrak{C}$.</description>

      <title>Bochvar algebras: A categorical equivalence and the generated variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper quasivariety BCA of Bochvar algebras, which serves as the equivalent algebraic semantics of Bochvar's external logic, was introduced by Finn and Grigolia in and extensively studied in a recent work by two of these authors. In this paper, we show that the algebraic category of Bochvar algebras is equivalent to a category whose objects are pairs consisting of a Boolean algebra and a meet-subsemilattice (with unit) of the same. Furthermore, we provide an axiomatisation of the variety $V(BCA) generated by Bochvar algebras. Finally, we axiomatise the join of Boolean algebras and semilattices within the lattice of subvarieties of V(BCA).</description>

      <title>Undecidability in the Ramsey theory of polynomial equations and Hilbert's tenth problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that several sets of interest arising from the study of partition regularity and density Ramsey theory of polynomial equations over integral domains are undecidable. In particular, we show that the set of homogeneous polynomials $p \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ for which the equation $p(x_1,\cdots,x_n) = 0$ is partition regular over $\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$ is undecidable conditional on Hilbert's tenth problem for $\mathbb{Q}$. For other integral domains, we get the analogous result unconditionally. More generally, we determine the exact lightface complexity of the various sets of interest. For example, we show that the set of homogeneous polynomials $p \in \mathbb{F}_q(t)[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ for which the equation $p(x_1,\cdots,x_n) = 0$ is partition regular over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)\setminus\{0\}$ is $\Pi_2^0$-complete.
  We also prove several other results of independent interest. These include a compactness principle and a uniformity principle for density Ramsey theory on countable cancellative left amenable semigroups, as well as the existence of the natural extension for measure preserving systems of countable cancellative left reversible semigroups.</description>

      <title>Semantics Foundation of Reductive Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of logic has largely been through the 'deductive' paradigm: conclusions are inferred from established premisses. However, the use of logic in the context of both human and machine reasoning is typically through the dual 'reductive' perspective: collections of sufficient premisses are generated from putative conclusions. We call this paradigm, 'reductive logic'. This expression of logic encompass as diverse reasoning activities as proving a formula in a formal system to seeking to meet a friend before noon on Saturday. This paper is a semantical analysis of reductive logic. In particular, we provide mathematical foundations for representing and reasoning about 'reduction operators'. Heuristically, reduction operators may be thought of as `backwards' inference rules. In this paper, we address their mathematical representation, how they are used in the context of reductive reasoning, and, crucially, what makes them 'valid'.</description>

      <title>An independence of the MIN principle from the PHP principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the typical forcing of M. M\"uller and derive conditions on the forcing frame for which generic expansions preserve injective/bijective pigeonhole principle for polynomial-time computable graphs of functions. Applying this machinery, we show that the bounded arithmetic theory $\forall \textsf{T}^1_2(\textsf{PV}(\alpha))$ augmented by the polynomial-time injective pigeonhole principle does not prove the linear ordering, tournament, and dual weak pigeonhole principles.</description>

      <title>Hilbert polynomials for finitary matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01560v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a tuple $\Phi = (\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_m)$ of commuting maps on a finitary matroid $X$. We show that if $\Phi$ satisfies certain conditions, then for any finite set $A\subseteq X$, the rank of $\{\phi_1^{r_1}\cdots\phi_m^{r_m}(a):a \in A\text{ and }r_1+\cdots+r_m = t\}$ is eventually a polynomial in $t$ (we also give a multivariate version of the polynomial). This allows us easily recover Khovanskii's theorem on the growth of sumsets, the existence of the classical Hilbert polynomial, and the existence of the Kolchin polynomial. We also prove some new Kolchin polynomial results for differential exponential fields and derivations on o-minimal fields, as well as a new result on the growth of Betti numbers in simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Fontaine-Wintenberger theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a perfectoid field, we find an elementary extension and a henselian defectless valuation on it, whose value group is divisible and whose residue field is an elementary extension of the tilt. This specializes to the almost purity theorem over perfectoid valuation rings and Fontaine-Wintenberger. Along the way, we prove an Ax-Kochen/Ershov principle for certain deeply ramified fields, which also uncovers some new model-theoretic phenomena in positive characteristic. Notably, we get that the perfect hull of $\mathbb{F}_p(t)^h$ is an elementary substructure of the perfect hull of $\mathbb{F}_p(\!(t)\!)$.</description>
