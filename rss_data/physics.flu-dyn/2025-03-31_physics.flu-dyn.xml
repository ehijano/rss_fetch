      <title>Impact of freestream turbulence and thrust coefficient on wind turbine-generated wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how variations in freestream turbulence (FST) and the thrust coefficient ($C_T$) influence wind turbine wakes. Wakes generated at $C_T \in \{0.5, 0.7,0.9\}$ are exposed to turbulent inflows with varying FST intensity ($1\% \lesssim TI_{\infty} \lesssim 11\%$) and integral length scale ($0.1 \lesssim \mathcal{L}_x/D \lesssim 2$, $D$ is the rotor diameter). For high-$TI_{\infty}$ inflows, a flow region within the wake is observed several diameters downstream, where a mean momentum deficit persists despite the turbulence intensity having already homogenised with the freestream, challenging traditional wake definitions. A ``turning point'' in the mean wake width evolution is identified, beyond which wakes spread at slower rates. Near-field ($x/D \lesssim 7$) wake growth rate increases with higher $TI_{\infty}$ and $C_T$, while far-field ($x/D \gtrsim 15$) wake growth rate decreases with higher $TI_{\infty}$ -- a finding with profound implications for wind turbine wake modelling that also bridges the gap with entrainment behaviours observed in bluff and porous body wakes exposed to FST. Increasing $\mathcal{L}_x$ delays wake recovery onset and reduces the mean wake width, with minimal effect on the spreading rate. Both $C_T$ and FST influence high- and low-frequency wake dynamics, with varying contributions in the near and far fields. For low-$TI_{\infty}$ and small-$\mathcal{L}_x$ inflows, wake meandering is minimal, sensitive to $C_T$, and appears to be triggered by shear layer instabilities. Wake meandering is enhanced for high-$TI_{\infty}$ and large-$\mathcal{L}_x$ inflows and is dominated by background turbulence. This emphasises the complex role of FST integral length scale: while increasing $\mathcal{L}_x$ amplifies meandering, it does not necessarily translate to larger mean wake width due to the concurrent suppression of entrainment rate.</description>

      <title>Universal energy cascade in homogeneous binary fluid turbulence: A direct comparison of different exact relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Below critical temperature, turbulence prevents the spontaneous phase separation of binary mixtures, resulting in a phase arrested state of emulsion which is of significant interest for scientific and industrial applications. The current work is an extensive continuation of our initial theoretical investigation into the nature and universality of associated energy cascade (Pan and Banerjee, PRE, 2022). In addition to the previously derived divergence and correlator forms of the exact relations, a Banerjee-Galtier type divergence-free form of the exact relation is derived under the explicit assumption of homogeneity. By performing three-dimensional direct numerical simulations with up to $1024^3$ grid points, we show that the sum of the kinetic and active energy associates a Kolmogorov-like universal cascade with constant flux rate across inertial scales. Despite term-by-term deviations, the cascade rates computed from all three exact laws show excellent agreement, thereby confirming the equivalence of different exact relations and hence the feasibility of determining the net cascade rate from any of the three formulations. Notably, the two dominant flux rates of the divergence form are found to cross each other roughly at the domain size, which also serves as an infrared cut-off for the inverse cascade of the small scale active energy. This behaviour is phenomenologically justified based on the interplay between the flow and surface dynamics of a phase arrested binary fluid.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulations of supersonic three-dimensional turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersonic turbulent channels subjected to sudden spanwise acceleration at initial friction Reynolds numbers of approximately 500 and different Mach numbers are studied through direct numerical simulations. The response to the spanwise acceleration creates a transient period where the flow exhibits three-dimensionality in the mean statistics. This enables a detailed study of the thermal transport and development of velocity transformations and Reynolds analogies for compressible turbulent flows in swept-like conditions. Extensions of velocity transformations to three-dimensional flows demonstrate near-wall self-similarity of the velocity, providing evidence for Morkovin's hypothesis in nonequilibrium conditions. A similarity solution for the spanwise velocity, valid during the initial transient, is also presented. During the transient, both the thermal fluctuations and turbulent kinetic energy decrease, consistent with previous observations in incompressible flows (Lozano-Duran, \textit{et al.} 2019, Moin, \textit{et al.} 1990). For sufficiently strong spanwise acceleration, $Q_{3}$ $(+T',+v')$ and $Q_{1}$ $(-T',-v')$ events become more significant than sweep and ejections across the channel, creating changes in sign in the velocity-temperature covariances. The temporal evolution of the orientation and sizes of the turbulent kinetic energy and temperature carrying structures is quantified through structure identification and spectra. Finally, the generalized Reynolds analogy (Zhang, \textit{et al.} 2012) is derived for a transient three-dimensional flow, allowing predictions of the mean temperature from the velocity.</description>

      <title>Reynolds number effects on surface-induced secondary flows in turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the effect of friction Reynolds number ($Re_\tau \approx 3{,}000$--$13{,}000$) on secondary flows in three-dimensional turbulent boundary layers induced by spanwise surface heterogeneity. Using a combination of floating-element drag balance and high-resolution hot-wire anemometry, we examine how varying spanwise spacing ($S/\delta$) influences frictional drag, turbulence intensity, spectral energy distribution, and the organisation of coherent structures. The results reveal that secondary flows modulate turbulence differently depending on $S/\delta$, with strong near-wall effects at $S/\delta &lt; 1$ and outer-layer modulation at $S/\delta \gtrsim 1$. A robust spectral signature of secondary flows peaking at $\lambda_x \approx 3\delta$ and $y \approx 0.5\delta$ emerges across all cases. This peak coexists with, or suppresses, very-large-scale motions (VLSMs), depending on flow region and spacing. While VLSMs are suppressed in low-momentum pathways (LMPs), they gradually recover in high-momentum pathways (HMPs) at higher $S/\delta$ and $Re_\tau$. These findings offer new insight into the interplay between secondary motions and scale interactions in three-dimensional turbulent boundary layers, with implications for drag control, mixing, and surface design.</description>

      <title>Large eddy simulation of a utility-scale vertical-axis marine hydrokinetic turbine under live-bed conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coupled large-eddy simulation (LES) and bed morphodynamics study to investigate the impact of sediment dynamics on the wake flow, wake recovery and power production of a utility-scale marine hydrokinetic vertical-axis turbine (VAT). A geometry-resolving immersed boundary method is employed to capture the turbine components, the waterway, and the sediment layer. Our numerical findings reveal that increasing the turbine tip speed ratio (TSR) would intensify turbulence, accelerate wake recovery, and increase erosion at the base of the device. Furthermore, it is found that the deformation of the bed around the turbine induces a jet-like flow near the bed beneath the turbine, which enhances wake recovery. Analyzing the interactions between turbulent flow and bed morphodynamics, this study seeks to provide physical information on the environmental and operational implications of VAT deployment in natural riverine and marine environments.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling of fluid flow around rotating structures with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks, recently introduced into the field of fluid flow surrogate modeling, have been successfully applied to model the temporal evolution of various fluid flow systems. Existing applications, however, are mostly restricted to cases where the domain is time-invariant. The present work extends the application of graph neural network-based modeling to fluid flow around structures rotating with respect to a certain axis. Specifically, we propose to apply a graph neural network-based surrogate modeling for fluid flow with the mesh corotating with the structure. Unlike conventional data-driven approaches that rely on structured Cartesian meshes, our framework operates on unstructured co-rotating meshes, enforcing rotation equivariance of the learned model by leveraging co-rotating polar (2D) and cylindrical (3D) coordinate systems. To model the pressure for systems without Dirichlet pressure boundaries, we propose a novel local directed pressure difference formulation that is invariant to the reference pressure point and value. For flow systems with large mesh sizes, we introduce a scheme to train the network in single or distributed graphics processing units by accumulating the backpropagated gradients from partitions of the mesh. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is examined on two test cases: (i) fluid flow in a 2D rotating mixer, and (ii) the flow past a 3D rotating cube. Our results show that the model achieves stable and accurate rollouts for over 2000 time steps in periodic regimes while capturing accurate short-term dynamics in chaotic flow regimes. In addition, the drag and lift force predictions closely match the CFD calculations, highlighting the potential of the framework for modeling both periodic and chaotic fluid flow around rotating structures.</description>

      <title>openKARST: A novel open-source flow simulator for karst systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the open-source Python-based code openKARST for flow in karst conduit networks. Flow and transport in complex karst systems remain a challenging area of hydrogeological research due to the heterogeneous nature of conduit networks. Flow regimes in these systems are highly dynamic, with transitions from free-surface to fully pressurized and laminar to turbulent flow conditions with Reynolds numbers often exceeding one million. These transitions can occur simultaneously within a network, depending on conduit roughness properties and diameter distributions. openKARST solves the transient dynamic wave equation using an iterative scheme and is optimized with an efficient vectorized structure. Transitions from free-surface to pressurized flows in smooth and rough circular conduits are realized via a Preissmann slot approach in combination with an implementation of the Darcy-Weisbach and Manning equations to compute friction losses. To mitigate numerical fluctuations commonly encountered in the Colebrook-White equation, the dynamic switching from laminar to turbulent flows is modeled with a continuous Churchill formulation for the friction factor computation. openKARST supports common boundary conditions encountered in karst systems, as well as functionalities for network import, export and visualization. The code is verified via comparison against several analytical solutions and validated against a laboratory experiment. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the openKARST by simulating a synthetic recharge event in one of the largest explored karst networks, the Ox Bel Ha system in Mexico.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian intermittency and vertical confinement in stably stratified turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Lagrangian properties of homogeneous, stratified turbulence at different Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequencies.We show increasing vertical confinement of trajectories with increasing stratification strength highlighting the predominantly horizontal dynamics of these flows. We characterize the intermittent properties of the fluid motion by computing the probability distributions of the horizontal and vertical Lagrangian velocity increments and Lagrangian horizontal velocity structure functions, and find that horizontal velocity differences display intermittency at higher orders. Our results provide an understanding of the Lagrangian dynamics in stratified turbulence, and highlight the importance of buoyancy forces in shaping the Lagrangian statistics in these flows.</description>

      <title>Chaotic and time-periodic edge states in square duct flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the dynamics within the stability boundary between laminar and turbulent square duct flow with the aid of an edge-tracking algorithm. As for the circular pipe, the edge state turns out to be a chaotic attractor within the edge if the flow is not constrained to a symmetric subspace. The chaotic edge state dynamics is characterised by a sequence of alternating quiescent phases and regularly occurring bursting episodes. These latter reflect the different stages of the well-known streak-vortex interaction in near-wall turbulence: The edge states feature most of the time a single streak with a number of flanking quasi-streamwise vortices attached to one of the four surrounding walls. The initially straight streak undergoes the classical linear instability and eventually breaks in an intense bursting event due to the action of the quasi-streamwise vortices. At the same time, the vortices give rise to a new generation of low-speed streaks at one of the neighbouring walls, thereby causing the turbulent activity to `switch' from one wall to the other. When restricting the edge dynamics to a single or twofold mirror-symmetric subspace, on the other hand, the outlined bursting and wall-switching episodes become self-recurrent in time. These edge states thus represent the first periodic orbits found in the square duct. In contrast to the chaotic edge states in the non-symmetric case, the imposed symmetries enforce analogue bursting cycles to simultaneously appear at two parallel opposing walls in a mirror-symmetric configuration. Both localisation of the turbulent activity to one or two walls and wall switching are shown to be a common phenomenon in low Reynolds number duct turbulence. We therefore argue that the marginally turbulent trajectories transiently visit the identified edge states during these episodes, so that the edge states become actively involved in the turbulent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bouncing microdroplets on hydrophobic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intuitively, slow droplets stick to a surface and faster droplets splash or bounce. However, recent work suggests that on non-wetting surfaces, whether microdroplets stick or bounce depends only on their size and fluid properties, but not on the incoming velocity. Here, we show using theory and experiments that even poorly wetting surfaces have a velocity-dependent criterion for bouncing of aqueous droplets, which is as high as 6 m/s for diameters of 30-50 microns on hydrophobic surfaces such as Teflon. We quantify this criterion by analyzing the interplay of dissipation, surface adhesion, and incoming kinetic energy, and describe a wealth of associated phenomena, including air bubbles and satellite droplets. Our results on inertial microdroplets elucidate fundamental processes crucial to aerosol science and technology.</description>

      <title>Two-phase pore-network model for evaporation-driven salt precipitation -- representation and analysis of pore-scale processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaporation-driven salt precipitation occurs in different contexts and leads to challenges in case of e.g. soil salinization or stress-introducing precipitation in building material. During evaporation, brine in porous media gets concentrated due to the loss of water until the solubility limit is reached and salt precipitates. Different models on the REV-scale are available, which describe the effective behavior of the system. But several studies indicate that the controlling processes of evaporation-driven salt precipitation act on the pore scale. Thus, pore-scale models are necessary for a detailed understanding. In this paper, we present a dynamic, two-phase, non-isothermal pore-network model for evaporation-driven salt precipitation. Salt precipitation is modeled with a kinetic reaction and the resulting pore-space alteration is considered. Further, the model includes influence of the salt concentration on the fluid properties and liquid corner films. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated in several numerical evaporation experiments. The model is able to represent the effects of the decrease of pore space due to precipitation on the flow, phase displacement and salt transport. Further, the influence of the location of the brine-air interface and its dependency on the presence of liquid corner flow is described. Additionally, pore-scale heterogeneities and their effects like capillary pumping can be modeled. All these pore-scale effects have an influence on the salt precipitation process and the global behavior of the porous system. The presented model provides a general tool for further investigations of salt precipitation on the pore scale and transfer to the REV scale.</description>

      <title>Curvature-based energy spectra revealing flow regime changes in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the local curvature derived from velocity vector fields or particle tracks as a surrogate for structure size to compute curvature-based energy spectra. An application to homogeneous isotropic turbulence shows that these spectra replicate certain features of classical energy spectra such as the slope of the inertial range extending towards the equivalent curvature of the Taylor microscale. As this curvature-based analysis framework is sampling based, it also allows further statistical analyses of the time evolution of the kinetic energies and curvatures considered. The main findings of these analyses are that the slope for the inertial range also appears as a salient point in the probability density distribution of the angle of the vector comprising the two time evolution components. This density distribution further exhibits changing features of its shape depending on the Rayleigh number. This Rayleigh number evolution allows to observe a change in the flow regime between the Rayleigh numbers 10^7 and 10^8. Insight into this regime change is gathered by conditionally sampling the salient time evolution behaviours and projecting them back into physical space. Concretely, the regime change is manifested by a change in the spatial distribution for the different time evolution behaviours. Finally, we show that this analysis can be applied to measured Lagrangian particle tracks.</description>

      <title>Falling plates with leading-edge vortex shedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new numerical method for thin plates falling in inviscid fluid that allows for leading-edge vortex shedding. The inclusion of leading-edge shedding restores physical dynamics to vortex-sheet models of falling bodies, and for the first time large-amplitude fluttering and tumbling are observed in inviscid simulations. Leading-edge shedding is achieved by introducing a novel quadrature rule and smoothing procedure for the Birkhoff-Rott equations. The smoothing error is controlled by a novel fencing procedure. We find a transition point between fluttering and tumbling that is consistent with previous viscous simulations and experiments, and other falling motions such as looping, autorotation are also observed as the plate density increases. The dipole street wakes behind the fluttering plates resemble those in experiments. We consider plates bent into V shapes and study the effects of density and bending angle on the qualitative falling dynamics. At small densities, increasing the bending angle stabilizes the falling motion into fluttering, while at large densities, decreasing the bending angle stabilizes the falling motion into autorotation. In the autorotation regime, the magnitude of angular velocity increases as time cubed before it reaches a terminal angular velocity, and in the fluttering regime, the fluttering frequency scales as as the $-1/2$ power of $R_1$, the plate density.</description>

      <title>Experimental measurement of the vorticity-strain alignment around extreme energy transfer events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work experimentally explores the alignment of the vorticity vector and the strain-rate tensor eigenvectors at locations of extreme upscale and downscale energy transfer. We show that the turbulent von Karman flow displays vorticity-strain alignment behavior across a large range of Reynolds numbers, which are very similar to previous studies on homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. We observe that this behavior is amplified for the largest downscale energy transfer events, which tend to be associated with sheet-like geometries. These events are also shown to have characteristics previously associated with high flow field non-linearity and singularities. In contrast the largest upscale energy transfer events display much different structures which showcase a strong preference for vortex-compression. We then show further evidence to the argument that strain-self-amplification is the most salient feature in characterizing cascade direction. Finally, we identify possible invariant behavior for the largest energy transfer events, even at scales near the Kolmogorov scale.</description>

      <title>Stochastic reduced-order Koopman model for turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic data-driven reduced-order model applicable to a wide range of turbulent natural and engineering flows is presented. Combining ideas from Koopman theory and spectral model order reduction, the stochastic low-dimensional inflated convolutional Koopman model (SLICK) accurately forecasts short-time transient dynamics while preserving long-term statistical properties. A discrete Koopman operator is used to evolve convolutional coordinates that govern the temporal dynamics of spectral orthogonal modes, which in turn represent the energetically most salient large-scale coherent flow structures. Turbulence closure is achieved in two steps: first, by inflating the convolutional coordinates to incorporate nonlinear interactions between different scales, and second, by modeling the residual error as a stochastic source. An empirical dewhitening filter informed by the data is used to maintain the second-order flow statistics within the long-time limit. The model uncertainty is quantified through either Monte Carlo simulation or by directly propagating the model covariance matrix. The model is demonstrated on the Ginzburg-Landau equations, large-eddy simulation (LES) data of a turbulent jet, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) data of the flow over an open cavity. In all cases, the model is predictive over time horizons indicated by a detailed error analysis and integrates stably over arbitrary time horizons, generating realistic surrogate data.</description>

      <title>Ostwald Ripening of Buoyancy-Driven Microbubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbubble solutions have a wide range of industrial applications, including heat transfer, agriculture, and water treatment. Therefore, understanding and controlling the size variation of bubbles is critical. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework for Ostwald ripening in buoyancy-driven microbubbles by introducing a height-dependent size distribution function. For the first time, we show that the population balance equation in steady state can be interpreted within the Lifshitz-Slezov-Wagner theory when the distribution function is redefined as the density distribution of the buoyancy-induced flux. Notably, in this form of Ostwald ripening, the distribution function approaches a scaled universal distribution, not over time, but as a function of height. We analytically derive the scaled universal distribution and show that the fifth power of the mean radius of the bubbles grows linearly with height.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Influence of Parametrized Pulsatility on Left Ventricular Washout under LVAD Support: A Computational Study Using Reduced-Order Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical therapy for patients with severe heart disease often relies on left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). It is an ongoing topic of research how complications like stagnation and thrombosis can be prevented by using artificial pulsatility. We study a parametric pulse profile and its effect on the left ventricular washout using a computational flow model. Based on finite element simulations, we construct reduced-order models to reduce the computational costs for evaluating the parametrized problem. We observe that a pulsatile flow rate improves the washout compared to a constant flow rate. In particular, we find that short, intense pulses wash out the left ventricle best, whereas the time between subsequent pulses plays no significant role.</description>

      <title>Wave-kinetic dynamics of forced-dissipated turbulent internal gravity waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal gravity waves are an essential feature of stratified media, such as oceans and atmospheres. To investigate their dynamics, we perform simulations of the forced-dissipated kinetic equation describing the evolution of the energy spectrum of weakly nonlinear internal gravity waves. During the early evolution, three well-known nonlocal interactions, the Elastic Scattering, the Induced-Diffusion, and the Parametric Subharmonic Instability, together with a Superharmonic Resonance play a prominent role. In contrast, local interactions are responsible for anisotropic energy cascade on longer time scales. We reveal emergence of a condensate at small horizontal wavevectors that can be interpreted as a pure wave-wave interaction-mediated layering process.</description>

      <title>Drop impact on a heated wet wall: deposition-on-crater regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of a liquid drop with high Reynolds and Weber numbers on a wet solid surface typically results in the emergence, rising, and expansion of a corona-like thin jet. This phenomenon is explained by the propagation of a kinematic discontinuity within the wall film. Conventional theories suggest that the corona-forming liquid jet comprises material from the impacting drop and wall film. In this study, the impact of a drop on a wall film is observed using a high-speed video system. Simultaneously, the distribution of the contact temperature at the substrate surface is measured with a high-speed infrared system. The results reveal that heat transfer predominantly occurs within the thin thermal boundary layers in the drop and substrate. Moreover, our experiments show that under our specific conditions, the drop deposits at the base of the crater while only the wall film produces the corona and splashes. Correspondingly, the secondary drops consist only of the heated material of the wall film. This regime has not been previously reported in the literature. The validated models for the diameter of the cold spot, the characteristic time, and the contact temperature developed in this study can be potentially useful for reliable modeling of spray cooling.</description>

      <title>Symmetric instability in a Boussinesq fluid on a rotating planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric instability has broad applications in geophysical and planetary fluid dynamics. It plays a crucial role in the formation of mesoscale rainbands at mid-latitudes on Earth, instability in the ocean's mixed layer, and slantwise convection on gas giants and icy moon oceans. Here, we apply linear instability analysis to an arbitrary zonally symmetric Boussinesq flow on a rotating spherical planet, with applicability to icy moon oceans. We characterize the instabilities into three types: (1) gravitational instability, occurring when stratification is unstable along angular momentum surfaces, (2) inertial instability, occurring when angular momentum shear is unstable along buoyancy surfaces, and (3) a mixed symmetric instability, occurring when neither of the previous conditions are fulfilled, but the potential vorticity has the opposite sign as planetary rotation. We note that $N^2&lt;0$ where $N$ is the Brunt--V\"ais\"al\"a frequency -- a typical criterion used to trigger convective adjustment in global ocean models -- is neither necessary nor sufficient for instability. Instead, $b_z \sin{\theta_0}&lt;0$, where $b_z$ is the stratification along the planetary rotation axis and $\theta_0$ is the local latitude, is always sufficient for instability and also necessary in the low Rossby number limit. In this limit, relevant for convection in icy moon oceans, the most unstable mode is slantwise convection parallel to the planetary rotation axis. This slantwise convection differs from the parameterized convection in existing general circulation models, whose convective schemes parameterize convection in the direction of gravity. Our results suggest that convection schemes in global ocean models must be revised before being applied to icy moon oceans.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectrically Elevated Hydrogel Evaporation for Personal Cooling under Extreme Heat Stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme heat events with wet-bulb temperatures (WBT) above 35{\deg}C pose serious risks to human survival, and conventional hydrogel evaporative cooling alone may not provide sufficient relief as it must be maintained at a sufficiently high temperature to achieve effective evaporation in hot, humid conditions. This study integrates thermoelectric devices (TEDs) with hydrogels to create an effective personal cooling solution. TEDs pump heat away from the skin to maintain comfort while simultaneously increasing the temperature of hydrogel to enhance evaporation. This hybrid system outperforms TEDs or hydrogel alone in extreme conditions (temperature up to 55{\deg}C and relative humidity up to 88%, with WBT &gt; 35{\deg}C) and can operate for over six hours with a manageable hydrogel and battery weight. The active temperature control of TEDs allows adaptation to changing thermal loads and environments. These results demonstrate the potential of hybrid evaporative and thermoelectric cooling as an efficient, adaptable, and sustainable personal cooling solution to combat extreme heat.</description>

      <title>Line tension from dual-geometry sessile droplet measurements: Combining contact-angle size-dependence data for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets to determine the line tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a thermodynamic analysis of various contributions to the size dependence of the contact-angle cosine for both axisymmetric and cylindrical sessile droplets. This shows that a commonly used method to determine the line tension from the slope of the contact-angle cosine dependence on the three-phase contact-line curvature (for axisymmetric droplets) provides a certain combination of the line tension, the adsorptions at the three interfaces, and the macroscopic contact angle. To extract the contribution related to the contact line in the leading order and determine the line tension, we propose a simple technique using droplet-size dependences of the contact angle for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets under the same conditions.</description>
