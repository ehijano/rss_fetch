      <title>Extranatural transformations, adjunctions of two variables and conjugation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adjunctions of two variables generalize the relationship between tensor product and the internal hom functor in a closed monoidal category. For a pair of ordinary adjunctions $(F\dashv U, F'\dashv U')$ conjugation relates natural transformations of the form $F\Rightarrow F'$ with natural transformations of the form $U' \Rightarrow U$. We look at conjugation for general two variable adjunctions. It is useful in the context of Grothendieck's six operations as we will show that this is an appropriate way to view the constructions of Fausk, Hu and May where they discuss things like the projection formula and internal adjunctions.
  Extensive use is made of surface diagram notation as this is a helpful way to keep track of the three dimensions of composition. This also places the work in the context of formal category theory as, for instance, closed monoidal categories are defined without reference to objects or morphisms inside them. In an appendix it is explained how an appropriate setting for this perspective is the monoidal double category of functors and profunctors, using the fact that the bicategory of profunctors has duals.</description>

      <title>Monads and limits in bicategories of circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study monads in the (pseudo-)double category $\mathbf{KSW}(\mathcal{K})$ where loose arrows are Mealy automata valued in an ambient monoidal category $\mathcal{K}$, and the category of tight arrows is $\mathcal{K}$. Such monads turn out to be elegantly described through instances of semifree bicrossed products (bicrossed products of monoids, in the sense of Zappa-Sz\'ep-Takeuchi, where one factor is a free monoid). This result which gives an explicit description of the `free monad' double left adjoint to the forgetful functor. (Loose) monad maps are interesting as well, and relate to already known structures in automata theory. In parallel, we outline what double co/limits exist in $\mathbf{KSW}(\mathcal{K})$ and express in a synthetic language, based on double category theory, the bicategorical features of Katis-Sabadini-Walters `bicategory of circuits'.</description>

      <title>DiagrammaticLearning: A Graphical Language for Compositional Training Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by deep learning regimes with multiple interacting yet distinct model components, we introduce learning diagrams, graphical depictions of training setups that capture parameterized learning as data rather than code. A learning diagram compiles to a unique loss function on which component models are trained. The result of training on this loss is a collection of models whose predictions ``agree" with one another. We show that a number of popular learning setups such as few-shot multi-task learning, knowledge distillation, and multi-modal learning can be depicted as learning diagrams. We further implement learning diagrams in a library that allows users to build diagrams of PyTorch and Flux.jl models. By implementing some classic machine learning use cases, we demonstrate how learning diagrams allow practitioners to build complicated models as compositions of smaller components, identify relationships between workflows, and manipulate models during or after training. Leveraging a category theoretic framework, we introduce a rigorous semantics for learning diagrams that puts such operations on a firm mathematical foundation.</description>

      <title>Presentations of pseudodistributive laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.12468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering the situation in which the involved pseudomonads are presented in no-iteration form, we deduce a number of alternative presentations of pseudodistributive laws including a 'decagon' form, a pseudoalgebra form, a no-iteration form, and a warping form. As an application, we show that five coherence axioms suffice in the usual monoidal definition of a pseudodistributive law.</description>

      <title>Enriched concepts of regular logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our previous work on enriched universal algebra, we define a notion of enriched language consisting of function and relation symbols whose arities are objects of the base of enrichment. In this context, we construct atomic formulas and define the regular fragment of enriched logic by taking conjunctions and existential quantifications of those. We then characterize enriched categories of models of regular theories as enriched injectivity classes in the enriched category of structures. These notions rely on the choice of a factorization system on the base of enrichment which will be used to interpret relation symbols and existential quantifications.</description>
