      <title>Commutation relations for functions of canonical conjugate operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the commutator of any two reasonable functions of several pairs of canonical conjugate operators is obtained as a sum of terms of partial derivatives of those functions (equations 9, 10 or 11). When applied to quantum mechanics, first term in the sum is formally equivalent to Poisson bracket in classical mechanics, which is a well-known result. The novelty respect other papers is the type of functions of operators considered: equations mentioned are proved valid when each function is an infinite series of positive and negative powers of these operators, as long as every series converges. Therefore, this formalism can be applied to functions such as the Coulomb potential, where the inverse of radial distance cannot be expressed as a Taylor series.</description>

      <title>The Aharonov-Bohm Hamiltonian: self-adjointness, spectral and scattering properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides an introduction and overview on some basic mathematical aspects of the single-flux Aharonov-Bohm Schr\"odinger operator. The whole family of admissible self-adjoint realizations is characterized by means of four different methods: von Neumann theory, boundary triplets, quadratic forms and Kre{\u\i}n's resolvent formalism. The relation between the different parametrizations thus obtained is explored, comparing the asymptotic behavior of functions in the corresponding operator domains close to the flux singularity. Special attention is devoted to those self-adjoint realizations which preserve the same rotational symmetry and homogeneity under dilations of the basic differential operator. The spectral and scattering properties of all the Hamiltonian operators are finally described.</description>

      <title>Poisson bundles over unordered configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a Poisson algebra bundle whose distributional sections are suitable to represent multilocal observables in classical field theory. To do this, we work with vector bundles over the unordered configuration space of a manifold $M$ and consider the structure of a $2$-monoidal category given by the usual (Hadamard) tensor product of bundles and a new (Cauchy) tensor product which provides a symmetrized version of the usual external tensor product of vector bundles on $M$. We use the symmetric algebras with respect to both products to obtain a Poisson 2-algebra bundle mimicking the construction of Peierls bracket from the causal propagator in field theory. The explicit description of observables from this Poisson algebra bundle will be carried out in a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>Distributions of consecutive level spacings of GUE and their ratio: an analytic treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent studies of many-body localization in nonintegrable quantum systems, the distribution of the ratio of two consecutive energy level spacings, $r_n=(E_{n+1}-E_n)/(E_{n}-E_{n-1})$ or $\tilde{r}_n=\min(r_n,r_n^{-1})$, has been used as a measure to quantify the chaoticity, alternative to the more conventional distribution of the level spacings, $s_n=\bar{\rho}(E_n)(E_{n+1}-E_n)$, as the former unnecessitates the unfolding required for the latter. Based on our previous work on the Tracy-Widom approach to the Janossy densities, we present analytic expressions for the joint probability distribution of two consecutive eigenvalue spacings and the distribution of their ratio for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of random Hermitian $N\times N$ matrices at $N\to\infty$, in terms of a system of differential equations. As a showcase of efficacy of our results for characterizing an approach to quantum chaoticity, we contrast them to arguably the most ideal of all quantum-chaotic spectra: the zeroes of the Riemann $\zeta$ function on the critical line at increasing heights.</description>

      <title>Independent GUE minor processes of perfect matchings on rail-yard graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study perfect matchings on the rail-yard graphs in which the right boundary condition is given by the empty partition and the left boundary can be divided into finitely many alternating line segments where all the vertices along each line segment are either removed or remained. When the edge weights satisfy certain conditions, we show that the distributions of the locations of certain types of dimers near the right boundary converge to the spectra of independent GUE minor processes. The proof is based on new quantitative analysis of a formula to compute Schur functions at general points discovered in \cite{ZL18}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A broad class of nonlinear acoustic wave models possess a Hamiltonian structure in their dissipation-free limit and a gradient flow structure for their dissipative dynamics. This structure may be exploited to design numerical methods which preserve the Hamiltonian structure in the dissipation-free limit, and which achieve the correct dissipation rate in the spatially-discrete dissipative dynamics. Moreover, by using spatial discretizations which preserve the de Rham cohomology, the non-evolving involution constraint for the vorticity may be exactly satisfied for all of time. Numerical examples are given using a mimetic finite difference spatial discretization.</description>

      <title>Structured Input-Output Modeling and Robust Stability Analysis of Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced structured input-output analysis is a powerful method for capturing nonlinear phenomena associated with incompressible flows, and this paper extends that method to the compressible regime. The proposed method relies upon a reformulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, which allows for an exact quadratic formulation of the dynamics of perturbations about a steady base flow. To facilitate the structured input-output analysis, a pseudo-linear model for the quadratic nonlinearity is proposed and the structural information of the nonlinearity is embedded into a structured uncertainty comprising unknown `perturbations'. The structured singular value framework is employed to compute the input-output gain, which provides an estimate of the robust stability margin of the flow perturbations, as well as the forcing and response modes that are consistent with the nonlinearity structure. The analysis is then carried out on a plane, laminar compressible Couette flow over a range of Mach numbers. The structured input-output gains identify an instability mechanism, characterized by a spanwise elongated structure in the streamwise-spanwise wavenumber space at a subsonic Mach number, that evolves into an oblique structure at sonic and supersonic Mach numbers. In addition, the structured input-output forcing and response modes provide insight into the thermodynamic and momentum characteristics associated with a source of instability. Comparisons with a resolvent/unstructured analysis reveal discrepancies in the distribution of input-output gains over the wavenumber space as well as in the modal behavior of an instability, thus highlighting the strong correlation between the structural information of the nonlinearity and the underlying flow physics.</description>

      <title>Integral and hypergeometric representations for multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses two primary objectives in the realm of classical multiple orthogonal polynomials with an arbitrary number of weights. Firstly, it establishes new and explicit hypergeometric expressions for type I Hahn multiple orthogonal polynomials. Secondly, applying the residue theorem and the Mellin transform, the paper derives contour integral representations for several families of orthogonal polynomials. Specifically, it presents contour integral formulas for both type I and type II multiple orthogonal polynomials in the Laguerre of the first kind, Jacobi-Pi\~neiro, and Hahn families. The evaluation of these integrals leads to explicit hypergeometric representations.</description>

      <title>Dipole Cosmology in $f(Q)$-gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$-gravity allows for the presence of a perfect fluid with a tilted velocity in the Kantowski-Sachs geometry. In this dipole model, we consider an ideal gas and we investigate the evolution of the physical parameters. The tilt parameter is constrained by the nonlinear function $f(Q)$ through the non-diagonal equations of the field equations. We find that the dynamics always reduce to the vacuum solutions of STEGR. This includes the Kasner universe, when no cosmological term is introduced by the $f(Q)$ function, and the isotropic de Sitter universe, where $f\left( Q\right) $ plays the role of the cosmological constant. In the extreme tilt limit, the universe is consistently anisotropic and accelerated. However, the final solution matches that of STEGR.</description>

      <title>Stationary Solitons in discrete NLS with non-nearest neighbour interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide a construction of stationary discrete solitons in an extended one-dimensional Discrete NLS model with non-nearest neighbour interactions. These models, models of the type with long-range interactions were studied in various other contexts. In particular, it was shown that, if the interaction strength decays sufficiently slowly as a function of distance, it gives rise to bistability of solitons, which may find applications in their controllable switching. Dynamical lattices with long-range interactions also serve as models for energy and charge transport in biological molecules. Using a dynamical systems method we are able to construct, with great accuracy, stationary discrete solitons for our model, for a large region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>PFWNN: A deep learning method for solving forward and inverse problems of phase-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-field models have been widely used to investigate the phase transformation phenomena. However, it is difficult to solve the problems numerically due to their strong nonlinearities and higher-order terms. This work is devoted to solving forward and inverse problems of the phase-field models by a novel deep learning framework named Phase-Field Weak-form Neural Networks (PFWNN), which is based on the weak forms of the phase-field equations. In this framework, the weak solutions are parameterized as deep neural networks with a periodic layer, while the test function space is constructed by functions compactly supported in small regions. The PFWNN can efficiently solve the phase-field equations characterizing the sharp transitions and identify the important parameters by employing the weak forms. It also allows local training in small regions, which significantly reduce the computational cost. Moreover, it can guarantee the residual descending along the time marching direction, enhancing the convergence of the method. Numerical examples are presented for several benchmark problems. The results validate the efficiency and accuracy of the PFWNN. This work also sheds light on solving the forward and inverse problems of general high-order time-dependent partial differential equations.</description>

One of the main focuses of this work is to construct the Backlund transformation for the different solutions of that equation through its associated Riccati equation and then that transformations further reduces to its algebraic analogue with the help of One-fold Darboux solution. Finally, its exact solutions upto three solitons are calculated with their graphical representations which reveal dynamical profiles of these solutions.</description>

      <title>Kerr--Newman Memory Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bring the Kerr--Newman spacetime into the Bondi--Sachs gauge by means of zero angular momentum, null geodesics. We compute the memory effect produced at the black hole horizon by a transient gravitational shock wave, which from future null infinity is seen as a Bondi-Metzner-Sachs supertranslation. This results in a change of the supertransformation charges at infinity between the spacetime geometries defined by the black hole before, and after, the shockwave scattering. For an extremal Kerr--Newman black hole, we give the complementary description of this process in the near-horizon limit, as seen by an observer hovering over the horizon. In this limit, we compute the supertranformation charges and compare them to those calculated at null infinity. We analyze the effect of these transformations on the electromagnetic gauge field and explore the self-interaction between this and the angular momentum of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Lower bound for simulation cost of open quantum systems: Lipschitz continuity approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating quantum dynamics is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. While the upper bound of the simulation cost has been extensively studied through various quantum algorithms, much less work has focused on establishing the lower bound, particularly for the simulation of open quantum system dynamics. In this work, we present a general framework to calculate the lower bound for simulating a broad class of quantum Markov semigroups. Given a fixed accessible unitary set, we introduce the concept of convexified circuit depth to quantify the quantum simulation cost and analyze the necessary circuit depth to construct a quantum simulation scheme that achieves a specific order. Our framework can be applied to both unital and non-unital quantum dynamics, and the tightness of our lower bound technique is illustrated by showing that the upper and lower bounds coincide in several examples.</description>

Abstract: In the previous paper, we constructed two kinds of edge contractions for the affine super Yangian. In this article, we show that these two edge contractions are commutative with each other. As an application, we give a homomorphism from the affine super Yangian to some centralizer algebras of the universal enveloping algebra of $W$-algebras of type $A$.</description>

      <title>Reduced theory of symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions in nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of minimizers of perturbed Dirichlet energies supported on a wire generated by a regular simple curve $\gamma$ and defined in the space of $\mathbb{S}^2$-valued functions. The perturbation $K$ is represented by a matrix-valued function defined on $\mathbb{S}^2$ with values in $\mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$. Under natural regularity conditions on $K$, we show that the family of perturbed Dirichlet energies converges, in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence, to a simplified energy functional on $\gamma$. The reduced energy unveils how part of the antisymmetric exchange interactions contribute to an anisotropic term whose specific shape depends on the curvature of $\gamma$.
  We also discuss the significant implications of our results for studies of ferromagnetic nanowires when Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is present.</description>

Abstract: We study the class of one-dimensional equations driven by a stochastic measure $\mu$. For $\mu$ we assume only $\sigma$-additivity in probability. This class of equations include the Burgers equation and the heat equation. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved, and the averaging principle for the equation is studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algebraic characterization of the contractions of the Poincar\'e group permits a proper construction of a non-relativistic limit of its tachyonic representation. We arrive at a consistent, nonstandard representation of the Galilei group which was disregarded long ago by supposedly unphysical properties. The corresponding quantum (and classical) theory shares with the relativistic one their fundamentals, and serves as a toy model to better comprehend the unusual behavior of the tachyonic representation. For instance, we see that evolution takes place in a spatial coordinate rather than time, as for relativistic tachyons, but the modulus of the three-momentum is the same for all Galilean observers, leading to a new dispersion relation for a Galilean system. Furthermore, the tachyonic objects described by the new representation cannot be regarded as localizable in the standard sense.</description>

      <title>Quantum three-rotor problem in the identity representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum three-rotor problem concerns the dynamics of three equally massive particles moving on a circle subject to pairwise attractive cosine potentials and can model coupled Josephson junctions. Classically, it displays order-chaos-order behavior with increasing energy. The quantum system admits a dimensionless coupling with semiclassical behavior at strong coupling. We study stationary states with periodic `relative' wave functions. Perturbative and harmonic approximations capture the spectrum at weak coupling and that of low-lying states at strong coupling. More generally, the cumulative distribution of energy levels obtained by numerical diagonalization is well-described by a Weyl-like semiclassical estimate. However, the system has an $S_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is obscured when working with relative angles. By exploiting a basis for invariant states, we obtain the purified spectrum in the identity representation. To uncover universal quantum hallmarks of chaos, we partition the spectrum into energy windows where the classical motion is regular, mixed or chaotic and unfold each separately. At strong coupling, we find striking signatures of transitions between regularity and chaos: spacing distributions morph from Poisson to Wigner-Dyson while the number variance shifts from linear to logarithmic behavior at small lengths. Some nonuniversal features are also examined. For instance, the number variance saturates and oscillates at large lengths for strong coupling while deviations from Poisson spacings at asymptotically low and high energies are well-explained by purified quantum harmonic and free-rotor spectra at strong and weak coupling. Interestingly, the degeneracy of free-rotor levels admits an elegant formula that we deduce using properties of Eisenstein primes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate nonlinear, higher-order dispersive equations with measure (or even less regular) potentials and initial data with low regularity. Our approach is of distributional nature and relies on the phase space analysis (via Gabor wave packets) of the corresponding fundamental solution - in fact, locating the modulation/amalgam space regularity of such generalized Fresnel-type oscillatory functions is a problem of independent interest in harmonic analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time binary branching random walk with independent standard normal increments subject to a penalty $\b$ for every pair of particles that get within distance $\e$ of each other at any time. We give a precise description of the most likely configurations of the particles under this law for $N$ large and $\b,\e$ fixed. Particles spread out over a distance $2^{2N/3}$, essentially in finite time, and subsequently arrange themselves so that at time $2N/3$ they cover a grid of width $\e$ with one particle per site. After time $2N/3$, the bulk of the particles and their descendants do not move anymore, while the particles in a boundary layer of width $2^{N/3}$ form a ``staircase" to the particles in the bulk. At time $N$, each site in the boundary layer is occupied by $2^{N/3}$ particles.</description>

      <title>Sharp commutator estimates of all order for Coulomb and Riesz modulated energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove functional inequalities in any dimension controlling the iterated derivatives along a transport of the Coulomb or super-Coulomb Riesz modulated energy in terms of the modulated energy itself. This modulated energy was introduced by the second author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where control of such derivatives by the energy itself is an essential ingredient. In this paper, we extend and improve such functional inequalities, proving estimates which are now sharp in their additive error term, in their density dependence, valid at arbitrary order of differentiation, and localizable to the support of the transport. Our method relies on the observation that these iterated derivatives are the quadratic form of a commutator. Taking advantage of the Riesz nature of the interaction, we identify these commutators as solutions to a degenerate elliptic equation with a right-hand side exhibiting a recursive structure in terms of lower-order commutators and develop a local regularity theory for the commutators, which may be of independent interest.
  These estimates have applications to obtaining sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and in proving central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases. In particular, we show here the expected $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The progress of miniaturized technology allows controlling physical systems at nanoscale with remarkable precision in regimes where thermal fluctuations are non-negligible. Experimental advancements have sparked interest in control problems in stochastic thermodynamics, typically concerning a time-dependent potential applied to a nanoparticle to reach a target stationary state in a given time with minimal energy cost. We study this problem for a particle subject to thermal fluctuations in a regime that takes into account the effects of inertia, and, building on the results of [1], provide a numerical method to find optimal controls even for non-Gaussian initial and final conditions corresponding to non-harmonic confinements. We show that the momentum mean tends to a constant value along the trajectory except at the boundary and the evolution of the variance is non-trivial. Our results also support that the lower bound on the optimal entropy production computed from the overdamped case is tight in the adiabatic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following advances in the theory of composites we develop rapidly converging series expansions about $z=\infty$ for the resolvent ${\bf R}(z)=[z{\bf I}-{\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}]^{-1}$ where ${\bf Q}$ is an orthogonal projection and ${\bf P}$ is such that ${\bf P}^\dagger{\bf P}={\bf I}$ while $\Gamma={\bf P}{\bf P}^\dagger$ is an orthogonal projection. It is assumed that the spectrum of ${\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}$ lies within the interval $[z^-,z^+]$ for some known $z^+\leq 1$ and $z^-\geq 0$. The series converges in the entire $z$-plane excluding the cut $[z^-,z^+]$. It is obtained using subspace substitution, where the desired resolvent is tied to a resolvent in a larger space and ${\bf Q}$ gets replaced by a projection $\underline{\bf Q}$ that is no longer orthogonal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.06680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework to decompose real multivariate polynomials while preserving invariance and positivity. This framework has been recently introduced for tensor decompositions, in particular for quantum many-body systems. Here we transfer results about decomposition structures, invariance under permutations of variables, positivity, rank inequalities and separations, approximations, and undecidability to real polynomials. Specifically, we define invariant decompositions of polynomials and characterize which polynomials admit such decompositions. We then include positivity: We define invariant separable and sum-of-squares decompositions, and characterize the polynomials similarly. We provide inequalities and separations between the ranks of the decompositions, and show that the separations are not robust with respect to approximations. For cyclically invariant decompositions, we show that it is undecidable whether the polynomial is nonnegative or sum-of-squares for all system sizes. Our work sheds new light on polynomials by putting them on an equal footing with tensors, and opens the door to extending this framework to other tensor product structures.</description>

Abstract: Treating the nonlinear term of the Gross-Pitaevskii nonlinear Schrodinger equation as a perturbation of an isolated discrete eigenvalue of the linear problem one obtains a Rayleigh-Schrodinger power series. This power series is proved to be convergent when the parameter representing the intensity of the nonlinear term is less in absolute value than a threshold value, and it gives a stationary solution to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the dynamical symmetries of classical supersymmetric oscillators in one and two spatial (bosonic) dimensions. Our main ingredient is a generalized Poisson bracket which is defined as a suitable classical counterpart to commutators and anticommutators. In one dimension, i.e., in the presence of one bosonic and one fermionic coordinate, the Hamiltonian admits a $U(1,1)$ symmetry for which we explicitly compute the first integrals. It is found that suitable forms of the supercharges emerge in a natural way as fermionic conserved quantities. Following this, we describe classical supercharge operators based on the generalized Poisson bracket and subsequently define supersymmetry transformations. We perform a straightforward generalization to two spatial dimensions where the Hamiltonian has an overall $U(2,2)$ symmetry. We comment on plausible supersymmetric generalizations of the Pais-Uhlenbeck and isotonic oscillators, and also present the possibility of defining a generalized Nambu bracket within the classical formalism.</description>

Abstract: Algebraic quantum field theory is a general mathematical framework for relativistic quantum physics, based on the theory of operator algebras. It comprises all observable and operational aspects of a theory. In its framework the entire state space of a theory is covered, starting from the vacuum over arbitrary configurations of particles to thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. It provides a solid foundation for structural analysis, the physical interpretation of the theory and the development of new constructive schemes. This survey is commissioned by the Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics, edited by M. Bojowald and R.J. Szabo. It is to be published by the Elsevier publishing house.</description>

      <title>The transformations to remove or add bound states for the half-line matrix Schr\"odinger operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the transformations to remove or add bound states or to decrease or increase the multiplicities of any existing bound states for the half-line matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operator with the general selfadjoint boundary condition, without changing the continuous spectrum of the operator. When the matrix-valued potential is selfadjoint, is integrable, and has a finite first moment, the relevant transformations are constructed through the development of the Gel'fand-Levitan method for the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator. In particular, the bound-state normalization matrices are constructed at each bound state for any multiplicity. The transformations are obtained for all relevant quantities, including the matrix potential, the Jost solution, the regular solution, the Jost matrix, the scattering matrix, and the boundary condition. For each bound state, the corresponding dependency matrix is introduced by connecting the normalization matrix used in the Gel'fand-Levitan method and the normalization matrix used in the Marchenko method of inverse scattering. Various estimates are provided to describe the large spacial asymptotics for the change in the potential when the bound states are removed or added or their multiplicities are modified. An explicit example is provided showing that an asymptotic estimate available in the literature in the scalar case for the potential increment is incorrect.</description>

      <title>On Strong Bounds for Trotter and Zeno Product Formulas with Bosonic Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Trotter product formula and the quantum Zeno effect are both indispensable tools for constructing time-evolutions using experimentally feasible building blocks. In this work, we discuss assumptions under which quantitative bounds can be proven in the strong operator topology on Banach spaces and provide natural bosonic examples. Specially, we assume the existence of a continuously embedded Banach space, which relatively bounds the involved generators and creates an invariant subspace of the limiting semigroup with a stable restriction. The slightly stronger assumption of admissible subspaces is well-recognized in the realm of hyperbolic evolution systems (time-dependent semigroups), to which the results are extended. By assuming access to a hierarchy of continuously embedded Banach spaces, Suzuki-higher-order bounds can be demonstrated. In bosonic applications, these embedded Banach spaces naturally arise through the number operator, leading to a diverse set of examples encompassing notable instances such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup and multi-photon driven dissipation used in bosonic error correction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that for the Heisenberg XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain in the critical regime, the scaling limit of the vacuum Bethe roots yields an infinite set of numbers that coincide with the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical 3D anharmonic oscillator. The discovery of this curious relation, among others, gave rise to the approach referred to as the ODE/IQFT (or ODE/IM) correspondence. Here we consider a multiparametric generalization of the Heisenberg spin chain, which is associated with the inhomogeneous six-vertex model. When quasi-periodic boundary conditions are imposed the lattice system may be explored within the Bethe Ansatz technique. We argue that for the critical spin chain, with a properly formulated scaling limit, the scaled Bethe roots for the ground state are described by second order differential equations, which are multi-parametric generalizations of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the anharmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Affine subgroups of the affine Coxeter group with the same Coxeter number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine subgroups having the same Coxeter number with the affine Coxeter groups W(An), W(Dn), and W(En) are constructed by graph folding technique. The affine groups W(Cn) and W(Bn) are obtained from the Coxeter groups W(A2n-1) and W(D2n-1) respectively. The affine groups W(E6), W(D6) and W(E8) lead to the affine groups W(F4), W(H3), and W(H4) respectively by graph folding. The latter two are the non-crystallographic groups where W(H3) plays a special role in the quasicrystallographic structures with icosahedral symmetry. A general construction of the affine dihedral subgroups is introduced, some of which, describe the existing planar quasicrystallography. In the construction of the root systems, sets of orthonormal vectors are used but a special non-orthogonal set of vectors in the formulation of the root system of W(An) is also introduced which has practical applications in the construction of the lattices An and An* and their Delone and Voronoi cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Riccati's differential equation is formulated as abstract equation in finite or infinite dimensional Banach spaces. Since the Riccati's differential equation with the Cole-Hopf transform shows a relation between the first order evolution equations and the second order evolution equations, its generalization suggests the existence of recurrence formula leading to a sequence of differential equations with different order. %%% In conclusion, by means of the logarithmic representation of operators, a transform between the first order evolution equations and the higher order evolution equation is presented. Several classes of evolution equations with different orders are given, and some of them are shown as examples.</description>

      <title>Novel non-involutive solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation from (skew) braces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.11580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We produce novel non-involutive solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation coming from (skew) braces. These solutions are generalisations of the known ones coming from braces and skew braces, and surprisingly in the case of braces they are not necessarily involutive. In the case of two-sided (skew) braces one can assign such solutions to every element of the set. Novel bijective maps associated to the inverse solutions are also introduced. Moreover, we show that the recently derived Drinfeld twists of the involutive case are still admissible in the non-involutive frame and we identify the twisted $r$-matrices and twisted coproducts. We observe, as in the involutive case that the underlying quantum algebra is not a quasi-triangular bialgebra, as one would expect, but a quasi-triangular quasi-bialgebra. The same applies to the quantum algebra of the twisted $r$-matrices, contrary to the involutive case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions relating to the lengths of longest monotone subsequences of involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03798v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the length of longest monotone subsequences in random (fixed-point free) involutions of $n$ integers as $n$ grows large, establishing asymptotic expansions in powers of $n^{-1/6}$ in the general case and in powers of $n^{-1/3}$ in the fixed-point free cases. Whilst the limit laws were shown by Baik and Rains to be one of the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ for $\beta=1$ or $\beta=4$, we find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansion terms as linear combinations of higher order derivatives of $F_\beta$ with rational polynomial coefficients. Our derivation is based on a concept of generalized analytic de-Poissonization and is subject to the validity of certain hypotheses for which we provide compelling (computational) evidence. In a preparatory step expansions of the hard-to-soft edge transition laws of L$\beta$E are studied, which are lifted into expansions of the generalized Poissonized length distributions for large intensities. (This paper continues our work arXiv:2301.02022, which established similar results in the case of general permutations and $\beta=2$.)</description>

      <title>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</description>

      <title>Black-hole spectroscopy: quasinormal modes, ringdown stability and the pseudospectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-hole spectroscopy is a powerful tool to probe the Kerr nature of astrophysical compact objects and their environment. The observation of multiple ringdown modes in gravitational waveforms could soon lead to high-precision gravitational-wave spectroscopy, thus it is critical to understand if the quasinormal mode spectrum itself is affected by astrophysical environments, quantum corrections, and other generic modifications. In this chapter, we will review the black-hole spectroscopy program and its challenges regarding quasinormal mode detection, the overtone status and the recent evidence that supports the existence of nonlinearities in the spectrum of black holes. We will then discuss a newly introduced non-modal tool in black-hole physics, namely the pseudospectrum; a mathematical notion that can shed light on the spectral stability of quasinormal modes, and discuss its novel applications in black holes and exotic horizonless compact objects. We will show that quasinormal modes generically suffer from spectral instabilities, explore how such phenomena can further affect black-hole spectroscopy, and discuss potential ringdown imprints and waveform stability issues in current and future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>An efficient stochastic particle method for high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical resolution of high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs remains a huge challenge due to the curse of dimensionality. Starting from the weak formulation of the Lawson-Euler scheme, this paper proposes a stochastic particle method (SPM) by tracking the deterministic motion, random jump, resampling and reweighting of particles. Real-valued weighted particles are adopted by SPM to approximate the high-dimensional solution, which automatically adjusts the point distribution to intimate the relevant feature of the solution. A piecewise constant reconstruction with virtual uniform grid is employed to evaluate the nonlinear terms, which fully exploits the intrinsic adaptive characteristic of SPM. Combining both, SPM can achieve the goal of adaptive sampling in time. Numerical experiments on the 6-D Allen-Cahn equation and the 7-D Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman equation demonstrate the potential of SPM in solving high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs efficiently while maintaining an acceptable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamic free energy as $A$-discriminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the free energy $\mathcal{F}$ and temperature $T$ of black holes, considered as a thermodynamic system, can be viewed as an $A$-discriminant of an appropriately-defined polynomial. As such, mathematical results about $A$-discriminants may lead to implications about black hole thermodynamics. In particular, for static spacetimes with spherical, planar, or hyperbolic symmetry, the number of distinct thermodynamic phases depend on the number of distinct terms in the metric component $g_{tt}$. We prove that if $g_{tt}$ consists of $N_f$ distinct terms, then the $\mathcal{F}$-$T$ curve consists of $N_f-2$ cusps, which in turn leads to $N_f-1$ distinct thermodynamic phases. This result is applied to explicit examples of the Schwarzschild-AdS, Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m, power-law Maxwell, and Euler--Heisenberg black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geometrical analysis of the stability of nuclei against deformations is presented. In particular, we use Catastrophe Theory to illustrate discontinuous changes in the behavior of nuclei with respect to deformations as one moves in the N - Z space. We construct a minimalistic deformation model using the microscopic-macroscopic approach. A third-order phase transition is found in the liquid-drop model, which translates to a complete loss of stability (using the Fold catastrophe) when shell effects are included. The analysis is found to explain the instability of known fissile nuclei and also justify known decay chains of heavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard system with dynamic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a general class of bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard systems with dynamic boundary conditions. In contrast to classical Neumann boundary conditions, the dynamic boundary conditions of Cahn--Hilliard type allow for dynamic changes of the contact angle between the diffuse interface and the boundary, a convection-induced motion of the contact line as well as absorption of material by the boundary. The coupling conditions for bulk and surface quantities involve parameters $K,L\in[0,\infty]$, whose choice declares whether these conditions are of Dirichlet, Robin or Neumann type. We first prove the existence of a weak solution to our model in the case $K,L\in (0,\infty)$ by means of a Faedo--Galerkin approach. For all other cases, the existence of a weak solution is then shown by means of the asymptotic limits, where $K$ and $L$ are sent to zero or to infinity, respectively. Eventually, we establish higher regularity for the phase-fields, and we prove the uniqueness of weak solutions given that the mobility functions are constant.</description>

      <title>Linearized Boltzmann collision operator for a mixture of monatomic and polyatomic chemically reacting species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At higher altitudes, for high temperature gases, for instance near space shuttles moving at hypersonic speed, not only mechanical collisions are affecting the gas flow, but also chemical reactions have an impact on such hypersonic flows. In this work we insert chemical reactions, in form of dissociations and recombinations (associations), in an existing model for a mixture of mono- and polyatomic (non-reacting) species. More general chemical reactions, e.g., bimolecular ones, can be obtained by instant combinations of associations and dissociations. The polyatomicity is modelled by a continuous internal energy variable and the evolution of the gas is described by a Boltzmann equation.
  In, e.g., the Chapman-Enskog process - and related half-space problems - the linearized Boltzmann collision operator plays a central role. Here we extend some important properties of the linearized Boltzmann collision operator to the introduced model with chemical reactions. A compactness result, stating that the linearized operator can be decomposed into a sum of a positive multiplication operator - the collision frequency - and a compact integral operator, is proven under reasonable assumptions on the collision kernel. The strategy is to show that the terms of the integral operator are (at least) uniform limits of Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators and therefore also compact operators. Self-adjointness of the linearized operator is a direct consequences. Moreover, bounds on - including coercivity of - the collision frequency are obtained for hard sphere like, as well as hard potentials with cutoff like models. As consequence, Fredholmness, as well as, the domain, of the linearized collision operator are obtained</description>

      <title>LLM4ED: Large Language Models for Automatic Equation Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equation discovery is aimed at directly extracting physical laws from data and has emerged as a pivotal research domain. Previous methods based on symbolic mathematics have achieved substantial advancements, but often require the design of implementation of complex algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that utilizes natural language-based prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in automatically mining governing equations from data. Specifically, we first utilize the generation capability of LLMs to generate diverse equations in string form, and then evaluate the generated equations based on observations. In the optimization phase, we propose two alternately iterated strategies to optimize generated equations collaboratively. The first strategy is to take LLMs as a black-box optimizer and achieve equation self-improvement based on historical samples and their performance. The second strategy is to instruct LLMs to perform evolutionary operators for global search. Experiments are extensively conducted on both partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations. Results demonstrate that our framework can discover effective equations to reveal the underlying physical laws under various nonlinear dynamic systems. Further comparisons are made with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating good stability and usability. Our framework substantially lowers the barriers to learning and applying equation discovery techniques, demonstrating the application potential of LLMs in the field of knowledge discovery.</description>

      <title>Hidden zero modes and topology of multiband non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a finite one-dimensional non-Hermitian system, the number of zero modes does not necessarily reflect the topology of the system. This is known as the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence and has lead to misconceptions about the topological protection of edge modes in such systems. Here we show why this breakdown does occur and that it typically results in hidden zero modes, extremely long-lived zero energy excitations, which are only revealed when considering the singular value instead of the eigenvalue spectrum. We point out, furthermore, that in a finite multiband non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian $H$, one needs to consider also the reflected Hamiltonian $\tilde H$, which is in general distinct from the adjoint $H^\dagger$, to properly relate the number of protected zeroes to the winding number of $H$.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization conditions and full transseries structures for ${\cal PT}$ symmetric anharmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exact Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin analysis (EWKB) for a ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics (QM) defined by the potential that $V_{\cal PT}(x) = \omega^2 x^2 + g x^{2 K} (i x)^{\varepsilon}$ with $\omega \in {\mathbb R}_{\ge 0}$, $g \in {\mathbb R}_{&gt;0}$ and $K, \varepsilon \in {\mathbb N}$ to clarify its perturbative/non-perturbative structure. In our analysis, we mainly consider the massless cases, i.e., $\omega = 0$, and derive the exact quantization conditions (QCs) for arbitrary $(K,\varepsilon)$ including all perturbative/non-perturbative corrections. From the exact QCs, we clarify full transseries structure of the energy spectra with respect to the inverse energy level expansion, and then formulate the Gutzwiller trace formula, the spectral summation form, and the Euclidean path-integral. For the massive cases, i.e., $\omega &gt; 0$, we show the fact that, by requiring existence of solution of the exact QCs, the path of analytic continuation in EWKB is uniquely determined for a given $N = 2K + \varepsilon$, and in consequence the exact QCs, the energy spectra, and the three formulas are all perturbative. Similarities to Hermitian QMs and resurgence are also discussed as additional remarks.</description>

      <title>Clustering of conditional mutual information and quantum Markov structure at arbitrary temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05835</link>

Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley-Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay concerning distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been established for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement is corroborated to exist by the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the `entanglement Hamiltonian' or `Hamiltonian of mean force.' As one outcome of our analyses, we enhance the prior clustering theorem concerning bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal conformal restriction and unitarizing measures for Virasoro algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure to construct a natural representation of the Virasoro algebra of central charge $c = c(\kappa) \le 1$. In particular, we introduce a non-degenerate bilinear Hermitian form (not positive-definite) using the SLE loop measure and show that the representation is (indefinite) unitary. Our proof relies on the infinitesimal conformal restriction property of the SLE loop measure.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Origin of Wannier Localizability and Detachable Topological Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While topology can impose obstructions to exponentially localized Wannier functions, certain topological insulators are exempt from such Wannier obstructions. The absence of the Wannier obstructions can further accompany topological boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. Here, we elucidate a close connection between these detachable topological boundary states and non-Hermitian topology. Identifying topological boundary states as non-Hermitian topology, we demonstrate that intrinsic non-Hermitian topology leads to the inevitable spectral flow. By contrast, we show that extrinsic non-Hermitian topology underlies the detachment of topological boundary states and clarify anti-Hermitian topology of the detached boundary states. Based on this connection and $K$-theory, we complete the tenfold classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states.</description>

      <title>Power rate of convergence of discrete curves: framework and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework of estimates for convergence rates of random discrete model curves approaching Schramm Loewner Evolution (SLE) curves in the lattice size scaling limit. We show that a power-law convergence rate of an interface to an SLE curve can be derived from a power-law convergence rate for an appropriate martingale observable provided the discrete curve satisfies a specific bound on crossing events, the Kempannien-Smirnov condition, along with an estimate on the growth of the derivative of the SLE curve. We apply our framework to show that the exploration process for critical site percolation on hexagonal lattice converges to the SLE$_6$ curve with a power-law convergence rate.</description>

      <title>A novel translationally invariant supersymmetric chain with inverse-square interactions: partition function, thermodynamics and criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel family of translationally-invariant su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interaction not directly associated to a root system. We study the symmetries of these models, establishing in particular the existence of a boson-fermion duality characteristic of this type of systems. Taking advantage of the relation of the new chains with an associated many-body supersymmetric spin dynamical model, we are able to compute their partition function in closed form for all values of $m$ and $n$ and for an arbitrary number of spins. When both $m$ and $n$ are even, we show that the partition function factorizes as the product of the partition functions of two supersymmetric Haldane-Shastry spin chains, which in turn leads to a simple expression for the thermodynamic free energy per spin in terms of the Perron eigenvalue of a suitable transfer matrix. We use this expression to study the thermodynamics of a large class of these chains, showing in particular that the specific heat presents a single Schottky peak at approximately the same temperature as a suitable $k$-level model. We also analyze the critical behavior of the new chains, and in particular the ground state degeneracy and the existence of low energy excitations with a linear energy-momentum dispersion relation. In this way we are able to show that the only possible critical chains are the ones with $m=0,1,2$. In addition, using the explicit formula for the partition function we are able to establish the criticality of the su$(0|n)$ and su$(2|n)$ chains with even $n$, and to evaluate the central charge of their associated conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Linear and Non linear stability for the kinetic plasma sheath on a bounded interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma sheaths are inhomogeneous equilibrium that form when a plasma is in contact with an absorbing wall. We prove linear and non linear stability of a kinetic sheath equilibrium for a Vlasov-Poisson type system in a bounded interval. Notably, in the linear setting, we obtain exponential decay of the fluctuation provided the rate of injection of particles at equilibrium is smaller that the rate of absorption at the wall. In the non linear setting, we prove a similar result for small enough equilibrium and small localized perturbation of the equilibrium.</description>
