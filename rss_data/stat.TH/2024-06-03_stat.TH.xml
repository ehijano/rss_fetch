      <title>Nonparametric regression on random geometric graphs sampled from submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonparametric regression problem when the covariates are located on an unknown smooth compact submanifold of a Euclidean space. Under defining a random geometric graph structure over the covariates we analyze the asymptotic frequentist behaviour of the posterior distribution arising from Bayesian priors designed through random basis expansion in the graph Laplacian eigenbasis. Under Holder smoothness assumption on the regression function and the density of the covariates over the submanifold, we prove that the posterior contraction rates of such methods are minimax optimal (up to logarithmic factors) for any positive smoothness index.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of the Sinkhorn Algorithm with Sparse Cost Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the convergence rate of the Sinkhorn algorithm when the cost matrix is sparse. We derive bounds on the convergence rate that depend on the sparsity pattern and the degree of sparsity of the cost matrix. We also explore whether existing convergence results for dense cost matrices can be adapted or improved for the sparse case. Our analysis provides new insights into the behavior of the Sinkhorn algorithm in the presence of sparsity and highlights potential avenues for algorithmic improvements.</description>

      <title>Waveform Design for Over-the-Air Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the increasing number of devices anticipated in next-generation networks, a shift toward over-the-air (OTA) computing has been proposed. Leveraging the superposition of multiple access channels, OTA computing enables efficient resource management by supporting simultaneous uncoded transmission in the time and the frequency domain. Thus, to advance the integration of OTA computing, our study presents a theoretical analysis addressing practical issues encountered in current digital communication transceivers, such as time sampling error and intersymbol interference (ISI). To this end, we examine the theoretical mean squared error (MSE) for OTA transmission under time sampling error and ISI, while also exploring methods for minimizing the MSE in the OTA transmission. Utilizing alternating optimization, we also derive optimal power policies for both the devices and the base station. Additionally, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based approach to design waveforms enhancing OTA transmission performance under time sampling error and ISI. To ensure fair comparison with existing waveforms like the raised cosine (RC) and the better-than-raised-cosine (BRTC), we incorporate a custom loss function integrating energy and bandwidth constraints, along with practical design considerations such as waveform symmetry. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate performance gains of the designed pulse over RC and BTRC waveforms. To facilitate testing of our results without necessitating the DNN structure recreation, we provide curve fitting parameters for select DNN-based waveforms as well.</description>

      <title>Information limits and Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations for spiked matrix models with structured noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a prototypical problem of Bayesian inference for a structured spiked model: a low-rank signal is corrupted by additive noise. While both information-theoretic and algorithmic limits are well understood when the noise is i.i.d. Gaussian, the more realistic case of structured noise still proves to be challenging. To capture the structure while maintaining mathematical tractability, a line of work has focused on rotationally invariant noise. However, existing studies either provide sub-optimal algorithms or they are limited to a special class of noise ensembles. In this paper, we establish the first characterization of the information-theoretic limits for a noise matrix drawn from a general trace ensemble. These limits are then achieved by an efficient algorithm inspired by the theory of adaptive Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) equations. Our approach leverages tools from statistical physics (replica method) and random matrix theory (generalized spherical integrals), and it unveils the equivalence between the rotationally invariant model and a surrogate Gaussian model.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Bayesian Predictive Inference in High-dimensional Regerssion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian predictive inference provides a coherent description of entire predictive uncertainty through predictive distributions. We examine several widely used sparsity priors from the predictive (as opposed to estimation) inference viewpoint. To start, we investigate predictive distributions in the context of a high-dimensional Gaussian observation with a known variance but an unknown sparse mean under the Kullback-Leibler loss. First, we show that LASSO (Laplace) priors are incapable of achieving rate-optimal predictive distributions. However, deploying the Laplace prior inside the Spike-and-Slab framework (e.g. with the Spike-and-Slab LASSO prior), rate-minimax performance can be attained with properly tuned parameters (depending on the sparsity level sn). We highlight the discrepancy between prior calibration for the purpose of prediction and estimation. Going further, we investigate popular hierarchical priors which are known to attain adaptive rate-minimax performance for estimation. Whether or not they are rate-minimax also for predictive inference has, until now, been unclear. We answer affirmatively by showing that hierarchical Spike-and-Slab priors are adaptive and attain the minimax rate without the knowledge of sn. This is the first rate-adaptive result in the literature on predictive density estimation in sparse setups. Building on the sparse normal-means model, we extend our adaptive rate findings to the case of sparse high-dimensional regression with Spike-and-Slab priors. All of these results underscore benefits of fully Bayesian predictive inference.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional robust regression under heavy-tailed data: Asymptotics and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the high-dimensional properties of robust regression estimators in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination of both the covariates and response functions. In particular, we provide a sharp asymptotic characterisation of M-estimators trained on a family of elliptical covariate and noise data distributions including cases where second and higher moments do not exist. We show that, despite being consistent, the Huber loss with optimally tuned location parameter $\delta$ is suboptimal in the high-dimensional regime in the presence of heavy-tailed noise, highlighting the necessity of further regularisation to achieve optimal performance. This result also uncovers the existence of a transition in $\delta$ as a function of the sample complexity and contamination. Moreover, we derive the decay rates for the excess risk of ridge regression. We show that, while it is both optimal and universal for covariate distributions with finite second moment, its decay rate can be considerably faster when the covariates' second moment does not exist. Finally, we show that our formulas readily generalise to a richer family of models and data distributions, such as generalised linear estimation with arbitrary convex regularisation trained on mixture models.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Point Process Learning and its special case Takacs-Fiksel estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Cronie et al. (2024) introduced the notion of cross-validation for point processes and a new statistical methodology called Point Process Learning (PPL). In PPL one splits a point process/pattern into a training and a validation set, and then predicts the latter from the former through a parametrised Papangelou conditional intensity. The model parameters are estimated by minimizing a point process prediction error; this notion was introduced as the second building block of PPL. It was shown that PPL outperforms the state-of-the-art in both kernel intensity estimation and estimation of the parameters of the Gibbs hard-core process. In the latter case, the state-of-the-art was represented by pseudolikelihood estimation. In this paper we study PPL in relation to Takacs-Fiksel estimation, of which pseudolikelihood is a special case. We show that Takacs-Fiksel estimation is a special case of PPL in the sense that PPL with a specific loss function asymptotically reduces to Takacs-Fiksel estimation if we let the cross-validation regime tend to leave-one-out cross-validation. Moreover, PPL involves a certain type of hyperparameter given by a weight function which ensures that the prediction errors have expectation zero if and only if we have the correct parametrisation. We show that the weight function takes an explicit but intractable form for general Gibbs models. Consequently, we propose different approaches to estimate the weight function in practice. In order to assess how the general PPL setup performs in relation to its special case Takacs-Fiksel estimation, we conduct a simulation study where we find that for common Gibbs models we can find loss functions and hyperparameters so that PPL typically outperforms Takacs-Fiksel estimation significantly in terms of mean square error. Here, the hyperparameters are the cross-validation parameters and the weight function estimate.</description>
