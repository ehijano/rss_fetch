      <title>Disc-planet misalignment from an unstable triple system: IRAS04125</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IRAS01425+2902 wide binary system was recently reported to have both a young planet and a puzzling geometric arrangement, where the planet and binary both orbit edge-on, but misaligned by 60 deg to the circumprimary disc. This is the youngest transiting planet yet to be detected but its misalignment to the disc is difficult to explain. In this paper we explore the dissolution of an unstable triple system as a potential mechanism to produce this system. We simulate the effects of an ejection interaction in models using a highly inclined, retrograde flyby centred on the primary star of IRAS01425. The escaping star of ~0.35 solar masses inclines both the disc and binary orbits such that they have a relative misalignment of greater than 60 deg, as inferred from observations. The planet orbit also becomes inclined relative to the disc, and our interpretation predicts that the binary should have a highly eccentric orbit (e &gt; 0.5 from our simulations). We additionally demonstrate that despite the high relative misalignment of the disc it is unlikely to be vulnerable to von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov oscillations.</description>

      <title>Earth-like planet predictor: A machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for planets analogous to Earth in terms of mass and equilibrium temperature is currently the first step in the quest for habitable conditions outside our Solar System and, ultimately, the search for life in the universe. Future missions such as PLATO or LIFE will begin to detect and characterise these small, cold planets, dedicating significant observation time to them. The aim of this work is to predict which stars are most likely to host an Earth-like planet (ELP) to avoid blind searches, minimises detection times, and thus maximises the number of detections. Using a previous study on correlations between the presence of an ELP and the properties of its system, we trained a Random Forest to recognise and classify systems as 'hosting an ELP' or 'not hosting an ELP'. The Random Forest was trained and tested on populations of synthetic planetary systems derived from the Bern model, and then applied to real observed systems. The tests conducted on the machine learning (ML) model yield precision scores of up to 0.99, indicating that 99% of the systems identified by the model as having ELPs possess at least one. Among the few real observed systems that have been tested, 44 have been selected as having a high probability of hosting an ELP, and a quick study of the stability of these systems confirms that the presence of an Earth-like planet within them would leave them stable. The excellent results obtained from the tests conducted on the ML model demonstrate its ability to recognise the typical architectures of systems with or without ELPs within populations derived from the Bern model. If we assume that the Bern model adequately describes the architecture of real systems, then such a tool can prove indispensable in the search for Earth-like planets. A similar approach could be applied to other planetary system formation models to validate those predictions.</description>

      <title>Perihelion precession in non-Newtonian central potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High order corrections to the perihelion precession are obtained in non-Newtonian central potentials, via complex analysis techniques. The result is an exact series expansion whose terms, for a perturbation of the form $\delta V=\frac{\gamma}{r^{s}}$, are calculated in closed form. To validate the method, the series is applied to the specific case of s=3, and the results are compared with those presented in literature, which are relate to the Schwarzschild metric. As a further test, a numerical simulation was carried out for the case where s=4. The algebraic calculations and numerical simulations were carried out via software with symbolic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Low-Thrust Many-Revolution Transfer between Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit and Low Lunar Orbit Using Hybrid Differential Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-thrust, many-revolution transfers between near-rectilinear halo orbits and low lunar orbits are challenging due to the many-revolutions and is further complicated by three-body perturbation. To address these challenges, we extend hybrid differential dynamic programming by enhancing with a continuation of dynamical system. The optimization begins with the Sundman-transformed two-body problem and gradually transitions to the Sundman-transformed circular restricted three-body problem expressed in the moon-centered inertial frame. Numerical examples demonstrate the robust convergence of our method, where optimal transfers from low lunar orbit to near-rectilinear halo orbit are obtained with a poor initial guess of low lunar orbit.</description>

      <title>A new look into the atmospheric composition of WASP-39 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being one of the first exoplanets observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), WASP-39 b has become an iconic target and many transit spectra recorded with different instruments (NIRISS, NIRCAM, NIRSpec G395H, NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI) are currently available, allowing in-depth studies of its atmosphere. We present here a novel approach to interpret WASP-39 b's transit spectroscopic data, consisting of a multi-step process where ab initio equilibrium chemistry models and blind retrievals are used iteratively to find physically robust, optimal solutions. Following this approach, we have identified a new scenario to explain WASP-39 b's atmospheric composition, in which silicon-based chemistry plays a major role. In this scenario, SiO may explain the spectral absorption at 4.1 $\mu$m, currently interpreted as being due to SO$_2$. SiO and the other gas species identified by the retrieval models, i.e. H$_2$O, CO$_2$, Na and K, are consistent with an atmosphere in chemical equilibrium with a temperature-pressure profile constrained by H$_2$O and CO$_2$ absorption bands. In addition, silicate clouds and hazes can produce the spectral features observed by MIRI in the spectral window 5-12 $\mu$m. While we advocate the need for more data, possibly at higher spectral resolution, to confirm our results for WASP-39 b's atmospheric composition, we highlight a refined atmospheric retrieval strategy with pre-selection and post-reconstruction to guide the next generation of transit spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>The Minimum Mass of Planets, Dwarf Planets, and Planetary-scale Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The International Astronomical Union definitions for Planet and Dwarf Planet both require that a body has sufficient mass to overcome rigid body forces and self gravitate into a nearly round shape. However, quantitative standards for determining when a body is sufficiently round have been lacking. Previously published triaxial ellipsoid solutions for asteroids, satellites, and Dwarf Planets in the radius range 135 to 800 km are examined to identify a minimum mass above which the entire population, regardless of composition, is round. From this data, the minimum mass to meet the roundness criterion is 5.0 x 10E20 kg. The triaxial shape data suggests three radius ranges: (1) bodies with a radius less than 160 km are non-spheroidal, (2) bodies with a radius in the range 160 to 450 km are transitional in shape or nearly round, (3) bodies with a radius greater than 450 km are spheroidal. Bodies orbiting the Sun with a mass greater than 5.0 x 10E20 kg are Planets or Dwarf Planets. Arguments are presented for including the 16 spheroidal moons of the Solar System as a third dynamical class that can be identified as Satellite Planets. Definitions are proposed that expand upon the taxonomy started in 2006 with the International Astronomomical Union Planet and Dwarf Planet classes.</description>

      <title>Jupiter's ultraviolet auroral bridge: the influence of the solar wind on polar auroral morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jupiter's ultraviolet aurora frequently shows a number of arcs between the dusk-side polar region and the main emission, which are denoted as ``bridges''. This work presents a largely automated detection and statistical analysis of bridges over 248 Hubble-Space-Telescope observations, alongside a multi-instrument study of crossings of magnetic field lines connected to bridges by the Juno spacecraft during its first 30 perijoves. Bridges are observed to arise on timescales of $\sim$2 hours, can persist over a full Jupiter rotation, and are conjugate between hemispheres. The appearance of bridges is strongly associated with compression of the magnetosphere by the solar wind. Low-altitude bridge crossings are associated with upward-dominated, broadband electron distributions, consistent with Zone-II aurorae, as well as with plasma-wave bursts observed by Juno-Waves, in agreement with existing theoretical models for the generation of polar-region aurorae. Electron populations associated with crossings of field lines threading the main emission by Juno also become more downward-dominated when separate bridges are present in the nearby aurora. In all, this indicates that bridges are likely Zone-II aurorae that have become spatially separated from the Zone-I aurorae under the influence of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>A dark matter hail: Detecting macroscopic dark matter with asteroids, planetary rings, and craters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter could be composed of macroscopic objects with large masses and geometric cross-sections spanning many decades. We investigate the potential interaction of such `stuff-sized' dark matter by considering its interactions with asteroids, planetary rings, and terrestrial bodies. This hail of dark matter could catastrophically destroy these Solar System objects, evaporate them from their orbits, or cause substantial cratering. We estimate these effects and use them to place competitive bounds on a wide, previously-unconstrained swathe of the dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Revealing a main-sequence star that consumed a planet with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subluminous red nova (SLRN) ZTF SLRN-2020 is the most compelling direct detection of a planet being consumed by its host star, a scenario known as a planetary engulfment event. We present JWST spectroscopy of ZTF SLRN-2020 taken +830 d after its optical emission peak using the NIRSpec fixed-slit $3-5$ $\mu$m high-resolution grating and the MIRI $5-12$ $\mu$m low-resolution spectrometer. NIRSpec reveals the $^{12}$CO fundamental band ($\nu=1-0$) in emission at $\sim4.7$ $\mu$m, Brackett-$\alpha$ emission, and the potential detection of PH$_3$ in emission at $\sim4.3$ $\mu$m. The JWST spectra are consistent with the claim that ZTF SLRN-2020 arose from a planetary engulfment event. We utilize DUSTY to model the late-time $\sim1-12$ $\mu$m spectral energy distribution (SED) of ZTF SLRN-2020, where the best-fit parameters indicate the presence of warm, $720^{+80}_{-50}$ K, circumstellar dust with a total dust mass of Log$\left(\frac{M_\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{M}_\odot}\right)=-10.61^{+0.08}_{-0.16}$ M$_\odot$. We also fit a DUSTY model to archival photometry taken +320 d after peak that suggested the presence of a cooler, T$_\mathrm{d}=280^{+450}_{-20}$ K, and more massive, Log$\left(\frac{M_\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{M}_\odot}\right)=-5.89^{+0.29}_{-3.21}$, circumstellar dust component. Assuming the cool component originates from the ZTF SLRN-2020 ejecta, we interpret the warm component as fallback from the ejecta. From the late-time SED model we measure a luminosity of L$_* = 0.29^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ L$_\odot$ for the remnant host star, which is consistent with a $\sim0.7$ M$_\odot$ K-type star that should not yet have evolved off the main sequence. If ZTF SLRN-2020 was not triggered by stellar evolution, we suggest that the planetary engulfment was due to orbital decay from tidal interactions between the planet and the host star.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Periodic Pulsations in Ionospheric TEC Synchronized with Solar Flare EUV Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray radiation emitted during solar flares has been shown to significantly increase the electron density of the Earth's ionosphere. During flares, quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in X-ray flux originating in the corona have previously been linked to subsequent pulsations in the Earth's ionospheric D-region. Similar pulsations have been detected in chromospheric EUV emission, although their impact on the Earth's ionosphere has not previously been investigated. Here, for the first time, synchronous pulsations were detected in solar EUV emission and ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements. Using wavelet and periodogram analysis, we detect QPPs with approximately 85 second periods in chromospheric EUV emission lines (He II 304 \AA{}, C III 977 \AA{} and H I 972 \AA{}) from the Solar Dynamics Observatory Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (SDO/EVE) during the impulsive phase of an X5.4 flare on March 7, 2012. These lines contribute to ionization in the ionospheric E- and F-regions, resulting in subsequent variations of electron density with the same periodicity, which was detected in TEC measurements. This work demonstrates that the Earth's ionosphere is responsive to fine-scale fluctuations in EUV emission during flares, with a time delay of approximately 30 seconds found. These findings may have applications in atmospheric modelling and solar-terrestrial studies, including the calculation of ionospheric recombination rates.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Detection of Fast Moving Celestial Objects Using a Mixture of Experts and Physical-Inspired Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast moving celestial objects are characterized by velocities across the celestial sphere that significantly differ from the motions of background stars. In observational images, these objects exhibit distinct shapes, contrasting with the typical appearances of stars. Depending on the observational method employed, these celestial entities may be designated as near-Earth objects or asteroids. Historically, fast moving celestial objects have been observed using ground-based telescopes, where the relative stability of stars and Earth facilitated effective image differencing techniques alongside traditional fast moving celestial object detection and classification algorithms. However, the growing prevalence of space-based telescopes, along with their diverse observational modes, produces images with different properties, rendering conventional methods less effective. This paper presents a novel algorithm for detecting fast moving celestial objects within star fields. Our approach enhances state-of-the-art fast moving celestial object detection neural networks by transforming them into physical-inspired neural networks. These neural networks leverage the point spread function of the telescope and the specific observational mode as prior information; they can directly identify moving fast moving celestial objects within star fields without requiring additional training, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional techniques. Additionally, all neural networks are integrated using the mixture of experts technique, forming a comprehensive fast moving celestial object detection algorithm. We have evaluated our algorithm using simulated observational data that mimics various observations carried out by space based telescope scenarios and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our method effectively detects fast moving celestial objects across different observational modes.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Modeling of Planet and Substellar Atmosphere: High-Resolution Emission, Transmission, and Reflection Spectroscopy with ExoJAX2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling based on differentiable programming holds great promise for astronomy, as it can employ techniques such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, gradient-based optimization, and other machine learning techniques. This new programming paradigm has motivated us to develop the first auto-differentiable spectrum model of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, ExoJAX (Kawahara et al. 2022). ExoJAX is designed to directly calculate cross-sections as functions of temperature and pressure, rather than interpolating tabulated data, to minimize errors in high-dispersion spectra modeling. However, its application was primarily proof-of-concept and limited to narrowband high-dispersion emission spectroscopy. In this paper, we have enhanced the differentiable opacity calculation using a new fast and memory-efficient algorithm, and have developed differentiable radiative transfer schemes, including emission, transmission, and reflection spectroscopy. These enhancements significantly expand the range of applications, as demonstrated through actual atmospheric retrievals: high-dispersion emission spectra of the brown dwarf GL229 B, medium-dispersion transmission spectra of the hot Saturn WASP-39 b from JWST, and high-dispersion reflection spectra of Jupiter. We obtained a C/O ratio for GL229 B consistent with its host star, constrained WASP-39 b's radial velocity from molecular fine structures at original resolution ($R \sim 3,000$), and estimated Jupiter's metallicity consistent with previous studies.</description>

Abstract: We carried out the first high-resolution transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-49 Ab with Keck/HIRES. Upon custom wavelength calibration we achieve a Doppler RV precision of $&lt;$ 60 {\mbox{${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$}}. This is an improvement in RV stability of roughly 240 {\mbox{${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$}} with respect to the instrument standard. We report an average sodium flux residual of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD}/ \mathcal{F}_{\star} (\lambda) \sim$ 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 $\%$ (8.0 $\sigma$) comparable to previous studies. Interestingly, an average Doppler shift of -6.2 $\pm$ 0.5 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}} (12.4 $\sigma$) is identified offset from the exoplanet rest frame. The velocity residuals \textit{in time} trace a blueshift (v$_{\Gamma, ingress} \sim$ -10.3 $\pm$ 1.9 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}}) to redshift (v$_{\Gamma, egress} \sim$ +4.1 $\pm$ 1.5 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}}) suggesting the origin of the observed sodium is unlikely from the atmosphere of the planet. The average Na light curves indicate a depth of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD} /\mathcal{F}_{\star} (t) \sim$ 0.47 $\pm$ 0.04 \% (11.7 $\sigma$) enduring $\lesssim$ 90 minutes with a half-max duration of $\sim$ 40.1 minutes. Frequent high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be able to characterize the periodicity of the observed Doppler shifts. Considering the origin of the transient sodium gas is of unknown geometry, a co-orbiting natural satellite may be a likely source.</description>

      <title>Simple lipids form stable higher-order structures in concentrated sulfuric acid</title>

Abstract: Venus has become a target of astrobiological interest because it is physically accessible to direct exploration, unlike exoplanets. So far this interest has been motivated not by the explicit expectation of finding life but rather by a desire to understand the limits of biology. The venusian surface is sterilizing, but the cloud deck includes regions with temperatures and pressures conventionally considered compatible with life. However, the venusian clouds are thought to consist of concentrated sulfuric acid. To determine if any fundamental features of life as we understand them here on Earth could in principle exist in these extreme solvent conditions, we tested several simple lipids for resistance to solvolysis and their ability to form structures in concentrated sulfuric acid. We find that single-chain saturated lipids with sulfate, alcohol, trimethylamine, and phosphonate head groups are resistant to sulfuric acid degradation at room temperature. Furthermore, we find that they form stable higher-order structures typically associated with lipid membranes, micelles, and vesicles. Finally, results from molecular dynamics simulations suggest a molecular explanation for the observed robustness of the lipid structures formed in concentrated sulfuric acid. We conclude with implications for the study of Venus as a target of experimental astrobiology.</description>

      <title>Simulating Solar Neighborhood Brown Dwarfs I: The Luminosity Function Above and Below the Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06330</link>

Abstract: Brown dwarfs form the key, yet poorly understood, link between stellar and planetary astrophysics. These objects offer unique tests of Galactic structure, but observational limitations have inhibited their large-scale analysis to date. Major upcoming sky surveys will reveal unprecedented numbers of brown dwarfs, among even greater numbers of stellar objects, greatly enhancing the statistical study of brown dwarfs. To extract the comparatively rare brown dwarfs from these massive datasets, we must understand the parameter space they will occupy. In this work, we construct synthetic populations of brown dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood to explore their evolutionary properties using Gaia-derived star formation histories alongside observational mass, metallicity, and age relationships. We apply the Sonora Bobcat, SM08, and Sonora Diamondback evolutionary models. From the populations, we explore the space densities and median ages by spectral type. We present the simulated luminosity function and its evolution with distance from the Galactic Plane. Our simulation shows that brown dwarf population statistics are a function of height above/below the Galactic Plane and sample different age distributions. Interpreting the local sample requires combining evolutionary models, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and kinematic heating. Our models are a guide to how well height-dependent samples can test these scenarios. Sub-populations of brown dwarfs farther from the Plane are older and occupy a different region of parameter space than younger sub-populations closer to the Galactic Plane. Therefore, fully exploring population statistics both near and far from the Plane is critical to prepare for upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Nearly a Decade of Groundbreaking Speckle Interferometry at the International Gemini Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since its inception, speckle interferometry has revolutionized high-resolution astronomical imaging, overcoming atmospheric challenges to achieve the diffraction limits of telescopes. Almost a decade ago, in 2018, a pair of speckle cameras -- 'Alopeke and Zorro -- were installed at the twin 8.1-meter Gemini North and South telescopes, two of the largest apertures in the world, in Hawai'i and Chile. Equipped with dual blue and red channels, 'Alopeke and Zorro deliver high-resolution imaging across optical bandpasses from 350 to 1000 nm, which has led to crucial discoveries in both stellar multiplicity and exoplanetary science. Furthermore, the broad and nonrestrictive access to these instruments, given by each Gemini Observatory partner and via the US NOIRLab open skies policy, has allowed our community to expand the applications of the instruments, supporting a wide range of scientific investigations from Solar System bodies, to morphological studies of stellar remnants, to evolved stars, to transient phenomena. This paper reviews the instrument technology and observational capabilities, and highlights key scientific contributions and discoveries of 'Alopeke and Zorro, emphasizing the enduring importance of speckle interferometry in advancing modern observational astronomy and expanding the frontiers of astronomical research.</description>
