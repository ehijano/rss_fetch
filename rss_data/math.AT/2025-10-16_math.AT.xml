      <title>Equivariant Framed 1-Manifolds and the Pontryagin-Thom Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pontryagin-Thom theorem gives an isomorphism between the cobordism group of framed $n$-dimensional manifolds, $\omega_n$, and the $n^{th}$ stable homotopy group of the sphere spectrum, $\pi_n(\mathbb{S})$. The equivariant analogue of this theorem, gives an isomorphism between the equivariant cobordism group of $V$-framed $G$-manifolds, $\omega_V^G$, and the $V^{th}$ equivariant stable homotopy group of the $G$-sphere spectrum, $\pi_V^G(\mathbb{S})$, for a finite group $G$ and a $G$-representation, $V$. In this paper, we explicitly identify the images of each element of $\omega_1^{C_2}$ and $\omega_\sigma^{C_2}$ in $\pi_1^{C_2}(\mathbb{S})$ and $\pi_\sigma^{C_2}(\mathbb{S})$ under the equivariant Pontryagin-Thom isomorphism.</description>

      <title>MCbiF: Measuring Topological Autocorrelation in Multiscale Clusterings via 2-Parameter Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Datasets often possess an intrinsic multiscale structure with meaningful descriptions at different levels of coarseness. Such datasets are naturally described as multi-resolution clusterings, i.e., not necessarily hierarchical sequences of partitions across scales. To analyse and compare such sequences, we use tools from topological data analysis and define the Multiscale Clustering Bifiltration (MCbiF), a 2-parameter filtration of abstract simplicial complexes that encodes cluster intersection patterns across scales. The MCbiF can be interpreted as a higher-order extension of Sankey diagrams and reduces to a dendrogram for hierarchical sequences. We show that the multiparameter persistent homology (MPH) of the MCbiF yields a finitely presented and block decomposable module, and its stable Hilbert functions characterise the topological autocorrelation of the sequence of partitions. In particular, at dimension zero, the MPH captures violations of the refinement order of partitions, whereas at dimension one, the MPH captures higher-order inconsistencies between clusters across scales. We demonstrate through experiments the use of MCbiF Hilbert functions as topological feature maps for downstream machine learning tasks. MCbiF feature maps outperform information-based baseline features on both regression and classification tasks on synthetic sets of non-hierarchical sequences of partitions. We also show an application of MCbiF to real-world data to measure non-hierarchies in wild mice social grouping patterns across time.</description>

      <title>Algebraic $n$-Valued Monoids on $\mathbb{C}P^1$, Discriminants and Projective Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish connections between the theory of algebraic $n$-valued monoids and groups and the theories of discriminants and projective duality. We show that the composition of projective duality followed by the M\"obius transformation $z\mapsto 1/z$ defines a shift operation $\mathbb{M}_n(\mathbb{C}P^1)\mapsto \mathbb{M}_{n-1}(\mathbb{C}P^1)$ in the family of algebraic $n$-valued coset monoids $\{\mathbb{M}_{n}(\mathbb{C}P^1)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$. We also show that projective duality sends each Fermat curve $x^n+y^n=z^n$ $(n\ge 2)$ to the curve $p_{n-1}(z^n; x^n, y^n)=0$, where the polynomial $p_n(z;x,y)$ defines the addition law in the monoid $\mathbb{M}_n(\mathbb{C}P^1)$. We solve the problem of describing coset $n$-valued addition laws constructed from cubic curves. As a corollary, we obtain that all such addition laws are given by polynomials, whereas the addition laws of formal groups on general cubic curves are given by series.</description>

      <title>The Homology Groups of Zero Divisor Graphs of Finite Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the homology groups of the clique complex associated with the zero-divisor graph of a finite commutative ring. Generalizing the construction introduced by F. R. DeMeyer and L. DeMeyer, we establish a Kunneth-type formula for the homology of such complexes and provide explicit computations for products of finite local rings. As a notable application, we obtain a general method to determine the clique homology groups of Z_n and related ring products. Furthermore, we derive explicit formulas for the Betti numbers when all local factors are fields or non-fields. A complete classification of when this clique complex is Cohen-Macaulay is given, with the exception of one borderline case. Finally, our results yield a partial answer to a question posed in earlier literature, showing that certain topological spaces such as the Klein bottle and the real projective plane cannot be realized as zero-divisor complexes of finite commutative rings.</description>

      <title>What is missing from this picture? Persistent homology and mixup barcodes as a means of investigating negative embedding space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work in the information sciences, especially informetrics and scientometrics, has made substantial contributions to the development of new metrics that eschew the intrinsic biases of citation metrics. This work has tended to employ either network scientific (topological) approaches to quantifying the disruptiveness of peer-reviewed research, or topic modeling approaches to quantifying conceptual novelty. We propose a combination of these approaches, investigating the prospect of topological data analysis (TDA), specifically persistent homology and mixup barcodes, as a means of understanding the negative space among document embeddings generated by topic models. Using top2vec, we embed documents and topics in n-dimensional space, we use persistent homology to identify holes in the embedding distribution, and then use mixup barcodes to determine which holes are being filled by a set of unobserved publications. In this case, the unobserved publications represent research that was published before or after the data used to train top2vec. We investigate the extent that negative embedding space represents missing context (older research) versus innovation space (newer research), and the extend that the documents that occupy this space represents integrations of the research topics on the periphery. Potential applications for this metric are discussed.</description>

      <title>Relating categorical dimensions in topology and symplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study several notions of dimension for (pre-)triangulated categories naturally arising from topology and symplectic geometry. We prove new bounds on these dimensions and raise several questions for further investigation. For instance, we relate the Rouquier dimension of the wrapped Fukaya category of either the cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold $M$ or more generally a Weinstein domain $X$ to quantities of geometric interest. These quantities include the minimum number of critical values of a Morse function on $M$, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of $M$, the number of distinct action values of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of $X$, and the smallest $n$ such that $X$ admits a Weinstein embedding into $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$. Along the way, we introduce a notion of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category for dg-categories and construct exact Lagrangian cobordisms for restriction to a Liouville subdomain.</description>
