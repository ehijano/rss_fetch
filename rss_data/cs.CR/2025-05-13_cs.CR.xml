      <title>Input-Specific and Universal Adversarial Attack Generation for Spiking Neural Networks in the Spiking Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) gain traction across various applications, understanding their security vulnerabilities becomes increasingly important. In this work, we focus on the adversarial attacks, which is perhaps the most concerning threat. An adversarial attack aims at finding a subtle input perturbation to fool the network's decision-making. We propose two novel adversarial attack algorithms for SNNs: an input-specific attack that crafts adversarial samples from specific dataset inputs and a universal attack that generates a reusable patch capable of inducing misclassification across most inputs, thus offering practical feasibility for real-time deployment. The algorithms are gradient-based operating in the spiking domain proving to be effective across different evaluation metrics, such as adversarial accuracy, stealthiness, and generation time. Experimental results on two widely used neuromorphic vision datasets, NMNIST and IBM DVS Gesture, show that our proposed attacks surpass in all metrics all existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we present the first demonstration of adversarial attack generation in the sound domain using the SHD dataset.</description>

      <title>RAP-SM: Robust Adversarial Prompt via Shadow Models for Copyright Verification of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have underscored the importance of safeguarding intellectual property rights through robust fingerprinting techniques. Traditional fingerprint verification approaches typically focus on a single model, seeking to improve the robustness of its fingerprint.However, these single-model methods often struggle to capture intrinsic commonalities across multiple related models. In this paper, we propose RAP-SM (Robust Adversarial Prompt via Shadow Models), a novel framework that extracts a public fingerprint for an entire series of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that RAP-SM effectively captures the intrinsic commonalities among different models while exhibiting strong adversarial robustness. Our findings suggest that RAP-SM presents a valuable avenue for scalable fingerprint verification, offering enhanced protection against potential model breaches in the era of increasingly prevalent LLMs.</description>

      <title>User Behavior Analysis in Privacy Protection with Large Language Models: A Study on Privacy Preferences with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), user privacy protection has become a significant research topic. Existing privacy preference modeling methods often rely on large-scale user data, making effective privacy preference analysis challenging in data-limited environments. This study explores how LLMs can analyze user behavior related to privacy protection in scenarios with limited data and proposes a method that integrates Few-shot Learning and Privacy Computing to model user privacy preferences. The research utilizes anonymized user privacy settings data, survey responses, and simulated data, comparing the performance of traditional modeling approaches with LLM-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with limited data, LLMs significantly improve the accuracy of privacy preference modeling. Additionally, incorporating Differential Privacy and Federated Learning further reduces the risk of user data exposure. The findings provide new insights into the application of LLMs in privacy protection and offer theoretical support for advancing privacy computing and user behavior analysis.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-driven Security Assistant for Internet of Things via Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has transformed people's way of life and has a profound impact on both production and daily activities. However, with the rapid advancement of IoT technology, the security of IoT devices has become an unavoidable issue in both research and applications. Although some efforts have been made to detect or mitigate IoT security vulnerabilities, they often struggle to adapt to the complexity of IoT environments, especially when dealing with dynamic security scenarios. How to automatically, efficiently, and accurately understand these vulnerabilities remains a challenge. To address this, we propose an IoT security assistant driven by Large Language Model (LLM), which enhances the LLM's understanding of IoT security vulnerabilities and related threats. The aim of the ICoT method we propose is to enable the LLM to understand security issues by breaking down the various dimensions of security vulnerabilities and generating responses tailored to the user's specific needs and expertise level. By incorporating ICoT, LLM can gradually analyze and reason through complex security scenarios, resulting in more accurate, in-depth, and personalized security recommendations and solutions. Experimental results show that, compared to methods relying solely on LLM, our proposed LLM-driven IoT security assistant significantly improves the understanding of IoT security issues through the ICoT approach and provides personalized solutions based on the user's identity, demonstrating higher accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>Defending against Indirect Prompt Injection by Instruction Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external sources is becoming increasingly common, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) being a prominent example. However, this integration introduces vulnerabilities of Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where hidden instructions embedded in external data can manipulate LLMs into executing unintended or harmful actions. We recognize that the success of IPI attacks fundamentally relies in the presence of instructions embedded within external content, which can alter the behavioral state of LLMs. Can effectively detecting such state changes help us defend against IPI attacks? In this paper, we propose a novel approach that takes external data as input and leverages the behavioral state of LLMs during both forward and backward propagation to detect potential IPI attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate that the hidden states and gradients from intermediate layers provide highly discriminative features for instruction detection. By effectively combining these features, our approach achieves a detection accuracy of 99.60\% in the in-domain setting and 96.90\% in the out-of-domain setting, while reducing the attack success rate to just 0.12\% on the BIPIA benchmark.</description>

      <title>Threat Modeling for AI: The Case for an Asset-Centric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI are transforming AI's ubiquitous presence in our world from that of standalone AI-applications into deeply integrated AI-agents. These changes have been driven by agents' increasing capability to autonomously make decisions and initiate actions, using existing applications; whether those applications are AI-based or not. This evolution enables unprecedented levels of AI integration, with agents now able to take actions on behalf of systems and users -- including, in some cases, the powerful ability for the AI to write and execute scripts as it deems necessary. With AI systems now able to autonomously execute code, interact with external systems, and operate without human oversight, traditional security approaches fall short.
  This paper introduces an asset-centric methodology for threat modeling AI systems that addresses the unique security challenges posed by integrated AI agents. Unlike existing top-down frameworks that analyze individual attacks within specific product contexts, our bottom-up approach enables defenders to systematically identify how vulnerabilities -- both conventional and AI-specific -- impact critical AI assets across distributed infrastructures used to develop and deploy these agents. This methodology allows security teams to: (1) perform comprehensive analysis that communicates effectively across technical domains, (2) quantify security assumptions about third-party AI components without requiring visibility into their implementation, and (3) holistically identify AI-based vulnerabilities relevant to their specific product context. This approach is particularly relevant for securing agentic systems with complex autonomous capabilities. By focusing on assets rather than attacks, our approach scales with the rapidly evolving threat landscape while accommodating increasingly complex and distributed AI development pipelines.</description>

      <title>LATENT: LLM-Augmented Trojan Insertion and Evaluation Framework for Analog Netlist Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog and mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuits (ICs) are integral to safety-critical applications. However, the globalization and outsourcing of A/MS ICs to untrusted third-party foundries expose them to security threats, particularly analog Trojans. Unlike digital Trojans which have been extensively studied, analog Trojans remain largely unexplored. There has been only limited research on their diversity and stealth in analog designs, where a Trojan is activated only during a narrow input voltage range. Effective defense techniques require a clear understanding of the attack vectors; however, the lack of diverse analog Trojan instances limits robust advances in detection strategies. To address this gap, we present LATENT, the first large language model (LLM)-driven framework for crafting stealthy, circuit-specific analog Trojans. LATENT incorporates LLM as an autonomous agent to intelligently insert and refine Trojan components within analog designs based on iterative feedback from a detection model. This feedback loop ensures that the inserted Trojans remain stealthy while successfully evading detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our generated Trojan designs exhibit an average Trojan-activation range of 15.74%, ensuring they remain inactive under most operating voltages, while causing a significant performance degradation of 11.3% upon activation.</description>

      <title>NCorr-FP: A Neighbourhood-based Correlation-preserving Fingerprinting Scheme for Intellectual Property Protection of Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring data ownership and traceability of unauthorised redistribution are central to safeguarding intellectual property in shared data environments. Data fingerprinting addresses these challenges by embedding recipient-specific marks into the data, typically via content modifications. We propose NCorr-FP, a Neighbourhood-based Correlation-preserving Fingerprinting system for structured tabular data with the main goal of preserving statistical fidelity. The method uses local record similarity and density estimation to guide the insertion of fingerprint bits. The embedding logic is then reversed to extract the fingerprint from a potentially modified dataset. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness, fidelity, utility and robustness. Results show that fingerprints are virtually imperceptible, with minute Hellinger distances and KL divergences, even at high embedding ratios. The system also maintains high data utility for downstream predictive tasks. The method achieves 100\% detection confidence under substantial data deletions and remains robust against adaptive and collusion attacks. Satisfying all these requirements concurrently on mixed-type datasets highlights the strong applicability of NCorr-FP to real-world data settings.</description>

      <title>Offensive Security for AI Systems: Concepts, Practices, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly adopted across sectors, the need for robust, proactive security strategies is paramount. Traditional defensive measures often fall short against the unique and evolving threats facing AI-driven technologies, making offensive security an essential approach for identifying and mitigating risks. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for offensive security in AI systems, emphasizing proactive threat simulation and adversarial testing to uncover vulnerabilities throughout the AI lifecycle. We examine key offensive security techniques, including weakness and vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and red teaming, tailored specifically to address AI's unique susceptibilities. By simulating real-world attack scenarios, these methodologies reveal critical insights, informing stronger defensive strategies and advancing resilience against emerging threats. This framework advances offensive AI security from theoretical concepts to practical, actionable methodologies that organizations can implement to strengthen their AI systems against emerging threats.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-Driven Human-Machine Co-Teaming for Adaptive and Agile Cyber Security Operation Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) face growing challenges in managing cybersecurity threats due to an overwhelming volume of alerts, a shortage of skilled analysts, and poorly integrated tools. Human-AI collaboration offers a promising path to augment the capabilities of SOC analysts while reducing their cognitive overload. To this end, we introduce an AI-driven human-machine co-teaming paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance threat intelligence, alert triage, and incident response workflows. We present a vision in which LLM-based AI agents learn from human analysts the tacit knowledge embedded in SOC operations, enabling the AI agents to improve their performance on SOC tasks through this co-teaming. We invite SOCs to collaborate with us to further develop this process and uncover replicable patterns where human-AI co-teaming yields measurable improvements in SOC productivity.</description>

      <title>Engineering Risk-Aware, Security-by-Design Frameworks for Assurance of Large-Scale Autonomous AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI models scale to billions of parameters and operate with increasing autonomy, ensuring their safe, reliable operation demands engineering-grade security and assurance frameworks. This paper presents an enterprise-level, risk-aware, security-by-design approach for large-scale autonomous AI systems, integrating standardized threat metrics, adversarial hardening techniques, and real-time anomaly detection into every phase of the development lifecycle. We detail a unified pipeline - from design-time risk assessments and secure training protocols to continuous monitoring and automated audit logging - that delivers provable guarantees of model behavior under adversarial and operational stress. Case studies in national security, open-source model governance, and industrial automation demonstrate measurable reductions in vulnerability and compliance overhead. Finally, we advocate cross-sector collaboration - uniting engineering teams, standards bodies, and regulatory agencies - to institutionalize these technical safeguards within a resilient, end-to-end assurance ecosystem for the next generation of AI.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we hope to expand the universe of security practitioners of open-source hardware by creating a bridge from hardware design languages (HDLs) to data science languages like Python and R through libraries that converge VCD (value change dump) files into data frames, the expected input type of the modern data science tools.

      <title>Learning from the Good Ones: Risk Profiling-Based Defenses Against Evasion Attacks on DNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety-critical applications such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles use deep neural networks (DNN) to make predictions and infer decisions. DNNs are susceptible to evasion attacks, where an adversary crafts a malicious data instance to trick the DNN into making wrong decisions at inference time. Existing defenses that protect DNNs against evasion attacks are either static or dynamic. Static defenses are computationally efficient but do not adapt to the evolving threat landscape, while dynamic defenses are adaptable but suffer from an increased computational overhead. To combine the best of both worlds, in this paper, we propose a novel risk profiling framework that uses a risk-aware strategy to selectively train static defenses using victim instances that exhibit the most resilient features and are hence more resilient against an evasion attack. We hypothesize that training existing defenses on instances that are less vulnerable to the attack enhances the adversarial detection rate by reducing false negatives. We evaluate the efficacy of our risk-aware selective training strategy on a blood glucose management system that demonstrates how training static anomaly detectors indiscriminately may result in an increased false negative rate, which could be life-threatening in safety-critical applications. Our experiments show that selective training on the less vulnerable patients achieves a recall increase of up to 27.5\% with minimal impact on precision compared to indiscriminate training.</description>

      <title>System Prompt Poisoning: Persistent Attacks on Large Language Models Beyond User Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse applications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their plug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with these models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated into various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are growing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts (e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack), while the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work bridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack vector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons system prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and model responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies in various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and reasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without requiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks, including those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language processing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective even when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and retrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for improving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened in their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.</description>

      <title>An In-kernel Forensics Engine for Investigating Evasive Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, adversarial attempts against critical services have become more effective and sophisticated in launching low-profile attacks. This trend has always been concerning. However, an even more alarming trend is the increasing difficulty of collecting relevant evidence about these attacks and the involved threat actors in the early stages before significant damage is done. This issue puts defenders at a significant disadvantage, as it becomes exceedingly difficult to understand the attack details and formulate an appropriate response. Developing robust forensics tools to collect evidence about modern threats has never been easy. One main challenge is to provide a robust trade-off between achieving sufficient visibility while leaving minimal detectable artifacts. This paper will introduce LASE, an open-source Low-Artifact Forensics Engine to perform threat analysis and forensics in Windows operating system. LASE augments current analysis tools by providing detailed, system-wide monitoring capabilities while minimizing detectable artifacts. We designed multiple deployment scenarios, showing LASE's potential in evidence gathering and threat reasoning in a real-world setting. By making LASE and its execution trace data available to the broader research community, this work encourages further exploration in the field by reducing the engineering costs for threat analysis and building a longitudinal behavioral analysis catalog for diverse security domains.</description>

      <title>POISONCRAFT: Practical Poisoning of Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various domains, primarily due to their strong capabilities in reasoning and generating human-like text. Despite their impressive performance, LLMs are susceptible to hallucinations, which can lead to incorrect or misleading outputs. This is primarily due to the lack of up-to-date knowledge or domain-specific information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, the security of RAG systems has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we study a poisoning attack on RAG systems named POISONCRAFT, which can mislead the model to refer to fraudulent websites. Compared to existing poisoning attacks on RAG systems, our attack is more practical as it does not require access to the target user query's info or edit the user query. It not only ensures that injected texts can be retrieved by the model, but also ensures that the LLM will be misled to refer to the injected texts in its response. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POISONCRAFTacross different datasets, retrievers, and language models in RAG pipelines, and show that it remains effective when transferred across retrievers, including black-box systems. Moreover, we present a case study revealing how the attack influences both the retrieval behavior and the step-by-step reasoning trace within the generation model, and further evaluate the robustness of POISONCRAFTunder multiple defense mechanisms. These results validate the practicality of our threat model and highlight a critical security risk for RAG systems deployed in real-world applications. We release our code\footnote{https://github.com/AndyShaw01/PoisonCraft} to support future research on the security and robustness of RAG systems in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Anomaly Detection with Blockchain for Real-Time Security and Reliability in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) proliferation brings important and pressing security and reliability issues that must be dealt with to guarantee public safety and help their widespread adoption. The contribution of the proposed research is towards achieving more secure, reliable, and trustworthy autonomous transportation system by providing more capabilities for anomaly detection, data provenance, and real-time response in safety critical AV deployments. In this research, we develop a new framework that combines the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for real-time anomaly detection with blockchain technology to detect and prevent any malicious activity including sensor failures in AVs. Through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our approach continually monitors associated multi-sensor data streams to detect anomalous patterns that may represent cyberattacks as well as hardware malfunctions. Further, this framework employs a decentralized platform for securely storing sensor data and anomaly alerts in a blockchain ledger for data incorruptibility and authenticity, while offering transparent forensic features. Moreover, immediate automated response mechanisms are deployed using smart contracts when anomalies are found. This makes the AV system more resilient to attacks from both cyberspace and hardware component failure. Besides, we identify potential challenges of scalability in handling high frequency sensor data, computational constraint in resource constrained environment, and of distributed data storage in terms of privacy.</description>

      <title>A Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning Intrusion Detection Framework for Internet of Robotic Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In intelligent industry, autonomous driving and other environments, the Internet of Things (IoT) highly integrated with robotic to form the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT). However, network intrusion to IoRT can lead to data leakage, service interruption in IoRT and even physical damage by controlling robots or vehicles. This paper proposes a Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning Network Intrusion Detection framework (CFedSSL-NID) for IoRT intrusion detection and defense, to address the practical scenario of IoRT where robots don't possess labeled data locally and the requirement for data privacy preserving. CFedSSL-NID integrates randomly weak and strong augmentation, latent contrastive learning, and EMA update to integrate supervised signals, thereby enhancing performance and robustness on robots' local unlabeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CFedSSL-NID outperforms existing federated semi-supervised and fully supervised methods on benchmark dataset and has lower resource requirements.</description>

      <title>Practical Reasoning Interruption Attacks on Reasoning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a variety of tasks, yet they also expose numerous security vulnerabilities. Most of these vulnerabilities have centered on the generation of unsafe content. However, recent work has identified a distinct "thinking-stopped" vulnerability in DeepSeek-R1: under adversarial prompts, the model's reasoning process ceases at the system level and produces an empty final answer. Building upon this vulnerability, researchers developed a novel prompt injection attack, termed reasoning interruption attack, and also offered an initial analysis of its root cause. Through extensive experiments, we verify the previous analyses, correct key errors based on three experimental findings, and present a more rigorous explanation of the fundamental causes driving the vulnerability. Moreover, existing attacks typically require over 2,000 tokens, impose significant overhead, reduce practicality, and are easily detected. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first practical reasoning interruption attack. It succeeds with just 109 tokens by exploiting our newly uncovered "reasoning token overflow" (RTO) effect to overwrite the model's final answer, forcing it to return an invalid response. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed attack is highly effective. Furthermore, we discover that the method for triggering RTO differs between the official DeepSeek-R1 release and common unofficial deployments. As a broadened application of RTO, we also construct a novel jailbreak attack that enables the transfer of unsafe content within the reasoning tokens into final answer, thereby exposing it to the user. Our work carries significant implications for enhancing the security of RLLMs.</description>

      <title>RuleGenie: SIEM Detection Rule Set Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SIEM systems serve as a critical hub, employing rule-based logic to detect and respond to threats. Redundant or overlapping rules in SIEM systems lead to excessive false alerts, degrading analyst performance due to alert fatigue, and increase computational overhead and response latency for actual threats. As a result, optimizing SIEM rule sets is essential for efficient operations. Despite the importance of such optimization, research in this area is limited, with current practices relying on manual optimization methods that are both time-consuming and error-prone due to the scale and complexity of enterprise-level rule sets. To address this gap, we present RuleGenie, a novel large language model (LLM) aided recommender system designed to optimize SIEM rule sets. Our approach leverages transformer models' multi-head attention capabilities to generate SIEM rule embeddings, which are then analyzed using a similarity matching algorithm to identify the top-k most similar rules. The LLM then processes the rules identified, utilizing its information extraction, language understanding, and reasoning capabilities to analyze rule similarity, evaluate threat coverage and performance metrics, and deliver optimized recommendations for refining the rule set. By automating the rule optimization process, RuleGenie allows security teams to focus on more strategic tasks while enhancing the efficiency of SIEM systems and strengthening organizations' security posture. We evaluated RuleGenie on a comprehensive set of real-world SIEM rule formats, including Splunk, Sigma, and AQL (Ariel query language), demonstrating its platform-agnostic capabilities and adaptability across diverse security infrastructures. Our experimental results show that RuleGenie can effectively identify redundant rules, which in turn decreases false positive rates and enhances overall rule efficiency.</description>

      <title>I Know What You Said: Unveiling Hardware Cache Side-Channels in Local Large Language Model Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be deployed locally have recently gained popularity for privacy-sensitive tasks, with companies such as Meta, Google, and Intel playing significant roles in their development. However, the security of local LLMs through the lens of hardware cache side-channels remains unexplored. In this paper, we unveil novel side-channel vulnerabilities in local LLM inference: token value and token position leakage, which can expose both the victim's input and output text, thereby compromising user privacy. Specifically, we found that adversaries can infer the token values from the cache access patterns of the token embedding operation, and deduce the token positions from the timing of autoregressive decoding phases. To demonstrate the potential of these leaks, we design a novel eavesdropping attack framework targeting both open-source and proprietary LLM inference systems. The attack framework does not directly interact with the victim's LLM and can be executed without privilege.
  We evaluate the attack on a range of practical local LLM deployments (e.g., Llama, Falcon, and Gemma), and the results show that our attack achieves promising accuracy. The restored output and input text have an average edit distance of 5.2% and 17.3% to the ground truth, respectively. Furthermore, the reconstructed texts achieve average cosine similarity scores of 98.7% (input) and 98.0% (output).</description>

      <title>DPolicy: Managing Privacy Risks Across Multiple Releases with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a robust framework for privacy-preserving data releases and has been successfully applied in high-profile cases, such as the 2020 US Census. However, in organizational settings, the use of DP remains largely confined to isolated data releases. This approach restricts the potential of DP to serve as a framework for comprehensive privacy risk management at an organizational level. Although one might expect that the cumulative privacy risk of isolated releases could be assessed using DP's compositional property, in practice, individual DP guarantees are frequently tailored to specific releases, making it difficult to reason about their interaction or combined impact. At the same time, less tailored DP guarantees, which compose more easily, also offer only limited insight because they lead to excessively large privacy budgets that convey limited meaning. To address these limitations, we present DPolicy, a system designed to manage cumulative privacy risks across multiple data releases using DP. Unlike traditional approaches that treat each release in isolation or rely on a single (global) DP guarantee, our system employs a flexible framework that considers multiple DP guarantees simultaneously, reflecting the diverse contexts and scopes typical of real-world DP deployments. DPolicy introduces a high-level policy language to formalize privacy guarantees, making traditionally implicit assumptions on scopes and contexts explicit. By deriving the DP guarantees required to enforce complex privacy semantics from these high-level policies, DPolicy enables fine-grained privacy risk management on an organizational scale. We implement and evaluate DPolicy, demonstrating how it mitigates privacy risks that can emerge without comprehensive, organization-wide privacy risk management.</description>

      <title>ThreatLens: LLM-guided Threat Modeling and Test Plan Generation for Hardware Security Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current hardware security verification processes predominantly rely on manual threat modeling and test plan generation, which are labor-intensive, error-prone, and struggle to scale with increasing design complexity and evolving attack methodologies. To address these challenges, we propose ThreatLens, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates security threat modeling and test plan generation for hardware security verification. ThreatLens integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract relevant security knowledge, LLM-powered reasoning for threat assessment, and interactive user feedback to ensure the generation of practical test plans. By automating these processes, the framework reduces the manual verification effort, enhances coverage, and ensures a structured, adaptable approach to security verification. We evaluated our framework on the NEORV32 SoC, demonstrating its capability to automate security verification through structured test plans and validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sandcastles in the Storm: Revisiting the (Im)possibility of Strong Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking AI-generated text is critical for combating misuse. Yet recent theoretical work argues that any watermark can be erased via random walk attacks that perturb text while preserving quality. However, such attacks rely on two key assumptions: (1) rapid mixing (watermarks dissolve quickly under perturbations) and (2) reliable quality preservation (automated quality oracles perfectly guide edits). Through large-scale experiments and human-validated assessments, we find mixing is slow: 100% of perturbed texts retain traces of their origin after hundreds of edits, defying rapid mixing. Oracles falter, as state-of-the-art quality detectors misjudge edits (77% accuracy), compounding errors during attacks. Ultimately, attacks underperform: automated walks remove watermarks just 26% of the time -- dropping to 10% under human quality review. These findings challenge the inevitability of watermark removal. Instead, practical barriers -- slow mixing and imperfect quality control -- reveal watermarking to be far more robust than theoretical models suggest. The gap between idealized attacks and real-world feasibility underscores the need for stronger watermarking methods and more realistic attack models.</description>

      <title>"Explain, Don't Just Warn!" -- A Real-Time Framework for Generating Phishing Warnings with Contextual Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anti-phishing tools typically display generic warnings that offer users limited explanation on why a website is considered malicious, which can prevent end-users from developing the mental models needed to recognize phishing cues on their own. This becomes especially problematic when these tools inevitably fail - particularly against evasive threats, and users are found to be ill-equipped to identify and avoid them independently. To address these limitations, we present PhishXplain (PXP), a real-time explainable phishing warning system designed to augment existing detection mechanisms. PXP empowers users by clearly articulating why a site is flagged as malicious, highlighting suspicious elements using a memory-efficient implementation of LLaMA 3.2. It utilizes a structured two-step prompt architecture to identify phishing features, generate contextual explanations, and render annotated screenshots that visually reinforce the warning. Longitudinally implementing PhishXplain over a month on 7,091 live phishing websites, we found that it can generate warnings for 94% of the sites, with a correctness of 96%. We also evaluated PhishXplain through a user study with 150 participants split into two groups: one received conventional, generic warnings, while the other interacted with PXP's explainable alerts. Participants who received the explainable warnings not only demonstrated a significantly better understanding of phishing indicators but also achieved higher accuracy in identifying phishing threats, even without any warning. Moreover, they reported greater satisfaction and trust in the warnings themselves. These improvements were especially pronounced among users with lower initial levels of cybersecurity proficiency and awareness. To encourage the adoption of this framework, we release PhishXplain as an open-source browser extension.</description>

      <title>DP-TRAE: A Dual-Phase Merging Transferable Reversible Adversarial Example for Image Privacy Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of digital security, Reversible Adversarial Examples (RAE) combine adversarial attacks with reversible data hiding techniques to effectively protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized analysis by malicious Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing RAE techniques primarily focus on white-box attacks, lacking a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in black-box scenarios. This limitation impedes their broader deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Further more, traditional black-box attacks are often characterized by poor transferability and high query costs, significantly limiting their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Phase Merging Transferable Reversible Attack method, which generates highly transferable initial adversarial perturbations in a white-box model and employs a memory augmented black-box strategy to effectively mislead target mod els. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving a 99.0% attack success rate and 100% recovery rate in black-box scenarios, highlighting its robustness in privacy protection. Moreover, we successfully implemented a black-box attack on a commercial model, further substantiating the potential of this approach for practical use.</description>

      <title>RedTeamLLM: an Agentic AI framework for offensive security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From automated intrusion testing to discovery of zero-day attacks before software launch, agentic AI calls for great promises in security engineering. This strong capability is bound with a similar threat: the security and research community must build up its models before the approach is leveraged by malicious actors for cybercrime. We therefore propose and evaluate RedTeamLLM, an integrated architecture with a comprehensive security model for automatization of pentest tasks. RedTeamLLM follows three key steps: summarizing, reasoning and act, which embed its operational capacity. This novel framework addresses four open challenges: plan correction, memory management, context window constraint, and generality vs. specialization. Evaluation is performed through the automated resolution of a range of entry-level, but not trivial, CTF challenges. The contribution of the reasoning capability of our agentic AI framework is specifically evaluated.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Accuracy and Effectiveness of PII Removal Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of commercial personally identifiable information (PII) removal systems -- commercial services that claim to improve privacy by automating the removal of PII from data broker's databases. Popular examples of such services include DeleteMe, Mozilla Monitor, Incogni, among many others. The claims these services make may be very appealing to privacy-conscious Web users, but how effective these services actually are at improving privacy has not been investigated. This work aims to improve our understanding of commercial PII removal services in multiple ways. First, we conduct a user study where participants purchase subscriptions from four popular PII removal services, and report (i) what PII the service find, (ii) from which data brokers, (iii) whether the service is able to have the information removed, and (iv) whether the identified information actually is PII describing the participant. And second, by comparing the claims and promises the services makes (e.g. which and how many data brokers each service claims to cover). We find that these services have significant accuracy and coverage issues that limit the usefulness of these services as a privacy-enhancing technology. For example, we find that the measured services are unable to remove the majority of the identified PII records from data broker's (48.2% of the successfully removed found records) and that most records identified by these services are not PII about the user (study participants found that only 41.1% of records identified by these services were PII about themselves).</description>

      <title>Source Anonymity for Private Random Walk Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers random walk-based decentralized learning, where at each iteration of the learning process, one user updates the model and sends it to a randomly chosen neighbor until a convergence criterion is met. Preserving data privacy is a central concern and open problem in decentralized learning. We propose a privacy-preserving algorithm based on public-key cryptography and anonymization. In this algorithm, the user updates the model and encrypts the result using a distant user's public key. The encrypted result is then transmitted through the network with the goal of reaching that specific user. The key idea is to hide the source's identity so that, when the destination user decrypts the result, it does not know who the source was. The challenge is to design a network-dependent probability distribution (at the source) over the potential destinations such that, from the receiver's perspective, all users have a similar likelihood of being the source. We introduce the problem and construct a scheme that provides anonymity with theoretical guarantees. We focus on random regular graphs to establish rigorous guarantees.</description>

      <title>Standing Firm in 5G: A Single-Round, Dropout-Resilient Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is well-suited to 5G networks, where many mobile devices generate sensitive edge data. Secure aggregation protocols enhance privacy in FL by ensuring that individual user updates reveal no information about the underlying client data. However, the dynamic and large-scale nature of 5G-marked by high mobility and frequent dropouts-poses significant challenges to the effective adoption of these protocols. Existing protocols often require multi-round communication or rely on fixed infrastructure, limiting their practicality. We propose a lightweight, single-round secure aggregation protocol designed for 5G environments. By leveraging base stations for assisted computation and incorporating precomputation, key-homomorphic pseudorandom functions, and t-out-of-k secret sharing, our protocol ensures efficiency, robustness, and privacy. Experiments show strong security guarantees and significant gains in communication and computation efficiency, making the approach well-suited for real-world 5G FL deployments.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Bit-Level Encryption of Full High-Definition Video Without Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of Shannon's confusion-diffusion architecture in image encryption, the implementation of diffusion to sequentially establish inter-pixel dependencies for attaining plaintext sensitivity constrains algorithmic parallelism, while the execution of multiple rounds of diffusion operations to meet the required sensitivity metrics incurs excessive computational overhead. Consequently, the pursuit of plaintext sensitivity through diffusion operations is the primary factor limiting the computational efficiency and throughput of video encryption algorithms, rendering them inadequate to meet the demands of real-time encryption for high-resolution video. To address the performance limitation, this paper proposes a real-time video encryption protocol based on heterogeneous parallel computing, which incorporates the SHA-256 hashes of original frames as input, employs multiple CPU threads to concurrently generate encryption-related data, and deploys numerous GPU threads to simultaneously encrypt pixels. By leveraging the extreme input sensitivity of the SHA hash, the proposed protocol achieves the required plaintext sensitivity metrics with only a single round of confusion and XOR operations, significantly reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, through eliminating the reliance on diffusion, it realizes the allocation of a dedicated GPU thread for encrypting each pixel within every channel, effectively enhancing algorithm's parallelism. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only exhibits superior statistical properties and robust security but also achieving delay-free bit-level encryption for 1920$\times$1080 resolution (full high definition) video at 30 FPS, with an average encryption time of 25.84 ms on a server equipped with an Intel Xeon Gold 6226R CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.</description>

      <title>One Trigger Token Is Enough: A Defense Strategy for Balancing Safety and Usability in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively used across diverse domains, including virtual assistants, automated code generation, and scientific research. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which manipulate the models into generating harmful responses despite safety alignment. Recent studies have shown that current safety-aligned LLMs often undergo the shallow safety alignment, where the first few tokens largely determine whether the response will be harmful. Through comprehensive observations, we find that safety-aligned LLMs and various defense strategies generate highly similar initial tokens in their refusal responses, which we define as safety trigger tokens. Building on this insight, we propose \texttt{D-STT}, a simple yet effective defense algorithm that identifies and explicitly decodes safety trigger tokens of the given safety-aligned LLM to trigger the model's learned safety patterns. In this process, the safety trigger is constrained to a single token, which effectively preserves model usability by introducing minimum intervention in the decoding process. Extensive experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks and benign prompts demonstrate that \ours significantly reduces output harmfulness while preserving model usability and incurring negligible response time overhead, outperforming ten baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Securing Genomic Data Against Inference Attacks in Federated Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising framework for collaboratively training machine learning models across decentralized genomic datasets without direct data sharing. While this approach preserves data locality, it remains susceptible to sophisticated inference attacks that can compromise individual privacy. In this study, we simulate a federated learning setup using synthetic genomic data and assess its vulnerability to three key attack vectors: Membership Inference Attack (MIA), Gradient-Based Membership Inference Attack, and Label Inference Attack (LIA). Our experiments reveal that Gradient-Based MIA achieves the highest effectiveness, with a precision of 0.79 and F1-score of 0.87, underscoring the risk posed by gradient exposure in federated updates. Additionally, we visualize comparative attack performance through radar plots and quantify model leakage across clients. The findings emphasize the inadequacy of na\"ive FL setups in safeguarding genomic privacy and motivate the development of more robust privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored to the unique sensitivity of genomic data.</description>

      <title>Comet: Accelerating Private Inference for Large Language Model by Predicting Activation Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing use of large language models (LLMs) hosted on cloud platforms to offer inference services, privacy concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information are escalating. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a promising solution to protect the privacy in LLM inference. However, MPC requires frequent inter-server communication, causing high performance overhead.
  Inspired by the prevalent activation sparsity of LLMs, where most neuron are not activated after non-linear activation functions, we propose an efficient private inference system, Comet. This system employs an accurate and fast predictor to predict the sparsity distribution of activation function output. Additionally, we introduce a new private inference protocol. It efficiently and securely avoids computations involving zero values by exploiting the spatial locality of the predicted sparse distribution. While this computation-avoidance approach impacts the spatiotemporal continuity of KV cache entries, we address this challenge with a low-communication overhead cache refilling strategy that merges miss requests and incorporates a prefetching mechanism. Finally, we evaluate Comet on four common LLMs and compare it with six state-of-the-art private inference systems. Comet achieves a 1.87x-2.63x speedup and a 1.94x-2.64x communication reduction.</description>

      <title>Private LoRA Fine-tuning of Open-Source LLMs with Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preserving data confidentiality during the fine-tuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for sensitive applications. This work introduces an interactive protocol adapting the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique for private fine-tuning. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) protects the confidentiality of training data and gradients handled by remote worker nodes performing the bulk of computations involving the base model weights. The data owner orchestrates training, requiring minimal local computing power and memory, thus alleviating the need for expensive client-side GPUs. We demonstrate feasibility by fine-tuning a Llama-3.2-1B model, presenting convergence results using HE-compatible quantization and performance benchmarks for HE computations on GPU hardware. This approach enables applications such as confidential knowledge base question answering, private codebase fine-tuning for AI code assistants, AI agents for drafting emails based on a company's email archive, and adapting models to analyze sensitive legal or healthcare documents.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Secure Decentralized Random Number Generation Protocol with Two Rounds of Communication in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomness plays a vital role in numerous applications, including simulation, cryptography, distributed systems, and gaming. Consequently, extensive research has been conducted to generate randomness. One such method is to design a decentralized random number generator (DRNG), a protocol that enables multiple participants to collaboratively generate random outputs that must be publicly verifiable. However, existing DRNGs are either not secure against quantum computers or depend on the random oracle model (ROM) to achieve security. In this paper, we design a DRNG based on lattice-based publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) that is post-quantum secure and proven secure in the standard model. Additionally, our DRNG requires only two rounds of communication to generate a single (pseudo)random value and can tolerate up to any t &lt; n/2 dishonest participants. To our knowledge, the proposed DRNG construction is the first to achieve all these properties.</description>

      <title>Security through the Eyes of AI: How Visualization is Shaping Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malware, a persistent cybersecurity threat, increasingly targets interconnected digital systems such as desktop, mobile, and IoT platforms through sophisticated attack vectors. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers compromise the integrity and resilience of modern digital ecosystems. To address this risk, security experts actively employ Machine Learning or Deep Learning-based strategies, integrating static, dynamic, or hybrid approaches to categorize malware instances. Despite their advantages, these methods have inherent drawbacks and malware variants persistently evolve with increased sophistication, necessitating advancements in detection strategies. Visualization-based techniques are emerging as scalable and interpretable solutions for detecting and understanding malicious behaviors across diverse platforms including desktop, mobile, IoT, and distributed systems as well as through analysis of network packet capture files. In this comprehensive survey of more than 100 high-quality research articles, we evaluate existing visualization-based approaches applied to malware detection and classification. As a first contribution, we propose a new all-encompassing framework to study the landscape of visualization-based malware detection techniques. Within this framework, we systematically analyze state-of-the-art approaches across the critical stages of the malware detection pipeline. By analyzing not only the single techniques but also how they are combined to produce the final solution, we shed light on the main challenges in visualization-based approaches and provide insights into the advancements and potential future directions in this critical field.</description>

      <title>SecReEvalBench: A Multi-turned Security Resilience Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models in security-sensitive domains necessitates rigorous evaluation of their resilience against adversarial prompt-based attacks. While previous benchmarks have focused on security evaluations with limited and predefined attack domains, such as cybersecurity attacks, they often lack a comprehensive assessment of intent-driven adversarial prompts and the consideration of real-life scenario-based multi-turn attacks. To address this gap, we present SecReEvalBench, the Security Resilience Evaluation Benchmark, which defines four novel metrics: Prompt Attack Resilience Score, Prompt Attack Refusal Logic Score, Chain-Based Attack Resilience Score and Chain-Based Attack Rejection Time Score. Moreover, SecReEvalBench employs six questioning sequences for model assessment: one-off attack, successive attack, successive reverse attack, alternative attack, sequential ascending attack with escalating threat levels and sequential descending attack with diminishing threat levels. In addition, we introduce a dataset customized for the benchmark, which incorporates both neutral and malicious prompts, categorised across seven security domains and sixteen attack techniques. In applying this benchmark, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art open-weighted large language models, Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, Mistral v0.3, DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen 3. Our findings offer critical insights into the strengths and weaknesses of modern large language models in defending against evolving adversarial threats. The SecReEvalBench dataset is publicly available at https://kaggle.com/datasets/5a7ee22cf9dab6c93b55a73f630f6c9b42e936351b0ae98fbae6ddaca7fe248d, which provides a groundwork for advancing research in large language model security.</description>

      <title>Securing WiFi Fingerprint-based Indoor Localization Systems from Malicious Access Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi fingerprint-based indoor localization schemes deliver highly accurate location data by matching the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) with an offline database using machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) models. However, over time, RSSI values degrade due to the malicious behavior of access points (APs), causing low positional accuracy due to RSSI value mismatch with the offline database. Existing literature lacks detection of malicious APs in the online phase and mitigating their effects. This research addresses these limitations and proposes a long-term reliable indoor localization scheme by incorporating malicious AP detection and their effect mitigation techniques. The proposed scheme uses a Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LGBM) classifier to estimate locations and integrates simple yet efficient techniques to detect malicious APs based on online query data. Subsequently, a mitigation technique is incorporated that updates the offline database and online queries by imputing stable values for malicious APs using LGBM Regressors. Additionally, we introduce a noise addition mechanism in the offline database to capture the dynamic environmental effects. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the proposed scheme attains a detection accuracy above 95% for each attack type. The mitigation strategy effectively restores the system's performance nearly to its original state when no malicious AP is present. The noise addition module reduces localization errors by nearly 16%. Furthermore, the proposed solution is lightweight, reducing the execution time by approximately 94% compared to the existing methods.</description>

      <title>DMRL: Data- and Model-aware Reward Learning for Data Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are inherently vulnerable to unintended privacy breaches. Consequently, systematic red-teaming research is essential for developing robust defense mechanisms. However, current data extraction methods suffer from several limitations: (1) rely on dataset duplicates (addressable via deduplication), (2) depend on prompt engineering (now countered by detection and defense), and (3) rely on random-search adversarial generation. To address these challenges, we propose DMRL, a Data- and Model-aware Reward Learning approach for data extraction. This technique leverages inverse reinforcement learning to extract sensitive data from LLMs. Our method consists of two main components: (1) constructing an introspective reasoning dataset that captures leakage mindsets to guide model behavior, and (2) training reward models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning optimization based on task difficulty at both the data and model levels. Comprehensive experiments across various LLMs demonstrate that DMRL outperforms all baseline methods in data extraction performance.</description>

      <title>Remote Rowhammer Attack using Adversarial Observations on Federated Learning Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has the potential for simultaneous global learning amongst a large number of parallel agents, enabling emerging AI such as LLMs to be trained across demographically diverse data. Central to this being efficient is the ability for FL to perform sparse gradient updates and remote direct memory access at the central server. Most of the research in FL security focuses on protecting data privacy at the edge client or in the communication channels between the client and server. Client-facing attacks on the server are less well investigated as the assumption is that a large collective of clients offer resilience.
  Here, we show that by attacking certain clients that lead to a high frequency repetitive memory update in the server, we can remote initiate a rowhammer attack on the server memory. For the first time, we do not need backdoor access to the server, and a reinforcement learning (RL) attacker can learn how to maximize server repetitive memory updates by manipulating the client's sensor observation. The consequence of the remote rowhammer attack is that we are able to achieve bit flips, which can corrupt the server memory. We demonstrate the feasibility of our attack using a large-scale FL automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems with sparse updates, our adversarial attacking agent can achieve around 70\% repeated update rate (RUR) in the targeted server model, effectively inducing bit flips on server DRAM. The security implications are that can cause disruptions to learning or may inadvertently cause elevated privilege. This paves the way for further research on practical mitigation strategies in FL and hardware design.</description>

      <title>RiM: Record, Improve and Maintain Physical Well-being using Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In academic settings, the demanding environment often forces students to prioritize academic performance over their physical well-being. Moreover, privacy concerns and the inherent risk of data breaches hinder the deployment of traditional machine learning techniques for addressing these health challenges. In this study, we introduce RiM: Record, Improve, and Maintain, a mobile application which incorporates a novel personalized machine learning framework that leverages federated learning to enhance students' physical well-being by analyzing their lifestyle habits. Our approach involves pre-training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model on a large-scale simulated dataset to generate personalized recommendations. Subsequently, we employ federated learning to fine-tune the model using data from IISER Bhopal students, thereby ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios. The federated learning approach guarantees differential privacy by exclusively sharing model weights rather than raw data. Experimental results show that the FedAvg-based RiM model achieves an average accuracy of 60.71% and a mean absolute error of 0.91--outperforming the FedPer variant (average accuracy 46.34%, MAE 1.19)--thereby demonstrating its efficacy in predicting lifestyle deficits under privacy-preserving constraints.</description>

      <title>Sponge Attacks on Sensing AI: Energy-Latency Vulnerabilities and Defense via Model Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that sponge attacks can significantly increase the energy consumption and inference latency of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, prior work has focused primarily on computer vision and natural language processing tasks, overlooking the growing use of lightweight AI models in sensing-based applications on resource-constrained devices, such as those in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These attacks pose serious threats of energy depletion and latency degradation in systems where limited battery capacity and real-time responsiveness are critical for reliable operation. This paper makes two key contributions. First, we present the first systematic exploration of energy-latency sponge attacks targeting sensing-based AI models. Using wearable sensing-based AI as a case study, we demonstrate that sponge attacks can substantially degrade performance by increasing energy consumption, leading to faster battery drain, and by prolonging inference latency. Second, to mitigate such attacks, we investigate model pruning, a widely adopted compression technique for resource-constrained AI, as a potential defense. Our experiments show that pruning-induced sparsity significantly improves model resilience against sponge poisoning. We also quantify the trade-offs between model efficiency and attack resilience, offering insights into the security implications of model compression in sensing-based AI systems deployed in IoT environments.</description>

      <title>PRUNE: A Patching Based Repair Framework for Certiffable Unlearning of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often desirable to remove (a.k.a. unlearn) a speciffc part of the training data from a trained neural network model. A typical application scenario is to protect the data holder's right to be forgotten, which has been promoted by many recent regulation rules. Existing unlearning methods involve training alternative models with remaining data, which may be costly and challenging to verify from the data holder or a thirdparty auditor's perspective. In this work, we provide a new angle and propose a novel unlearning approach by imposing carefully crafted "patch" on the original neural network to achieve targeted "forgetting" of the requested data to delete. Speciffcally, inspired by the research line of neural network repair, we propose to strategically seek a lightweight minimum "patch" for unlearning a given data point with certiffable guarantee. Furthermore, to unlearn a considerable amount of data points (or an entire class), we propose to iteratively select a small subset of representative data points to unlearn, which achieves the effect of unlearning the whole set. Extensive experiments on multiple categorical datasets demonstrates our approach's effectiveness, achieving measurable unlearning while preserving the model's performance and being competitive in efffciency and memory consumption compared to various baseline methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first nearly optimal differentially private PAC learner for any concept class with VC dimension 1 and Littlestone dimension $d$. Our algorithm achieves the sample complexity of $\tilde{O}_{\varepsilon,\delta,\alpha,\delta}(\log^* d)$, nearly matching the lower bound of $\Omega(\log^* d)$ proved by Alon et al. [STOC19]. Prior to our work, the best known upper bound is $\tilde{O}(VC\cdot d^5)$ for general VC classes, as shown by Ghazi et al. [STOC21].</description>

      <title>Centralized Trust in Decentralized Systems: Unveiling Hidden Contradictions in Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain technology promises to democratize finance and promote social equity through decentralization, but questions remain about whether current implementations advance or hinder these goals. Through a mixed-methods study combining semi-structured interviews with 13 diverse blockchain stakeholders and analysis of over 3,000 cryptocurrency discussions on Reddit, we examine how trust manifests in cryptocurrency ecosystems despite their decentralized architecture. Our findings uncover that users actively seek out and create centralized trust anchors, such as established exchanges, prominent community figures, and recognized development teams, contradicting blockchain's fundamental promise of trustless interactions. We identify how this contradiction arises from users' mental need for accountability and their reluctance to shoulder the full responsibility of self-custody. The study also reveals how these centralized trust patterns disproportionately impact different user groups, with newer and less technical users showing stronger preferences for centralized intermediaries. This work contributes to our understanding of the inherent tensions between theoretical decentralization and practical implementation in cryptocurrency systems, highlighting the persistent role of centralized trust in supposedly trustless environments.</description>

      <title>Privacy-aware Berrut Approximated Coded Computing applied to general distributed learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coded computing is one of the techniques that can be used for privacy protection in Federated Learning. However, most of the constructions used for coded computing work only under the assumption that the computations involved are exact, generally restricted to special classes of functions, and require quantized inputs. This paper considers the use of Private Berrut Approximate Coded Computing (PBACC) as a general solution to add strong but non-perfect privacy to federated learning. We derive new adapted PBACC algorithms for centralized aggregation, secure distributed training with centralized data, and secure decentralized training with decentralized data, thus enlarging significantly the applications of the method and the existing privacy protection tools available for these paradigms. Particularly, PBACC can be used robustly to attain privacy guarantees in decentralized federated learning for a variety of models. Our numerical results show that the achievable quality of different learning models (convolutional neural networks, variational autoencoders, and Cox regression) is minimally altered by using these new computing schemes, and that the privacy leakage can be bounded strictly to less than a fraction of one bit per participant. Additionally, the computational cost of the encoding and decoding processes depends only of the degree of decentralization of the data.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Latency of Network Layer Security in 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to its predecessors, 5G supports a wide range of commercial, industrial, and critical infrastructure scenarios. One key feature of 5G, ultra-reliable low latency communication, is particularly appealing to such scenarios for its real-time capabilities. However, 5G's enhanced security, mostly realized through optional security controls, imposes additional overhead on the network performance, potentially hindering its real-time capabilities. To better assess this impact and guide operators in choosing between different options, we measure the latency overhead of IPsec when applied over the N3 and the service-based interfaces to protect user and control plane data, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluate whether WireGuard constitutes an alternative to reduce this overhead. Our findings show that IPsec, if configured correctly, has minimal latency impact and thus is a prime candidate to secure real-time critical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Apple's Synthetic Defocus Noise Pattern: Characterization and Forensic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: iPhone portrait-mode images contain a distinctive pattern in out-of-focus regions simulating the bokeh effect, which we term Apple's Synthetic Defocus Noise Pattern (SDNP). If overlooked, this pattern can interfere with blind forensic analyses, especially PRNU-based camera source verification, as noted in earlier works. Since Apple's SDNP remains underexplored, we provide a detailed characterization, proposing a method for its precise estimation, modeling its dependence on scene brightness, ISO settings, and other factors. Leveraging this characterization, we explore forensic applications of the SDNP, including traceability of portrait-mode images across iPhone models and iOS versions in open-set scenarios, assessing its robustness under post-processing. Furthermore, we show that masking SDNP-affected regions in PRNU-based camera source verification significantly reduces false positives, overcoming a critical limitation in camera attribution, and improving state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Automated Fuzzing of Automotive Control Units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.12345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern vehicles are governed by a network of Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are programmed to sense inputs from the driver and the environment, to process these inputs, and to control actuators that, e.g., regulate the engine or even control the steering system. ECUs within a vehicle communicate via automotive bus systems such as the Controller Area Network (CAN), and beyond the vehicles boundaries through upcoming vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure channels. Approaches to manipulate the communication between ECUs for the purpose of security testing and reverse-engineering of vehicular functions have been presented in the past, all of which struggle with automating the detection of system change in response to message injection. In this paper we present our findings with fuzzing CAN networks, in particular while observing individual ECUs with a sensor harness. The harness detects physical responses, which we then use in a oracle functions to inform the fuzzing process. We systematically define fuzzers, fuzzing configurations and oracle functions for testing ECUs. We evaluate our approach based on case studies of commercial instrument clusters and with an experimental framework for CAN authentication. Our results show that the approach is capable of identifying interesting ECU states with a high level of automation. Our approach is applicable in distributed cyber-physical systems beyond automotive computing.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic detection of GNSS spoofing using opportunistic information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are integrated into many devices. However, civilian GNSS signals are usually not cryptographically protected. This makes attacks that forge signals relatively easy. Considering modern devices often have network connections and onboard sensors, the proposed here Probabilistic Detection of GNSS Spoofing (PDS) scheme is based on such opportunistic information. PDS has at its core two parts. First, a regression problem with motion model constraints, which equalizes the noise of all locations considering the motion model of the device. Second, a Gaussian process, that analyzes statistical properties of location data to construct uncertainty. Then, a likelihood function, that fuses the two parts, as a basis for a Neyman-Pearson lemma (NPL)-based detection strategy. Our experimental evaluation shows a performance gain over the state-of-the-art, in terms of attack detection effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Detecting Misuse of Security APIs: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial for ensuring software security. However, their misuse introduces vulnerabilities, potentially leading to severe data breaches and substantial financial loss. Complex API design, inadequate documentation, and insufficient security training often lead to unintentional misuse by developers. The software security community has devised and evaluated several approaches to detecting security API misuse to help developers and organizations. This study rigorously reviews the literature on detecting misuse of security APIs to gain a comprehensive understanding of this critical domain. Our goal is to identify and analyze security API misuses, the detection approaches developed, and the evaluation methodologies employed along with the open research avenues to advance the state-of-the-art in this area. Employing the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, we analyzed 69 research papers. Our review has yielded (a) identification of 6 security API types; (b) classification of 30 distinct misuses; (c) categorization of detection techniques into heuristic-based and ML-based approaches; and (d) identification of 10 performance measures and 9 evaluation benchmarks. The review reveals a lack of coverage of detection approaches in several areas. We recommend that future efforts focus on aligning security API development with developers' needs and advancing standardized evaluation methods for detection technologies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Boundaries: A Comprehensive Survey of Transferable Attacks on AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly underpin critical applications, from autonomous vehicles to biometric authentication, their vulnerability to transferable attacks presents a growing concern. These attacks, designed to generalize across instances, domains, models, tasks, modalities, or even hardware platforms, pose severe risks to security, privacy, and system integrity. This survey delivers the first comprehensive review of transferable attacks across seven major categories, including evasion, backdoor, data poisoning, model stealing, model inversion, membership inference, and side-channel attacks. We introduce a unified six-dimensional taxonomy: cross-instance, cross-domain, cross-modality, cross-model, cross-task, and cross-hardware, which systematically captures the diverse transfer pathways of adversarial strategies. Through this framework, we examine both the underlying mechanics and practical implications of transferable attacks on AI systems. Furthermore, we review cutting-edge methods for enhancing attack transferability, organized around data augmentation and optimization strategies. By consolidating fragmented research and identifying critical future directions, this work provides a foundational roadmap for understanding, evaluating, and defending against transferable threats in real-world AI systems.</description>

      <title>FreStega: A Plug-and-Play Method for Boosting Imperceptibility and Capacity in Generative Linguistic Steganography for Real-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linguistic steganography embeds secret information in seemingly innocent texts, safeguarding privacy in surveillance environments. Generative linguistic steganography leverages the probability distribution of language models (LMs) and applies steganographic algorithms to generate stego tokens, gaining attention with recent Large Language Model (LLM) advancements. To enhance security, researchers develop distribution-preserving stego algorithms to minimize the gap between stego sampling and LM sampling. However, the reliance on language model distributions, coupled with deviations from real-world cover texts, results in insufficient imperceptibility when facing steganalysis detectors in real-world scenarios. Moreover, LLM distributions tend to be more deterministic, resulting in reduced entropy and, consequently, lower embedding capacity. In this paper, we propose FreStega, a plug-and-play method to reconstruct the distribution of language models used for generative linguistic steganography. FreStega dynamically adjusts token probabilities from the language model at each step of stegotext auto-regressive generation, leveraging both sequential and spatial dimensions. In sequential adjustment, the temperature is dynamically adjusted based on instantaneous entropy, enhancing the diversity of stego texts and boosting embedding capacity. In the spatial dimension, the distribution is aligned with guidance from the target domain corpus, closely mimicking real cover text in the target domain. By reforming the distribution, FreStega enhances the imperceptibility of stego text in practical scenarios and improves steganographic capacity by 15.41\%, all without compromising the quality of the generated text. FreStega serves as a plug-and-play remedy to enhance the imperceptibility and embedding capacity of existing distribution-preserving steganography methods in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) demands secure and efficient authentication to support high-speed, high-density and mobility-challenged environments. This paper presents a privacy-preserving authentication scheme that incorporates batch authentication, mutual authentication, and secure key establishment, enabling users to authenticate one another without a central authority. Our proposed scheme facilitates simultaneous multi-user authentication, significantly enhancing scalability, robustness and security in dynamic IoV networks. Results from realistic implementations show that our method achieves average authentication and verification times of 10.61 ms and 1.78 ms, respectively, for a fleet of 100 vehicles, outperforming existing methods. Scalability tests demonstrate efficient processing for larger groups of up to 500 vehicles, where average authentication times remain low, establishing our scheme as a robust solution for secure communication in IoV systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We surface a new threat to closed-weight Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables an attacker to compute optimization-based prompt injections. Specifically, we characterize how an attacker can leverage the loss-like information returned from the remote fine-tuning interface to guide the search for adversarial prompts. The fine-tuning interface is hosted by an LLM vendor and allows developers to fine-tune LLMs for their tasks, thus providing utility, but also exposes enough information for an attacker to compute adversarial prompts. Through an experimental analysis, we characterize the loss-like values returned by the Gemini fine-tuning API and demonstrate that they provide a useful signal for discrete optimization of adversarial prompts using a greedy search algorithm. Using the PurpleLlama prompt injection benchmark, we demonstrate attack success rates between 65% and 82% on Google's Gemini family of LLMs. These attacks exploit the classic utility-security tradeoff - the fine-tuning interface provides a useful feature for developers but also exposes the LLMs to powerful attacks.</description>

      <title>Security Steerability is All You Need</title>

Abstract: The adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) in various applications inevitably comes with expanding the attack surface, combining new security threats along with the traditional ones. Consequently, numerous research and industrial initiatives aim to mitigate these security threats in GenAI by developing metrics and designing defenses. However, while most of the GenAI security work focuses on universal threats (e.g. manipulating the LLM to generate forbidden content), there is significantly less discussion on application-level security and how to mitigate it. Thus, in this work we adopt an application-centric approach to GenAI security, and show that while LLMs cannot protect against ad-hoc application specific threats, they can provide the framework for applications to protect themselves against such threats. Our first contribution is defining Security Steerability - a novel security measure for LLMs, assessing the model's capability to adhere to strict guardrails that are defined in the system prompt ('Refrain from discussing about politics'). These guardrails, in case effective, can stop threats in the presence of malicious users who attempt to circumvent the application and cause harm to its providers. Our second contribution is a methodology to measure the security steerability of LLMs, utilizing two newly-developed datasets: VeganRibs assesses the LLM behavior in forcing specific guardrails that are not security per se in the presence of malicious user that uses attack boosters (jailbreaks and perturbations), and ReverseText takes this approach further and measures the LLM ability to force specific treatment of the user input as plain text while do user try to give it additional meanings...</description>

      <title>Optimizing Mouse Dynamics for User Authentication by Machine Learning: Addressing Data Sufficiency, Accuracy-Practicality Trade-off, and Model Performance Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User authentication is essential to ensure secure access to computer systems, yet traditional methods face limitations in usability, cost, and security. Mouse dynamics authentication, based on the analysis of users' natural interaction behaviors with mouse devices, offers a cost-effective, non-intrusive, and adaptable solution. However, challenges remain in determining the optimal data volume, balancing accuracy and practicality, and effectively capturing temporal behavioral patterns. In this study, we propose a statistical method using Gaussian kernel density estimate (KDE) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate the sufficient data volume for training authentication models. We introduce the Mouse Authentication Unit (MAU), leveraging Approximate Entropy (ApEn) to optimize segment length for efficient and accurate behavioral representation. Furthermore, we design the Local-Time Mouse Authentication (LT-AMouse) framework, integrating 1D-ResNet for local feature extraction and GRU for modeling long-term temporal dependencies. Taking the Balabit and DFL datasets as examples, we significantly reduced the data scale, particularly by a factor of 10 for the DFL dataset, greatly alleviating the training burden. Additionally, we determined the optimal input recognition unit length for the user authentication system on different datasets based on the slope of Approximate Entropy. Training with imbalanced samples, our model achieved a successful defense AUC 98.52% for blind attack on the DFL dataset and 94.65% on the Balabit dataset, surpassing the current sota performance.</description>

      <title>LLM-Text Watermarking based on Lagrange Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs (Large Language Models) has established them as a foundational technology for many AI and ML-powered human computer interactions. A critical challenge in this context is the attribution of LLM-generated text -- either to the specific language model that produced it or to the individual user who embedded their identity via a so-called multi-bit watermark. This capability is essential for combating misinformation, fake news, misinterpretation, and plagiarism. One of the key techniques for addressing this challenge is digital watermarking.
  This work presents a watermarking scheme for LLM-generated text based on Lagrange interpolation, enabling the recovery of a multi-bit author identity even when the text has been heavily redacted by an adversary. The core idea is to embed a continuous sequence of points $(x, f(x))$ that lie on a single straight line. The $x$-coordinates are computed pseudorandomly using a cryptographic hash function $H$ applied to the concatenation of the previous token's identity and a secret key $s_k$. Crucially, the $x$-coordinates do not need to be embedded into the text -- only the corresponding $f(x)$ values are embedded. During extraction, the algorithm recovers the original points along with many spurious ones, forming an instance of the Maximum Collinear Points (MCP) problem, which can be solved efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective, allowing the recovery of the author identity even when as few as three genuine points remain after adversarial manipulation.</description>

      <title>New protocols for quantum key distribution with explicit upper and lower bound on secret key rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two new schemes for quantum key distribution (QKD) that neither require entanglement nor an ideal single-photon source, making them implementable with commercially available single-photon sources. These protocols are shown to be secure against multiple attacks, including intercept-resend and a class of collective attacks. We derive bounds on the key rate and demonstrate that a specific type of classical pre-processing can increase the tolerable error limit. A trade-off between quantum resources and information revealed to an eavesdropper (Eve) is observed, with higher efficiency achievable through the use of additional quantum resources. Specifically, our proposed protocols outperform the SARG04 protocol in terms of efficiency at the cost of more quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Privacy of SGD under Gaussian or Heavy-Tailed Noise: Guarantees without Gradient Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The injection of heavy-tailed noise into the iterates of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has garnered growing interest in recent years due to its theoretical and empirical benefits for optimization and generalization. However, its implications for privacy preservation remain largely unexplored. Aiming to bridge this gap, we provide differential privacy (DP) guarantees for noisy SGD, when the injected noise follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution, which includes a spectrum of heavy-tailed distributions (with infinite variance) as well as the light-tailed Gaussian distribution. Considering the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP framework, we show that SGD with heavy-tailed perturbations achieves $(0, O(1/n))$-DP for a broad class of loss functions which can be non-convex, where $n$ is the number of data points. As a remarkable byproduct, contrary to prior work that necessitates bounded sensitivity for the gradients or clipping the iterates, our theory can handle unbounded gradients without clipping, and reveals that under mild assumptions, such a projection step is not actually necessary. Our results suggest that, given other benefits of heavy-tails in optimization, heavy-tailed noising schemes can be a viable alternative to their light-tailed counterparts.</description>

      <title>AttackBench: Evaluating Gradient-based Attacks for Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial examples are typically optimized with gradient-based attacks. While novel attacks are continuously proposed, each is shown to outperform its predecessors using different experimental setups, hyperparameter settings, and number of forward and backward calls to the target models. This provides overly-optimistic and even biased evaluations that may unfairly favor one particular attack over the others. In this work, we aim to overcome these limitations by proposing AttackBench, i.e., the first evaluation framework that enables a fair comparison among different attacks. To this end, we first propose a categorization of gradient-based attacks, identifying their main components and differences. We then introduce our framework, which evaluates their effectiveness and efficiency. We measure these characteristics by (i) defining an optimality metric that quantifies how close an attack is to the optimal solution, and (ii) limiting the number of forward and backward queries to the model, such that all attacks are compared within a given maximum query budget. Our extensive experimental analysis compares more than $100$ attack implementations with a total of over $800$ different configurations against CIFAR-10 and ImageNet models, highlighting that only very few attacks outperform all the competing approaches. Within this analysis, we shed light on several implementation issues that prevent many attacks from finding better solutions or running at all. We release AttackBench as a publicly-available benchmark, aiming to continuously update it to include and evaluate novel gradient-based attacks for optimizing adversarial examples.</description>

      <title>Scaling up the Banded Matrix Factorization Mechanism for Differentially Private ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated noise mechanisms such as DP Matrix Factorization (DP-MF) have proven to be effective alternatives to DP-SGD in large-epsilon few-epoch training regimes. Significant work has been done to find the best correlated noise strategies, and the current state-of-the-art approach is DP-BandMF, which optimally balances the benefits of privacy amplification and noise correlation. Despite it's utility advantages, severe scalability limitations prevent this mechanism from handling large-scale training scenarios where the number of training iterations may exceed $10^4$ and the number of model parameters may exceed $10^7$. In this work, we present techniques to scale up DP-BandMF along these two dimensions, significantly extending it's reach and enabling it to handle settings with virtually any number of model parameters and training iterations, with negligible utility degradation.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Bilevel Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present differentially private (DP) algorithms for bilevel optimization, a problem class that received significant attention lately in various machine learning applications. These are the first algorithms for such problems under standard DP constraints, and are also the first to avoid Hessian computations which are prohibitive in large-scale settings. Under the well-studied setting in which the upper-level is not necessarily convex and the lower-level problem is strongly-convex, our proposed gradient-based $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithm returns a point with hypergradient norm at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left((\sqrt{d_\mathrm{up}}/\epsilon n)^{1/2}+(\sqrt{d_\mathrm{low}}/\epsilon n)^{1/3}\right)$ where $n$ is the dataset size, and $d_\mathrm{up}/d_\mathrm{low}$ are the upper/lower level dimensions. Our analysis covers constrained and unconstrained problems alike, accounts for mini-batch gradients, and applies to both empirical and population losses. As an application, we specialize our analysis to derive a simple private rule for tuning a regularization hyperparameter.</description>

      <title>D-CIPHER: Dynamic Collaborative Intelligent Multi-Agent System with Planner and Heterogeneous Executors for Offensive Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used in cybersecurity such as autonomous security analysis or penetration testing. Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges serve as benchmarks to assess automated task-planning abilities of LLM agents for cybersecurity. Early attempts to apply LLMs for solving CTF challenges used single-agent systems, where feedback was restricted to a single reasoning-action loop. This approach was inadequate for complex CTF tasks. Inspired by real-world CTF competitions, where teams of experts collaborate, we introduce the D-CIPHER LLM multi-agent framework for collaborative CTF solving. D-CIPHER integrates agents with distinct roles with dynamic feedback loops to enhance reasoning on complex tasks. It introduces the Planner-Executor agent system, consisting of a Planner agent for overall problem-solving along with multiple heterogeneous Executor agents for individual tasks, facilitating efficient allocation of responsibilities among the agents. Additionally, D-CIPHER incorporates an Auto-prompter agent to improve problem-solving by auto-generating a highly relevant initial prompt. We evaluate D-CIPHER on multiple CTF benchmarks and LLM models via comprehensive studies to highlight the impact of our enhancements. Additionally, we manually map the CTFs in NYU CTF Bench to MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques that apply for a comprehensive evaluation of D-CIPHER's offensive security capability. D-CIPHER achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks: 22.0% on NYU CTF Bench, 22.5% on Cybench, and 44.0% on HackTheBox, which is 2.5% to 8.5% better than previous work. D-CIPHER solves 65% more ATT&amp;CK techniques compared to previous work, demonstrating stronger offensive capability.</description>

      <title>Revealing Weaknesses in Text Watermarking Through Self-Information Rewrite Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text watermarking aims to subtly embed statistical signals into text by controlling the Large Language Model (LLM)'s sampling process, enabling watermark detectors to verify that the output was generated by the specified model. The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA), which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more robust watermarking.</description>
