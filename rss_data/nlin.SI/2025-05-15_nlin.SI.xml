      <title>On differential equations invariant under a projective transformation group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a projective transformation and establish the invariants for this transformation group up to order seven. We use the obtained invariants to construct a class of nonlinear evolution equations and identify some symmetry-integrable equations in this class. Notably, the only symmetry-integrable evolution equation of order three in this class is a fully-nonlinear equation for which we find the recursion operator and its connection to the Schwarzian KdV. We furthermore establish that higher-order symmetry-integrable equations in this class belong to the hierarchy of the fully-nonlinear 3rd-order equation and prove this for the 5th-order case. We also identify the ordinary differential equations that are invariant under this projective transformation and reduce the order of these equations.</description>

      <title>Connection Between the Exact Moving Solutions of the Negative Korteweg-de Vries (nKdV) Equation and the Negative Modified Korteweg-de Vries (nmKdV) Equation and the Static Solutions of 1+1 Dimensional $\phi^4$ Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negative order KdV (nKdV) and the modified KdV (nmKdV) equations have two different formulations based on different hierarchy operators. Both equations can be written in terms of a nonlinear differential equation for a field $u(x,t)$ which we call the ``Lou form" of the equation. We find that for moving solutions of the nKdV equation and the nmKdV equation written in the ``Lou form" with $u(x,t) \rightarrow u (x-ct)= u(\xi) $, the equation for $u(\xi)$ can be mapped to the equation for the static solutions of the 1+1 dimensional $\phi^4$ field theory. Using this mapping we obtain a large number of solutions of the nKdV and the nmKdV equation, most of which are new. We also show that the nKdV equation can be derived from an Action Principle for both of its formulations. Furthermore, for both forms of the nmKdV equations as well as for both focusing and defocusing cases, we show that with a suitable ansatz one can decouple the $x$ and $t$ dependence of the nmKdV field $u(x,t)$ and obtain novel solutions in all the cases. We also obtain novel rational solutions of both the nKdV and the nmKdV equations.</description>

      <title>Classical integrable spin chains of Landau-Lifshitz type from R-matrix identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a family of 1+1 classical integrable space-discrete models of the Landau-Lifshitz type through the usage of ansatz for $U$-$V$ (Lax) pair with spectral parameter satisfying the semi-discrete Zakharov-Shabat equation. The ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair is based on $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation and certain additional properties. Equations of motion are obtained using a set of $R$-matrix identities. In the continuous limit we reproduce the previously known family of the higher rank Landau-Lifshitz equations.</description>
