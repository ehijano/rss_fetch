      <title>Patient-specific Biomolecular Instruction Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteomics data is essential to pathogenic understanding of a disease phenotype. In cancer, analysis of molecular signatures enables precision medicine through the identification of biological processes that drive individualized tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical heterogeneity. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capacity to integrate and reason across heterogeneous data modalities. However, performing multi-modal language modeling for molecular understanding of patient-specific proteomics remains a significant challenge due to two barriers: (1) the lack of instruction-tuning datasets that enable clinical interpretation from proteomics data, and (2) the absence of language modeling architectures designed to capture the rich heterogeneity of molecular data. In this work, we introduce CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning dataset for molecular understanding of oncology, comprising over 400k open-ended examples derived from individualized proteomic profiles curated from the largest national proteomics cancer study (CPTAC). Additionally, we propose KRONOS (Knowledge Representation of patient Omics Networks in Oncology via Structured tuning), a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph representations for enhanced clinical reasoning. We show that KRONOS achieves competitive performance across benchmark clinical tasks, including molecular classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from proteomics data. Ultimately, this approach empowers LLMs to understand patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Clinic: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Augmenting EHR with Wearable Data for Diverse Health Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a powerful basis for predicting the onset of health outcomes. Yet EHRs primarily capture in-clinic events and miss aspects of daily behavior and lifestyle containing rich health information. Consumer wearables, by contrast, continuously measure activity, heart rate, and sleep, and more, offering complementary signals that can fill this gap. Despite this potential, there has been little systematic evaluation of the benefit that wearable data can bring to health outcome prediction on top of EHRs. In this study, we present an extensible framework for multimodal health outcome prediction that integrates EHR and wearable data streams. Using data from the All of Us Program, we systematically compared the combination of different encoding methods on EHR and wearable data, including the traditional feature engineering approach, as well as foundation model embeddings. Across ten clinical outcomes, wearable integration consistently improved model performance relative to EHR-only baselines, e.g., average delta AUROC +5.8% for major depressive disorder, +10.7% for hypertension, and +12.2% for diabetes. On average across all ten outcomes, fusing EHRs with wearable features shows 8.9% improvement in AUROC. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale evaluation of wearable-EHR fusion, underscoring the utility of wearable-derived signals in complementing EHRs and enabling more holistic, personalized health outcome predictions. Meanwhile, our analysis elucidates future directions for optimizing foundation models for wearable data and its integration with EHR data.</description>

      <title>Twin Peaks: Dual-Head Architecture for Structure-Free Prediction of Protein-Protein Binding Affinity and Mutation Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel dual-head deep learning architecture for protein-protein interaction modeling that enables simultaneous prediction of binding affinity ($\Delta G$) and mutation-induced affinity changes ($\Delta\Delta G$) using only protein sequence information. Our approach offers a significant advancement over existing methods by employing specialized prediction heads that operate on a shared representation network, allowing direct and optimized prediction of both values. To ensure robust generalization, we integrated complementary datasets from SKEMPI v2 and PDBbind with a rigorous protein domain-based splitting strategy that prevents information leakage between training and validation sets. Our architecture combines transformer-based encoders with a novel cross-attention mechanism that processes paired protein sequences directly, without requiring any structural information. The network embeds input sequences using ESM3 representations, then employs a learnable sliced window embedding layer to manage variable-length sequences efficiently. A multi-layer transformer encoder with bidirectional self-attention captures intra-protein patterns, while cross-attention layers enable explicit modeling of interactions between protein pairs. This shared representation network feeds into separate $\Delta G$ and $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction heads, allowing task-specific optimization while leveraging common features. The model achieves $\Delta\Delta G$ validation of Pearson correlation at 0.485, while maintaining strong $\Delta G$ predictions (Pearson: 0.638). While existing approaches require protein structure data and binding interface information, our model eliminates these constraints. This provides a critical advantage for the numerous proteins with unknown structures or those challenging to crystallize, such as viral and intrinsically disordered proteins.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Bacterial Microcompartment Permeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\textit{Salmonella}$ expresses bacterial microcompartments (MCPs) upon 1,2-propanediol exposure. MCPs are nanoscale protein-bound shells that encase enzymes for the cofactor-dependent 1,2-propanediol metabolism. They are hypothesized to limit exposure to the toxic intermediate, propionaldehyde, decrease cofactor involvement in competing reactions, and enhance flux. We construct a mass-action mathematical model of purified MCPs and calibrate parameters to measured metabolite concentrations. We constrain mass-action kinetic parameters to previously estimated Michaelis-Menten parameters. We identified two distinct fits with different dynamics in the pathway product, propionate, but similar goodness of fit. Across fits, we inferred that the MCP 1,2-propanediol and propionaldehyde permeability should be greater than $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-8}$ m/s, respectively. Our results identify parameter ranges consistent with prevailing theories that MCPs impose preferential diffusion to 1,2-propanediol over propionaldehyde, and sequester toxic propionaldehyde away from the cell cytosol. The bimodality of the posterior distribution arises from bimodality in the estimated coenzyme-A (CoA) permeability and inhibition rates. The MCP permeability to CoA was inferred to be either less than $10^{-8.8}$ m/s or greater than $10^{-7.3}$ m/s. In a high CoA permeability environment with low rates of CoA inhibition, enzymes produced metabolites by recycling (NAD+)/(NADH). In a low CoA permeability environment with high rates of CoA inhibition, enzymes required external NAD+/H to produce metabolites. Dynamics are consistent with prevailing hypotheses about MCP function to sequester toxic propionaldehyde, and additional collection of data points between 6 and 24 hours or characterization of enzyme inhibition rates could further reduce uncertainty and provide better permeability estimates.</description>

      <title>13CFLUX - Third-generation high-performance engine for isotopically (non)stationary 13C metabolic flux analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 13C-based metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) is a cornerstone of quantitative systems biology, yet its increasing data complexity and methodological diversity place high demands on simulation software. We introduce 13CFLUX(v3), a third-generation simulation platform that combines a high-performance C++ engine with a convenient Python interface. The software delivers substantial performance gains across isotopically stationary and nonstationary analysis workflows, while remaining flexible to accommodate diverse labeling strategies and analytical platforms. Its open-source availability facilitates seamless integration into computational ecosystems and community-driven extension. By supporting multi-experiment integration, multi-tracer studies, and advanced statistical inference such as Bayesian analysis, 13CFLUX provides a robust and extensible framework for modern fluxomics research.</description>

      <title>LAMP-PRo: Label-aware Attention for Multi-label Prediction of DNA- and RNA-binding Proteins using Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying DNA- (DBPs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is crucial for the understanding of cell function, molecular interactions as well as regulatory functions. Owing to their high similarity, most of the existing approaches face challenges in differentiating between DBPs and RBPs leading to high cross-prediction errors. Moreover, identifying proteins which bind to both DNA and RNA (DRBPs) is also quite a challenging task. In this regard, we propose a novel framework viz. LAMP-PRo which is based on pre-trained protein language model (PLM), attention mechanisms and multi-label learning to mitigate these issues. First, pre-trained PLM such ESM-2 is used for embedding the protein sequences followed by convolutional neural network (CNN). Subsequently multi-head self-attention mechanism is applied for the contextual information while label-aware attention is used to compute class-specific representations by attending to the sequence in a way that is tailored to each label (DBP, RBP and non-NABP) in a multi-label setup. We have also included a novel cross-label attention mechanism to explicitly capture dependencies between DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, enabling more accurate prediction of DRBP. Finally, a linear layer followed by a sigmoid function are used for the final prediction. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare LAMP-PRo with the existing methods wherein the proposed model shows consistent competent performance. Furthermore, we also provide visualization to showcase model interpretability, highlighting which parts of the sequence are most relevant for a predicted label. The original datasets are available at http://bliulab.net/iDRBP\_MMC and the codes are available at https://github.com/NimishaGhosh/LAMP-PRo.</description>

      <title>De novo peptide sequencing rescoring and FDR estimation with Winnow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has markedly advanced de novo peptide sequencing (DNS) for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. DNS tools offer a reliable way to identify peptides without relying on reference databases, extending proteomic analysis and unlocking applications into less-charted regions of the proteome. However, they still face a key limitation. DNS tools lack principled methods for estimating false discovery rates (FDR) and instead rely on model-specific confidence scores that are often miscalibrated. This limits trust in results, hinders cross-model comparisons and reduces validation success. Here we present Winnow, a model-agnostic framework for estimating FDR from calibrated DNS outputs. Winnow maps raw model scores to calibrated confidences using a neural network trained on peptide-spectrum match (PSM)-derived features. From these calibrated scores, Winnow computes PSM-specific error metrics and an experiment-wide FDR estimate using a novel decoy-free FDR estimator. It supports both zero-shot and dataset-specific calibration, enabling flexible application via direct inference, fine-tuning, or training a custom model. We demonstrate that, when applied to InstaNovo predictions, Winnow's calibrator improves recall at fixed FDR thresholds, and its FDR estimator tracks true error rates when benchmarked against reference proteomes and database search. Winnow ensures accurate FDR control across datasets, helping unlock the full potential of DNS.</description>

      <title>Identifying Memory Effects in Epidemics via a Fractional SEIRD Model and Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for parameter estimation in fractional-order SEIRD epidemic models. By embedding the Caputo fractional derivative into the network residuals via the L1 discretization scheme, our method simultaneously reconstructs epidemic trajectories and infers both epidemiological parameters and the fractional memory order $\alpha$. The fractional formulation extends classical integer-order models by capturing long-range memory effects in disease progression, incubation, and recovery. Our framework learns the fractional memory order $\alpha$ as a trainable parameter while simultaneously estimating the epidemiological rates $(\beta, \sigma, \gamma, \mu)$. A composite loss combining data misfit, physics residuals, and initial conditions, with constraints on positivity and population conservation, ensures both accuracy and biological consistency. Tests on synthetic Mpox data confirm reliable recovery of $\alpha$ and parameters under noise, while applications to COVID-19 show that optimal $\alpha \in (0, 1]$ captures memory effects and improves predictive performance over the classical SEIRD model. This work establishes PINNs as a robust tool for learning memory effects in epidemic dynamics, with implications for forecasting, control strategies, and the analysis of non-Markovian epidemic processes.</description>

      <title>Fusing Sequence Motifs and Pan-Genomic Features: Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction using an Explainable Lightweight 1D CNN-XGBoost Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis. While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes, current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data. This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of 809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.</description>

      <title>Efficient Identification of High Similarity Clusters in Polygon Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding, supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.</description>

      <title>TeraAgent: A Distributed Agent-Based Simulation Engine for Simulating Half a Trillion Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based simulation is an indispensable paradigm for studying complex systems. These systems can comprise billions of agents, requiring the computing resources of multiple servers to simulate. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art platform, BioDynaMo, does not scale out across servers due to its shared-memory-based implementation.
  To overcome this key limitation, we introduce TeraAgent, a distributed agent-based simulation engine. A critical challenge in distributed execution is the exchange of agent information across servers, which we identify as a major performance bottleneck. We propose two solutions: 1) a tailored serialization mechanism that allows agents to be accessed and mutated directly from the receive buffer, and 2) leveraging the iterative nature of agent-based simulations to reduce data transfer with delta encoding.
  Built on our solutions, TeraAgent enables extreme-scale simulations with half a trillion agents (an 84x improvement), reduces time-to-result with additional compute nodes, improves interoperability with third-party tools, and provides users with more hardware flexibility.</description>

      <title>Is Sequence Information All You Need for Bayesian Optimization of Antibodies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However, finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods, raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for antibodies.</description>

      <title>FusionDTI: Fine-grained Binding Discovery with Token-level Fusion for Drug-Target Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.</description>

      <title>A Sensitivity Analysis Methodology for Rule-Based Stochastic Chemical Systems</title>

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a sensitivity analysis methodology for stochastic systems in chemistry, where dynamics are often governed by random processes. Our approach is based on gradient estimation via finite differences, averaging simulation outcomes, and analyzing variability under intrinsic noise. We characterize gradient uncertainty as an angular range within which all plausible gradient directions are expected to lie. This uncertainty measure adaptively guides the number of simulations performed for each nominal-perturbation pair of points in order to minimize unnecessary computations while maintaining robustness.
  Systematically exploring a range of parameter values across the parameter space, rather than focusing on a single value, allows us to identify not only sensitive parameters but also regions of parameter space associated with different levels of sensitivity. These results are visualized through vector field plots to offer an intuitive representation of local sensitivity across parameter space. Additionally, global sensitivity coefficients are computed to capture overall trends.
  Flexibility regarding the choice of output observable measures is another key feature of our method: while traditional sensitivity analyses often focus on species concentrations, our framework allows for the definition of a large range of problem-specific observables. This makes it broadly applicable in diverse chemical and biochemical scenarios. We demonstrate our approach on two systems: classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a rule-based model of the formose reaction, using the cheminformatics software M{\O}D for Gillespie-based stochastic simulations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Tool to Analyse Spectroscopic Changes in High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06466v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</description>

      <title>A Graph-in-Graph Learning Framework for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is pivotal for advancing drug discovery and target validation techniques. While machine learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph, enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics, highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and interaction data.</description>

      <title>SimpleFold: Folding Proteins is Simpler than You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks, SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware. SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future progress.</description>
