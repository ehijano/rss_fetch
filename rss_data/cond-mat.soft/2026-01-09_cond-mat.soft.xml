      <title>Mesoscale flows in active baths dictate the dynamics of semi-flexible filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-flexible filaments in living systems are constantly driven by active forces that often organize into mesoscale coherent flows. Although theory and simulations predict rich filament dynamics, experimental studies of passive filaments in collective active baths remain scarce. Here we present an experimental study on passive colloidal filaments confined to the air-liquid interface beneath a free-standing, quasi-two-dimensional bacterial film featuring jet-like mesoscale flows. By varying filament contour length and bacterial activity, we demonstrate that filament dynamics are governed by its length relative to the characteristic size of the bath. Filaments shorter than the jet width exhibit greatly enhanced translation and rotation with minimal deformation, while long filaments show dramatic deformation but less enhanced transport. We explain our findings through the competition between the active viscous drag of the bath and passive elastic resistance of the filaments, using a modified elastoviscous number that considers the mesoscale flows.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dynamical Heterogeneity in Active Glasses as a Signature of Violation of Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) systems have attracted renewed interest within the scientific community due to their anomalous dynamical behaviors, which arise from long-wavelength density fluctuations as predicted by the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg (MWH) theorem. In equilibrium, it is well established that continuous spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in 2D is prohibited at any finite temperature ($T &gt; 0$), resulting in the absence of true long-range positional order and establishing $d_l = 2$ as the lower critical dimension. Recent studies have demonstrated that, in active systems, the lower critical dimension can shift from $d_l = 2$ to $3$. This study examines the impact of MWH theorem violation in active systems on dynamical heterogeneity (DH). As a minimal model, glassy systems of active particles undergoing run-and-tumble (RT) motion are considered. Glass-like dynamical behavior, including anomalously enhanced DH, is observed in various biological systems such as collective cell migration, bacterial cytoplasm, and ant colonies. Furthermore, the study investigates the influence of local positional order, or medium-range crystalline order (MRCO), on DH in the presence of activity. The results indicate that the growth of DH with increasing activity differs significantly between systems with and without MRCO. These findings may have important implications, as many biological systems exhibit local structural ordering, and DH could serve as a useful indicator for quantifying the degree of ordering.</description>

      <title>Power-law molecular-weight distributions dictate universal behaviors in highly polydisperse polymer solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polydispersity is a universal feature of synthetic polymers and biological molecules in the cytoplasm. However, its quantitative impact on collective behavior remains poorly understood because conventional metrics, such as the polydispersity index, fail to capture broad, non-Gaussian size distributions. Here, we develop an experimental platform in which polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions are engineered to follow tunable power-law molecular-weight distributions spanning an extensive range, from $M = 1$ kg/mol to $10^{4}$ kg/mol. By systematically varying the $M$ distribution exponent $a$, we identify a robust regime ($1 &lt; a \lesssim 2.5$) in which the viscosity scaling exponent in the entangled regime, the overlap concentration $c^{\ast}$, and the entanglement concentration ${c_{\mathrm{e}}}$ all exhibit pronounced maxima that exceed monodisperse limits. This amplification minimizes as the upper cutoff $M_{\max}$ is reduced, with the system approaching monodisperse behavior. The enhanced rheology arises from a competition between long-chain-dominated entanglement and short-chain-mediated void filling, demonstrating that the whole shape of the molecular-weight distribution plays a decisive role. Consequently, these collective behaviors cannot be reproduced by simply tuning the average molecular weight. Together, our results establish the power-law exponent $a$ as a quantitative control parameter that links polymer entanglement, soft packing, and molecular crowding in highly polydisperse systems.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Structure and Elasticity in Colloidal Gels Under Isotropic Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the controlled drying of millimeter-sized gel beads to investigate isotropic compression of colloidal fractal gels. Using a custom dynamic light scattering setup, we demonstrate that stresses imposed by drying on the bead surface propagate homogeneously throughout the gel volume, inducing plastic rearrangements. We find that the Young modulus and yield stress of the gels increase monotonically with the instantaneous colloid volume fraction, $\phi$, exhibiting a mechanical response that depends solely on $\phi$, regardless of the drying history. In striking contrast, small-angle X-ray scattering reveals that the gel microstructure retains a strong memory of its initial state, depending on both $\varphi$ and the entire compression pathway. Our findings challenge the prevailing paradigm of a one-to-one relationship between microstructure and elasticity in colloidal fractal gels, opening new avenues for independent control over the structural and mechanical properties of soft materials.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Spatiotemporal Damage Evolution in Double Polymer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double polymer networks exhibit a striking enhancement of toughness compared to single networks, yet the microscopic mechanisms governing stress redistribution, damage evolution, and fracture remain incompletely understood. Using large-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations under uniaxial deformation, we resolve bond scission statistics, local stress redistribution following individual bond-breaking events, and the spatiotemporal evolution of damage in single- and double-network architectures. We show that while the early mechanical response is dominated by the pre-stretched sacrificial network, damage evolution in double networks follows a qualitatively distinct pathway. In contrast to single networks, where anisotropic stress redistribution promotes rapid localization and catastrophic fracture, the presence of a soft matrix in double networks induces a screening of stress redistribution generated by sacrificial bond scission. This screening suppresses correlated rupture events and stabilizes multiple damage zones, leading to a strongly delocalized damage landscape over a broad deformation range. At larger strains, when the matrix becomes load-bearing, damage progressively localizes, ultimately triggering fracture. By isolating the dynamics of individual damage zones, we further demonstrate that matrix-mediated stress screening stabilizes defects and delays localization. Together, these results identify stress-screening-induced damage delocalization as a central microscopic mechanism underlying toughness enhancement in multiple-network elastomers.</description>

      <title>Determining fluid-crystal phase boundaries for a binary hard-sphere mixture using direct-coexistence simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining fluid-crystal phase boundaries via direct-coexistence methods can be challenging due to the fact that the simulation box can introduce crystal strain. Recently, a direct-coexistence approach was developed which allows one to easily identify the equilibrium strain-free fluid-crystal coexistence in monodisperse systems. Here, we show that this approach can be readily extended to binary mixtures forming stoichiometric binary crystals, allowing accurate and efficient determination of the phase boundaries. Moreover, we examine how the choice of crystal plane in contact with the fluid affects the accuracy of the phase boundary determination. The method is easy to implement and does not require prior knowledge of the binary fluid's equation of state. These results further establish the method as a robust and practical tool for accurately determining fluid-crystal phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Exploring structure-property relationship on a nanoscale for tailoring films of amphiphilic polymer co-networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amphiphilic polymer co-networks (APCNs) provide a large toolbox for tuning coatings important for applications such as bio-interfaces. Therefore, we investigate the influence of network composition and environmental conditions on the structure and mechanical and adhesive properties of thin films composed of hydrophobic tetra-PCL and hydrophilic tetra-PEG stars of varying sizes. State-of-the-art atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques, including phase imaging, fast quantitative static indentation and dynamic indentation, provide insights into the structure-property-relationship on various length scales. PEG-rich networks exhibit amorphous morphologies with spherical nanodomains and elastic moduli of a few MPa, while PCL-rich networks form semicrystalline cylindrical arrangements with moduli up to several hundred MPa in water. Temperature-dependent measurements in water revealed a strong hysteresis of elastic moduli while shifting the melting/crystallization transitions or preventing crystallization in PEG-rich networks. All networks displayed predominantly elastic behavior. Co-networks in non-selective solvent conditions are overall softer, less adhesive and structurally more homogeneous. These results establish a predictable correlation of network composition, physical and chemical environment, structure and properties, which makes them suitable for a rational design of amphiphilic systems for various applications.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic interactions in a binary-mixture colloidal monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A colloidal monolayer embedded in the bulk of a fluid experiences a "compressible", long-range hydrodynamic interaction which, far from boundaries, leads to a breakdown of Fick's law above a well defined length scale, showing up as anomalous collective diffusion. We here extend the model to study the effect of the hydrodynamic interaction on a monolayer formed by two types of particles. The most interesting finding is a new regime, in the limit of very dissimilar kinds of particles, where the effective dynamics of the concentration of "big" (slow) particles appears to obey Fick's law at large scales, but the corresponding collective diffusivity is completely determined, through hydrodynamic coupling, by the diffusivity of the "small" (fast) particles.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of axis formation in $\textit{Hydra}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of a body axis is a fundamental step in the development of multicellular organisms. In simple systems such as $\textit{Hydra}$, growing evidence suggests that mechanical forces generated by collective cellular activity play a central role in this process. Here, we explore a physical mechanism for axis formation based on the coupling between active stresses and tissue elasticity. We analyse the elastic deformation induced by activity-generated stresses and show that, owing to the spherical topology of the tissue, forces globally condense toward configurations in which both elastic strain and nematic defect localise at opposite poles. These mechanically selected states define either a polar or apolar head-food axis. To characterize the condensed regime, we introduce a compact parametrization of of the active force and flux distributions, enabling analytical predictions and direct comparison with experiments. Using this framework, we calculate experimentally relevant observables, including areal strain, lateral pressure, and normal displacements during muscular contraction, as well as the detailed structure of topological defect complexes in head and foot regions. Together, our results identify a mechanical route by which active tissues can spontaneously break symmetry at the organismal scale, suggesting a general physical principle underlying body-axis specification during morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Local Multimodal Dynamics in Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductors and Their Fingerprints in Organic Electrochemical Transistor Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed ionic-electronic conductors host tightly coupled interactions among mobile ions, electronic charges, and the polymer matrix, giving rise to complex multimodal responses spanning electrical, mechanical, and morphological transformations. These materials underpin organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which translate such interactions into low-voltage signal amplification and sensing for applications in bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and memory. Despite their central role, OECT current-voltage transfer characteristics are often treated phenomenologically, as both the local multimodal dynamics and their connection to global device response remain unresolved. Here, we reveal that the transfer curve encodes a cascade of spatially localized electrochemical transitions, each associated with distinct changes in conductivity, stiffness, and morphology, fundamentally redefining it as a spatially resolved fingerprint of device's internal state. Using automated operando multimodal in-liquid scanning dielectric microscopy, we directly map these dynamics and identify region-specific electrochemical thresholds governing the interplay between source, channel, and drain. We found that the local tip-sample electrostatic force serves as a remarkable mechanistic observable of coupled multimodal dynamics in mixed conductors. A physically grounded model links it to general material, interfacial, and geometric parameters, enabling mechanistic interpretation and predictive insights. Our work provides a new framework for probing and understanding mixed conduction in ion-electron coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-response relation for a nonequilibrium system with resolved Markovian embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation-response relations must be modified to describe nonequilibrium systems with non-Markovian dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that such relation is quantitatively recovered when the appropriate Markovian embedding of the dynamics is explicitly resolved. Using a colloidal particle optically trapped in a harmonic potential and driven out of equilibrium by a controlled colored noise, we study the response to a perturbation of the stiffness of the confining potential. While the reduced dynamics violates equilibrium fluctuation-response relations, we show that the dynamical response to the stiffness perturbation is fully determined by steady-state correlations involving the exact conjugate observable in the Markovian embedding.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Long Wavelength Mermin-Wagner Fluctuations in Active Crystals and Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensions (2D), the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg (MWH) fluctuation plays a significant role, giving rise to striking dimensionality effects marked by long-range density fluctuations leading to the singularities of various dynamical properties. According to the MWH theorem, a 2D equilibrium system with continuous degrees of freedom cannot achieve long-range crystalline order at non-zero temperatures. Recently, MWH fluctuations have been observed in glass-forming liquids, evidenced by the logarithmic divergence in the plateau value of mean squared displacement (MSD). Our research investigates long-wavelength fluctuations in crystalline and glassy systems influenced by non-equilibrium active noises. Active systems serve as a minimal model for understanding diverse non-equilibrium dynamics, such as those in biological systems and self-propelled colloids. We demonstrate that fluctuations from active forces can strongly couple with long-wavelength density fluctuations, altering the lower critical dimension ($d_l$) from $2$ to $3$ and leading to a novel logarithmic divergence of the MSD plateau with system size in 3D.</description>

      <title>Machine learning short-ranged many-body interactions in colloidal systems using descriptors based on Voronoi cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) strategies are opening the door to faster computer simulations, allowing us to simulate more realistic colloidal systems. Since the interactions in colloidal systems are often highly many-body, stemming from e.g. depletion and steric interactions, one of the challenges for these algorithms is capturing the many-body nature of these interactions. In this paper, we introduce a new ML-based strategy for fitting many-body interactions in colloidal systems where the many-body interaction is highly local. To this end, we develop Voronoi-based descriptors for capturing the local environment and fit the effective potential using a simple neural network. To test this algorithm, we consider a simple two-dimensional model for a colloid-polymer mixture, where the colloid-colloid interactions and colloid-polymer interactions are hard-disk like, while the polymers themselves interact as ideal gas particles. We find that a Voronoi-based description is sufficient to accurately capture the many-body nature of this system. Moreover, we find that the Pearson correlation function alone is insufficient to determine the predictive power of the network emphasizing the importance of additional metrics when assessing the quality of ML-based potentials.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the cage state of glassy systems and its sensitivity to frozen boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the role that structure plays in the dynamical arrest observed in glassy systems remains an open challenge. Over the last decade, machine learning (ML) strategies have emerged as an important tool for probing this structure-dynamics relationship, particularly for predicting heterogeneous glassy dynamics from local structure. A recent advancement is the introduction of the cage state, a structural quantity that captures the average positions of particles while rearrangements are forbidden. During the caging regime, linear models trained on the cage state have been shown to outperform more complex ML methods trained on initial configurations only. In this paper, we explore the properties associated with the cage state in more detail to better understand why it serves as such an effective predictor for the dynamics. Specifically, we examine how the cage state in a binary hard-sphere mixture is influenced by both packing fraction and boundary conditions. Our results reveal that, as the system approaches the glassy regime, the cage state becomes increasingly influenced by long-range structural effects. This influence is evident both in its predictive power for particle dynamics and in the internal structure of the cage state, suggesting that the CS might be associated with some form of an amorphous growing structural length scale.</description>

Abstract: We study bent-core nematic (BCN) systems in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) settings, focusing on the role of cybotactic clusters, phase transitions, confinement effects and applied external fields. We propose a generalised version of Madhusudana's two-state model for BCNs in [Madhusudhana NV, Physical Review E, 96(2), 022710] with two order parameters: $\mathbf{Q}_g$ to describe the ambient ground-state (GS) molecules and $\mathbf{Q}_c$ to describe the additional ordering induced by the cybotactic clusters. The equilibria are modelled by minimisers of an appropriately defined free energy, with an empirical coupling term between $\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\mathbf{Q}_c$. We demonstrate two phase transitions in spatially homogeneous 3D BCN systems at fixed temperatures: a first-order nematic-paranematic transition followed by a paranematic-isotropic phase transition driven by the GS-cluster coupling. We also numerically compute and give heuristic insights into solution landscapes of confined BCN systems on 2D square domains, tailored by the GS-cluster coupling, temperature and external fields. This benchmark example illustrates the potential of this generalised model to capture tunable director profiles, cluster properties and potential biaxiality induced by antagonistic $\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\mathbf{Q}_c$-profiles.</description>

      <title>Defect configuration of an active nematic around a circular obstacle</title>

Abstract: To enhance the understanding of the behavior of active nematic, it is important to understand the behavior of topological defects. In this paper, we study the configuration of topological defects of a two-dimensional active nematic around a circular obstacle. In the case of a passive nematic liquid crystal, the equilibrium configuration of defects can be easily identified by the method of image charges. In the case of an active nematic, however, one must take account of the flow field generated by active constituents, and the problem of identifying the defect configuration becomes complicated. We first perform numerical simulations and investigate how the stationary defect configuration deviates from the passive case. Furthermore, we carry out a theoretical calculation based on an analytical expression relating the defect velocity with the force exerted on the defect. Our theoretical calculation qualitatively reproduces the simulation results. Our study may be applied to describing the behaviour of e.g. cell populations in the presence of obstacles, and has the potential to benefit related fields, e.g., developmental biology.</description>

      <title>Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00744</link>

Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Local Reversibility and Divergent Markov Length in 1+1-D Directed Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany-Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</description>
