      <title>Navigating Chemical Space: Multi-Level Bayesian Optimization with Hierarchical Coarse-Graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular discovery within the vast chemical space remains a significant challenge due to the immense number of possible molecules and limited scalability of conventional screening methods. To approach chemical space exploration more effectively, we have developed an active learning-based method that uses transferable coarse-grained models to compress chemical space into varying levels of resolution. By using multiple representations of chemical space with different coarse-graining resolutions, we balance combinatorial complexity and chemical detail. To identify target compounds, we first transform the discrete molecular spaces into smooth latent representations. We then perform Bayesian optimization within these latent spaces, using molecular dynamics simulations to calculate target free energies of the coarse-grained compounds. This multi-level approach effectively balances exploration and exploitation at lower and higher resolutions, respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by optimizing molecules to enhance phase separation in phospholipid bilayers. Our funnel-like strategy not only suggests optimal compounds but also provides insight into relevant neighborhoods in chemical space. We show how this neighborhood information from lower resolutions can guide the optimization at higher resolutions, thereby providing an efficient way to navigate large chemical spaces for free energy-based molecular optimization.</description>

      <title>Effect of Rod Asymmetry on Field Distortions and Transmission Characteristics in Linear Quadrupole Mass Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reports the appearance of the octupole and hexadecapole components in the radial potential, which are otherwise absent in a linear quadrupole mass filter of symmetric round-rod configuration, if a small structural asymmetry is introduced in one electrode. Using the commercial ion simulation package SIMION, it is shown that the weightage of the octupole and hexadecapole potential increases with an increase in the asymmetry factor. A consistent correlation is observed between the octupole and dodecapole components, and between the hexadecapole and icosapole components with asymmetry added to different rod-to-field radius ratios. The transmission characteristics of the mass filter are studied for different asymmetry factors and rod-to-field radius ratios. The variation in the resolution parameter, as derived from the transmission contour, exhibits a strong correlation with the combined weightage of the multipole fields.</description>

      <title>MuAPBEK: An Improved Analytical Kinetic Energy Density Functional for Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) offers a true realization of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems, enabling full quantum-mechanical studies of electronic systems based solely on electron densities. However, OFDFT remains limited by the difficulty of formulating accurate kinetic-energy density functionals. In this paper, we substantially enhance the accuracy of OFDFT energies and densities by tuning, during density initialization, the parameter $\mu$ of the APBEK functional, which arises in the second-order gradient expansion of the kinetic energy for semiclassical neutral atoms. We augment this parameterized APBEK functional with two physically-motivated, non-empirical corrections derived from Kato's cusp condition and the virial theorem. The resulting functional, which we call MuAPBEK, is benchmarked against Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) on atoms, organic molecules from the QM9 dataset, and the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. MuAPBEK achieves much lower energy errors than standard APBEK and Thomas-Fermi-von-Weizsacker functionals, even when the latter two are evaluated on converged KSDFT densities. Its mean absolute energy errors on atoms and molecules are 161 and 122 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that MuAPBEK's errors do not scale with system size. MuAPBEK also yields accurate densities, with a mean integrated absolute density error of 1.8 electrons for molecules. Importantly, one step of our density optimization scheme is at least ten times faster than a single KSDFT self-consistent field cycle and exhibits a lower-order computational time complexity of $O(N^{1.96})$ with respect to system size, $N$. Our results indicate that highly-accurate OFDFT for large-scale quantum simulations beyond the practical limits of KSDFT is within reach.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Theory of Electrochemical Ostwald Ripening for Electrodeposited Lithium Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a theoretical framework that describes the evolution of lithium nuclei under the competing effects of electroplating and surface energy-driven redistribution (electrochemical Ostwald ripening). Our model introduces a formulation that accounts for solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) resistance, electrolyte conductivity, and electrode wettability, capturing the transition from SEI to electrolyte-limited growth regimes. We identify asymptotic behaviors for high and low current densities, quantify the conditions under which ripening dominates, and derive analytical expressions for nucleus size, density, and surface coverage. Model predictions show excellent agreement with experimental data across multiple datasets. The results reveal how SEI and electrolyte conductivity, current density and metal-electrode contact angle govern deposition morphology and Coulombic efficiency. Based on these insights, we outline experimentally accessible guidelines to improve battery efficiency and cycling stability - offering a simple yet predictive approach for optimizing metal electrodeposition processes in battery systems and beyond.</description>

      <title>Lambda-ABF-OPES: Faster Convergence with High Accuracy in Alchemical Free Energy Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity between small molecules and target macromolecules while combining both speed and accuracy, is a cornerstone of modern computational drug discovery which is critical for accelerating therapeutic development. Despite recent progresses in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, such as advanced polarizable force fields and enhanced-sampling techniques, estimating absolute binding free energies (ABFE) remains computationally challenging. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce a highly efficient, hybrid methodology that couples the Lambda-Adaptive Biasing Force (Lambda-ABF) scheme with On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES). This approach achieves up to a nine-fold improvement in sampling efficiency and computational speed compared to the original Lambda-ABF when used in conjunction with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, yielding converged results at a fraction of the cost of standard techniques.</description>

      <title>Correlated vibration-solvent and Duschinsky effects on electron transfer dynamics and optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the effects of vibrations in electron transfer (ET) dynamics and optical spectroscopies is essential to precisely interpret the role of decoherence, especially for systems embedded in solvents. In this work, we study the correlated Duschinsky and solvent effects on ET and spectroscopy. Exploited is a novel extended dissipaton-equation-of motion (ext-DEOM) approach, which is an exact and non-Markovian, non-perturbative method for quadratic system-bath couplings. The unified bath description, in terms of multiple Brownian oscillators (BOs), comprises the solvent modes and also intramolecular vibrations. Both ET dynamics and spectroscopy show the complex interplay among linear displacements, frequency shifts, Duschinsky rotations and solvent-induced BO-mode correlations. The reduced ET system density operator evolution is further analyzed in the context of Bloch sphere representation that is basis-set independent due to its geometric nature.</description>

      <title>The First Selected Configuration Interaction Implementation with Distributed Storage of the Configuration Interaction Vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the hybrid "QC+HPC" strategy -- where quantum computers screen important determinants, followed by exact diagonalization on classical computer -- has shown great potential in the study of strongly correlated systems in quantum chemistry. Last year, an IBM team proposed a novel scheme that utilizes quantum computers to select important bitstrings, which are then used to construct a spin-adapted determinant space via tensor products. In this work, we have specifically designed an entirely new algorithm for this tensor-product bitstring selected configuration interaction (SCI). For the first time worldwide, we have implemented distributed storage of the configuration interaction (CI) vector in this SCI framework, enabling massively parallel execution and scalable treatment of trillion-determinant spaces. Since this study is independent and does not involve determinant selection by quantum computers, we demonstrate our implementation's capabilities by performing large-scale full configuration interaction (FCI) computations on the supercomputer Fugaku. The largest case is N$2$ (cc-pVTZ) under D${2h}$ symmetry, involving $2.62 \times 10^{12}$ determinants after freezing the core orbitals. This scale surpasses the previous SCI record ($2 \times 10^9$ determinants) by over three orders of magnitude, and even doubles the size of the largest FCI calculation reported to date ($1.31 \times 10^{12}$ determinants). Remarkably, this result was achieved within the SCI framework, yet it exceeds the largest known full CI calculation. This work sets a new benchmark for SCI implementations and provides a scalable and efficient framework that can be extended to a wide range of SCI methodologies.</description>

      <title>Exploiting a Shortcoming of Coupled-Cluster Theory: The Extent of non-Hermiticity as a Diagnostic Indicator of Computational Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental non-Hermitian nature of the forms of coupled-cluster (CC) theory widely used in quantum chemistry has usually been viewed as a negative, but the present letter shows how this can be used to advantage. Specifically, the non-symmetric nature of the reduced one-particle density matrix (in the molecular orbital basis) is advocated as a diagnostic indicator of computational quality. In the limit of full coupled-cluster theory (which is equivalent to full configuration interaction (FCI)), the electronic wavefunction and correlation energy are exact within a given one-particle basis set and the symmetric character of the exact density matrix is recovered. The extent of the density matrix asymmetry is shown to provide a measure of ``how difficult the problem is'' (like the well-known T$_1$ diagnostic), but its variation with level of theory also gives information about ``how well this particular method works'', irrespective of the difficulty of the problem at hand. The proposed diagnostic is described and applied to a select group of small molecules, and an example of its overall utility for the practicing quantum chemist is illustrated through its application to the beryllium dimer (Be$_2$). Future applications of this idea to excited states, open-shell systems, symmetry-breaking problems and extension of the method to the two-particle density are then proposed.</description>
