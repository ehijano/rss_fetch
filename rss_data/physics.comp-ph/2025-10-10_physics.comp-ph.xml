      <title>A Virtual Fields Method-Genetic Algorithm (VFM-GA) calibration framework for isotropic hyperelastic constitutive models with application to an elastomeric foam material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a calibration framework for material parameter identification in isotropic hyperelastic constitutive models. The framework synergizes the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) to define an objective function with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the optimization method to facilitate automated calibration. The formulation of the objective function uses experimental displacement fields measured from Digital Image Correlation (DIC) synchronized with load cell data and can accommodate data from experiments involving homogeneous or inhomogeneous deformation fields. The framework places no restrictions on the target isotropic hyperelastic constitutive model, accommodating models with coupled dependencies on deformation invariants and specialized functional forms with a number of material parameters, and assesses material stability, eliminating sets of material parameters that potentially lead to non-physical behavior for the target hyperelastic constitutive model. To minimize the objective function, a GA is deployed as the optimization tool due to its ability to navigate the intricate landscape of material parameter space. The VFM-GA framework is evaluated by applying it to a hyperelastic constitutive model for compressible elastomeric foams. The evaluation process entails a number of tests that employ both homogeneous and inhomogeneous displacement fields collected from DIC experiments on open-cell foam specimens. The results outperform manual fitting, demonstrating the framework's robust and efficient capability to handle material parameter identification for complex hyperelastic constitutive models.</description>

      <title>Iterated Agent for Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR), the automated discovery of mathematical expressions from data, is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. However, it is often hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the search space and a tendency to overfit. Popular methods, rooted in genetic programming, explore this space syntactically, often yielding overly complex, uninterpretable models. This paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, a framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as semantic operators within an evolutionary search. By generating candidate expressions guided by natural-language rationales, our method biases discovery towards models that are not only accurate but also conceptually coherent and interpretable. We demonstrate IdeaSearchFitter's efficacy across diverse challenges: it achieves competitive, noise-robust performance on the Feynman Symbolic Regression Database (FSReD), outperforming several strong baselines; discovers mechanistically aligned models with good accuracy-complexity trade-offs on real-world data; and derives compact, physically-motivated parametrizations for Parton Distribution Functions in a frontier high-energy physics application. IdeaSearchFitter is a specialized module within our broader iterated agent framework, IdeaSearch, which is publicly available at https://www.ideasearch.cn/.</description>

      <title>Quantum Grid Path Planning Using Parallel QAOA Circuits Based on Minimum Energy Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To overcome the bottleneck of classical path planning schemes in solving NP problems and address the predicament faced by current mainstream quantum path planning frameworks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, this study attempts to construct a quantum path planning solution based on parallel Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) architecture. Specifically, the grid path planning problem is mapped to the problem of finding the minimum quantum energy state. Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously execute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path energy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out unreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate optimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the calculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings indicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states corresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities can be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of obtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is only 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can still be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter. Compared with serial circuits, parallel circuits exhibit a significant advantage, as they can find the optimal feasible path coding combination with the highest probability.</description>

      <title>Scalings and simulation requirements in two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, important two-phase flow scalings are derived, which enable the quantification of grid-point and time-step requirements as functions of Re, We, and Ca numbers. The adequate grid resolution is determined in the inertia-dominated regime with the aid of high-fidelity simulations of stationary two-phase homogeneous isotropic turbulence by evaluating convergence of total interfacial area, size distribution, SMD, and curvature distribution. Although standards for DNS for single-phase turbulence flow exist, there is a lack of similar guidance in two-phase flows. Therefore, length scale ratios of the Kolmogorov-Hinze to the Kolmogorov scale of \eta_{KH}/\eta \sim We_{L}^{-3/5}Re_{L}^{3/4} in the inertia-dominated regime and the Kolmogorov-viscous to Kolmogorov scale of \eta_{KV}/\eta \sim Ca_{L}^{-1}Re_{L}^{3/4} for the viscous-dominated regime, are constructed. These scalings imply a computational cost increase like We_{L}^{12/5} and Ca_{L}^4, in the inertia-dominated and viscous-dominated regimes, respectively. A novel dimensionless number, coined as the ratio of interface scales (Ris), is proposed to aid in the classification of the turbulence regimes in the presence of an interface. Convergence of the total interfacial area, size distribution, SMD, and curvature distribution are observed for grid resolutions of k_{\max} \eta_{KH} \geq 60$ for second-order schemes. Furthermore, it is observed that this lower bound is the minimum required to capture intermittent events responsible for the increase of instantaneous total interfacial area. This criterion will be a valuable tool for determining grid resolution and time-step requirements a-priori for DNS of two-phase flows and for estimating the corresponding computational cost. This work provides guidelines and best practices for numerical simulations of two-phase flows, which will accelerate physics discovery and model development.</description>

      <title>Dimension- and Facet-Dependent Altermagnetic Triferroics and Biferroics in CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently garnered significant interest due to their vanishing net magnetic moment and non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. However, altermagnetic (AM) multiferroics especially triferroics remain scarce. We investigate the experimentally synthesized non-van der Waals CrSb as a model system to explore the effects of dimensionality and facet orientation on its ferroic properties. NiAs, MnP, wurtzite (WZ), zincblende (ZB), and rocksalt (RS) phases are considered. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the altermagnetism of CrSb in MnP phase which has comparable stability with experimental NiAs phase. Both NiAs- and MnP-phase (110) facets exhibit AM-ferroelastic (FC) biferroics, while the WZ-phase bulk and (001) facets host ferromagnetic (FM) or AM-ferroelectric (FE) biferroics. Notably, the WZ-phase (110) facets are identified as FM/AM-FE-FC triferroics, with moderate energy barriers of 0.129 and 0.363 eV atom-1 for FE and FC switching, respectively. Both FE and FC switching can reverse the AM spin splitting in antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations while preserving the high spin polarization in FM states. The magnetic anisotropy is highly tunable, exhibiting either uniaxial or in-plane behavior depending on the phase, dimension, and facet. This work establishes a framework for designing AM multiferroics through polymorphic, dimensional, and facet engineering, offering promising avenues for multifunctional spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of nonlinear forced response curves via reduction on spectral submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forced response curves (FRCs) of nonlinear systems can exhibit complex behaviors, including hardening/softening behavior and bifurcations. Although topology optimization holds great potential for tuning these nonlinear dynamic responses, its use in high-dimensional systems is limited by the high cost of repeated response and sensitivity analyses. To address this challenge, we employ the spectral submanifolds (SSMs) reduction theory, which reformulates the periodic response as the equilibria of an associated reduced-order model (ROM). This enables efficient and analytic evaluation of both response amplitudes and their sensitivities. Based on the SSM-based ROM, we formulate optimization problems that optimize the peak amplitude, the hardening/softening behavior, and the distance between two saddle-node bifurcations for an FRC. The proposed method is applied to the design of nonlinear MEMS devices, achieving targeted performance optimization. This framework provides a practical and efficient strategy for incorporating nonlinear dynamic effects into the topology optimization of structures.</description>

      <title>Modulating thermal conductivity of bulk BAs based on targeted phonon excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a reversible phonon excitation strategy to dynamically modulate the thermal conductivity of boron arsenide (BAs), addressing the opposing thermal conductivity requirements in electronics and thermoelectrics. Using first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport equation, we demonstrate that selective excitation of specific phonon modes enables active control over thermal transport. At an excitation multiplier of 25, the thermal conductivity of BAs can be enhanced by up to 2% or suppressed by up to 35% relative to its intrinsic value of 2235 W m^-1 K^-1. At a lower multiplier of 5, thermal conductivity can be increased by 2% or decreased by 11%. The modulation effect depends on excitation frequency, multiplier, and intrinsic phonon properties, with certain frequencies exhibiting opposite trends under different excitation intensities. Mechanistic analysis shows that at low excitation levels, phonon splitting suppresses Umklapp scattering, reducing the scattering rate, while at high levels, it enhances Normal scattering, increasing the scattering rate. This approach offers a dynamic and reversible route to tuning thermal conductivity, with applications in thermal management and thermoelectric energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Rare-Earth Engineering of NaAlO3 Perovskites Unlocks Unified Optoelectronic, Thermoelectric, and Spintronic Functionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite oxides are promising for energy and quantum technologies, but wide-gap hosts such as NaAlO3 suffer from deep-UV absorption and limited carrier transport. Using first-principles GGA+U+SOC calculations, we investigate Eu3+-, Gd3+-, and Tb3+-doped NaAlO3 and evaluate their electronic, optical, elastic, and thermoelectric properties. Rare-earth substitution is thermodynamically favorable (formation energies 1.2-1.6 eV) and induces strong f-p hybridization, reducing the pristine band gap (about 6.2 eV) to about 3.1 eV for Tb. Spin-resolved band structures reveal Gd-driven half-metallicity, Eu-induced spin-selective metallicity, and Tb-stabilized p-type semiconducting behavior. The optical spectra show a red-shifted absorption edge (about 2.0-2.2 eV), a large static dielectric response (epsilon1(0) about 95 for Eu), and plasmonic resonances near 4 eV, enabling visible-light harvesting. Elastic analysis indicates mild lattice softening with preserved ductility (Pugh ratio B/G about 1.56-1.57). Thermoelectric performance is enhanced, with Seebeck coefficients greater than 210 uV/K for Eu and Tb and ZT about 0.45 at 500 K. These results identify rare-earth-doped NaAlO3 as a multifunctional perovskite platform for photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics, and spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between many-body localization and spectra in non-Hermitian many-body systems is crucial. In a one-dimensional clean, long-range interaction-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization system, we have discovered the coexistence of static and dynamic spectral real-complex phase transitions, along with many-body ergodic-localized phase transitions. The phase diagrams of these two types of transitions show similar non-monotonic boundary trends but do not overlap, highlighting properties distinct from conventional disorder-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization. We also propose a potential experimental realization of this model in cold-atom systems. Our findings provide valuable insights for further understanding the relationship between non-Hermitian many-body localization and non-Hermitian spectra in long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>When Less is More: Approximating the Quantum Geometric Tensor with Block Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural gradient is central in neural quantum states optimizations but it is limited by the cost of computing and inverting the quantum geometric tensor, the quantum analogue of the Fisher information matrix. We introduce a block-diagonal quantum geometric tensor that partitions the metric by network layers, analogous to block-structured Fisher methods such as K-FAC. This layer-wise approximation preserves essential curvature while removing noisy cross-layer correlations, improving conditioning and scalability. Experiments on Heisenberg and frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ models show faster convergence, lower energy, and improved stability.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic systems have a fundamental relevance in the description of physical phenomena. The search for more accurate and faster numerical integration methods for the resolution of such systems is, therefore, an important topic of research. The present work introduces a new approach for the numerical integration of dynamic systems. We propose an association of numerical integration methods (integrators) in order to optimize the performance. The standard we apply is the balance of the duo : precision obtained x running time. The numerical integration methods we have chosen, for this particular instance of association, were the Runge-Kutta of fourth order and seventheighth order. The algorithm was implemented in C++ language. The results showed an improvement in accuracy over the lower grade numerical integrator (actually, we have achieved, basically, the precision of the top integrator) with a processing time performance closer to the one of the lower grade integrator. Similar results can be obtained for other pairs of numerical integration methods.</description>

      <title>Extending the trapping theorem to provide local stability guarantees for quadratically nonlinear models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00324v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Navier Stokes equations (NSEs) are partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the nonlinear convective motion of fluids and they are computationally expensive to simulate because of their high nonlinearity and variables being fully coupled. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are simpler models for evolving the flows by capturing only the dominant behaviors of a system and can be used to design controllers for high-dimensional systems. However it is challenging to guarantee the stability of these models either globally or locally. Ensuring the stability of ROMs can improve the interpretability of the behavior of the dynamics and help develop effective system control strategies. For quadratically nonlinear systems that represent many fluid flows, the Schlegel and Noack trapping theorem (JFM, 2015) can be used to check if ROMs are globally stable (long-term bounded). This theorem was subsequently incorporated into system identification techniques that determine models directly from data. In this work, we relax the quadratically energy-preserving constraints in this theorem, and then promote local stability in data-driven models of quadratically nonlinear dynamics. First, we prove a theorem outlining sufficient conditions to ensure local stability in linear-quadratic systems and provide an estimate of the stability radius. Second, we incorporate this theorem into system identification methods and produce a-priori locally stable data-driven models. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Dual formulation of the maximum entropy method applied to analytic continuation of quantum Monte Carlo data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many fields of physics use quantum Monte Carlo techniques, but struggle to estimate dynamic spectra via the analytic continuation of imaginary-time quantum Monte Carlo data. One of the most ubiquitous approaches to analytic continuation is the maximum entropy method (MEM). We supply a dual Newton optimization algorithm to be used within the MEM and provide analytic bounds for the algorithm's error. The MEM is typically used with Bryan's controversial algorithm [Rothkopf, "Bryan's Maximum Entropy Method" Data 5.3 (2020)]. We present new theoretical issues that are not yet in the literature. Our algorithm has all the theoretical benefits of Bryan's algorithm without these theoretical issues. We compare the MEM with Bryan's optimization to the MEM with our dual Newton optimization on test problems from lattice quantum chromodynamics and plasma physics. These comparisons show that in the presence of noise the dual Newton algorithm produces better estimates and error bars; this indicates the limits of Bryan's algorithm's applicability. We use the MEM to investigate authentic quantum Monte Carlo data for the uniform electron gas at warm dense matter conditions and further substantiate the roton-type feature in the dispersion relation.</description>

Abstract: This study addresses a challenge of parametrizing a resolution function of the neutron beam from the neutron time of flight facility n_TOF at CERN. A difficulty stems from a fact that a resolution function exhibits rather strong variations in shape, over approximately 10 orders of magnitude in neutron energy. In order to avoid a need for a manual identification of the appropriate analytical forms - hindering past attempts at its parametrization - we take advantage of the versatile machine learning techniques. In particular, we parametrize it by training a multilayer feedforward neural network, relying on a key idea that such networks act as the universal approximators. The proof of concept is presented for a resolution function for the first experimental area of the n_TOF facility, from the third phase of its operation. We propose an optimal network structure for a resolution function in question, which is also expected to be optimal or near-optimal for other experimental areas and for different phases of n_TOF operation. In order to reconstruct several resolution function forms in common use from a single parametrized form, we provide a practical tool in the form of a specialized C++ class encapsulating the computationally efficient procedures suited to the task. Specifically, the class allows an application of a user-specified temporal spread of a primary proton beam (from a neutron production process at n_TOF) to a desired resolution function form.</description>

      <title>Coupling all-electron full-potential density functional theory with grid-based continuum embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in continuum embedding models have enabled the incorporation of solvent and electrolyte effects into density functional theory (DFT) simulations of material surfaces, significantly benefiting electrochemistry, catalysis, and other applications. To extend the simulation of diverse systems and properties, the implementation of continuum embedding models into the Environ library adopts a modular programming paradigm, offering a flexible interface for communication with various DFT programs. The speed and scalability of the current implementation rely on a smooth definition of the key physical properties of the atomistic system, in particular of its electronic density. This has hindered the coupling of Environ with all-electron simulation packages, as the sharp electron density peaks near atomic nuclei are difficult to represent on regular grids. In this work, we introduce a novel smoothing scheme that transforms atom-centered electron densities into a regular grid representation while preserving the accuracy of electrostatic calculations. This approach enables a minimal and generic interface, facilitating seamless interoperability between Environ and all-electron DFT programs. We demonstrate this development through the coupling of Environ with the FHI-aims package and present benchmark simulations that validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Training a Foundation Model for Materials on a Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16067</link>

Abstract: Foundation models for materials modeling are advancing quickly, but their training remains expensive, often placing state-of-the-art methods out of reach for many research groups. We introduce Nequix, a compact E(3)-equivariant potential that pairs a simplified NequIP design with modern training practices, including equivariant root-mean-square layer normalization and the Muon optimizer, to retain accuracy while substantially reducing compute requirements. Nequix has 700K parameters and was trained in 100 A100 GPU-hours. On the Matbench-Discovery and MDR Phonon benchmarks, Nequix ranks third overall while requiring a 20 times lower training cost than most other methods, and it delivers two orders of magnitude faster inference speed than the current top-ranked model. We release model weights and fully reproducible codebase at https://github.com/atomicarchitects/nequix.</description>

      <title>MORPH: Shape-agnostic PDE Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning. The source code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/lanl/MORPH.</description>

      <title>Kinetic closure of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a kinetic closure of the filtered Boltzmann-BGK equation, paving the way towards an alternative description of turbulence. The closure naturally incorporates the turbulent subfilter stress tensor without the need for explicit modeling, unlike in Navier-Stokes models. In contrast, it accounts for the subfilter turbulent diffusion in the nonconserved moments by generalizing the BGK collision operator. The model requires neither scale separation nor a Smagorinsky-type ansatz for the subfilter stress tensor. The Chapman-Enskog analysis shows that its hydrodynamic limit converges exactly to the filtered Navier-Stokes equations, with velocity gradients isolating subfilter contributions. Validations through lattice Boltzmann simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex and the turbulent mixing layer demonstrate improved stability and reduced dissipation, benchmarked against the Smagorinsky model.</description>
