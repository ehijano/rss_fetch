      <title>Superexchanges and Charge Transfer in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with $T_c$ above 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Motivated by the recent experimental reports, we study an 11-band Hubbard model with tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, by using large scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory approaches. Our results demonstrate that the major antiferromagnetic superexchange couplings in thin-film La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ can be significantly weaker than in the bulk at 29.5 Gpa. The out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is significantly reduced by about 27% in film, whereas, the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unchanged. We estimate the antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\parallel}$ and $J_{\perp}$ by using perturbation theory. Regarding charge transfer, we find that biaxial compression in the thin films results in reduced charge-transfer gap compared to the bulk material. We determine the distribution of doped holes and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) orbitals and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals. A significant particle-hole asymmetry regarding carrier doping is revealed. Our results provide a foundation for subsequent studies of the low-energy $t-J$ model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, and ofer key insights into the understanding of physical differences between the film and bulk bilayer nickelate high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Many-body wave function and edge magnetization of an open $p+is$ superconducting chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although BCS wave function for superconductors under periodic boundary conditions are well-established, obtaining an explicit form of the many-body BCS wave function under open boundary condition is usually a nontrivial problem. In this work, we construct the exact BCS ground state wave function of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 superconductor with $p+ is$ pairing symmetry under open boundary conditions for special sets of parameters. The spin magnetization on the edges are calculated explicitly using the obtained wave function. Approximate expression of the wave function is also discussed based on degenerate perturbation theory when the $s$-wave component is much smaller than the $p$-wave one, which provides more intuitive understanding for the system. Our work is useful for obtaining deeper understandings of open $p+ is$ superconducting chains on a wave function level.</description>

      <title>Interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity in two dimensions: intertwined symmetries and singlet-triplet mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity for the case of two-dimensional square- and triangular-lattice systems. Our approach is based on an effective single particle Hamiltonian which mimics the alternating spin splitting characteristic for the $d$-$wave$ and $i$-$wave$ altermagnetic state. By supplementing the model with intersite pairing term we characterize the principal features of the coexistent altermagnetic-superconducting state as well as the possibility of inducing the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase. Our calculations show that the subtle interplay between the symmetries of the superconducting and altermagnetic order parameters as well as the shape/size of the Fermi surface lead to various types of anisotropic behaviors of the resultant non-zero momentum pairing, which has not been possible in the originally proposed FFLO state. Moreover, in the considered systems additional pairing symmetries appear leading to an exotic multi-component order parameter with singlet-triplet mixing. To interpret the obtained data we analyze the Cooper pair density in the momentum space and the corresponding Fermi wave vector mismatch resulting from the altermagnetic spin splitting. We discuss our result in the context of possible applications like, e.g., the superconducting diode.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nodal Gap in a Doped Spin-1/2 Antiferromagnetic Mott Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many emergent phenomena appear in doped Mott insulators near the insulator-to-metal transition. In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, superconductivity arises when antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is gradually suppressed by carrier doping, and a $\textit{d}$-wave superconducting gap forms when an enigmatic nodal gap evolves into a point node. Here, we examine electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$, the 5$\textit{d}$-electron counterpart of cuprates, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. At low doping levels, we observe the formation of electronic states near the Fermi level, accompanied by a gap at the AFM zone boundary, mimicking the AFM gap in electron-doped cuprates. With increasing doping, a distinct gap emerges along the (0,0)-($\pi$,$\pi$) nodal direction, paralleling that observed in hole-doped cuprates. This anomalous nodal gap persists after the collapse of the AFM gap and gradually decreases with further doping. It eventually vanishes into a point node of the reported $\textit{d}$-wave gap. These observations replicate the characteristic features in both electron- and hole-doped cuprates, indicating a unified route toward nodal metallicity in doped spin-1/2 AFM Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Phase controlled multi-terminal Josephson junction in ternary hybrid nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents multiterminal Josephson junctions in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor InAsSb-Al nanocrosses. Hybrid nanocrosses are grown using molecular beam epitaxy and are formed through As-assisted merging of oppositely directed InAsSb nanowires. We explain this complex ternary merging mechanism using a temperature-dependent phase diagram and investigate the detailed crystal structure with atomic-resolution imaging. The hybrid nanoscrosses enabled the fabrication of multiterminal Josephson junction devices, which were characterized at low temperatures. The supercurrent through each terminal combination was measured as a function of the density in the junction and the relative phase of the terminals, which was controlled by an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Mapping the positions of Two-Level-Systems on the surface of a superconducting transmon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherence of superconducting quantum computers is severely limited by material defects that create parasitic two-level-systems (TLS). Progress is complicated by lacking understanding how TLS are created and in which parts of a qubit circuit they are most detrimental. Here, we present a method to determine the individual positions of TLS at the surface of a transmon qubit. We employ a set of on-chip gate electrodes near the qubit to generate local DC electric fields that are used to tune the TLS' resonance frequencies. The TLS position is inferred from the strengths at which TLS couple to different electrodes and comparing them to electric field simulations. We found that the majority of detectable surface-TLS was residing on the leads of the qubit's Josephson junction, despite the dominant contribution of its coplanar capacitor to electric field energy and surface area. This indicates that the TLS density is significantly enhanced near shadow-evaporated electrodes fabricated by lift-off techniques. Our method is useful to identify critical circuit regions where TLS contribute most to decoherence, and can guide improvements in qubit design and fabrication methods.</description>

      <title>Local insulator-to-superconductor transition in amorphous InO$_x$ films modulated by e-beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method enabling precise post-fabrication modulation of the electrical resistance in micrometer-scale regions of amorphous indium oxide (a-InO$_x$) films. By subjecting initially insulating films to an electron beam at room temperature, we demonstrate that the exposed region of the films becomes superconducting. The resultant superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is adjustable up to 2.8 K by changing the electron dose and accelerating voltage. This technique offers a compelling alternative to traditional a-InO$_x$ annealing methods for both fundamental investigations and practical applications. Moreover, it empowers independent adjustment of electrical properties across initially identical a-InO$_x$ samples on the same substrate, facilitating the creation of superconducting microstructures with precise $T_c$ control at the micrometer scale. Some possible mechanisms for the observed resistance modifications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau Formalism in a Tilted Dirac Cone Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent researches on tilted Dirac cone materials have unveiled an astonishing property, the metric of the spacetime can be altered in these materials by applying a perpendicular electric field. This phenomenon is observed near the Fermi velocity, which is significantly lower than the speed of light. According to this property, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau action from the microscopic Hamiltonian of the BCS theory for the tilted Dirac cone materials. This derivation is performed near the critical point within the framework of curved spacetime. The novelty of the present work lies in deriving a general Ginzburg-Landau action that depends on spacetime curvature, where the curvature is tuned by an external electric field. Furthermore, this finding enables us to apply the Ginzburg-Landau theory at high temperatures by changing the spacetime metric, potentially offering insights into achieving high-temperature superconductivity in these materials.</description>

      <title>Spin and orbital excitations in undoped infinite layers: a comparison between superconducting PrNiO2 and insulating CaCuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinite layer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.</description>

      <title>KTaO3-Based Supercurrent Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supercurrent diode effect (SDE), characterized by nonreciprocal critical currents, represents a promising building block for future dissipationless electronics and quantum circuits. Realizing SDE requires breaking both time-reversal and inversion symmetry in the device. Here we use conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) lithography to pattern reconfigurable superconducting weak links (WLs) at the LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) interface. By deliberately engineering the WL geometry at the nanoscale, we realize SDE in these devices in the presence of modest out-of-plane magnetic fields. The SDE polarity can be reversed by simply changing the WL position, and the rectification efficiency reaches up to 13% under optimal magnetic field conditions. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations reveal that the observed SDE originates from asymmetric vortex motion in the inversion-symmetry-breaking device geometry. This demonstration of SDE in the LAO/KTO system establishes a versatile platform for investigating and engineering vortex dynamics, forming the basis for engineered quantum circuit elements.</description>

      <title>Toroid, Altermagnetic and Noncentrosymmetric ordering in metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is dedicated to the 60-th anniversary of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics and presents a review of normal and superconducting properties of toroidal, altermagnetic, and noncentrosymmetric metals. Metals with toroidal order are compounds not possessing symmetry in respect of space and time inversion but are symmetric in respect of the product of these operations. An electric current propagating through samples of such a material causes its magnetisation. Superconducting states in toroidal metals are a mixture of singlet and triplet states. Superconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals without impurities. Altermagnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a specific spin splitting of electron bands determined by time inversion in combinations with rotations and reflections of a crystal lattice. Similar splitting takes place in metals whose symmetry does not have a spatial inversion operation. Both of these types of materials have an anomalous Hall effect. A current propagating through a noncentrosymmetric metal causes magnetization, but this is not the case in altermagnets. On the other hand, in altermagnets, there is a specific piezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting pairing in non-centrosymmetric metals occurs between electrons occupying states in one zone, whereas, in altermagnets, we are dealing with interband pairing, which is unfavorable for the formation of a superconducting state.</description>
