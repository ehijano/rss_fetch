      <title>The Geometric P=W conjecture and Thurston's compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an explicit formula for a well-known embedding of the set of isotopy classes of multicurves on a closed surface of genus $g$ into $\mathbb{N}^{9g - 9}$. More significantly, we relate this result and established facts about Thurston's compactification of Teichm\"uller space to the geometric P = W conjecture for $\tn{SL}(2,\C)$, which concerns projective compactifications of character varieties of closed surfaces. In particular, we construct a projective compactification of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety for any closed surface of genus $g &gt; 1$, in which the boundary divisors are toric orbifolds and their dual intersection complex is a sphere.</description>

      <title>Connected components of the space of type-preserving representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete the characterization of the connected components of the space of type-preserving representations of a punctured surface group into $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. We show that the connected components are indexed by the relative Euler classes and the signs of the images of the peripheral elements satisfying a generalized Milnor-Wood inequality; and when the surface is a punctured sphere, there are additional connected components consisting of ``totally non-hyperbolic" representations. As a consequence, we count the total number of the connected components of the space of type-preserving representations.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Morse Geodesics and First Passage Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an infinite connected graph, a way to randomly perturb its metric is to assign random i.i.d. lengths to the edges of the graph. Assume that the graph is infinite and of bounded degree. Assume also strict positivity and finite expectation of the edge length distribution and existence of a sublinearly Morse bi-infinite geodesic line, we prove that almost surely there exists a bi-infinite geodesic line. This generalizes a previous result of \cite{BT17} regarding Morse geodesics.</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence and diffeomorphism groups of smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let two smooth manifolds $M$ and $N$ be given, with $M$ closed and connected. If the $C^r$--diffeomorphism group of $M$ is elementarily equivalent to the $C^s$--diffeomorphism group of $N$ for some $r,s\in[1,\infty)\cup\{0,\infty\}$, then $r=s$ and $M$ and $N$ are $C^r$--xdiffeomorphic. This strengthens a previously known result by Takens and Filipkiewicz, which implies that a group isomorphism between diffeomorphism groups of closed manifolds necessarily arises from a diffeomorphism of the underlying manifolds, provided the regularity lies in $\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$. We prove an analogous result for groups of diffeomorphisms preserving smooth volume forms, in dimension at least two.</description>

      <title>Complete classification of the Dehn functions of Bestvina-Brady groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Dehn function of every finitely presented Bestvina-Brady group grows as a linear, quadratic, cubic, or quartic polynomial. In fact, we provide explicit criteria on the defining graph to determine the degree of this polynomial. As a consequence, we identify an obstruction that prevents certain Bestvina-Brady groups from admitting a CAT(0) structure.</description>

      <title>Khovanov homology and rational unknotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on work by Alishahi-Dowlin, we extract a new knot invariant $\lambda \ge 0$ from universal Khovanov homology. While $\lambda$ is a lower bound for the unknotting number, in fact more is true: $\lambda$ is a lower bound for the proper rational unknotting number (the minimal number of rational tangle replacements preserving connectivity necessary to relate a knot to the unknot). Moreover, we show that for all $n \ge 0$, there exists a knot K with $\lambda(K) = n$. Along the way, following Thompson, we compute the Bar-Natan complexes of rational tangles.</description>

      <title>Free ribbon lemma for surface-link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09281v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A free surface-link is a surface-link whose fundamental group is a free group not necessarily meridian-based. Free ribbon lemma says that every free sphere-link in the 4-sphere is a ribbon sphere-link. Four different proofs of Free ribbon lemma are explained. The first proof is done in an earlier paper. The second proof is done by showing that there is an O2-handle basis of a ribbon surface-link. The third proof is done by removing the commuter relations from a Wirtinger presentation of a free group, which a paper on another proof of Free ribbon lemma complements. The fourth proof is given by the special case of the proof of the result that every free surface-link is a ribbon surface-link which is a stabilization of a free ribbon sphere-link. As a consequence, it is shown that a surface-link is a sublink of a free surface-link if and only if it is a stabilization of a ribbon sphere-link.</description>

      <title>Revised note on surface-link of trivial components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that a surface-link of ribbon surface-knot components is a ribbon surface-link if and only if it is a surface-link producing a ribbon surface-link by surgery along a self-trivial 1-handle system. This corrects an earlier statement. This result makes a corrected proof for the claim that every surface-link of trivial surface-knot components with at most one aspheric component is a ribbon surface-link. For non-ribbon surface-links of trivial components with at least two aspheric components constructed in a previous note, it adds the new property that non-ribbonability continues through surgery along any self-trivial 1-handle system.</description>

      <title>Hodge structures on conformal blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness of complex Hodge structures on modular functors. The proof is based on the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence and Ocneanu rigidity. Given a modular functor, we explain how its Hodge numbers fit into a Frobenius algebra and the Chern characters of its Hodge decompositions into a new cohomological field theory (CohFT). In the case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ modular functors of level $2$ times an odd number, we give explicit formulas for all Hodge numbers, in any genus $g$.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin-Weiss classes and a rational decomposition of spaces of homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a rational homotopy pullback decomposition for variants of the classifying space of the group of homeomorphisms for a large class of manifolds. This has various applications, including a rational section of the stabilisation map ${\rm Top}(d)\rightarrow {\rm Top}$ of the space of homeomorphisms of ${\bf R}^d$ for $d\ge 6$, or a new method to construct topological bundles and detect characteristic classes thereof. Some steps in the proofs may be of independent interest, such as the construction of a nullhomotopy of the twice-iterated stabilisation map for the space of orientation-preserving derived automorphisms of the rational $E_d$-operad, results on recovering boundaries of manifolds from the interior in the context of embedding calculus, or a treatment of tensor products of truncated $\infty$-operads.</description>

      <title>Symmetry groups of origami structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Origami is the art of folding paper into various patterns without cutting or tearing the paper. By viewing the paper as the complex plane, we iteratively compute and record all intersection points to construct mathematical origami sets. Additionally, we include the various lines to create a repeating pattern that can be viewed as a wallpaper group if the angle set contains fewer than 3 angles. There are 17 wallpaper groups up to isomorphism, so we determine which such groups can be constructed in this way, depending on the rotational and reflectional symmetries present in the given pattern. If the angle set contains more than 4 angles, the resulting pattern will be dense and hence no longer a wallpaper group. In this case, the classification of the symmetry group is done algorithmically.</description>
