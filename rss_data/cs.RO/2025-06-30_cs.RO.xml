      <title>Conversations with Andrea: Visitors' Opinions on Android Robots in a Museum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The android robot Andrea was set up at a public museum in Germany for six consecutive days to have conversations with visitors, fully autonomously. No specific context was given, so visitors could state their opinions regarding possible use-cases in structured interviews, without any bias. Additionally the 44 interviewees were asked for their general opinions of the robot, their reasons (not) to interact with it and necessary improvements for future use. The android's voice and wig were changed between different days of operation to give varying cues regarding its gender. This did not have a significant impact on the positive overall perception of the robot. Most visitors want the robot to provide information about exhibits in the future, while opinions on other roles, like a receptionist, were both wanted and explicitly not wanted by different visitors. Speaking more languages (than only English) and faster response times were the improvements most desired. These findings from the interviews are in line with an analysis of the system logs, which revealed, that after chitchat and personal questions, most of the 4436 collected requests asked for information related to the museum and to converse in a different language. The valuable insights gained from these real-world interactions are now used to improve the system to become a useful real-world application.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Discovery of Behavioral Primitives from Sensorimotor Dynamic Functional Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movements of both animals and robots give rise to streams of high-dimensional motor and sensory information. Imagine the brain of a newborn or the controller of a baby humanoid robot trying to make sense of unprocessed sensorimotor time series. Here, we present a framework for studying the dynamic functional connectivity between the multimodal sensory signals of a robotic agent to uncover an underlying structure. Using instantaneous mutual information, we capture the time-varying functional connectivity (FC) between proprioceptive, tactile, and visual signals, revealing the sensorimotor relationships. Using an infinite relational model, we identified sensorimotor modules and their evolving connectivity. To further interpret these dynamic interactions, we employed non-negative matrix factorization, which decomposed the connectivity patterns into additive factors and their corresponding temporal coefficients. These factors can be considered the agent's motion primitives or movement synergies that the agent can use to make sense of its sensorimotor space and later for behavior selection. In the future, the method can be deployed in robot learning as well as in the analysis of human movement trajectories or brain signals.</description>

      <title>DriveBLIP2: Attention-Guided Explanation Generation for Complex Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework, DriveBLIP2, built upon the BLIP2-OPT architecture, to generate accurate and contextually relevant explanations for emerging driving scenarios. While existing vision-language models perform well in general tasks, they encounter difficulties in understanding complex, multi-object environments, particularly in real-time applications such as autonomous driving, where the rapid identification of key objects is crucial. To address this limitation, an Attention Map Generator is proposed to highlight significant objects relevant to driving decisions within critical video frames. By directing the model's focus to these key regions, the generated attention map helps produce clear and relevant explanations, enabling drivers to better understand the vehicle's decision-making process in critical situations. Evaluations on the DRAMA dataset reveal significant improvements in explanation quality, as indicated by higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores compared to baseline models. These findings underscore the potential of targeted attention mechanisms in vision-language models for enhancing explainability in real-time autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Directed Shape Morphing using Kirigami-enhanced Thermoplastics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple, accessible method for autonomously transforming flat plastic sheets into intricate three-dimensional structures using only uniform heating and common tools such as household ovens and scissors. Our approach combines heat-shrinkable thermoplastics with Kirigami patterns tailored to the target 3D shape, creating bilayer composites that morph into a wide range of complex structures, e.g., bowls, pyramids, and even custom ergonomic surfaces like mouse covers. Critically, the transformation is driven by a low-information stimulus (uniform heat) yet produces highly intricate shapes through programmed geometric design. The morphing behavior, confirmed by finite element simulations, arises from strain mismatch between the contracting thermoplastic layer and the constraining Kirigami layer. By decoupling material composition from mechanical response, this method avoids detailed process control and enables a broad class of self-morphing structures, offering a versatile platform for adaptive design and scalable manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Pixels-to-Graph: Real-time Integration of Building Information Models and Scene Graphs for Semantic-Geometric Human-Robot Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly playing key roles as support platforms for human operators in high-risk, dangerous applications. To accomplish challenging tasks, an efficient human-robot cooperation and understanding is required. While typically robotic planning leverages 3D geometric information, human operators are accustomed to a high-level compact representation of the environment, like top-down 2D maps representing the Building Information Model (BIM). 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to bridge the gap between human readable 2D BIM and the robot 3D maps. In this work, we introduce Pixels-to-Graph (Pix2G), a novel lightweight method to generate structured scene graphs from image pixels and LiDAR maps in real-time for the autonomous exploration of unknown environments on resource-constrained robot platforms. To satisfy onboard compute constraints, the framework is designed to perform all operation on CPU only. The method output are a de-noised 2D top-down environment map and a structure-segmented 3D pointcloud which are seamlessly connected using a multi-layer graph abstracting information from object-level up to the building-level. The proposed method is quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated during real-world experiments performed using the NASA JPL NeBula-Spot legged robot to autonomously explore and map cluttered garage and urban office like environments in real-time.</description>

      <title>Robust Peg-in-Hole Assembly under Uncertainties via Compliant and Interactive Contact-Rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust and adaptive robotic peg-in-hole assembly under tight tolerances is critical to various industrial applications. However, it remains an open challenge due to perceptual and physical uncertainties from contact-rich interactions that easily exceed the allowed clearance. In this paper, we study how to leverage contact between the peg and its matching hole to eliminate uncertainties in the assembly process under unstructured settings. By examining the role of compliance under contact constraints, we present a manipulation system that plans collision-inclusive interactions for the peg to 1) iteratively identify its task environment to localize the target hole and 2) exploit environmental contact constraints to refine insertion motions into the target hole without relying on precise perception, enabling a robust solution to peg-in-hole assembly. By conceptualizing the above process as the composition of funneling in different state spaces, we present a formal approach to constructing manipulation funnels as an uncertainty-absorbing paradigm for peg-in-hole assembly. The proposed system effectively generalizes across diverse peg-in-hole scenarios across varying scales, shapes, and materials in a learning-free manner. Extensive experiments on a NIST Assembly Task Board (ATB) and additional challenging scenarios validate its robustness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Efficient Robotic Garment Manipulation with Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Garment manipulation is a significant challenge for robots due to the complex dynamics and potential self-occlusion of garments. Most existing methods of efficient garment unfolding overlook the crucial role of standardization of flattened garments, which could significantly simplify downstream tasks like folding, ironing, and packing. This paper presents APS-Net, a novel approach to garment manipulation that combines unfolding and standardization in a unified framework. APS-Net employs a dual-arm, multi-primitive policy with dynamic fling to quickly unfold crumpled garments and pick-and-place (p and p) for precise alignment. The purpose of garment standardization during unfolding involves not only maximizing surface coverage but also aligning the garment's shape and orientation to predefined requirements. To guide effective robot learning, we introduce a novel factorized reward function for standardization, which incorporates garment coverage (Cov), keypoint distance (KD), and intersection-over-union (IoU) metrics. Additionally, we introduce a spatial action mask and an Action Optimized Module to improve unfolding efficiency by selecting actions and operation points effectively. In simulation, APS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods for long sleeves, achieving 3.9 percent better coverage, 5.2 percent higher IoU, and a 0.14 decrease in KD (7.09 percent relative reduction). Real-world folding tasks further demonstrate that standardization simplifies the folding process. Project page: see https://hellohaia.github.io/APS/</description>

      <title>SPI-BoTER: Error Compensation for Industrial Robots via Sparse Attention Masking and Hybrid Loss with Spatial-Physical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread application of industrial robots in fields such as cutting and welding has imposed increasingly stringent requirements on the trajectory accuracy of end-effectors. However, current error compensation methods face several critical challenges, including overly simplified mechanism modeling, a lack of physical consistency in data-driven approaches, and substantial data requirements. These issues make it difficult to achieve both high accuracy and strong generalization simultaneously. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Spatial-Physical Informed Attention Residual Network (SPI-BoTER). This method integrates the kinematic equations of the robotic manipulator with a Transformer architecture enhanced by sparse self-attention masks. A parameter-adaptive hybrid loss function incorporating spatial and physical information is employed to iteratively optimize the network during training, enabling high-precision error compensation under small-sample conditions. Additionally, inverse joint angle compensation is performed using a gradient descent-based optimization method. Experimental results on a small-sample dataset from a UR5 robotic arm (724 samples, with a train:test:validation split of 8:1:1) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. It achieves a 3D absolute positioning error of 0.2515 mm with a standard deviation of 0.15 mm, representing a 35.16\% reduction in error compared to conventional deep neural network (DNN) methods. Furthermore, the inverse angle compensation algorithm converges to an accuracy of 0.01 mm within an average of 147 iterations. This study presents a solution that combines physical interpretability with data adaptability for high-precision control of industrial robots, offering promising potential for the reliable execution of precision tasks in intelligent manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Vision-Language Planning for Multi-Step Humanoid Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to reliably execute complex multi-step manipulation tasks is crucial for their effective deployment in industrial and household environments. This paper presents a hierarchical planning and control framework designed to achieve reliable multi-step humanoid manipulation. The proposed system comprises three layers: (1) a low-level RL-based controller responsible for tracking whole-body motion targets; (2) a mid-level set of skill policies trained via imitation learning that produce motion targets for different steps of a task; and (3) a high-level vision-language planning module that determines which skills should be executed and also monitors their completion in real-time using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). Experimental validation is performed on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot executing a non-prehensile pick-and-place task. Over 40 real-world trials, the hierarchical system achieved a 72.5% success rate in completing the full manipulation sequence. These experiments confirm the feasibility of the proposed hierarchical system, highlighting the benefits of VLM-based skill planning and monitoring for multi-step manipulation scenarios. See https://vlp-humanoid.github.io/ for video demonstrations of the policy rollout.</description>

      <title>Safe Reinforcement Learning with a Predictive Safety Filter for Motion Planning and Control: A Drifting Vehicle Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous drifting is a complex and crucial maneuver for safety-critical scenarios like slippery roads and emergency collision avoidance, requiring precise motion planning and control. Traditional motion planning methods often struggle with the high instability and unpredictability of drifting, particularly when operating at high speeds. Recent learning-based approaches have attempted to tackle this issue but often rely on expert knowledge or have limited exploration capabilities. Additionally, they do not effectively address safety concerns during learning and deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based motion planner for autonomous drifting. Our approach integrates an RL agent with model-based drift dynamics to determine desired drift motion states, while incorporating a Predictive Safety Filter (PSF) that adjusts the agent's actions online to prevent unsafe states. This ensures safe and efficient learning, and stable drift operation. We validate the effectiveness of our method through simulations on a Matlab-Carsim platform, demonstrating significant improvements in drift performance, reduced tracking errors, and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods. This strategy promises to extend the capabilities of autonomous vehicles in safety-critical maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Energy-Constrained Resilient Multi-Robot Coverage Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of multi-robot coverage control becomes significantly challenging when multiple robots leave the mission space simultaneously to charge their batteries, disrupting the underlying network topology for communication and sensing. To address this, we propose a resilient network design and control approach that allows robots to achieve the desired coverage performance while satisfying energy constraints and maintaining network connectivity throughout the mission. We model the combined motion, energy, and network dynamics of the multirobot systems (MRS) as a hybrid system with three modes, i.e., coverage, return-to-base, and recharge, respectively. We show that ensuring the energy constraints can be transformed into designing appropriate guard conditions for mode transition between each of the three modes. Additionally, we present a systematic procedure to design, maintain, and reconfigure the underlying network topology using an energy-aware bearing rigid network design, enhancing the structural resilience of the MRS even when a subset of robots departs to charge their batteries. Finally, we validate our proposed method using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>SPICE-HL3: Single-Photon, Inertial, and Stereo Camera dataset for Exploration of High-Latitude Lunar Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring high-latitude lunar regions presents an extremely challenging visual environment for robots. The low sunlight elevation angle and minimal light scattering result in a visual field dominated by a high dynamic range featuring long, dynamic shadows. Reproducing these conditions on Earth requires sophisticated simulators and specialized facilities. We introduce a unique dataset recorded at the LunaLab from the SnT - University of Luxembourg, an indoor test facility designed to replicate the optical characteristics of multiple lunar latitudes. Our dataset includes images, inertial measurements, and wheel odometry data from robots navigating seven distinct trajectories under multiple illumination scenarios, simulating high-latitude lunar conditions from dawn to night time with and without the aid of headlights, resulting in 88 distinct sequences containing a total of 1.3M images. Data was captured using a stereo RGB-inertial sensor, a monocular monochrome camera, and for the first time, a novel single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) camera. We recorded both static and dynamic image sequences, with robots navigating at slow (5 cm/s) and fast (50 cm/s) speeds. All data is calibrated, synchronized, and timestamped, providing a valuable resource for validating perception tasks from vision-based autonomous navigation to scientific imaging for future lunar missions targeting high-latitude regions or those intended for robots operating across perceptually degraded environments. The dataset can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/13970078?preview=1, and a visual overview is available at https://youtu.be/d7sPeO50_2I.

      <title>Scenario-Based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Automated Driving Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems remains challenging, since these systems have to operate safely in an open and complex environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can learn comprehensive decision policies directly from experience and already show promising results in simple driving tasks. However, current approaches fail to achieve generalizability for more complex driving tasks and lack learning efficiency. Therefore, we present Scenario-based Automated Driving Reinforcement Learning (SAD-RL), the first framework that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) of hierarchical policy in a scenario-based environment. A high-level policy selects maneuver templates that are evaluated and executed by a low-level control logic. The scenario-based environment allows to control the training experience for the agent and to explicitly introduce challenging, but rate situations into the training process. Our experiments show that an agent trained using the SAD-RL framework can achieve safe behaviour in easy as well as challenging situations efficiently. Our ablation studies confirmed that both HRL and scenario diversity are essential for achieving these results.</description>

      <title>Event-based Stereo Visual-Inertial Odometry with Voxel Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The event camera, renowned for its high dynamic range and exceptional temporal resolution, is recognized as an important sensor for visual odometry. However, the inherent noise in event streams complicates the selection of high-quality map points, which critically determine the precision of state estimation. To address this challenge, we propose Voxel-ESVIO, an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes voxel map management, which efficiently filter out high-quality 3D points. Specifically, our methodology utilizes voxel-based point selection and voxel-aware point management to collectively optimize the selection and updating of map points on a per-voxel basis. These synergistic strategies enable the efficient retrieval of noise-resilient map points with the highest observation likelihood in current frames, thereby ensureing the state estimation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our Voxel-ESVIO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Acoustic Noise: Enhancing Quiet Locomotion for Quadruped Robots in Indoor Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quadruped robot research have significantly improved their ability to traverse complex and unstructured outdoor environments. However, the issue of noise generated during locomotion is generally overlooked, which is critically important in noise-sensitive indoor environments, such as service and healthcare settings, where maintaining low noise levels is essential. This study aims to optimize the acoustic noise generated by quadruped robots during locomotion through the development of advanced motion control algorithms. To achieve this, we propose a novel approach that minimizes noise emissions by integrating optimized gait design with tailored control strategies. This method achieves an average noise reduction of approximately 8 dBA during movement, thereby enhancing the suitability of quadruped robots for deployment in noise-sensitive indoor environments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various indoor settings, highlighting the potential of quadruped robots for quiet operation in noise-sensitive environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Motion Skills with Adaptive Assistive Curriculum Force in Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning policies for complex humanoid tasks remains both challenging and compelling. Inspired by how infants and athletes rely on external support--such as parental walkers or coach-applied guidance--to acquire skills like walking, dancing, and performing acrobatic flips, we propose A2CF: Adaptive Assistive Curriculum Force for humanoid motion learning. A2CF trains a dual-agent system, in which a dedicated assistive force agent applies state-dependent forces to guide the robot through difficult initial motions and gradually reduces assistance as the robot's proficiency improves. Across three benchmarks--bipedal walking, choreographed dancing, and backflip--A2CF achieves convergence 30% faster than baseline methods, lowers failure rates by over 40%, and ultimately produces robust, support-free policies. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that adaptively applied assistive forces significantly accelerate the acquisition of complex skills in high-dimensional robotic control.</description>

      <title>ParticleFormer: A 3D Point Cloud World Model for Multi-Object, Multi-Material Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D world models (i.e., learning-based 3D dynamics models) offer a promising approach to generalizable robotic manipulation by capturing the underlying physics of environment evolution conditioned on robot actions. However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks. Experimental videos are available at https://particleformer.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Flatness-based Finite-Horizon Multi-UAV Formation Trajectory Planning and Directionally Aware Collision Avoidance Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision-free optimal formation control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) teams is challenging. The state-of-the-art optimal control approaches often rely on numerical methods sensitive to initial guesses. This paper presents an innovative collision-free finite-time formation control scheme for multiple UAVs leveraging the differential flatness of the UAV dynamics, eliminating the need for numerical methods. We formulate a finite-time optimal control problem to plan a formation trajectory for feasible initial states. This formation trajectory planning optimal control problem involves a collective performance index to meet the formation requirements of achieving relative positions and velocity consensus. It is solved by applying Pontryagin's principle. Subsequently, a collision-constrained regulating problem is addressed to ensure collision-free tracking of the planned formation trajectory. The tracking problem incorporates a directionally aware collision avoidance strategy that prioritizes avoiding UAVs in the forward path and relative approach. It assigns lower priority to those on the sides with an oblique relative approach and disregards UAVs behind and not in the relative approach. The simulation results for a four-UAV team (re)formation problem confirm the efficacy of the proposed control scheme.</description>

      <title>DexH2R: A Benchmark for Dynamic Dexterous Grasping in Human-to-Robot Handover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handover between a human and a dexterous robotic hand is a fundamental yet challenging task in human-robot collaboration. It requires handling dynamic environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality, real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions, we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution, DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods, providing a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will drive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a high-quality dataset, effective solutions, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Mode Collapse Happens: Evaluating Critical Interactions in Joint Trajectory Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally, traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>InfGen: Scenario Generation as Next Token Group Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic and interactive traffic simulation is essential for training and evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most existing data-driven simulation methods rely on static initialization or log-replay data, limiting their ability to model dynamic, long-horizon scenarios with evolving agent populations. We propose InfGen, a scenario generation framework that outputs agent states and trajectories in an autoregressive manner. InfGen represents the entire scene as a sequence of tokens, including traffic light signals, agent states, and motion vectors, and uses a transformer model to simulate traffic over time. This design enables InfGen to continuously insert new agents into traffic, supporting infinite scene generation. Experiments demonstrate that InfGen produces realistic, diverse, and adaptive traffic behaviors. Furthermore, reinforcement learning policies trained in InfGen-generated scenarios achieve superior robustness and generalization, validating its utility as a high-fidelity simulation environment for autonomous driving.

      <title>Simplifying Data-Driven Modeling of the Volume-Flow-Pressure Relationship in Hydraulic Soft Robotic Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robotic systems are known for their flexibility and adaptability, but traditional physics-based models struggle to capture their complex, nonlinear behaviors. This study explores a data-driven approach to modeling the volume-flow-pressure relationship in hydraulic soft actuators, focusing on low-complexity models with high accuracy. We perform regression analysis on a stacked balloon actuator system using exponential, polynomial, and neural network models with or without autoregressive inputs. The results demonstrate that simpler models, particularly multivariate polynomials, effectively predict pressure dynamics with fewer parameters. This research offers a practical solution for real-time soft robotics applications, balancing model complexity and computational efficiency. Moreover, the approach may benefit various techniques that require explicit analytical models.</description>

      <title>Moving Matter: Using a Single, Simple Robot to Reconfigure a Connected Set of Building Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement and evaluate different methods for the reconfiguration of a connected arrangement of tiles into a desired target shape, using a single active robot that can move along the tile structure. This robot can pick up, carry, or drop off one tile at a time, but it must maintain a single connected configuration at all times.
  Becker et al. (CCCG 2025) recently proposed an algorithm that uses histograms as canonical intermediate configurations, guaranteeing performance within a constant factor of the optimal solution if the start and target configuration are well-separated. We implement and evaluate this algorithm, both in a simulated and practical setting, using an inchworm type robot to compare it with two existing heuristic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Safe and Performant Deployment of Autonomous Systems via Model Predictive Control and Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While we have made significant algorithmic developments to enable autonomous systems to perform sophisticated tasks, it remains difficult for them to perform tasks effective and safely. Most existing approaches either fail to provide any safety assurances or substantially compromise task performance for safety. In this work, we develop a framework, based on model predictive control (MPC) and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, to optimize task performance for autonomous systems while respecting the safety constraints. Our framework guarantees recursive feasibility for the MPC controller, and it is scalable to high-dimensional systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with two simulation studies using a 4D Dubins Car and a 6 Dof Kuka iiwa manipulator, and the experiments show that our framework significantly improves the safety constraints satisfaction of the systems over the baselines.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Generalizable Bimanual Manipulation: RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at CVPR 2025 MEIS Workshop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is an emerging frontier in robotics, driven by the need for autonomous systems that can perceive, reason, and act in complex physical environments. While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1, Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled 17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants, producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key findings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and generalizable bimanual manipulation policies.

      <title>GS-NBV: a Geometry-based, Semantics-aware Viewpoint Planning Algorithm for Avocado Harvesting under Occlusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient identification of picking points is critical for automated fruit harvesting. Avocados present unique challenges owing to their irregular shape, weight, and less-structured growing environments, which require specific viewpoints for successful harvesting. We propose a geometry-based, semantics-aware viewpoint-planning algorithm to address these challenges. The planning process involves three key steps: viewpoint sampling, evaluation, and execution. Starting from a partially occluded view, the system first detects the fruit, then leverages geometric information to constrain the viewpoint search space to a 1D circle, and uniformly samples four points to balance the efficiency and exploration. A new picking score metric is introduced to evaluate the viewpoint suitability and guide the camera to the next-best view. We validate our method through simulation against two state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show a 100% success rate in two case studies with significant occlusions, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of our approach.

      <title>A Model Predictive Control Framework to Enhance Safety and Quality in Mobile Additive Manufacturing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the demand for customized, on-demand production has grown in the manufacturing sector. Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance customization capabilities, enabling greater flexibility, reduced lead times, and more efficient material usage. However, traditional AM systems remain constrained by static setups and human worker dependencies, resulting in long lead times and limited scalability. Mobile robots can improve the flexibility of production systems by transporting products to designated locations in a dynamic environment. By integrating AM systems with mobile robots, manufacturers can optimize travel time for preparatory tasks and distributed printing operations. Mobile AM robots have been deployed for on-site production of large-scale structures, but often neglect critical print quality metrics like surface roughness. Additionally, these systems do not have the precision necessary for producing small, intricate components. We propose a model predictive control framework for a mobile AM platform that ensures safe navigation on the plant floor while maintaining high print quality in a dynamic environment. Three case studies are used to test the feasibility and reliability of the proposed systems.</description>

      <title>Risk-Based Filtering of Valuable Driving Situations in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving automated vehicle software requires driving data rich in valuable road user interactions. In this paper, we propose a risk-based filtering approach that helps identify such valuable driving situations from large datasets. Specifically, we use a probabilistic risk model to detect high-risk situations. Our method stands out by considering a) first-order situations (where one vehicle directly influences another and induces risk) and b) second-order situations (where influence propagates through an intermediary vehicle). In experiments, we show that our approach effectively selects valuable driving situations in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Compared to the two baseline interaction metrics of Kalman difficulty and Tracks-To-Predict (TTP), our filtering approach identifies complex and complementary situations, enriching the quality in automated vehicle testing. The risk data is made open-source: https://github.com/HRI-EU/RiskBasedFiltering.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments, comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we open source MGPRL as a ROS package https://github.com/herolab-uga/MGPRL.</description>

      <title>Online Human Action Detection during Escorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However, most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies, assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness, showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Passage-traversing optimal path planning with sampling-based algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new paradigm of optimal path planning, i.e., passage-traversing optimal path planning (PTOPP), that optimizes paths' traversed passages for specified optimization objectives. In particular, PTOPP is utilized to find the path with optimal accessible free space along its entire length, which represents a basic requirement for paths in robotics. As passages are places where free space shrinks and becomes constrained, the core idea is to leverage the path's passage traversal status to characterize its accessible free space comprehensively. To this end, a novel passage detection and free space decomposition method using proximity graphs is proposed, enabling fast detection of sparse but informative passages and environment decompositions. Based on this preprocessing, optimal path planning with accessible free space objectives or constraints is formulated as PTOPP problems compatible with sampling-based optimal planners. Then, sampling-based algorithms for PTOPP, including their dependent primitive procedures, are developed leveraging partitioned environments for fast passage traversal check. All these methods are implemented and thoroughly tested for effectiveness and efficiency validation. Compared to existing approaches, such as clearance-based methods, PTOPP demonstrates significant advantages in configurability, solution optimality, and efficiency, addressing prior limitations and incapabilities. It is believed to provide an efficient and versatile solution to accessible free space optimization over conventional avenues and more generally, to a broad class of path planning problems that can be formulated as PTOPP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleoperation with non-haptic VR controllers deprives human operators of critical motion feedback. We address this by embedding a multi-objective optimization problem that converts user input into collision-free UR5e joint trajectories while actively suppressing liquid slosh in a glass. The controller maintains 13 ms average planning latency, confirming real-time performance and motivating the augmentation of this teleoperation approach to further objectives.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive control architecture for semi-autonomous dual-arm robots in agriculture settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of mobile robotic platforms in complex environments, such as agricultural settings, requires these systems to exhibit a flexible yet effective architecture that integrates perception and control. In such scenarios, several tasks need to be accomplished simultaneously, ranging from managing robot limits to performing operational tasks and handling human inputs. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive control architecture for achieving complex tasks such as robotized harvesting in vineyards within the framework of the European project CANOPIES. In detail, a 16-DOF dual-arm mobile robot is employed, controlled via a Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) approach capable of handling both equality and inequality constraints at various priorities to harvest grape bunches selected by the perception system developed within the project. Furthermore, given the complexity of the scenario and the uncertainty in the perception system, which could potentially lead to collisions with the environment, the handling of interaction forces is necessary. Remarkably, this was achieved using the same HQP framework. This feature is further leveraged to enable semi-autonomous operations, allowing a human operator to assist the robotic counterpart in completing harvesting tasks. Finally, the obtained results are validated through extensive testing conducted first in a laboratory environment to prove individual functionalities, then in a real vineyard, encompassing both autonomous and semi-autonomous grape harvesting operations.</description>

      <title>PAC Bench: Do Foundation Models Understand Prerequisites for Executing Manipulation Policies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot manipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and failure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications often assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a capability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions reliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material, weight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical constraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being closed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue that off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded understanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of core Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability perspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations, comprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1 to 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios, and 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.
  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to grasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their suitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for targeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for rigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of more robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.

      <title>Validation of AI-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation in a Cyber-Physical Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safe and realistic interactions between automated driving systems and vulnerable road users (VRUs) in urban environments requires advanced testing methodologies. This paper presents a test environment that combines a Vehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the feasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and vehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian localization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach through a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations of VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a commercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is generated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and projected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation technique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle perception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP domains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in movement trajectories and joint estimation stability. The validation includes dynamic test scenarios where human avatars, both walking and cycling, are monitored under controlled conditions. Our results show a strong alignment in HPE between RW and CP test conditions for stable motion patterns, while notable inaccuracies persist under dynamic movements and occlusions, particularly for complex cyclist postures. These findings contribute to refining CP testing approaches for evaluating next-generation AI-based vehicle perception and to enhancing interaction models of automated vehicles and VRUs in CP environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel musculoskeletal model of a dog, procedurally generated from accurate 3D muscle meshes. Accompanying this model is a motion capture-based locomotion task compatible with a variety of control algorithms, as well as an improved muscle dynamics model designed to enhance convergence in differentiable control frameworks. We validate our approach by comparing simulated muscle activation patterns with experimentally obtained electromyography (EMG) data from previous canine locomotion studies. This work aims to bridge gaps between biomechanics, robotics, and computational neuroscience, offering a robust platform for researchers investigating muscle actuation and neuromuscular control.We plan to release the full model along with the retargeted motion capture clips to facilitate further research and development.</description>

      <title>Multi-Timescale Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Unified Behavior and Control of Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD) and shows clear advantages. However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore, we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action consistency and safety.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Predictive Planning and Control for Aerial 3D Inspection with Back-face Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated inspection with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) is a transformative capability set to revolutionize various application domains. However, this task is inherently complex, as it demands the seamless integration of perception, planning, and control which existing approaches often treat separately. Moreover, it requires accurate long-horizon planning to predict action sequences, in contrast to many current techniques, which tend to be myopic. To overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D inspection approach that unifies perception, planning, and control within a single data-driven predictive control framework. Unlike traditional methods that rely on known UAS dynamic models, our approach requires only input-output data, making it easily applicable to off-the-shelf black-box UASs. Our method incorporates back-face elimination, a visibility determination technique from 3D computer graphics, directly into the control loop, thereby enabling the online generation of accurate, long-horizon 3D inspection trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving data efficiency and generalization in robotic manipulation remains a core challenge. We propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained multimodal image-generation model as a world model to guide policy learning. By exploiting its rich visual-semantic representations and strong generalization across diverse scenes, the model generates open-ended future state predictions that inform downstream manipulation. Coupled with zero-shot low-level control modules, our approach enables general-purpose robotic manipulation without task-specific training. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that our method achieves effective performance across a wide range of manipulation tasks with no additional data collection or fine-tuning.

      <title>Adapt Your Body: Mitigating Proprioception Shifts in Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment. To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed to address distributional shifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safe trajectory planning of intelligent and connected vehicles is a key component in autonomous driving technology. Modeling the environment risk information by field is a promising and effective approach for safe trajectory planning. However, existing risk assessment theories only analyze the risk by current information, ignoring future prediction. This paper proposes a predictive risk analysis and safe trajectory planning framework for intelligent and connected vehicles. This framework first predicts future trajectories of objects by a local risk-aware algorithm, following with a spatiotemporal-discretised predictive risk analysis using the prediction results. Then the safe trajectory is generated based on the predictive risk analysis. Finally, simulation and vehicle experiments confirm the efficacy and real-time practicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Exploring Accelerated Skill Acquisition via Tandem Training for Colonoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New endoscopists require a large volume of expert-proctored colonoscopies to attain minimal competency. Developing multi-fingered, synchronized control of a colonoscope requires significant time and exposure to the device. Current training methods inhibit this development by relying on tool hand-off for expert demonstrations. There is a need for colonoscopy training tools that enable in-hand expert guidance in real-time. We present a new concept of a tandem training system that uses a telemanipulated preceptor colonoscope to guide novice users as they perform a colonoscopy. This system is capable of dual-control and can automatically toggle between expert and novice control of a standard colonoscope's angulation control wheels. Preliminary results from a user study with novice and expert users show the effectiveness of this device as a skill acquisition tool. We believe that this device has the potential to accelerate skill acquisition for colonoscopy and, in the future, enable individualized instruction and responsive teaching through bidirectional actuation.</description>

Abstract: Spiders use their webs as multifunctional tools that enable capturing and localizing prey and more general environmental sensing through vibrations. Inspired by their biological function, we present a spider web-inspired optical waveguide system for resilient impulse detection and localization. The structure consists of six clear thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) waveguides arranged radially and interconnected by a spiral TPU thread, mimicking orb spider webs. Light transmission losses, induced by vibrations, are measured via coupled LEDs and photo-diodes, allowing real-time detection. We systematically characterize individual waveguides, analyzing key parameters such as tension, impulse position, and break angle to optimize vibrational response. The complete system is validated through controlled experiments, revealing a 5 ms propagation delay in vibration transfer between adjacent radii, enhancing localization capabilities. We demonstrate a robust impulse detection and localization algorithm leveraging time delay analysis, achieving reliable event identification even in cases of sensor failure. This study highlights the potential of bioinspired optical waveguide structures for adaptive sensing, with applications in soft robotics, structural monitoring, and environmental sensing.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Human-Like Planning via LLMs</title>

Abstract: Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication, drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve satisfactory performance.</description>

      <title>RoboPearls: Editable Video Simulation for Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges, we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.</description>

      <title>Single-Frame Point-Pixel Registration via Supervised Cross-Modal Feature Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception. A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings. Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically, these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability. Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g. MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability, we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds), despite using only single-frame LiDAR.</description>

      <title>SoMi-ToM: Evaluating Multi-Perspective Theory of Mind in Embodied Social Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions. However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi, covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.</description>

      <title>RoboScape: Physics-informed Embodied World Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence, serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances 3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy training with generated data and policy evaluation. Our work provides new insights for building efficient physics-informed world models to advance embodied intelligence research.

      <title>Towards foundational LiDAR world models with efficient latent flow matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor generalization, (ii) sparse-beam \&amp; dense-beam adaptation, and (iii) non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data, our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11% absolute improvement (83\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models, mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching (CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).</description>

      <title>StyleDrive: Towards Driving-Style Aware Benchmarking of End-To-End Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics. To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems, catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.</description>

      <title>STCLocker: Deadlock Avoidance Testing for Autonomous Driving Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is essential to ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) before deployment. However, existing techniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV settings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes crucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding deadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a circular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures. Despite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks remains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first dedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique, STCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs controlled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker consists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable black-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a given scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation collaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial conflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive behaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby increasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We evaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA, a module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results show that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing baseline.</description>

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLM) has paved the way for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms, which integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and control within a single policy. Researchers in autonomous driving are actively adapting these methods to the vehicle domain. Such models promise autonomous vehicles that can interpret high-level instructions, reason about complex traffic scenes, and make their own decisions. However, the literature remains fragmented and is rapidly expanding. This survey offers the first comprehensive overview of VLA for Autonomous Driving (VLA4AD). We (i) formalize the architectural building blocks shared across recent work, (ii) trace the evolution from early explainer to reasoning-centric VLA models, and (iii) compare over 20 representative models according to VLA's progress in the autonomous driving domain. We also consolidate existing datasets and benchmarks, highlighting protocols that jointly measure driving safety, accuracy, and explanation quality. Finally, we detail open challenges - robustness, real-time efficiency, and formal verification - and outline future directions of VLA4AD. This survey provides a concise yet complete reference for advancing interpretable socially aligned autonomous vehicles.

      <title>Planning under Uncertainty to Goal Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.04782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goals for planning problems are typically conceived of as subsets of the state space. However, for many practical planning problems in robotics, we expect the robot to predict goals, e.g. from noisy sensors or by generalizing learned models to novel contexts. In these cases, sets with uncertainty naturally extend to probability distributions. While a few works have used probability distributions as goals for planning, surprisingly no systematic treatment of planning to goal distributions exists in the literature. This article serves to fill that gap. We argue that goal distributions are a more appropriate goal representation than deterministic sets for many robotics applications. We present a novel approach to planning under uncertainty to goal distributions, which we use to highlight several advantages of the goal distribution formulation. We build on previous results in the literature by formally framing our approach as an instance of planning as inference. We additionally derive reductions of several common planning objectives as special cases of our probabilistic planning framework. Our experiments demonstrate the flexibility of probability distributions as a goal representation on a variety of problems including planar navigation among obstacles, intercepting a moving target, rolling a ball to a target location, and a 7-DOF robot arm reaching to grasp an object.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling-based path planning algorithms play an important role in autonomous robotics. However, a common problem among the RRT-based algorithms is that the initial path generated is not optimal, and the convergence is too slow for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel image-based learning algorithm using a Convolutional Block Attention Generative Adversarial Network (CBAGAN-RRT) with a combination of spatial and channel attention and a novel loss function to design the heuristics, find a better optimal path, and improve the convergence of the algorithm, both concerning time and speed. The probability distribution of the paths generated from our GAN model is used to guide the sampling process for the RRT algorithm. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art algorithms using both the image quality generation metrics, like IOU Score, Dice Score, FID score, and path planning metrics like time cost and the number of nodes. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of various components in our network architecture. The advantage of our approach is that we can avoid the complicated preprocessing in the state space, our model can be generalized to complex environments like those containing turns and narrow passages without loss of accuracy, and our model can be easily integrated with other sampling-based path planning algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Safe landing is essential in robotics applications, from industrial settings to space exploration. As artificial intelligence advances, we have developed PEACE (Prompt Engineering Automation for CLIPSeg Enhancement), a system that automatically generates and refines prompts for identifying landing zones in changing environments. Traditional approaches using fixed prompts for open-vocabulary models struggle with environmental changes and can lead to dangerous outcomes when conditions are not represented in the predefined prompts. PEACE addresses this limitation by dynamically adapting to shifting data distributions. Our key innovation is the dual segmentation of safe and unsafe landing zones, allowing the system to refine the results by removing unsafe areas from potential landing sites. Using only monocular cameras and image segmentation, PEACE can safely guide descent operations from 100 meters to altitudes as low as 20 meters. The testing shows that PEACE significantly outperforms the standard CLIP and CLIPSeg prompting methods, improving the successful identification of safe landing zones from 57% to 92%. We have also demonstrated enhanced performance when replacing CLIPSeg with FastSAM. The complete source code is available as an open-source software.</description>

Abstract: A key component of any robot is the interface between robotics middleware software and physical motors. New robots often use arbitrary, messy mixtures of closed and open motor drivers and error-prone physical mountings, wiring, and connectors to interface them. There is a need for a standardizing OSH component to abstract this complexity, as Arduino did for interfacing to smaller components. We present a OSH printed circuit board to solve this problem once and for all. On the high-level side, it interfaces to Arduino Giga - acting as an unusually large and robust shield - and thus to existing open source software stacks. A ROS2 interface is provided. On the lower-level side, it interfaces to existing emerging standard open hardware including OSH motor drivers and relays, which can already be used to drive fully open hardware wheeled and arm robots. This enables the creation of a family of standardized, fully open hardware, fully reproducible, research platforms.</description>

      <title>Ego-Foresight: Self-supervised Learning of Agent-Aware Representations for Improved RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) observed in the last decade, the amount of training experience necessary to learn effective policies remains one of the primary concerns both in simulated and real environments. Looking to solve this issue, previous work has shown that improved training efficiency can be achieved by separately modeling agent and environment, but usually requiring a supervisory agent mask.
  In contrast to RL, humans can perfect a new skill from a small number of trials and in most cases do so without a supervisory signal, making neuroscientific studies of human development a valuable source of inspiration for RL. In particular, we explore the idea of motor prediction, which states that humans develop an internal model of themselves and of the consequences that their motor commands have on the immediate sensory inputs. Our insight is that the movement of the agent provides a cue that allows the duality between agent and environment to be learned.
  To instantiate this idea, we present Ego-Foresight, a self-supervised method for disentangling agent and environment based on motion and prediction. Our main finding is self-supervised agent-awareness by visuomotor prediction of the agent improves sample-efficiency and performance of the underlying RL algorithm.
  To test our approach, we first study its ability to visually predict agent movement irrespective of the environment, in simulated and real-world robotic data. Then, we integrate Ego-Foresight with a model-free RL algorithm to solve simulated robotic tasks, showing that self-supervised agent-awareness can improve sample-efficiency and performance in RL.</description>

      <title>SSFold: Learning to Fold Arbitrary Crumpled Cloth Using Graph Dynamics from Human Demonstration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic cloth manipulation faces challenges due to the fabric's complex dynamics and the high dimensionality of configuration spaces. Previous methods have largely focused on isolated smoothing or folding tasks and overly reliant on simulations, often failing to bridge the significant sim-to-real gap in deformable object manipulation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a two-stream architecture with sequential and spatial pathways, unifying smoothing and folding tasks into a single adaptable policy model that accommodates various cloth types and states. The sequential stream determines the pick and place positions for the cloth, while the spatial stream, using a connectivity dynamics model, constructs a visibility graph from partial point cloud data of the self-occluded cloth, allowing the robot to infer the cloth's full configuration from incomplete observations. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, we utilize a hand tracking detection algorithm to gather and integrate human demonstration data into our novel end-to-end neural network, improving real-world adaptability. Our method, validated on a UR5 robot across four distinct cloth folding tasks with different goal shapes, consistently achieves folded states from arbitrary crumpled initial configurations, with success rates of 99\%, 99\%, 83\%, and 67\%. It outperforms existing state-of-the-art cloth manipulation techniques and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen cloth with diverse colors, shapes, and stiffness in real-world experiments.Videos and source code are available at: https://zcswdt.github.io/SSFold/</description>

      <title>AsymDex: Asymmetry and Relative Coordinates for RL-based Bimanual Dexterity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Asymmetric Dexterity (AsymDex), a novel and simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework that can efficiently learn a large class of bimanual skills in multi-fingered hands without relying on demonstrations. Two crucial insights enable AsymDex to reduce the observation and action space dimensions and improve sample efficiency. First, true ambidexterity is rare in humans and most of us exhibit strong "handedness". Inspired by this observation, we assign complementary roles to each hand: the facilitating hand repositions and reorients one object, while the dominant hand performs complex manipulations to achieve the desired result (e.g., opening a bottle cap, or pouring liquids). Second, controlling the relative motion between the hands is crucial for coordination and synchronization of the two hands. As such, we design relative observation and action spaces and leverage a relative-pose tracking controller. Further, we propose a two-phase decomposition in which AsymDex can be readily integrated with recent advances in grasp learning to facilitate both the acquisition and manipulation of objects using two hands. Unlike existing RL-based methods for bimanual dexterity with multi-fingered hands, which are either sample inefficient or tailored to a specific task, AsymDex can efficiently learn a wide variety of bimanual skills that exhibit asymmetry. Detailed experiments on seven asymmetric bimanual dexterous manipulation tasks (four simulated and three real-world) reveal that AsymDex consistently outperforms strong baselines that challenge our design choices.

      <title>Simultaneous Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Projected Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models hold significant potential in robotics, enabling the generation of diverse and smooth trajectories directly from raw representations of the environment. Despite this promise, applying diffusion models to motion planning remains challenging due to their difficulty in enforcing critical constraints, such as collision avoidance and kinematic feasibility. These limitations become even more pronounced in Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), where multiple robots must coordinate in shared spaces. To address these challenges, this work proposes Simultaneous MRMP Diffusion (SMD), a novel approach integrating constrained optimization into the diffusion sampling process to produce collision-free, kinematically feasible trajectories. Additionally, the paper introduces a comprehensive MRMP benchmark to evaluate trajectory planning algorithms across scenarios with varying robot densities, obstacle complexities, and motion constraints. Experimental results show SMD consistently outperforms classical and other learning-based motion planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in complex multi-robot environments.</description>

      <title>BFA: Best-Feature-Aware Fusion for Multi-View Fine-grained Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, multi-view cameras are typically employed for fine-grained manipulation tasks. Existing approaches (e.g., ACT) tend to treat multi-view features equally and directly concatenate them for policy learning. However, it will introduce redundant visual information and bring higher computational costs, leading to ineffective manipulation. For a fine-grained manipulation task, it tends to involve multiple stages while the most contributed view for different stages is varied over time. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play best-feature-aware (BFA) fusion strategy for multi-view manipulation tasks, which is adaptable to various policies. Built upon the visual backbone of the policy network, we design a lightweight network to predict the importance score of each view. Based on the predicted importance scores, the reweighted multi-view features are subsequently fused and input into the end-to-end policy network, enabling seamless integration. Notably, our method demonstrates outstanding performance in fine-grained manipulations. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms multiple baselines by 22-46% success rate on different tasks. Our work provides new insights and inspiration for tackling key challenges in fine-grained manipulations.</description>

      <title>MapNav: A Novel Memory Representation via Annotated Semantic Maps for VLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a key task in Embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate diverse and unseen environments while following natural language instructions. Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets for Multi-Robot Motion Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) problem of computing collision-free trajectories for multiple robots in shared continuous environments. While existing frameworks effectively decompose MRMP into single-robot subproblems, spatiotemporal motion planning with dynamic obstacles remains challenging, particularly in cluttered or narrow-corridor settings. We propose Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS), a novel planner that systematically covers the collision-free space-time domain with convex sets instead of relying on random sampling. By extending Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) into the time dimension, ST-GCS formulates time-optimal trajectories in a unified convex optimization that naturally accommodates velocity bounds and flexible arrival times. We also propose Exact Convex Decomposition (ECD) to "reserve" trajectories as spatiotemporal obstacles, maintaining a collision-free space-time graph of convex sets for subsequent planning. Integrated into two prioritized-planning frameworks, ST-GCS consistently achieves higher success rates and better solution quality than state-of-the-art sampling-based planners -- often at orders-of-magnitude faster runtimes -- underscoring its benefits for MRMP in challenging settings.</description>

      <title>GRaD-Nav: Efficiently Learning Visual Drone Navigation with Gaussian Radiance Fields and Differentiable Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous visual navigation is an essential element in robot autonomy. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising policy training paradigm. However existing RL methods suffer from high sample complexity, poor sim-to-real transfer, and limited runtime adaptability to navigation scenarios not seen during training. These problems are particularly challenging for drones, with complex nonlinear and unstable dynamics, and strong dynamic coupling between control and perception. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with differentiable deep reinforcement learning (DDRL) to train vision-based drone navigation policies. By leveraging high-fidelity 3D scene representations and differentiable simulation, our method improves sample efficiency and sim-to-real transfer. Additionally, we incorporate a Context-aided Estimator Network (CENet) to adapt to environmental variations at runtime. Moreover, by curriculum training in a mixture of different surrounding environments, we achieve in-task generalization, the ability to solve new instances of a task not seen during training. Drone hardware experiments demonstrate our method's high training efficiency compared to state-of-the-art RL methods, zero shot sim-to-real transfer for real robot deployment without fine tuning, and ability to adapt to new instances within the same task class (e.g. to fly through a gate at different locations with different distractors in the environment).

      <description>arXiv:2503.08858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To navigate crowds without collisions, robots must interact with humans by forecasting their future motion and reacting accordingly. While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</description>

      <title>Bimanual Regrasp Planning and Control for Active Reduction of Object Pose Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22240v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precisely grasping an object is a challenging task due to pose uncertainties. Conventional methods have used cameras and fixtures to reduce object uncertainty. They are effective but require intensive preparation, such as designing jigs based on the object geometry and calibrating cameras with high-precision tools fabricated using lasers. In this study, we propose a method to reduce the uncertainty of the position and orientation of a grasped object without using a fixture or a camera. Our method is based on the concept that the flat finger pads of a parallel gripper can reduce uncertainty along its opening/closing direction through flat surface contact. Three orthogonal grasps by parallel grippers with flat finger pads collectively constrain an object's position and orientation to a unique state. Guided by the concepts, we develop a regrasp planning and admittance control approach that sequentially finds and leverages three orthogonal grasps of two robotic arms to actively reduce uncertainties in the object pose. We evaluated the proposed method on different initial object uncertainties and verified that it had good repeatability. The deviation levels of the experimental trials were on the same order of magnitude as those of an optical tracking system, demonstrating strong relative inference performance.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in visual domains such as image and video generation. They have also recently emerged as a promising approach in robotics, especially in robot manipulations. Diffusion models leverage a probabilistic framework, and they stand out with their ability to model multi-modal distributions and their robustness to high-dimensional input and output spaces. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art diffusion models in robotic manipulation, including grasp learning, trajectory planning, and data augmentation. Diffusion models for scene and image augmentation lie at the intersection of robotics and computer vision for vision-based tasks to enhance generalizability and data scarcity. This paper also presents the two main frameworks of diffusion models and their integration with imitation learning and reinforcement learning. In addition, it discusses the common architectures and benchmarks and points out the challenges and advantages of current state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.</description>

      <title>Region Based SLAM-Aware Exploration: Efficient and Robust Autonomous Mapping Strategy That Can Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous exploration for mapping unknown large scale environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, with efficiency in time, stability against map corruption and computational resources being crucial. This paper presents a novel approach to indoor exploration that addresses these key issues in existing methods. We introduce a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)-aware region-based exploration strategy that partitions the environment into discrete regions, allowing the robot to incrementally explore and stabilize each region before moving to the next one. This approach significantly reduces redundant exploration and improves overall efficiency. As the device finishes exploring a region and stabilizes it, we also perform SLAM keyframe marginalization, a technique which reduces problem complexity by eliminating variables, while preserving their essential information. To improves robustness and further enhance efficiency, we develop a checkpoint system that enables the robot to resume exploration from the last stable region in case of failures, eliminating the need for complete re-exploration. Our method, tested in real homes, office and simulations, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The improvements demonstrate substantial enhancements in various real world environments, with significant reductions in keyframe usage (85%), submap usage (50% office, 32% home), pose graph optimization time (78-80%), and exploration duration (10-15%). This region-based strategy with keyframe marginalization offers an efficient solution for autonomous robotic mapping.</description>

      <title>Low-Cost Infrared Vision Systems for Improved Safety of Emergency Vehicle Operations Under Low-Visibility Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of infrared (IR) camera technology to enhance driver safety for emergency vehicles operating in low-visibility conditions, particularly at night and in dense fog. Such environments significantly increase the risk of collisions, especially for tow trucks and snowplows that must remain operational in challenging conditions. Conventional driver assistance systems often struggle under these conditions due to limited visibility. In contrast, IR cameras, which detect the thermal signatures of obstacles, offer a promising alternative. The evaluation combines controlled laboratory experiments, real-world field tests, and surveys of emergency vehicle operators. In addition to assessing detection performance, the study examines the feasibility of retrofitting existing Department of Transportation (DoT) fleets with cost-effective IR-based driver assistance systems. Results underscore the utility of IR technology in enhancing driver awareness and provide data-driven recommendations for scalable deployment across legacy emergency vehicle fleets.</description>

      <title>Multi Layered Autonomy and AI Ecologies in Robotic Art Installations</title>

Abstract: This paper presents Symbiosis of Agents, is a large-scale installation by Baoyang Chen (baoyangchen.com), that embeds AI-driven robots in an immersive, mirror-lined arena, probing the tension between machine agency and artistic authorship. Drawing on early cybernetics, rule-based conceptual art, and seminal robotic works, it orchestrates fluid exchanges among robotic arms, quadruped machines, their environment, and the public. A three tier faith system pilots the ecology: micro-level adaptive tactics, meso-level narrative drives, and a macro-level prime directive. This hierarchy lets behaviors evolve organically in response to environmental cues and even a viewer's breath, turning spectators into co-authors of the unfolding drama. Framed by a speculative terraforming scenario that recalls the historical exploitation of marginalized labor, the piece asks who bears responsibility in AI-mediated futures. Choreographed motion, AI-generated scripts, reactive lighting, and drifting fog cast the robots as collaborators rather than tools, forging a living, emergent artwork. Exhibited internationally, Symbiosis of Agents shows how cybernetic feedback, robotic experimentation, and conceptual rule-making can converge to redefine agency, authorship, and ethics in contemporary art.</description>

      <title>ReactEMG: Zero-Shot, Low-Latency Intent Detection via sEMG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals show promise for effective human-computer interfaces, particularly in rehabilitation and prosthetics. However, challenges remain in developing systems that respond quickly and reliably to user intent, across different subjects and without requiring time-consuming calibration. In this work, we propose a framework for EMG-based intent detection that addresses these challenges. Unlike traditional gesture recognition models that wait until a gesture is completed before classifying it, our approach uses a segmentation strategy to assign intent labels at every timestep as the gesture unfolds. We introduce a novel masked modeling strategy that aligns muscle activations with their corresponding user intents, enabling rapid onset detection and stable tracking of ongoing gestures. In evaluations against baseline methods, considering both accuracy and stability for device control, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot transfer conditions, demonstrating its potential for wearable robotics and next-generation prosthetic systems.

      <title>Skill-Nav: Enhanced Navigation with Versatile Quadrupedal Locomotion via Waypoint Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated exceptional locomotion capabilities through Reinforcement Learning (RL), including extreme parkour maneuvers. However, integrating locomotion skills with navigation in quadrupedal robots has not been fully investigated, which holds promise for enhancing long-distance movement capabilities. In this paper, we propose Skill-Nav, a method that incorporates quadrupedal locomotion skills into a hierarchical navigation framework using waypoints as an interface. Specifically, we train a waypoint-guided locomotion policy using deep RL, enabling the robot to autonomously adjust its locomotion skills to reach targeted positions while avoiding obstacles. Compared with direct velocity commands, waypoints offer a simpler yet more flexible interface for high-level planning and low-level control. Utilizing waypoints as the interface allows for the application of various general planning tools, such as large language models (LLMs) and path planning algorithms, to guide our locomotion policy in traversing terrains with diverse obstacles. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate that Skill-Nav can effectively traverse complex terrains and complete challenging navigation tasks.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Object Detection using Depth and Image Data for Manufacturing Parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manufacturing requires reliable object detection methods for precise picking and handling of diverse types of manufacturing parts and components. Traditional object detection methods utilize either only 2D images from cameras or 3D data from lidars or similar 3D sensors. However, each of these sensors have weaknesses and limitations. Cameras do not have depth perception and 3D sensors typically do not carry color information. These weaknesses can undermine the reliability and robustness of industrial manufacturing systems. To address these challenges, this work proposes a multi-sensor system combining an red-green-blue (RGB) camera and a 3D point cloud sensor. The two sensors are calibrated for precise alignment of the multimodal data captured from the two hardware devices. A novel multimodal object detection method is developed to process both RGB and depth data. This object detector is based on the Faster R-CNN baseline that was originally designed to process only camera images. The results show that the multimodal model significantly outperforms the depth-only and RGB-only baselines on established object detection metrics. More specifically, the multimodal model improves mAP by 13% and raises Mean Precision by 11.8% in comparison to the RGB-only baseline. Compared to the depth-only baseline, it improves mAP by 78% and raises Mean Precision by 57%. Hence, this method facilitates more reliable and robust object detection in service to smart manufacturing applications.</description>

      <title>Can Robots "Taste" Grapes? Estimating SSC with Simple RGB Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In table grape cultivation, harvesting depends on accurately assessing fruit quality. While some characteristics, like color, are visible, others, such as Soluble Solid Content (SSC), or sugar content measured in degrees Brix ({\deg}Brix), require specific tools. SSC is a key quality factor that correlates with ripeness, but lacks a direct causal relationship with color. Hyperspectral cameras can estimate SSC with high accuracy under controlled laboratory conditions, but their practicality in field environments is limited. This study investigates the potential of simple RGB sensors under uncontrolled lighting to estimate SSC and color, enabling cost-effective, robot-assisted harvesting. Over the 2021 and 2022 summer seasons, we collected grape images with corresponding SSC and color labels to evaluate algorithmic solutions for SSC estimation, specifically testing for cross-seasonal and cross-device robustness. We propose two approaches: a computationally efficient histogram-based method for resource-constrained robots and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for more complex applications. Our results demonstrate high performance, with the DNN model achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as low as $1.05$ {\deg}Brix on a challenging cross-device test set. The lightweight histogram-based method also proved effective, reaching an MAE of $1.46$ {\deg}Brix. These results are highly competitive with those from hyperspectral systems, which report errors in the $1.27$--$2.20$ {\deg}Brix range in similar field applications.</description>

      <title>Environment-Driven Online LiDAR-Camera Extrinsic Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration (LCEC) is crucial for multi-modal data fusion in mechatronics. Existing methods, whether target-based or target-free, typically rely on customized calibration targets or fixed scene types, limiting their practicality in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we introduce EdO-LCEC, the first environment-driven online calibration approach. Unlike traditional target-free methods, EdO-LCEC observes the feature density of the application environment through a generalizable scene discriminator. Based on this feature density, EdO-LCEC extracts LiDAR intensity and depth features from varying perspectives to achieve higher calibration accuracy. To overcome the challenges of cross-modal feature matching between LiDAR and camera, we propose dual-path correspondence matching (DPCM), which leverages both structural and textural consistency for reliable 3D-2D correspondences. Additionally, our approach models the calibration process as a joint optimization problem utilizing global constraints from multiple views and scenes to enhance accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that EdO-LCEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in sparse or partially overlapping sensor views.</description>

      <title>A Robot-Led Intervention for Emotion Regulation: From Expression to Reappraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotion regulation is a crucial skill for managing emotions in everyday life, yet finding a constructive and accessible method to support these processes remains challenging due to their cognitive demands. In this study, we explore how regular interactions with a social robot, conducted in a structured yet familiar environment within university halls and departments, can provide effective support for emotion regulation through cognitive reappraisal. Twenty-one students participated in a five-session study at a university hall or department, where the robot, powered by a large language model (GPT-3.5), facilitated structured conversations, encouraging the students to reinterpret emotionally charged situations they shared with the robot. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate significant improvements in emotion self-regulation, with participants reporting better understanding and control of their emotions. The intervention led to significant changes in constructive emotion regulation tendencies and positive effects on mood and sentiment after each session. The findings also demonstrate that repeated interactions with the robot encouraged greater emotional expressiveness, including longer speech disclosures, increased use of affective language, and heightened facial arousal. Notably, expressiveness followed structured patterns aligned with the reappraisal process, with expression peaking during key reappraisal moments, particularly when participants were prompted to reinterpret negative experiences. The qualitative feedback further highlighted how the robot fostered introspection and provided a supportive space for discussing emotions, enabling participants to confront long-avoided emotional challenges. These findings demonstrate the potential of robots to effectively assist in emotion regulation in familiar environments, offering both emotional support and cognitive guidance.</description>

      <title>Mesh-Learner: Texturing Mesh with Spherical Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e., texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each mesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render, which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast, unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM, which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping). To benefit the society, the code will be available at https://github.com/hku-mars/Mesh-Learner.</description>

      <title>WeatherEdit: Controllable Weather Editing with 4D Gaussian Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

      <description>arXiv:2506.09523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft robots manufactured with flexible materials can be highly compliant and adaptive to their surroundings, which facilitates their application in areas such as dexterous manipulation and environmental exploration. This paper aims at investigating the tracking control problem for soft robots under uncertainty such as unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance. First, we establish a novel switching function and design the compensated tracking error dynamics by virtue of the command filter. Then, based on the backstepping methodology, the virtual controllers and the adaptive logic estimating the supremum of uncertainty impacts are developed for synthesizing an event-triggered control strategy. In addition, the uniformed finite-time stability certification is derived for different scenarios of the switching function. Finally, we perform a case study of a soft robot to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Domain Modeling with Language Models: A Multi-Agent Approach to Task Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent, coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.</description>
