      <title>Moving to the suburbs? Exploring the potential impact of work-from-home on suburbanization in Poland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to assess the likelihood of office workers relocating to the suburbs due to work-from-home opportunities and the key factors influencing these preferences. Our study focuses on Poland, a country with different cultural individualism at work, which can impact work-from-home preferences and, indirectly, home relocation desires. Given the methodological limitations of official data on remote work practices in Poland, we conducted an original survey, gathering primary data from a nationally representative sample of office workers living in cities with populations exceeding 100,000. To investigate the factors shaping employees' preferences for suburban relocation driven by remote work, we utilized logistic regression to analyze the effects of socio-economic and employment characteristics, commuting experiences, and reported changes in work productivity. Our findings reveal that age, mode of commuting, perceived changes in work productivity, and sector ownership are significant determinants, strongly affecting home relocation preferences in response to work-from-home opportunities. These results align with previous research, typically based on data from countries with different cultural frameworks and more developed work-from-home practices.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Impact on Labor Market: Analyzing ChatGPT's Demand in Job Advertisements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative AI (Gen AI) technologies, particularly tools like ChatGPT, is significantly impacting the labor market by reshaping job roles and skill requirements. This study examines the demand for ChatGPT-related skills in the U.S. labor market by analyzing job advertisements collected from major job platforms between May and December 2023. Using text mining and topic modeling techniques, we extracted and analyzed the Gen AI-related skills that employers are hiring for. Our analysis identified five distinct ChatGPT-related skill sets: general familiarity, creative content generation, marketing, advanced functionalities (such as prompt engineering), and product development. In addition, the study provides insights into job attributes such as occupation titles, degree requirements, salary ranges, and other relevant job characteristics. These findings highlight the increasing integration of Gen AI across various industries, emphasizing the growing need for both foundational knowledge and advanced technical skills. The study offers valuable insights into the evolving demands of the labor market, as employers seek candidates equipped to leverage generative AI tools to improve productivity, streamline processes, and drive innovation.</description>

      <title>A Joint Energy and Differentially-Private Smart Meter Data Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the vital role that smart meter data could play in handling uncertainty in energy markets, data markets have been proposed as a means to enable increased data access. However, most extant literature considers energy markets and data markets separately, which ignores the interdependence between them. In addition, existing data market frameworks rely on a trusted entity to clear the market. This paper proposes a joint energy and data market focusing on the day-ahead retailer energy procurement problem with uncertain demand. The retailer can purchase differentially-private smart meter data from consumers to reduce uncertainty. The problem is modelled as an integrated forecasting and optimisation problem providing a means of valuing data directly rather than valuing forecasts or forecast accuracy. Value is determined by the Wasserstein distance, enabling privacy to be preserved during the valuation and procurement process. The value of joint energy and data clearing is highlighted through numerical case studies using both synthetic and real smart meter data.</description>

      <title>Modeling Migration-Induced Unemployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13319v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Immigration is often blamed for increasing unemployment among local workers. This sentiment is reflected in the rise of anti-immigration parties and policies in Western democracies. And in fact, numerous studies estimate that in the short run, the arrival of new workers in a labor market raises the unemployment rate of local workers. Yet, standard migration models, such as the Walrasian model and the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model, inherently assume that immigrants are absorbed into the labor market without affecting local unemployment. This paper presents a more general model of migration that allows for the possibility that not only the wages but also the unemployment rate of local workers may be affected by the arrival of newcomers. This extension is essential to capture the full range of potential impacts of labor migration on labor markets. The model blends a matching framework with job rationing. In it, the arrival of new workers raises the unemployment rate among local workers, particularly in a depressed labor market where job opportunities are limited. On the positive side, in-migration helps firms fill vacancies more easily, boosting their profits. The overall impact of in-migration on local welfare varies with labor market conditions: in-migration reduces welfare when the labor market is inefficiently slack, but it enhances welfare when the labor market is inefficiently tight.</description>

      <title>Policy consequences of the new neuroeconomic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current theories of decision making suggest that the neural circuits in mammalian brains (including humans) computationally combine representations of the past (memory), present (perception), and future (agentic goals) to take actions that achieve the needs of the agent. How information is represented within those neural circuits changes what computations are available to that system which changes how agents interact with their world to take those actions. We argue that the computational neuroscience of decision making provides a new microeconomic framework (neuroeconomics) that offers new opportunities to construct policies that interact with those decision-making systems to improve outcomes. After laying out the computational processes underlying decision making in mammalian brains, we present four applications of this logic with policy consequences: (1) precommitment to avoid falling into the trap of sunk costs, (2) media consequences for changes in housing prices after a disaster, (3) contingency management as a treatment for addiction, and (4) how social interactions underlie the success (and failure) of microfinance institutions.</description>

      <title>High-frequency and heteroskedasticity identification in multicountry models: Revisiting spillovers of monetary shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.03158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the international transmission of monetary policy and central bank information shocks originating from the United States and the euro area. Employing a panel vector autoregression, we use macroeconomic and financial variables across several major economies to address both static and dynamic spillovers. To identify structural shocks, we introduce a novel approach that combines external instruments with heteroskedasticity-based identification and sign restrictions. Our results suggest significant spillovers from European Central Bank and Federal Reserve policies to each other's economies, global aggregates, and other countries. These effects are more pronounced for central bank information shocks than for pure monetary policy shocks, and the dominance of the US in the global economy is reflected in our findings.</description>
