      <title>Leveraging Time-Series Foundation Model for Subsurface Well Logs Prediction and Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise in energy demand highlights the importance of suitable subsurface storage, requiring detailed and accurate subsurface characterization often reliant on high-quality borehole well log data. However, obtaining complete well-log data is costly and time-consuming, with missing data being common due to borehole conditions or tool errors. While machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented to address these issues, they often fail to capture the intricate, nonlinear relationships and long-term dependencies in complex well log sequences. Additionally, prior AI-driven models typically require retraining when introduced to new datasets and are constrained to deployment in the same basin.
  In this study, we explored and evaluated the potential of a time-series foundation model leveraging transformer architecture and a generative pre-trained approach for predicting and detecting anomalies in borehole well log data. Specifically, we fine-tuned and adopted the TimeGPT architecture to forecast key log responses and detect anomalies with high accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving R2 of up to 87% and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as low as 1.95%. Additionally, the model's zero-shot capability successfully identified subtle yet critical anomalies, such as drilling hazards or unexpected geological formations, with an overall accuracy of 93%.
  The model represents a significant advancement in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling zero-shot inference through fine-tuning. Its application in well-log prediction enhances operational decision-making while reducing risks associated with subsurface exploration. These findings demonstrate the model's potential to transform well-log data analysis, particularly in complex geological settings.</description>

      <title>Multifidelity Uncertainty Quantification for Ice Sheet Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice sheet simulations suffer from vast parametric uncertainties, such as the basal sliding boundary condition or geothermal heat flux. Quantifying the resulting uncertainties in predictions is of utmost importance to support judicious decision-making, but high-fidelity simulations are too expensive to embed within uncertainty quantification (UQ) computations. UQ methods typically employ Monte Carlo simulation to estimate statistics of interest, which requires hundreds (or more) of ice sheet simulations. Cheaper low-fidelity models are readily available (e.g., approximated physics, coarser meshes), but replacing the high-fidelity model with a lower fidelity surrogate introduces bias, which means that UQ results generated with a low-fidelity model cannot be rigorously trusted. Multifidelity UQ retains the high-fidelity model but expands the estimator to shift computations to low-fidelity models, while still guaranteeing an unbiased estimate. Through this exploitation of multiple models, multifidelity estimators guarantee a target accuracy at reduced computational cost. This paper presents a comprehensive multifidelity UQ framework for ice sheet simulations. We present three multifidelity UQ approaches -- Multifidelity Monte Carlo, Multilevel Monte Carlo, and the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator -- that enable tractable UQ for continental-scale ice sheet simulations. We demonstrate the techniques on a model of the Greenland ice sheet to estimate the 2015-2050 ice mass loss, verify their estimates through comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, and give a comparative performance analysis. For a target accuracy equivalent to 1 mm sea level rise contribution at 95% confidence, the multifidelity estimators achieve computational speedups of two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Microstructural evolution of Carrara marble during semi-brittle deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fifteen marble samples were subjected to semi-brittle deformation through triaxial compression experiments, reaching axial strains of 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 4.0%, or 7.5% at temperatures of 20C, 200C, or 350C, under a confining pressure of 400 MPa. Deformation twins, lattice curvature, and intragranular microfractures in the samples were quantitatively characterised using forescattered electron images and electron backscatter diffraction. Microstructural analyses revealed that twins accommodate most of the shortening during the first 2% strain, whereas lattice curvature associated with geometrically necessary dislocations predominantly develops in the later stages. Intragranular fracture intensity exhibits an almost linear correlation with strain during the first 2% strain but increases more slowly thereafter. The mechanical data indicate a strong temperature dependence of yield stress, consistent with the temperature dependence of the critical resolved shear stress for dislocation glide. The subsequent strain hardening is likely caused by progressively increasing intensity of interactions among dislocations and between dislocations and twin boundaries. Based on the microstructural data and interpreted hardening mechanisms, we propose a phenomenological model, with microstructural state variables, for semi-brittle deformation at our experimental conditions as a step towards development of a microphysical constitutive model of semi-brittle deformation.</description>

      <title>Scintillations in Southern Europe during the geomagnetic storm of June 2015: analysis of a plasma bubbles spill-over using ground-based data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers to ionospheric disturbances and their constant growth are nowadays resulting in an increased concern of GNSS-users about the impacts of ionospheric disturbances at mid-latitudes. The geomagnetic storm of June 2015 is an example of a rare phenomenon of a spill-over of equatorial plasma bubbles well North from their habitual. We study the occurrence of small- and medium-scale irregularities in the North Atlantic Eastern-Mediterranean mid- and low-latitudinal zone by analysing the behaviour of the amplitude scintillation index S4 and of the rate of total electron content index (ROTI) during such a storm. In addition, large scale perturbations of the ionospheric electron density were studied using ground and space-born instruments, thus characterizing a complex perturbation behaviour over the region mentioned above. The multi-source data allows us to characterize the impact of irregularities of different scales to better understand the ionospheric dynamics and stress the importance of a proper monitoring of the ionosphere in the studied region.</description>

      <title>Seismic Traveltime Inversion with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the application of quantum computing based quantum annealing to seismic traveltime inversion, a critical approach for inverting highly accurate velocity models. The seismic inversion problem is first converted into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, which the quantum annealer is specifically designed to solve. We then solve the problem via quantum annealing method. The inversion is applied on a synthetic velocity model, presenting a carbon storage scenario at depths of 1000-1300 meters. As an application example, we also show the capacity of quantum computing to handle complex, noisy data environments. This work highlights the emerging potential of quantum computing in geophysical applications, providing a foundation for future developments in high-precision seismic imaging.</description>

      <title>Mapping The Layers of The Ocean Floor With a Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mapping of ocean floor layers is a current challenge for the oil industry. Existing solution methods involve mapping through seismic methods and wave inversion, which are complex and computationally expensive. The introduction of artificial neural networks, specifically UNet, to predict velocity models based on seismic shots reflected from the ocean floor shows promise for optimising this process. In this study, two neural network architectures are validated for velocity model inversion and compared in terms of stability metrics such as loss function and similarity coefficient, as well as the differences between predicted and actual models. Indeed, neural networks prove promising as a solution to this challenge, achieving S{\o}rensen-Dice coefficient values above 70%.</description>

      <title>Python workflow for segmenting multiphase flow in porous rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray micro-computed tomography (X-ray micro-CT) is widely employed to investigate flow phenomena in porous media, providing a powerful alternative to core-scale experiments for estimating traditional petrophysical properties such as porosity, single-phase permeability or fluid connectivity. However, the segmentation process, critical for deriving these properties from greyscale images, varies significantly between studies due to the absence of a standardized workflow or any ground truth data. This introduces challenges in comparing results across different studies, especially for properties sensitive to segmentation. To address this, we present a fully open-source, automated workflow for the segmentation of a Bentheimer sandstone filled with nitrogen and brine. The workflow incorporates a traditional image processing pipeline, including non-local means filtering, image registration, watershed segmentation of grains, and a combination of differential imaging and thresholding for segmentation of the fluid phases. Our workflow enhances reproducibility by enabling other research groups to easily replicate and validate findings, fostering consistency in petrophysical property estimation. Moreover, its modular structure facilitates integration into modeling frameworks, allowing for forward-backward communication and parameter sensitivity analyses. We apply the workflow to exploring the sensitivity of the non-wetting phase volume, surface area, and connectivity to image processing. This adaptable tool paves the way for future advancements in X-ray micro-CT analysis of porous media.</description>
