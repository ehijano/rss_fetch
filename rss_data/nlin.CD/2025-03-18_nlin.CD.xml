      <title>Pairwise vs Higher-order interactions: Can we identify the interaction type in coupled oscillators from time series?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhythmic phenomena, which are ubiquitous in biological systems, are typically modelled as systems of coupled limit cycle oscillators. Recently, there has been an increased interest in understanding the impact of higher-order interactions on the population dynamics of coupled oscillators. Meanwhile, estimating a mathematical model from experimental data is a vital step in understanding the dynamics of real-world complex systems. In coupled oscillator systems, identifying the type of interaction (e.g. pairwise or three-body) of a network is challenging, because different interactions can induce similar dynamical states and bifurcations. In this study, we have developed a method based on the adaptive LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) to infer the interactions between the oscillators from time series data. The proposed method can successfully classify the type of interaction and infer the probabilities of the existence of pairwise and three-body couplings. Through systematic analysis of synthetic datasets, we have demonstrated that our method outperforms two baseline methods, LASSO and OLS (Ordinary Least Squares), in accurately inferring the topology and strength of couplings between oscillators. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to the synthetic data of 100 oscillators. These results imply that the proposed method is promising for identifying interactions from rhythmic activities in real-world systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13256v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regular logistic map was introduced in 1960s, served as an example of a complex system, and was used as an instrument to demonstrate and investigate the period doubling cascade of bifurcations scenario of transition to chaos. In this paper, we review various fractional generalizations of the logistic map and their applications.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and Intermittency in Coupled Dissipative Kicked Rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of complex dynamics in a system of coupled dissipative kicked rotors and show that critical transitions can be understood via bifurcations of simple states. We study multistability and bifurcations in the single rotor model, demonstrating how these give rise to a variety of coexisting spatial patterns in a coupled system. A combined order parameter is introduced to characterize different spatial patterns and to reveal the coexistence of chaotic and regular attractors. Finally, we illustrate an intermittent phenomenon near the onset of chaos.</description>

      <title>On the formation of the 1:2 resonance in oscillator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of nonlinear oscillators are investigated. We study the formation of $1:2$ resonance in nonlinear periodically forced oscillators due to period doubling of the primary $1:1$ resonance, or born independently. We compute the amplitude-frequency implicit function, the steady-state asymptotic solution, for the effective equation approximating coupled oscillators. Working in the framework of differential properties of implicit functions, we demonstrate that birth of $1:2$ resonances corresponds to singular isolated points of the implicit functions. We provide numerical examples illustrating our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Effect of oblique horizontal magnetic field on convection rolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of external horizontal magnetic field applied on the convection rolls obliquely (at an angle $\phi$ with the $x$-axis) in electrically conducting low Prandtl number fluids under the paradigm of the Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection by performing three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. The control parameters, namely, the Chandrasekhar number ($\mathrm{Q}$) and the reduced Rayleigh number $r$ (ratio of Rayleigh number to critical Rayleigh number), are varied in the ranges $0 \leq \mathrm{Q} \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq r \leq 20$ for the Prandtl numbers $\mathrm{Pr} = 0.1$ and $0.2$ by considering three horizontal aspect ratios ($\Gamma$): $\frac{1}{2}$, $1$ and $2$. In the absence of the magnetic field, the convection starts in the form of steady rolls including the one parallel to the $x$-axis. As the oblique horizontal magnetic field is switched on at an angle $\phi \in (0^\circ, ~90^\circ]$ with the $x$-axis, it is observed that the Lorentz force generated by the component of the magnetic field transverse to the axis of the convection rolls inhibits convection in the form of steady rolls. Thus, with the application of the magnetic field, the convection is suppressed and restarts for a higher Rayleigh number in the form of steady convection rolls. The rolls can either be oriented along the $x$-axis (steady parallel rolls, SPR) or oriented at an angle $45^\circ$ (steady oblique rolls, SOR$^+$) with the $x$-axis depending on the choices of the parameters. A rich bifurcation structure with standing and traveling patterns emerges at higher $r$. The oscillatory instability of steady rolls scales as \( \mathrm{Q}^\alpha \) with distinct exponents for weak and strong magnetic fields. Additionally, heat transfer decreases with increasing \( \phi \) for given \( \mathrm{Q} \) and \( \mathrm{Pr} \).</description>

      <title>Crisis in time-dependent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems operate in a fluctuating environment. However, even in low-dimensional setups, transitions and bifurcations have not yet been fully understood. In this Letter we focus on crises, a sudden flooding of the phase space due to the crossing of the boundary of the basin of attraction. We find that crises occur also in non-autonomous systems although the underlying mechanism is more complex. We show that in the vicinity of the transition, the escape probability scales as $\exp[-\alpha (\ln \delta)^2]$, where $\delta$ is the distance from the critical point, while $\alpha$ is a model-dependent parameter. This prediction is tested and verified in a few different systems, including the Kuramoto model with inertia, where the crisis controls the loss of stability of a chimera state.</description>

      <title>Assessment of spectral phases of non-Hermitian quantum systems through complex and singular values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic behavior or lack thereof in non-Hermitian systems is often diagnosed via spectral analysis of associated complex eigenvalues. Very recently, singular values of the associated non-Hermitian systems have been proposed as an effective measure to study dissipative quantum chaos. Motivated by the rich properties of non-Hermitian power-law banded random matrices and its promise as a platform to study localized and delocalized phases in non-Hermitian systems, we make an in-depth study to assess different spectral phases of these matrices through the lens of both complex eigenvalues and singular values. Remarkably, the results from complex spectra and singular value analysis are seemingly different, thereby necessitating caution while identifying different phases. We also exemplify our findings by studying a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with a complex on-site disorder. Our work indicates that systems, where disorder is present both in the Hermitian and non-Hermitian segments of a Hamiltonian, are sensitive to the specific diagnostic tool that needs to be employed to study quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics and fractal geometry in ring lattice systems of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex dynamics and fractal attractors that emerge from a 60-dimensional ring lattice system of electrically coupled nonchaotic Rulkov neurons. Although networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons are well studied, systems of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons have not been extensively explored due to the piecewise complexity of the nonchaotic Rulkov map. We find rich dynamics emerge from the electrical coupling of regular spiking Rulkov neurons, including chaotic spiking, synchronized chaotic bursting, and complete chaos. By varying the electrical coupling strength between the neurons, we also discover general trends in the maximal Lyapunov exponent across different regimes of the ring lattice system. By means of the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture, we also examine the fractal geometry of the ring system's high-dimensional chaotic attractors and find various correlations and differences between the fractal dimensions of the attractors and the chaotic dynamics on them.</description>

      <title>Extreme events at the onset of epileptic-like intermittent activity of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators on small-world networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the influence of coupling strength, network size, and randomness on the collective dynamics of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators on complex networks. Using Watts-Strogatz small-world network connectivities, we identify four distinct dynamical phases: chaotic, intermittent, partially synchronized, and fully synchronized. The intermittent phase is characterized by the coexistence of chaotic behavior and chimera states, reminiscent of epileptic-seizure-related (ESR) intermittency observed in the brain. We analyze the inter-spike intervals of the individual oscillators, and the existence, duration, and frequency of ESR events as a function of the system parameters. Furthermore, we study the transitions into and out of the intermittent phase and show that peaks in the probability of extreme events--short transients of anomalously high synchronization--precede the transitions from chaos to intermittency and from partial to full synchronization. These transitions are followed by significant changes in the maximum Lyapunov exponent and Kaplan-Yorke dimension. Finally, we discuss how the coupling strength and network properties can be leveraged to control the system's state and the potential applications of extreme event analysis in the study of neural data.</description>

      <title>Data-driven prediction of reversal of large-scale circulation in turbulent convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale circulation (LSC) quasi-stably emerges in the turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and intermittently reverses its rotational direction in two-dimensional turbulent convection. In this paper, direct numerical simulations of the intermittent reversals of the LSC in a two-dimensional square domain are performed, and the time series of the total angular momentum indicating the rotational direction of the LSC is predicted by reservoir computing whose input consists of the shear rates and temperatures at six locations on the sidewalls. The total angular momentum in the simulation after times shorter than half the typical duration of the quasi-stable states is successfully reproduced by the locally-measurable quantities on the sidewalls because the secondary rolls accompanied by the boundary flow characterize the reversal of the LSC. The successful prediction by such sparse input derived from local measurements on the sidewalls demonstrates that the reservoir computing prediction of the reversal is feasible in laboratory experiments and industrial applications. On the other hand, long-term prediction often provides the total angular momentum opposite in sign to the one in the simulations in the late parts of long quasi-stable states. The statistical independence of each reversal implies that the prediction after the reversal is difficult or even impossible, and the training data in the late part in the long quasi-stable state, which rarely appears, is contaminated by the statistically-independent angular momentum in the subsequent quasi-stable state.</description>
