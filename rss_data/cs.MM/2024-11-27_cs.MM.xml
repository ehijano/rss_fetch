      <title>Fully Automatic Deep Learning Pipeline for Whole Slide Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the use of deep learning (DL) methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced computational pathology, enhancing both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) Whole Slide Images (WSI) plays a crucial role by providing detailed tissue samples for the analysis and training of DL models. However, WSIs often contain regions with artifacts such as tissue folds, blurring, as well as non-tissue regions (background), which can negatively impact DL model performance. These artifacts are diagnostically irrelevant and can lead to inaccurate results. This paper proposes a fully automatic supervised DL pipeline for WSI Quality Assessment (WSI-QA) that uses a fused model combining CNNs and ViTs to detect and exclude WSI regions with artifacts, ensuring that only qualified WSI regions are used to build DL-based computational pathology applications. The proposed pipeline employs a pixel-based segmentation model to classify WSI regions as either qualified or non-qualified based on the presence of artifacts. The proposed model was trained on a large and diverse dataset and validated with internal and external data from various human organs, scanners, and H&amp;E staining procedures. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in WSI artifact detection. The proposed model consistently achieved over 95% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score across all artifact types. Furthermore, the WSI-QA pipeline shows strong generalization across different tissue types and scanning conditions.</description>

      <title>Visatronic: A Multimodal Decoder-Only Model for Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new task -- generating speech from videos of people and their transcripts (VTTS) -- to motivate new techniques for multimodal speech generation. This task generalizes the task of generating speech from cropped lip videos, and is also more complicated than the task of generating generic audio clips (e.g., dog barking) from videos and text. Multilingual versions of the task could lead to new techniques for cross-lingual dubbing. We also present a decoder-only multimodal model for this task, which we call Visatronic. This model embeds vision, text and speech directly into the common subspace of a transformer model and uses an autoregressive loss to learn a generative model of discretized mel-spectrograms conditioned on speaker videos and transcripts of their speech. By embedding all modalities into a common subspace, Visatronic can achieve improved results over models that use only text or video as input. Further, it presents a much simpler approach for multimodal speech generation compared to prevailing approaches which rely on lip-detectors and complicated architectures to fuse modalities while producing better results. Since the model is flexible enough to accommodate different ways of ordering inputs as a sequence, we carefully explore different strategies to better understand the best way to propagate information to the generative steps. To facilitate further research on VTTS, we will release (i) our code, (ii) clean transcriptions for the large-scale VoxCeleb2 dataset, and (iii) a standardized evaluation protocol for VTTS incorporating both objective and subjective metrics.</description>

      <title>DiM-Gestor: Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Adaptive Layer Normalization Mamba-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-driven gesture generation using transformer-based generative models represents a rapidly advancing area within virtual human creation. However, existing models face significant challenges due to their quadratic time and space complexities, limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce DiM-Gestor, an innovative end-to-end generative model leveraging the Mamba-2 architecture. DiM-Gestor features a dual-component framework: (1) a fuzzy feature extractor and (2) a speech-to-gesture mapping module, both built on the Mamba-2. The fuzzy feature extractor, integrated with a Chinese Pre-trained Model and Mamba-2, autonomously extracts implicit, continuous speech features. These features are synthesized into a unified latent representation and then processed by the speech-to-gesture mapping module. This module employs an Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN)-enhanced Mamba-2 mechanism to uniformly apply transformations across all sequence tokens. This enables precise modeling of the nuanced interplay between speech features and gesture dynamics. We utilize a diffusion model to train and infer diverse gesture outputs. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations conducted on the newly released Chinese Co-Speech Gestures dataset corroborate the efficacy of our proposed model. Compared with Transformer-based architecture, the assessments reveal that our approach delivers competitive results and significantly reduces memory usage, approximately 2.4 times, and enhances inference speeds by 2 to 4 times. Additionally, we released the CCG dataset, a Chinese Co-Speech Gestures dataset, comprising 15.97 hours (six styles across five scenarios) of 3D full-body skeleton gesture motion performed by professional Chinese TV broadcasters.</description>

      <title>PriorDiffusion: Leverage Language Prior in Diffusion Models for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of leveraging language priors learned by text-to-image diffusion models to address ambiguity and visual nuisance in monocular depth estimation. Particularly, traditional monocular depth estimation suffers from inherent ambiguity due to the absence of stereo or multi-view depth cues, and nuisance due to lack of robustness of vision. We argue that language prior in diffusion models can enhance monocular depth estimation by leveraging the geometric prior aligned with the language description, which is learned during text-to-image pre-training. To generate images that reflect the text properly, the model must comprehend the size and shape of specified objects, their spatial relationship, and the scale of the scene. Thus, we propose PriorDiffusion, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that takes both image and text description that aligned with the scene to infer affine-invariant depth through a denoising process. We also show that language priors can guide the model's attention to specific regions and help it perceive the 3D scene in alignment with user intent. Simultaneously, it acts as a constraint to accelerate the convergence of the diffusion trajectory, since learning 3D properties from a condensed, low-dimensional language feature is more efficient compared with learning from a redundant, high-dimensional image feature. By training on HyperSim and Virtual KITTI, we achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance and a faster convergence speed, compared with other diffusion-based depth estimators, across NYUv2, KITTI, ETH3D, and ScanNet.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Multimodal LLMs with Self-Reflective Tokens for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are the natural extension of large language models to handle multimodal inputs, combining text and image data. They have recently garnered attention due to their capability to address complex tasks involving both modalities. However, their effectiveness is limited to the knowledge acquired during training, which restricts their practical utility. In this work, we introduce a novel method to enhance the adaptability of MLLMs by integrating external knowledge sources. Our proposed model, Reflective LLaVA (ReflectiVA), utilizes reflective tokens to dynamically determine the need for external knowledge and predict the relevance of information retrieved from an external database. Tokens are trained following a two-stage two-model training recipe. This ultimately enables the MLLM to manage external knowledge while preserving fluency and performance on tasks where external knowledge is not needed. Through our experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of ReflectiVA for knowledge-based visual question answering, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods. Source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/ReflectiVA.</description>

      <title>Lens Distortion Encoding System Version 1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lens Distortion Encoding System (LDES) allows for a distortion-accurate workflow, with a seamless interchange of high quality motion picture images regardless of the lens source. This system is similar in a concept to the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES), but for distortion. Presented solution is fully compatible with existing software/plug-in tools for STMapping found in popular production software like Adobe After Effects or DaVinci Resolve. LDES utilizes common distortion space and produces single high-quality, animatable STMap used for direct transformation of one view to another, neglecting the need of lens-swapping for each shoot. The LDES profile of a lens consist of two elements; View Map texture, and Footage Map texture, each labeled with the FOV value. Direct distortion mapping is produced by sampling of the Footage Map through the View Map. The result; animatable mapping texture, is then used to sample the footage to a desired distortion. While the Footage Map is specific to a footage, View Maps can be freely combined/transitioned and animated, allowing for effects like smooth shift from anamorphic to spherical distortion, previously impossible to achieve in practice. Presented LDES Version 1.0 uses common 32-bit STMap format for encoding, supported by most compositing software, directly or via plug-ins. The difference between standard STMap workflow and LDES is that it encodes absolute pixel position in the spherical image model. The main benefit of this approach is the ability to achieve a similar look of a highly expensive lens using some less expensive equipment in terms of distortion. It also provides greater artistic control and never seen before manipulation of footage.</description>

      <title>Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation by Frequency Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity. It is an important task in video generation but remains an open problem for generative models. This paper pushes the technical frontier of IPT2V in two directions that have not been resolved in literature: (1) A tuning-free pipeline without tedious case-by-case finetuning, and (2) A frequency-aware heuristic identity-preserving DiT-based control scheme. We propose ConsisID, a tuning-free DiT-based controllable IPT2V model to keep human identity consistent in the generated video. Inspired by prior findings in frequency analysis of diffusion transformers, it employs identity-control signals in the frequency domain, where facial features can be decomposed into low-frequency global features and high-frequency intrinsic features. First, from a low-frequency perspective, we introduce a global facial extractor, which encodes reference images and facial key points into a latent space, generating features enriched with low-frequency information. These features are then integrated into shallow layers of the network to alleviate training challenges associated with DiT. Second, from a high-frequency perspective, we design a local facial extractor to capture high-frequency details and inject them into transformer blocks, enhancing the model's ability to preserve fine-grained features. We propose a hierarchical training strategy to leverage frequency information for identity preservation, transforming a vanilla pre-trained video generation model into an IPT2V model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our frequency-aware heuristic scheme provides an optimal control solution for DiT-based models. Thanks to this scheme, our ConsisID generates high-quality, identity-preserving videos, making strides towards more effective IPT2V.</description>

      <title>Video-Guided Foley Sound Generation with Multimodal Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating sound effects for videos often requires creating artistic sound effects that diverge significantly from real-life sources and flexible control in the sound design. To address this problem, we introduce MultiFoley, a model designed for video-guided sound generation that supports multimodal conditioning through text, audio, and video. Given a silent video and a text prompt, MultiFoley allows users to create clean sounds (e.g., skateboard wheels spinning without wind noise) or more whimsical sounds (e.g., making a lion's roar sound like a cat's meow). MultiFoley also allows users to choose reference audio from sound effects (SFX) libraries or partial videos for conditioning. A key novelty of our model lies in its joint training on both internet video datasets with low-quality audio and professional SFX recordings, enabling high-quality, full-bandwidth (48kHz) audio generation. Through automated evaluations and human studies, we demonstrate that MultiFoley successfully generates synchronized high-quality sounds across varied conditional inputs and outperforms existing methods.

      <title>Gotta Hear Them All: Sound Source Aware Vision to Audio Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-to-audio (V2A) synthesis has broad applications in multimedia. Recent advancements of V2A methods have made it possible to generate relevant audios from inputs of videos or still images. However, the immersiveness and expressiveness of the generation are limited. One possible problem is that existing methods solely rely on the global scene and overlook details of local sounding objects (i.e., sound sources). To address this issue, we propose a Sound Source-Aware V2A (SSV2A) generator. SSV2A is able to locally perceive multimodal sound sources from a scene with visual detection and cross-modality translation. It then contrastively learns a Cross-Modal Sound Source (CMSS) Manifold to semantically disambiguate each source. Finally, we attentively mix their CMSS semantics into a rich audio representation, from which a pretrained audio generator outputs the sound. To model the CMSS manifold, we curate a novel single-sound-source visual-audio dataset VGGS3 from VGGSound. We also design a Sound Source Matching Score to measure localized audio relevance. This is to our knowledge the first work to address V2A generation at the sound-source level. Extensive experiments show that SSV2A surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both generation fidelity and relevance. We further demonstrate SSV2A's ability to achieve intuitive V2A control by compositing vision, text, and audio conditions. Our SSV2A generation can be tried and heard at https://ssv2a.github.io/SSV2A-demo .</description>

      <title>Embedded Blockchains: A Synthesis of Blockchains, Spread Spectrum Watermarking, Perceptual Hashing &amp; Digital Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00951v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a scheme for detecting manipulated audio and video. The scheme is a synthesis of blockchains, encrypted spread spectrum watermarks, perceptual hashing and digital signatures, which we call an Embedded Blockchain. Within this scheme, we use the blockchain for its data structure of a cryptographically linked list, cryptographic hashing for absolute comparisons, perceptual hashing for flexible comparisons, digital signatures for proof of ownership, and encrypted spread spectrum watermarking to embed the blockchain into the background noise of the media. So each media recording has its own unique blockchain, with each block holding information describing the media segment. The problem of verifying the integrity of the media is recast to traversing the blockchain, block-by-block, and segment-by-segment of the media. If any chain is broken, the difference in the computed and extracted perceptual hash is used to estimate the level of manipulation.</description>

      <title>Automatic Album Sequencing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Album sequencing is a critical part of the album production process. Recently, a data-driven approach was proposed that sequences general collections of independent media by extracting the narrative essence of the items in the collections. While this approach implies an album sequencing technique, it is not widely accessible to a less technical audience, requiring advanced knowledge of machine learning techniques to use. To address this, we introduce a new user-friendly web-based tool that allows a less technical audience to upload music tracks, execute this technique in one click, and subsequently presents the result in a clean visualization to the user. To both increase the number of templates available to the user and address shortcomings of previous work, we also introduce a new direct transformer-based album sequencing method. We find that our more direct method outperforms a random baseline but does not reach the same performance as the narrative essence approach. Both methods are included in our web-based user interface, and this -- alongside a full copy of our implementation -- is publicly available at https://github.com/dylanashley/automatic-album-sequencing</description>

      <title>Any2Any: Incomplete Multimodal Retrieval with Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents perceive and interpret their surroundings by integrating multimodal inputs, such as vision, audio, and LiDAR. These perceptual modalities support retrieval tasks, such as place recognition in robotics. However, current multimodal retrieval systems encounter difficulties when parts of the data are missing due to sensor failures or inaccessibility, such as silent videos or LiDAR scans lacking RGB information. We propose Any2Any-a novel retrieval framework that addresses scenarios where both query and reference instances have incomplete modalities. Unlike previous methods limited to the imputation of two modalities, Any2Any handles any number of modalities without training generative models. It calculates pairwise similarities with cross-modal encoders and employs a two-stage calibration process with conformal prediction to align the similarities. Any2Any enables effective retrieval across multimodal datasets, e.g., text-LiDAR and text-time series. It achieves a Recall@5 of 35% on the KITTI dataset, which is on par with baseline models with complete modalities.</description>

Compared to traditional three-tier cascaded spoken dialogue models that comprise speech recognition (ASR), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS), modern spoken dialogue models exhibit greater intelligence. These advanced spoken dialogue models not only comprehend audio, music, and other speech-related features, but also capture stylistic and timbral characteristics in speech. Moreover, they generate high-quality, multi-turn speech responses with low latency, enabling real-time interaction through simultaneous listening and speaking capability. Despite the progress in spoken dialogue systems, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically organize and analyze these systems and the underlying technologies. To address this, we have first compiled existing spoken dialogue systems in the chronological order and categorized them into the cascaded and end-to-end paradigms. We then provide an in-depth overview of the core technologies in spoken dialogue models, covering aspects such as speech representation, training paradigm, streaming, duplex, and interaction capabilities. Each section discusses the limitations of these technologies and outlines considerations for future research. Additionally, we present a thorough review of relevant datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks from the perspectives of training and evaluating spoken dialogue systems. We hope this survey will contribute to advancing both academic research and industrial applications in the field of spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: Robust medical Machine Learning (ML) models have the potential to revolutionize healthcare by accelerating clinical research, improving workflows and outcomes, and producing novel insights or capabilities. Developing such ML models from scratch is cost prohibitive and requires substantial compute, data, and time (e.g., expert labeling). To address these challenges, we introduce Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF), a suite of pre-trained, domain-specific foundation models, tools, and recipes to accelerate building ML for health applications. The models cover various modalities and domains, including radiology (X-rays and computed tomography), histopathology, dermatological imaging, and audio. These models provide domain specific embeddings that facilitate AI development with less labeled data, shorter training times, and reduced computational costs compared to traditional approaches. In addition, we utilize a common interface and style across these models, and prioritize usability to enable developers to integrate HAI-DEF efficiently. We present model evaluations across various tasks and conclude with a discussion of their application and evaluation, covering the importance of ensuring efficacy, fairness, and equity. Finally, while HAI-DEF and specifically the foundation models lower the barrier to entry for ML in healthcare, we emphasize the importance of validation with problem- and population-specific data for each desired usage setting. This technical report will be updated over time as more modalities and features are added.</description>
