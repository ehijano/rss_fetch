      <title>$\Xi_c \to \Xi$ form factors from lattice QCD with domain-wall quarks: a new piece in the puzzle of $\Xi_c^0$ decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice-QCD determination of the vector and axial-vector form factors that describe the charm-baryon semileptonic decays $\Xi_c\to \Xi \ell^+ \nu_\ell$. The calculation uses a domain-wall action for the up, down, and strange quarks, and an anisotropic clover action for the charm quark. We use four ensembles of gauge-field configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations, with lattice spacings between 0.111 and 0.073 fm and pion masses ranging from 420 to 230 MeV. We present Standard-Model predictions for the decay rates and branching fractions of $\Xi_c^0\to \Xi_c^-\ell^+ \nu_\ell$ and $\Xi_c^+\to\Xi_c^0\ell^+ \nu_\ell$ for $\ell=e,\mu$. In particular, we obtain $\Gamma(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- e^+ \nu_e)/|V_{cs}|^2 = 0.2515(73)\text{ ps}^{-1}$ and $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- e^+ \nu_e) = 3.58(12)\:\%$. These values are higher than those predicted by a previous lattice calculation and substantially higher than the experimentally measured values, but consistent with expectations from approximate $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger model from Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Exploratory calculation of the rare hyperon decay $\Sigma^+ \to p \ell^+ \ell^-$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare hyperon decay $\Sigma^+ \to p \ell^+ \ell^-$ is a flavour-changing neutral current process mediated by an $s \to d$ transition that occurs only at loop level within the Standard Model. Consequently, this decay is highly suppressed, making it a promising avenue for probing potential new physics. While phenomenological calculations have made important progress in predicting the decay amplitude, there remains a four-fold ambiguity in the relevant transition form factors that prevents a unique prediction for the branching fraction and angular observables. Fully resolving this ambiguity requires a first-principles Standard-Model calculation, and the recent observation of this process using LHCb Run 2 data reinforces the timeliness of such a calculation. In this work, we present the first lattice-QCD calculation of this decay, performed using a 2+1-flavour domain-wall fermion ensemble with a pion mass of 340 MeV. At a small baryon source-sink separation, we observe the emergence of a signal in the relevant baryonic four-point functions. This allows us to determine the positive-parity form factors for the rare hyperon decays from first-principles, albeit with large statistical and systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Empirical Determination of the Kaon Distribution Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach to extract the Kaon leading-twist distribution amplitude (DA) from empirical information on the ratio of the neutral-to-charged kaon electromagnetic form factors, $\mathcal{R}_K$. Our study employs a two-parameter representation of the DA at $\zeta=2$ GeV, designed to capture the expected broadening and asymmetry of the distribution, as well as the soft endpoint behavior predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our leading-order analysis of the latest experimental measurements of $\mathcal{R}_K$ reveals that the extracted DA exhibits a somewhat significant skewness, with the first symmetric moment approximately $\langle 1-2x \rangle_K= 0.082(7)$. On the other hand, the brodaness and general shape of the produced distributions show a reasonable consistency with contemporaty lattice and continuum QCD analyses. These findings highlight the importance of accurately determining the profile of the DA, especially the skewness and its relation to $SU_F(3)$ flavor symmetry breaking, as well as the inclusion of higher-order effects in the hard-scattering kernels for analyzing data at experimentally accessible scales.</description>

      <title>Quantum Determinant Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum algorithm for computing the determinant of a unitary matrix $U\in U(N)$ is given. The algorithm requires no preparation of eigenstates of $U$ and estimates the phase of the determinant to $t$ binary digits accuracy with $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2 N+t^2)$ operations and $tN$ controlled applications of $U^{2^m}$ with $m=0,\ldots,t-1$. For an orthogonal matrix $O\in O(N)$ the algorithm can determine with certainty the sign of the determinant using $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2 N)$ operations and $N$ controlled applications of $O$. An extension of the algorithm to contractions is discussed.</description>

      <title>$B$ meson semileptonic decays from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $B$ processes are a rich source of potential anomalies that could lead to the discovery of BSM physics. The long-standing tension between the inclusive and the exclusive determinations of the CKM matrix elements $|V_{xb}|$, or the current tensions in the $R(D)$-$R(D^\ast)$ plane are some examples of active areas of research where we might find signals of new physics. Heavy-to-heavy $B$ semileptonic decays, $B_{(s)}\to D^{(\ast)}_{(s)}\ell\nu$, and in particular, decays with a vector product ($D^\ast_{(s)}$) are especially interesting from an experimental point of view, but experiment and theory must walk together in order to reach conclusions in the intensity frontier. In this review I talk about the current status of the lattice-QCD calculations of the $B\to D^{\ast}\ell\nu$ form factors at non-zero recoil, I discuss the implications they have for the determination of $B$ anomalies, and finally I give some hints of what we can expect from future calculations.</description>

      <title>Chiral and isospin breaking in the two-flavor Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schwinger model with two massive fermions is a nontrivial theory for which no analytical solution is known. The strong coupling limit of the theory allows for different semiclassical approximations to extract properties of its low-lying spectrum. In particular, analytical results exist for the fermion condensate, the fermion mass dependence of the pseudoscalar meson mass or its decay constant. These approximations, nonetheless, are not able to quantitatively predict isospin breaking effects in the light spectrum, for example. In this paper we use lattice simulations to test various analytical predictions, and study isospin breaking effects from nondegenerate quark masses. We also introduce a low-energy effective field theory based on a nonlinear $\sigma$ model with a dilaton field, which leads to the correct fermion mass dependence of the pion mass, the correct $\sigma$-to-$\pi$ mass ratio and a prediction of the isospin breaking effects, which we test numerically.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state via the $Z_c(3900)$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position to constrain the existence of the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method.</description>
