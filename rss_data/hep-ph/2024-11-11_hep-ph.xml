      <title>Neutrino Self-interaction and Weak Mixing Angle Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interaction with a larger ``Fermi constant'' is often resorted to for understanding various puzzles of our universe. We point out that a light, neutrinophilic scalar particle $\phi$ through radiative correction leads to an energy-scale dependence in the neutrino-$Z$-boson gauge coupling. The driver behind this phenomenon is a large separation between the mass scales of $\phi$ and additional heavy particles needed for gauge invariance. This is a generic effect insensitive to details of the UV completion. We show that the running can change the $Z\nu\bar\nu$ coupling by several percent and affect the measurement of weak mixing angle through neutrino neutral-current processes. We discuss the interplay between the running of the $Z\nu\bar\nu$ coupling and $\sin^2\theta_W$ in various experimental observables. It is possible to disentangle the two effects with more than one precise measurement.</description>

      <title>Bubble-wall speed with loop corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the nucleating scalar field during the first-order phase transitions by incorporating one-loop corrections of classical fluctuations. We assume that a high-temperature expansion is valid\te where the mass of the scalar field is significantly smaller than the temperature\te so that we can treat the bubble-wall dynamics in a regime where quantum fluctuations can be integrated out. We present a systematic framework for calculating classical loop corrections to the wall speed; contrast our results with traditional methods based on the derivative expansion; show that the latent heat can differ from the effective-potential result; and discuss general hydrodynamic corrections. Finally, we show an application of the presented framework for a simple scalar field model, finding that the one-loop improvement decreases the wall speed and that an effective-potential approximation underestimates full one-loop corrections by about a factor of two.</description>

      <title>Combination of aN$^3$LO PDFs and implications for Higgs production cross-sections at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how the two existing approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) sets of parton distributions (PDFs) from the MSHT20 and NNPDF4.0 series can be combined for LHC phenomenology, both in the pure QCD case and for the QCD$\otimes$QED sets that include the photon PDF. Using the resulting combinations, we present predictions for the total inclusive cross-section for Higgs production in gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production at the LHC Run-3. For the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion channels, the corrections that arise when using correctly matched aN$^3$LO PDFs with N$^3$LO cross section calculations, compared to using NNLO PDFs, are significant, in many cases larger than the PDF uncertainty, and generally larger than the differences between the two aN$^3$LO PDF sets entering the combination. The combined aN$^3$LO PDF sets, MSHT20xNNPDF40_an3lo and MSHT20xNNPDF40_an3lo_qed, are made publicly available in the LHAPDF format and can be readily used for LHC phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Decay as a Probe of Flavor Symmetry: The Case of Fake Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores nucleon decay within the framework of a "fake Grand Unified Theory (GUT)" combined with the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism. In this fake GUT framework, quarks and leptons may have distinct high-energy origins but fit into complete $\mathrm{SU}(5)$ multiplets at low energies without requiring force unification, setting it apart from conventional GUTs. By introducing flavor symmetry through the FN mechanism, the model addresses the flavor puzzle of quark and lepton mass hierarchies and mixing patterns. Our analysis demonstrates that nucleon decay rates and branching fractions in the fake GUT are sensitive to flavor symmetry, providing a means to distinguish it from conventional GUT predictions. These findings underscore the importance of nucleon decay searches in probing both baryon number violation and the underlying flavor structure.</description>

      <title>CP-violation in the Weinberg 3HDM potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of Weinberg's $Z_2\times Z_2$ symmetric three-Higgs-doublet potential, allowing for spontaneous violation of CP due to complex vacuum expectation values. An overview of all possible ways of satisfying the stationary-point conditions is given, with one, two or three non-vanishing vacuum expectation values, together with conditions for CP conservation in terms of basis invariants. All possible ways of satisfying the conditions for CP conservation are given. Scans of allowed parameter regions are given, together with measures of CP violation, in terms of the invariants. The light states identified in an earlier paper are further explored in terms of their CP-violating couplings. Loop-induced CP violation in $WWZ$ couplings, as well as charge-asymmetric scattering are also commented on.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction of $\eta_{c}\gamma$ pairs in CGC framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyzed the exclusive photoproduction of $\eta_{c}\gamma$ pairs in the Color Glass Condensate framework. We found that the cross-section of this process is sensitive only to the forward dipole scattering amplitude, and thus could be used as a new tool for analysis of this fundamental nonperturbative object. Using the phenomenological parametrizations of this object, we estimated numerically the production cross-section and counting rates in the kinematics of the ongoing and forthcoming experiments at LHC and future Electron Ion Collider. We found that the cross-section is sufficiently large for dedicated experimental study. We also estimated the role of this process as a potential background to $\eta_{c}$ photoproduction, which is conventionally considered as a gateway for studies of odderons. We found that the contribution of $\eta_{c}\gamma$ (with undetected photon) is on par with expected contributions of odderons in the kinematics of small momentum transfer $|t|\lesssim1$ GeV$^{2}$, though decreases rapidly at larger $|t|$. Finally, we also calculated the feed-down contribution (from radiative decays of other charmonia) and found that a sizable correction comes from $J/\psi\to\eta_{c}\gamma$ decays. This contribution remains pronounced even at relatively large $|t|$ and potentially can impose constraint on detectability of odderons via $\eta_{c}$ photoproduction.</description>

      <title>Condensation and prescaling in spatial Polyakov loop correlations far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of spatial Polyakov loop correlations, which provide gauge-invariant observables akin to effective particle numbers for gluon plasmas, are investigated within real-time $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ lattice gauge theory at weak couplings and large gluon occupations. The momentum zero mode of these correlations reveals the dynamic formation of a condensate, while at nonzero momenta, energy is transported toward the ultraviolet. We demonstrate that the non-zero momentum dynamics is well described by a direct cascade in terms of gauge-invariant Polyakov loop excitations, exhibiting self-similar prescaling indicative of a nonthermal attractor. This behavior can be analytically understood through perturbation theory for the Polyakov loop correlations and the established dynamics of gauge field correlations. We perform simulations for both $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge groups, providing further consistency checks on the $N_c$-dependence of perturbative expectations. No evidence of an inverse cascade toward lower momenta is found for momenta above the electric screening scale.</description>

      <title>FIMP Dark Matter in bulk viscous non-standard cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisited the extension of the classical non-standard cosmological model in which dissipative processes are considered through a bulk viscous term in the new field $\phi$, which interacts with the radiation component during the early universe. Specifically, we consider an interaction term of the form $\Gamma_{\phi} \rho_{\phi}$, where $\Gamma_{\phi}$ represents the decay rate of the field and $\rho_{\phi}$ denotes its energy density, and a bulk viscosity described by $\xi=\xi_{0}\rho_{\phi}^{1/2}$, within the framework of Eckart's theory. This extended non-standard cosmology is employed to examine the parameter space for the production of Feebly Interacting Massive Particles (FIMPs) as Dark Matter candidates. In particular, for certain combinations of the model and Dark Matter parameters, namely ($T_\text{end}$,$\kappa$) and $(m_\chi,\langle\sigma v\rangle)$, we found large new regions in which it can establish the Dark Matter and reproduce the current observable relic density as compared with the $\Lambda$CDM and the classical non-standard cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Axial-vector and scalar contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results for single axial-vector and scalar meson pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL) part of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. In the dispersive approach to these quantities (in narrow width approximation) the central inputs are the corresponding space-like electromagnetic transition form factors. We determine these directly using a functional approach to QCD by Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations in the very same setup we used previously to determine pseudo-scalar meson exchange ($\pi$, $\eta$ and $\eta'$) as well as meson ($\pi$ and $K$) box contributions. Particular care is taken to preserve gauge invariance and to comply with short distance constraints in both the form factors and the HLbL tensor. Our result for the contributions from a tower of axial-vector states including short distance constraints is $a_\mu^{\text{HLbL}}[\text{AV-tower+SDC}] = 27.5 \,(3.2) \times 10^{-11}$. For the combined contributions from $f_0(980), a_0(980), f_0(1370)$ and $a_0(1450)$ we find $a_\mu^{\text{HLbL}}[\text{scalar}] = -1.6 \,(5) \times 10^{-11}$.</description>

Abstract: I give a theoretical overview of magnetic monopoles, focusing on the physical perspective of monopoles as hypothetical particles rather than as mathematical objects.

      <title>Search for Axions from Magnetic White Dwarfs with Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low mass axion-like particles could be produced in abundance within the cores of hot, compact magnetic white dwarf (MWD) stars from electron bremsstrahlung and converted to detectable X-rays in the strong magnetic fields surrounding these systems. In this work, we constrain the existence of such axions from two dedicated Chandra X-ray observations of $\sim$40 ks each in the energy range $\sim$1 - 10 keV towards the magnetic white dwarfs (MWDs) WD 1859+148 and PG 0945+246. We find no evidence for axions, which constrains the axion-electron times axion-photon coupling to $|g_{a\gamma \gamma} g_{aee}| \lesssim 1.54 \times 10^{-25}$ ($3.54 \times 10^{-25}$) GeV$^{-1}$ for PG 0945+246 (WD 1859+148) at 95% confidence for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-6}$ eV. We find an excess of low-energy X-rays between 1 - 3 keV for WD 1859+148 but determine that the spectral morphology is too soft to arise from axions; instead, the soft X-rays may arise from non-thermal emission in the MWD magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter is a fundamental constituent of the universe, which is needed to explain a wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological observations. Although the existence of dark matter was first postulated nearly a century ago and its abundance is precisely measured, approximately five times larger than that of ordinary matter, its underlying identity remains a mystery. A leading hypothesis is that it is composed of new elementary particles, which are predicted to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. In this article we review the basic evidence for dark matter and the role it plays in cosmology and astrophysics, and discuss experimental searches and potential candidates. Rather than targeting researchers in the field, we aim to provide an accessible and concise summary of the most important ideas and results, which can serve as a first entry point for advanced undergraduate students of physics or astronomy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the binary black hole mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) remains an open question. We calculate the merger rate from primordial black holes (PBHs) within the density spike around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies. We show that the merger rate within the spike is comparable to that within the wider dark matter halo. We also calculate the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) signal from PBHs hosted within the density spike spiralling into their host SMBHs due to GW emission. We predict that LISA may detect $\sim10^4$ of these EMRIs with signal-to-noise ratio of 5 within a 4-year observation run, if all dark matter is made up of PBHs. Uncertainties in our rates come from the uncertain mass fraction of PBHs within the dark matter spike, relative to the host central SMBHs, which defines the parameter space LISA can constrain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for loop integral reduction in the Feynman parametrization using intersection theory and relative cohomology. In this framework, Feynman integrals correspond to boundary-supported differential forms in the language of relative cohomology. The integral reduction can then be achieved by computing intersection numbers. We apply our method in several examples to demonstrate its correctness, and discuss the subtleties in certain degenerate limits.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of finite-volume effect on hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muon g-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy spectrum relevant to the lattice calculation of hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment a_\mu is dominantly given by two-pion states satisfying L\"uscher's finite-volume quantization condition. Finite-volume effects from those states may exhibit power-law dependence on the volume, contrary to an exponential suppression as suggested by chiral effective theory. Employing the finite-volume state decomposition of Euclidean correlators, we systematically investigate the volume dependence. Phenomenological inputs are used for \pi\pi phase shift and time-like pion form factor. Our estimate for the finite-volume effects on a_\mu is larger than previous works and has a different volume scaling. Numerical results are given for the ``window'' observables of a_\mu.</description>

      <title>Selection rules of topological solitons from non-invertible symmetries in axion electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a relation between non-invertible symmetries and selection rules of topological solitons such as axionic domain walls and magnetic strings in the $(3+1)$-dimensional axion electrodynamics with a massive axion or a massive photon. In the low-energy limit of the phases where either the axion or the photon is massive, we identify non-invertible 0- or 1-form symmetry generators as axionic domain walls or magnetic strings, respectively. By non-invertible transformations on magnetic monopoles or axionic strings, we give constraints on possible configurations of topological solitons in the presence of the monopoles or axionic strings. Our results are consistent with a solution to the axionic domain wall problem by the magnetic monopole. Further, we give a new constraint on a linked configuration of the magnetic and axionic strings.</description>

      <title>The St\"uckelberg Path to Pure de Sitter Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advance the study of pure de Sitter supergravity by introducing a finite formulation of unimodular supergravity via the super-St\"uckelberg mechanism. Building on previous works, we construct a complete four-dimensional action of spontaneously broken ${\cal N}\!\!=\!\!1$ supergravity to all orders, which allows for de Sitter solutions. The introduction of finite supergravity transformations extends the super-St\"uckelberg procedure beyond the second order, offering a recursive solution to all orders in the goldstino sector. This work bridges the earlier perturbative approaches and the complete finite theory, opening new possibilities for de Sitter vacua in supergravity models and eventually string theory.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic effective field theory for heavy exotic hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.00552v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an effective field theory to describe hadrons with two heavy quarks without any assumption on the typical distance between the heavy quarks with respect to the typical hadronic scale. The construction is based on Non-Relativistic QCD and inspired in the strong coupling regime of Potential Non-Relativistic QCD. We construct the effective theory at leading and next-to-leading order in the inverse heavy-quark mass expansion for arbitrary quantum numbers of the light degrees of freedom. Hence our results hold for hybrids, tetraquarks, double heavy baryons and pentaquarks, for which we also present the corresponding operators at Non-Relativistic level. At leading order, the effective theory enjoys heavy quark spin symmetry and corresponds to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. At next-to-leading order, spin and velocity dependent terms arise, which produce splittings in the heavy-quark spin symmetry multiplets. A concrete application to double heavy baryons is presented in an accompanying paper.</description>

      <title>Hunting Nonstandard Neutrino Interactions and Leptoquarks in Dark Matter Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next generation direct dark matter (DM) detection experiments will have unprecedented capabilities to explore coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) complementary to dedicated neutrino experiments. We demonstrate that future DM experiments can effectively probe nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI) mediated by scalar fields in the scattering of solar and atmospheric neutrinos. We set first limits on $S_1$ leptoquark models that result in sizable $\mu-d$ and $\tau-d$ sector neutrino NSI CE$\nu$NS contributions using LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) data. As we show, near future DM experiments reaching $\sim \mathcal{O}(100)$ton-year exposure, such as argon-based ARGO and xenon-based DARWIN, can probe parameter space of leptoquarks beyond the reach of current and planned collider facilities. We also analyze for the first time prospects for testing NSI in lead-based detectors. We discuss the ability of leptoquarks in the parameter space of interest to also explain the neutrino masses and $(g-2)_\mu$ observations.</description>

Abstract: Since announcement of the muon $g-2$ anomaly, plenty of papers have devoted to this anomaly. The approximate formulae are always adopted when determining the new physics contributions to $(g-2)_{\mu}$, while clear scope of applications are always absent. This manuscript is dedicated to the comprehensive analytical results and approximations for the canonical interactions at one-loop level, which can be a useful handbook for the model builders. Here, we collect the analytic and approximate expressions for the scalar and vector mediator cases. The examples in specific models are exhibited to illustrate the applications of our formulae. Furthermore, we investigate the possible physics implications.</description>

      <title>Neutron beta decay and exact conservation of charged weak hadronic vector current in the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a reliability of the hypothesis of exact conservation of the charged weak hadronic vector current in the neutron $\beta^-$-decay with polarized neutron and unpolarized proton and electron. We calculate the contributions of the phenomenological term, responsible for Exact Conservation of the charged weak hadronic Vector Current (or the ECVC effect) in the neutron $\beta^-$-decay even for different masses of the neutron and proton (see Leitner et al. Phys. Rev. C73, 065502 (2006)), to the correlation coefficients together with a complete set of contributions of scalar and tensor interactions beyond the Standard Model (SM). We argue if total contributions of scalar and tensor interactions beyond the SM (Phys. Rev. D88, 073002 (2013); arXiv: 1212.0332v4 [hep-ph]) will not be able to reconcile the experimental data on the correlation coefficients with the contributions of the ECVC effect, one may conclude that the charged weak hadronic vector current is not conserved in the hadronic transitions of weak processes with different masses of incoming and outgoing hadrons.</description>

Abstract: The holographic Schwinger effect is investigated in systems with Nf = 0, Nf = 2, and Nf = 2+1 using the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model, incorporating equation of state and baryon number susceptibility information from lattice QCD. It is found that the critical electric field is smallest for Nf = 0, indicating that the Schwinger effect is more likely to occur than in systems with Nf = 2 and Nf = 2+ 1. The critical electric field decreases with increasing chemical potential and temperature across all systems. Additionally, potential analysis confirms that the maximum total potential energy increases with the number of flavors, suggesting that existing particles may reduce the probability of particle pair production.</description>

      <title>Covariant formulation of spinodal decomposition in rapidly expanding quark gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is expected to have a first order phase transition between the confined hadron gas and the deconfined quark gluon plasma at high baryon densities. This will result in phase boundary effects in the metastable and unstable regions. It is important to include these effects in phenomenological models of heavy ion collisions to identify experimental signatures of a phase transition. This requires building intuition on phase separation in rapidly expanding fluids. In this work we present the covariant equations of relativistic hydrodynamics with a phase boundary, provide prescriptions to extend the equation of state to metastable and unstable regions, and show the effects of spinodal separation in a Bjorken flow.</description>

      <title>Flavor invariants for the SM with one singlet vector-like quark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the flavor invariants of the SM augmented by one singlet vector-like quark. Aided by the Hilbert series, we construct all the basic invariants with which any flavor invariant can be written as a polynomial. In special, this theory contains one CP odd invariant of degree six which has degree much lower than the usual Jarlskog invariant of the SM. We find the nonlinear polynomial relations (syzygies) of lowest degrees involving these basic invariants, including the expression of the square of the CP odd invariant of lowest degree in terms of CP even invariants. The $SU(3)$ identity underlying this syzygy is uncovered in terms of invariant tensors, which can be applied to rewrite any square of a CP odd invariant of the same form, involving three hermitean matrices of size three. We demonstrate by an example that there is CP violation that is not detected by the CP odd invariants proposed in the literature so far but it can be detected with the full list of CP odd invariants found here.</description>

      <title>Effect of isoscalar and isovector scalar fields on baryon semileptonic decays in nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements is very important, because it could be a clue to new physics beyond Standard Theory. This is particular true of $V_{ud}$, because it is the main contribution to the unitary condition of the CKM matrix elements. The level of accuracy for the test of the unitarity involving the element $V_{ud}$ is now of the order of $10^{-4}$. Because the precise data for $V_{ud}$ is usually extracted from super-allowed nuclear $\beta$ decay, it is quite significant to investigate the breaking of SU(3) flavor symmetry on the weak vector coupling constant in nuclear matter. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the isoscalar scalar ($\sigma$) and the isovector scalar ($\delta$ or $a_0$) mean-fields affect the weak vector and axial-vector coupling constants for semileptonic baryon (neutron, $\Lambda$ or $\Xi^-$) decay in asymmetric nuclear matter. To do so, we use the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, where nuclear matter consists of nucleons including quark degrees of freedom bound by the self-consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons. We pay careful attention to the center of mass correction to the quark currents in matter. We then find that, for neutron $\beta$ decay in asymmetric nuclear matter, the defect of the vector coupling constant due to the $\delta$ field can be of the order of $10^{-4}$ at the nuclear saturation density, which is the same amount as the level of the current uncertainty in the measurements. It is also interesting that, in neutron-rich matter, there exists a certain low density at which isospin symmetry is restored, that is, the $u$-$d$ quark mass difference vanishes. We conclude that the effect of the isoscalar scalar and the isovector scalar fields should be considered in baryon semileptonic decays in nuclei.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Interactions in White Dwarfs: A Multi-Energy Approach to Capture Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: White dwarfs offer a compelling avenue for probing interactions of dark matter particles, particularly in the challenging sub-GeV mass regime. The constraints derived from these celestial objects strongly depend on the existence of high dark matter densities in the corresponding regions of the Universe, where white dwarfs are observed. This implies that excluding the parameter space using local white dwarfs would present a significant challenge, primarily due to the low dark matter density in the solar neighbourhood. This limitation prompts the exploration of alternative scenarios involving dark matter particles with a diverse spectrum of kinetic energies. In this work, we investigate how these dark matter particles traverse the star, interact with stellar matter, and ultimately get captured. To accomplish this, we approximate the dark matter flux as a delta function and inspired on the Three Portal Model, we assume that fermionic dark matter interacts with stellar matter either through a broken $U(1)$ gauge vector mediator or a scalar. In our computations, we consider how interactions might vary across different energy regimes, from high-energy deep inelastic scattering and inelastic scatterings via the production of $N-$ and $\Delta-$ resonances to lower-energy elastic interactions with nucleons and nuclei. Our study models these inelastic resonant interactions with dark matter and vector or scalar mediators for the very first time. We provide insights into the specific conditions required for successfully boosted dark matter capture in white dwarfs. We found that, in general, dark matter capture is most likely to occur at low energies, as expected. However, in the high-energy regime, there remains a small window for capture through resonant and deep inelastic scattering processes.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental question in QCD is the existence of a phase transition at large doping of quarks over antiquarks. We present the first prediction of a QCD critical point (CP) from a Bayesian analysis constrained by first principle results at zero doping. We employ the gauge/gravity duality to map QCD onto a theory of dual black holes. Predictions for the CP location in different realizations of the model overlap at one sigma. Even if many prior samples do not include a CP, one is found in nearly 100\% of posterior samples, indicating a strong preference for a CP.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the charge of the graviton using gravitational wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the graviton possesses a non-zero charge $q_g$, gravitational waves (GW) originating from astrophysical sources would experience an additional time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields. This would result in a modification of the phase evolution of the observed GW signal similar to the effect induced by a massive graviton. As a result, we can reinterpret the most recent upper limits on the graviton's mass as constraints on the joint mass-charge parameter space, finding $|q_g|/{e} &lt; 3\times 10^{-34}$ where $e$ represents the charge of an electron. Additionally, we illustrate that a charged graviton would introduce a constant phase difference in the gravitational waves detected by two spatially separated GW detectors due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Using the non-observation of such a phase difference for the GW event GW190814, we establish a mass-independent constraint $|q_g|/e &lt; 2\times 10^{-26}$. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first-ever bounds on the charge of the graviton. We also discuss various caveats involved in our measurements and prospects for strengthening these bounds with future GW observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting subsolar objects in black hole binary mergers is considered a smoking gun signature of primordial black holes. Their supposedly vanishing tidal Love number is generically thought to help distinguish them from other subsolar and more deformable compact objects, such as neutron stars. We show that a large and detectable Love number of primordial black holes can be generated in the presence of even small disturbances of the system, thus potentially jeopardizing their discovery. However, such small perturbations are not tightly bound and are therefore disrupted before the mergers. We show that they leave a characteristic signature in the gravitational waveform that could be observed with current and future gravitational wave detectors. Thus, they may still hint towards the primordial nature of the black holes in the merger. Finally, we demonstrate that disregarding possible environmental effects in the matched-filter search for subsolar gravitational wave events can lead to a decreased sensitivity in the detectors.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in metric-affine gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in the framework of parity-even metric-affine gravity, we investigate the particle spectrum of a deformed theory in the large-$N$ limit. In a simple Higgs inflation model in metric-affine gravity, it is known that its UV cutoff is much smaller than the Planck scale. While it calls for UV completion, a concrete example has not yet been found, even with the large-$N$ limit known as a successful technique to complete an original Higgs inflation defined on the Riemannian geometry. This motivates us to study how small deformation of the simple Higgs inflation affects the emergence and properties of dynamical fields particularly in the large-$N$ limit. As a UV theory has to be free of ghosts or tachyons at least around Minkowski space, we perform the parameter search and find the healthy parameter region where a new heavy particle can propagate without these pathologies.</description>

      <title>Inflationary and Gravitational Wave Signatures of Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests that the semi-classical description of a black hole breaks down at the latest after losing an O(1) fraction of its mass. As a result, effects such as memory burden can slow down evaporation so that small primordial black holes (PBHs), in particular those in the mass range 10^6 g to 10^9 g, become viable dark matter candidates. In this paper, we investigate the production of PBHs from a prototype model of polynomial inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. We show that a sufficiently small PBH mass alleviates any tension with CMB observations. Moreover, we develop efficient numerical procedures to identify model parameters and evolve Mukhanov-Sasaki modes to place bounds on the scalar-induced stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Whilst we identify some prospects for observation with future GW detectors, our results highlight the need to develop new experiments for high-frequency GW detection in the ~kHz to ~MHz range. Finally, we demonstrate that previously-used ans\"atze for modelling the power spectrum only yield a reliable approximation for the GW signal if some input from inflation is used.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Forecast of Galactic Cosmic-Rays Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict galactic cosmic-ray spectra on a one-day-ahead basis by leveraging historical solar activity data, overcoming limitations inherent in traditional transport models. By flexibly incorporating multiple solar parameters such as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar wind speed, and sunspot numbers, our model achieves accurate short-term and long-term predictions of cosmic-ray flux. The addition of historical cosmic-ray flux data significantly enhances prediction accuracy, allowing the model to capture complex dependencies between past and future flux variations. Additionally, the model reliably predicts full cosmic-ray spectra for different particle species, enhancing its utility for comprehensive space weather forecasting. Our approach offers a scalable, data-driven alternative to traditional physics-based methods, ensuring robust daily and long-term forecasts. This work opens avenues for advanced models that can integrate broader observational data, with significant implications for space weather monitoring and mission planning.</description>
