      <title>Precision Design of Cyclic Peptides using AlphaFold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This independent research investigates methods to improve the precision of cyclic peptide generation targeting the HIV gp120 trimer using AlphaFold. The study explores proximity-based hotspot mapping at the CD4 binding site, centroid distance penalization, generative loss tuning, and custom loss function development. These enhancements produced cyclic peptides that closely resemble the binding conformation of the CD4 attachment inhibitor BMS-818251. The proposed methodology demonstrates improved structural control and precision in cyclic peptide generation, advancing the applicability of AlphaFold in structure-based drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Superior Molecular Representations from Intermediate Encoder Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we first analyze the information flow in five diverse molecular encoders and find that intermediate layers retain more general-purpose features, whereas the final-layer specializes and compresses information. We then perform an empirical layer-wise evaluation across 22 property prediction tasks. We find that using frozen embeddings from optimal intermediate layers improves downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, up to 28.6%, compared to the final-layer. Furthermore, finetuning encoders truncated at intermediate depths achieves even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with increases as high as 40.8%, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Multi-state Protein Design with DynamicMPNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one structure, one function paradigm, yet many critical biological processes - from enzyme catalysis to membrane transport - depend on proteins that adopt multiple conformational states. Existing multi-state design approaches rely on post-hoc aggregation of single-state predictions, achieving poor experimental success rates compared to single-state design. We introduce DynamicMPNN, an inverse folding model explicitly trained to generate sequences compatible with multiple conformations through joint learning across conformational ensembles. Trained on 46,033 conformational pairs covering 75% of CATH superfamilies and evaluated using Alphafold 3, DynamicMPNN outperforms ProteinMPNN by up to 25% on decoy-normalized RMSD and by 12% on sequence recovery across our challenging multi-state protein benchmark.</description>

      <title>Learning Inter-Atomic Potentials without Explicit Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space. Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and electrolyte-like species), TransIP effectively learns symmetry in its latent space, providing low equivariance error. Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to augmentation-based MLIP models.</description>
