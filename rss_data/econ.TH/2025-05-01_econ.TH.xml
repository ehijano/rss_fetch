      <title>Effect of a Manager in Relational Contracts with Multiple Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the optimal management structure about hiring a manager and providing the manager with a separate salary and bonus using a relational contract among an owner, a manager, and workers, assuming that the manager can observe individual worker performances while the owner can observe only overall team performance. I derive optimal contracts for the two cases in which the manage's salary and bonus are integrated into total team bonus or provided separately. I compare situations of having the manager distribute bonuses based on individual worker performance to the situation of equal bonus distribution based on overall team performance without a manager. Only a contract with a manager who receives a separate bonus is feasible for low discount factor. Making the manager to distribute the salary and bonus including himself is best with intermediate discount factor. Providing an equal bonus without a manager is optimal with high discount factor.</description>

      <title>On spatial systems of cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are there multiple equilibria in the spatial economy? This paper develops a unified framework that integrates systems of cities and regional models to address this question within a general geographic space. A key feature is the endogenous formation of commuting areas linking a continuum of residential locations to a finite set of potential business districts. Using tools from computational geometry and shape optimization, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of spatial equilibria. For plausible parameter values, urban location is indeterminate, but, conditional on an urban system, city sizes are uniquely determined. The framework reconciles seemingly conflicting empirical findings on the role of geography and scale economies in shaping the spatial economy.</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the ``Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R\&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>

      <title>Publication Design with Incentives in Mind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The publication process both determines which research receives the most attention, and influences the supply of research through its impact on the researcher's private incentives. We introduce a framework to study optimal publication decisions when researchers can choose (i) whether or how to conduct a study and (ii) whether or how to manipulate the research findings (e.g., via selective reporting or data manipulation). When manipulation is not possible, but research entails substantial private costs for the researchers, it may be optimal to incentivize cheaper research designs even if they are less accurate. When manipulation is possible, it is optimal to publish some manipulated results, as well as results that would have not received attention in the absence of manipulability. Even if it is possible to deter manipulation, such as by requiring pre-registered experiments instead of (potentially manipulable) observational studies, it is suboptimal to do so when experiments entail high research costs.</description>
