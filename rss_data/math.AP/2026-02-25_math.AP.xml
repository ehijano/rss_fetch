      <title>Uniform rectifiability of brittle fractures in linear elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the uniform rectifiability of brittle fractures in arbitrary dimension. The existing approach for the Mumford-Shah functional, which relies on separation-type properties of the singular set, faces serious obstacles in the Griffith setting due to the lack of coarea formula for the symmetric gradient. We present an alternative route to uniform rectifiability for free-discontinuity problems by proving that cracks have ``plenty of big projections''.</description>

      <title>Global Existence for Reaction-diffusion Equations with State-Dependent Delay and Fast-growing Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to study the initial-boundary value problem of the reaction-diffusion equation with state-dependent delay $\pa_{t}u-\Delta u=f(u)+g(u,u(t-\tau(t,u_t)))+h(t,x)$ in a bounded domain. We establish the global existence of the problem under suitable dissipative-type structural conditions, allowing both nonlinear terms $f$ and $g$ to have arbitrary polynomial growth rates. Another highlight in this work is that, we significantly relax the continuity assumptions imposed on the delay functions.</description>

      <title>The singularity at degenerate points in steady axisymmetric compressible free surface flows with gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the singular shape of the free boundary at degenerate points in a three dimensional axisymmetric compressible gravity flow. For all possible degenerate points on the free surface, we prove that the only nontrivial asymptotic behavior of the free surface at the stagnation points away from the axis of symmetry is the Stokes corner flow. The possible geometries for free boundaries at the non-stagnation axis points are downward pointing or upward pointing cusps. At the origin, there are only two nontrivial asymptotics possible: the Garabedian's pointed bubble or a horizontal flat surface.
  The problem is associated with the analysis of the degenerate points of a quasilinear free boundary problem of the Bernoulli type, and the main obstacles are the absence of a Weiss-type monotonicity formula. To achieve our goal, we establish for the first time monotonicity formulas for quasilinear Bernoulli type free boundary problems. Our formula works both when the equation becomes singular and when the free boundary condition is degenerate.
  Moreover, we establish a new nonlinear frequency formula at the horizontal flat points at the origin and integrate it with the compensated compactness theory for Euler equations, ensuring the strong convergence of variational solutions.
  Our results resolve the Stokes conjecture [Mathematical and Physical Papers, Vol. I., 1880] in a generalized compressible, three dimensional axisymmetric framework. In addition, it can also be realized as a compressible counterpart to V\v{a}rv\v{a}ruc\v{a} and Weiss [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., (67), 2014]. Our approach is completely new and gives a systematic approach for studying singularities of a singular Bernoulli type quasilinear free boundary problem.</description>

      <title>Solutions with one dimensional concentration for a two dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii model with general potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We concern standing wave solutions with frequency $\lambda$ to a two dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a trap potential under the unit mass constraint, which is used to describe Bose-Einstein condensates with attractive interaction. First, we investigate the necessary conditions for existence of the solutions with concentration phenomena directed along closed smooth curves. Next, not only imposing stationary and non-degeneracy conditions on the curves with respect to an auxiliary weighted length involving the trap potential, but also adding some other technical assumptions, we select a sequence $\{\lambda_j\}$ of the frequency $\lambda$ with $-\lambda_j\rightarrow +\infty$ and construct solutions with concentration directed along the curves. Our result partially answers the conjecture raised in [A. Ambrosetti, A. Malchiodi, W.-M. Ni, Comm. Math. Phys. 2003] about necessary condition for solution concentrating at submanifolds. The solutions constructed in this paper are concentrating on curves whose length are non-uniformly bounded, and hence the situation is quite different from that in [M. del Pino, M. Kowalczyk, J. Wei, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 2007].</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions for long cylindrical shells under radial deformations based on the isotropic relaxed micromorphic continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a closed-form analytical solution for the elastostatic response of long cylindrical shells composed of microstructured materials within the framework of the isotropic relaxed micromorphic continuum. The formulation accounts for microstructural effects by introducing an independent micro-distortion tensor field in addition to the classical displacement field. Under the assumptions of axisymmetric deformation and plane strain conditions, the governing equilibrium equations reduce to a coupled system of ordinary differential equations in the radial coordinate. By introducing suitable auxiliary variables, the system is reformulated into a non-homogeneous modified Bessel equation, which admits an exact analytical solution. Explicit expressions are derived for the radial displacement field and the non-zero components of the micro-distortion tensor. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the influence of material parameters and the characteristic length on the displacement. The results demonstrate that the relaxed micromorphic model predicts deviations from classical elasticity where microstructural effects are more pronounced. The obtained solution provides valuable physical insight into the mechanics of cylindrical shells and serves as a benchmark for validating numerical implementations of relaxed micromorphic models.</description>

      <title>On the singular nature of shallow-water convergence of the intermediate long wave equation on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate regularity properties of the solution map for the intermediate long wave equation (ILW) on the real line. More precisely, we study the scaled ILW which was shown to converge to the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) in $L^2(\mathbb R)$ in the shallow-water limit in a recent work by the first, third, and fourth authors with T. Zhao (2025). By decomposing the dynamics into the low frequency part and the residual part, we show that, when the depth parameter is sufficiently small, the solution map for the low frequency part is analytic in $L^2(\mathbb R)$, while the solution map for the residual part fails to be $C^2$. Moreover, we establish shallow-water convergence in $L^2(\mathbb R)$ of the low frequency dynamics to KdV. This explains the mechanism of the regularity gain of the solution map in the shallow-water limit.</description>

      <title>Global self-similar solutions for Hardy-H\'enon equations with linear and quasilinear diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global self-similar solutions to the parabolic Hardy-H\'enon equation $$ u_t=\Delta u^m+|x|^{\sigma}u^p, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,\infty), $$ are classified in the range of exponents $m\geq1$, $p&gt;m$ and $\sigma&gt;\max\{-2,-N\}$. The classification varies strongly with respect to the celebrated \emph{Fujita} and \emph{Sobolev critical exponents} $$ p_F(\sigma)=m+\frac{\sigma+2}{N}, \quad p_S(\sigma)=
  \begin{cases}
  \frac{m(N+2\sigma+2)}{N-2}, &amp; \mbox{if } N\geq3, \\[1mm]
  \infty, &amp; \mbox{if } N\in\{1,2\}.
  \end{cases} $$ Indeed, if $p\in(p_F(\sigma),p_S(\sigma))$, both equations admit self-similar solutions with either compact support (if $m&gt;1$) or Gaussian-like tail as $|x|\to\infty$ (if $m=1$), as well as a one-parameter family satisfying $$ u(x,t)\sim C|x|^{-(\sigma+2)/(p-m)}, \quad {\rm as} \ |x|\to\infty. $$ If $p\geq p_S(\sigma)$, there are only self-similar solutions with the latter algebraic tail, while for $m&lt;p\leq p_F(\sigma)$ no global solutions exist. The results open the way for a deeper study of the role of these solutions in the dynamics of the Hardy-H\'enon equations.</description>

      <title>Continuous Data Assimilation for Semilinear Parabolic Equations: A General Approach by Evolution Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops a general framework for continuous deterministic data assimilation for semilinear parabolic equations by means of evolution equations. Introducing a nudged model driven by partial observations, the global well-posedness of the reference and the approximating systems is established under natural assumptions. In addition, it is shown that the approximating solution converges exponentially to the solution of the reference system, provided the observational resolution and the nudging parameter are suitably chosen. The approach allows us to consider many systems, such as the Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard, Sellers-type energy balance, and bidomain systems, for the first time.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to investigate the existence of multiple critical points for a class of nonsmooth functionals. This method provides a robust framework to analyze the existence of solutions for problems involving the $1$-Laplacian operator with discontinuous nonlinearities. Our results contribute to advancing the study of nonsmooth variational problems, by establishing new nonsmooth multiple critical point theorems.</description>

      <title>Morse homology for strongly indefinite functionals on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we lay the foundations for the Morse theoretical study of strongly indefinite functionals on Banach manifolds by developing the local theory for a specific model class that captures several key analytical features also arising in the variational formulations of geometric problems such as Dirac-harmonic maps. As a corollary, we obtain existence results of solutions to certain systems of quasilinear elliptic problems involving the $p$-area functional. Abstracting from the concrete setting, we then formulate general conditions ensuring that Morse homology is well-defined for strongly indefinite functionals on a Banach space.</description>

      <title>The half-wave maps equation on $\mathbb{T}$: Global well-posedness in $H^{1/2}$ and almost periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the half-wave maps equation $$ \partial_t \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u} \times |D| \mathbf{u} $$ for $\mathbf{u} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{S}^2$, where $\mathbb{T}=\mathbb{R}/2 \pi \mathbb{Z}$ is the one-dimensional torus and $\mathbb{S}^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ denotes the unit sphere. By extension from rational initial data, we construct a unique and continuous flow map for data in the critical energy space $H^{1/2}(\mathbb{T}; \mathbb{S}^2)$. Moreover, we show almost periodicity in time of these solutions. For the dense subset of rational initial data, we establish quasi-periodicity in time and a-priori bounds on $\| \mathbf{u}(t) \|_{H^s(\mathbb{T})}$ for any $s &gt;0$.
  Our analysis relies crucially on an explicit formula arising from the Lax pair structure acting on a Hardy space of vector-valued holomorphic functions on the unit disk. As a central ingredient, we develop a general {\em stability principle} for explicit formulae associated with completely integrable PDEs possessing a Lax pair structure on Hardy spaces, including the Benjamin--Ono equation, Calogero--Sutherland DNLS, and the half-wave-maps equation posed on $\mathbb{T}$.
  Our results extend to the matrix-valued half-wave maps equation $$ \partial_t \mathbf{U} = -\frac{i}{2} [ \mathbf{U}, |D| \mathbf{U} ] $$ with target manifold given by the complex Grassmannians $\mathsf{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^d)$, thereby generalizing the special case $\mathbb{S}^2 \cong \mathbb{CP}^1 \cong \mathsf{Gr}_1(\mathbb{C}^2)$. In a companion work, we prove global well-posedness for the half-wave maps equation posed on $\mathbb{R}$ in the scaling-critical energy space $\dot{H}^{1/2}$, by establishing a stability principle for explicit formulae on Hardy spaces in the complex half-plane $\mathbb{C}_+$.</description>

      <title>Boundary-driven patterns in elongated convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the heat equation in a smooth bounded convex domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with nonlinear Neumann boundary condition $\partial_\nu u = \lambda (u - u^3)$. Stable non-constant stationary solutions do not exist when $\Omega$ is a ball. We show that this behavior is not a consequence of convexity alone. More precisely, if the inradius of $\Omega$ is fixed and its diameter is sufficiently large, then there exists $\lambda&gt;0$ for which the problem admits such a solution. The result reveals a geometric mechanism for the emergence of stable non-constant stationary solutions in elongated convex domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop two different types of criteria for the finite time blow-up solutions to the combined nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in 1D. The first one is a negative energy criterion developed for triple combined nonlinearity and then for a (convergent) infinite sum of combined nonlinearities, including an exponential nonlinearity. The second one is a positive energy criterion for the double nonlinearity with the defocusing-focusing coefficients. We also provide examples of initial data that satisfy either of the criteria.</description>

      <title>On thermal transpiration and thermomolecular pressure difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21079v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate the phenomenon of thermal transpiration in a bounded convex domain. We employ the stationary Boltzmann equation with a cutoff potential. For boundary condition, we partition the boundary into diffuse reflection and incoming regions. We establish the existence of solution in a weighted $L^\infty$ space. Furthermore, we consider a convex domain with diffuse reflection boundary condition in the middle and incoming boundary condition at the two ends.
  We first consider Maxwellians with the same pressure but different temperatures at the two ends. We prove that the total flux $U(x)$ is directed toward the hot end. Furthermore, we derive an estimate for the total flux:
  \begin{align}
  U(x)\geq C\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{T_2}}\right).
  \end{align}
  In addition, we show that when the pressures and temperatures on the two ends satisfy the relation
  \begin{align}
  \frac{P_1}{P_2}=\sqrt{\frac{T_1}{T_2}},
  \end{align}
  the total flux of the solution is of order $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\kappa})$. This result is consistent with Knudsen's finding of thermomolecular pressure difference in 1909.</description>

      <title>Regularity of stable radial solutions to semilinear elliptic equations in MEMS problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the regularity of stable radial solutions to semilinear elliptic equations arising in MEMS problems, modeled by the Dirichlet problem $-\Delta u=f(u)$ in the unit ball $B_1$, where the nonlinearity $f\in C^1([0,1))$ is nonnegative and satisfies $\int^1_0f(s)\,ds=+\infty$. We focus on the case where $f$ blows up as $u\to 1^{-}$. Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are widely used devices in engineering and technology. Our main result establishes for dimensions $2\le n\le 6$, every stable radial solution is regular, meaning $\|u\|_{L^{\infty}(B_1)}&lt;1$. This result gives a positive answer to an open problem posed by Bruera and Cabr\'e concerning the regularity of stable solutions for singular nonlinearities without requiring a Crandall-Rabinowitz type condition, at least in the radial case.</description>

Abstract: We consider the minmax Ljusternik-Schnirelmann levels of the constrained $p-$Dirichlet integral, on a general open set of the Euclidean space. We show that, whenever one of these levels lies below the threshold given by the $L^p$ Poincar\'e constant ``at infinity'', it actually defines an eigenvalue of the Dirichlet $p-$Laplacian. We also prove an exponential decay at infinity for the relevant eigenfunctions: this can be seen as a \v{S}nol-Simon--type estimate for the nonlinear case. Finally, we exhibit some peculiar examples of unbounded open sets to which our main result applies.</description>

      <title>Global hypoellipticity for perturbations of complex vector fields on the torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Kr\"{o}necker's approximation theorem to measure (in a topological sense) a set of constants which turn a vector field into a non-globally hypoelliptic operator. We present situations in which this set is a discrete enumerable (hence, meager) subset of the real line, and we also show that this set may be a dense $\mathcal{G}_\delta$ subset of the complex numbers (hence, nonmeager), which produces a contrast to a known result stating that this set has null Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Weak global solvability of a doubly degenerate parabolic-elliptic nutrient taxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the following doubly degenerate parabolic-elliptic nutrient taxis system $$ \begin{cases}
  u_t = (uvu_x)_x -(u^2 vv_x)_x + uv, \\[1.5 ex]
  \hspace{0.2 cm}0 = v_{xx} - uv + f(x,t), \end{cases} $$ in a bounded interval $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}$, under no-flux boundary conditions and nonnegative initial value $u(x,0) = u_0(x) \geq 0$, where $f(x,t) \geq 0$ is known external supply of the nutrient.
  It is shown that for any nonnegative $u_0 \in W^{1,\infty}(\Omega)$ and $f \in C^1\big(\bar{\Omega} \times [0,\infty) \big)$, $f \not \equiv 0$, a global weak solution of the problem can be constructed by means of a regularization approach.
  The core of the analysis lies on a Harnack-type inequality for the second that allows us to overcome the lack of uniform coercivity. Together with time regularity properties, we obtain relative compactness through a combination of the Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem and the Aubin-Lions lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a new fractal Weyl upper bound for the high-energy distribution of resonances of convex co-compact hyperbolic surfaces which matches the improved spectral gap given by Fourier decay. This improves upon the fractal Weyl bound of Dyatlov which matches the Patterson-Sullivan spectral gap. We also give a new resolvent estimate improving the ones given by Dyatlov-Zahl and Dyatlov. Analogous results are obtained for quantum open baker's maps, improving an estimate of Dyatlov-Jin, where we also give an improved fractal Weyl bound matching a spectral gap given by additive energy estimates. We refine known methods for proving fractal Weyl bounds which reduce the problem to an estimate of a certain determinant function; however, we use a different determinant function which allows us to make sharper estimates by applying the methods of proof of the fractal uncertainty principle in each setting.</description>

      <title>On the Mathematical Analysis and Physical Implications of the Principle of Minimum Pressure Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a two-way equivalence between the incompressible Navier- Stokes equation (INSE) and the principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG). We prove that a candidate smooth flow field is a solution of the INSE if and only if its instantaneous evolution minimizes, at every instant, the norm of the pressure force, required to enforce incompressibility. We show that the PMPG is precisely the minimization formulation of the Leray-Helmholtz projection. Any admissible instantaneous evolution (e.g., onset of separation) resulting from the INSE necessarily minimizes the PMPG cost. Conversely, any other kinematically admissible evolution, requiring a strictly larger pressure force to ensure the same constraints, does not satisfy the INSE. Thus, the PMPG offers a variational perspective through which intricate incompressible flow behaviors may be interpreted.
  In a finite-dimensional setting with divergence-free modes, we show that the PMPG yields the same dynamics as classical Galerkin projection. Moreover, the PMPG provides a natural generalization of classical Galerkin projection beyond linear modal expansions, accommodating nonlinear and non-modal representations. We then examine the relation between instantaneous dynamical minimization and steady variational selection, including its connection to the variational theory of lift. Motivated by these observations, we formulate conjectures concerning necessary conditions for stability and the convergence of Navier-Stokes solutions to Euler's in the vanishing-viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order computational homogenization for hyperelastic media using gradient based sensitivity analysis of microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20697v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for the computational homogenization of locally periodic hyperelastic structures undergoing large deformations due to external quasi-static loading. The algorithm performs clustering of macroscopic deformations into subsets called "centroids", and, as a new ingredient, approximates the homogenized coefficients using sensitivity analysis of micro-configurations with respect to the macroscopic deformation. The novel "model-order reduction" approach significantly reduces the number of microscopic problems that must be solved in nonlinear simulations, thereby accelerating the overall computational process. The degree of reduction can be controlled by a user-defined error tolerance parameter. The algorithm is implemented in the finite element framework SfePy, and its performance effectiveness is demonstrated using two-dimensional test examples, when compared with solutions obtained by the proper orthogonal decomposition method, and by the full "FE-square" simulations. Extensions beyond the present implementations and the scope of tractable problems are discussed.</description>

      <title>A flow approach to the Toda system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a flow to study the Toda system, which we call {\it Toda flow.} More generally, we introduce a flow of the Liouville systems, formulated as a coupled parabolic system with nonlocal interactions. Finite-time singularities are characterized and both necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence are provided in this general setting, even when the prescribed functions are allowed to change sign.
  As an application, we prove a global existence for the Toda flow in the critical case without restricting the sign of the prescribed functions. We provide a detailed description of blow-up behavior at infinity and obtain a sharp lower bound for the functional in cases where global convergence fails. By constructing appropriate test functions, we further establish a sufficient condition for the global convergence of the flow. These results are not affected by the sign-changing nature of the prescribed functions, and extend the theorem of Jost, Lin and Wang (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 59, 526-558, 2006) to systems of multiple equations under this more general and physically relevant condition.</description>

      <title>H\"older-Logarithmic Stability and Convergence Rates for an Inverse Random Source Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an inverse random source problem concerned with recovering the strength of a random, uncorrelated acoustic source from correlation measurements of emitted time-harmonic acoustic waves. Such problems arise in applications including aeroacoustics and seismic imaging. Unlike their deterministic counterparts, inverse random source problems are known to be uniquely solvable in the absence of noise. Nevertheless, due to their inherent ill-posedness, regularization is required to stably reconstruct the source strength.
  We derive conditional H\"older-logarithmic stability estimates under Sobolev smoothness assumptions by employing complex geometrical optics solutions. Moreover, by establishing a variational source condition, we obtain H\"older-logarithmic convergence rates for spectral regularization methods. At fixed frequency, the exponents in the logarithmic stability and convergence estimates grow unboundedly as the Sobolev regularity of the source increases. Finally, we present numerical experiments supporting our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: We study a nonrelativistic system made of two quantum particles constrained to move on a line and a spin located at a fixed point of the line. Initially the two particles are in a maximally entangled state and the spin is down. The first particle interacts with the spin while the second particle is free, i.e., it does not interact neither with the first particle nor with the spin. We rigorously prove that there is a correlation between the state of the spin and the state of the second particle. More precisely, we show that, in a suitable scaling limit, if the first particle flips the spin, then the second particle possesses a definite momentum in the direction opposite to the spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study curve shortening flow in high codimension for arcs with free boundary meeting a fixed smooth barrier orthogonally. We prove dilation-invariant curvature and higher-derivative estimates up to the boundary using a Stahl-type localised maximum principle and an adapted cut-off. Using a reflected Gaussian entropy and blow-up analysis, Type I boundary singularities yield a shrinking semicircle model after reflection. Type II blow-ups give a Grim Reaper translator, which is ruled out under a free-boundary entropy bound $&lt;2$. Hence in the low-entropy regime the flow either converges to the orthogonal chord or has only semicircle boundary singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate within the framework of linear theory the behaviour of the total (hydrodynamic) pressure and of the dynamic pressure in a regular wave train which propagates at the surface of water with a flat bed in a flow with constant vorticity. We show that nonzero vorticity, the hallmark of a non-uniform underlying current, may strongly alter the behaviour with respect to the case of irrotational flows, for which the maximum and minimum of the dynamic pressure always occur at the wave crest and at the wave trough, respectively (the extrema of the dynamic pressure may occur along the flat bed or along the critical level, depending on the vorticity strength). While vorticity does not modify the increase of the hydrodynamic pressure with depth, it can significantly alter the location of the extrema of the hydrodynamic pressure at a fixed depth level.</description>

Abstract: We consider the classical Dirac operator on globally hyperbolic manifolds with timelike boundary and show well-posedness of the Cauchy initial-boundary value problem coupled to APS-boundary conditions. This is achieved by deriving suitable energy estimates, which play a fundamental role in establishing uniqueness and existence of weak solutions. Finally, by introducing suitable mollifier operators, we study the differentiability of the solutions. For obtaining smoothness we need additional technical conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study positive solutions of semilinear elliptic equations in a planar triangular domain under mixed boundary conditions, consisting of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on one side and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on the remaining two sides. Using the method of moving planes, we prove that if the Neumann vertex is non-obtuse, then every positive solution is strictly increasing in the direction of the inward unit normal to the Dirichlet side. If the Neumann vertex is obtuse, we show that monotonicity instead holds in the direction of the outward normal direction to the longer Neumann side, under certain technical conditions. Furthermore, by applying the maximum principle, we demonstrate that these monotonicity properties extend to the first mixed eigenfunction of the Laplacian: its unique global maximum lies on the longer Neumann side and coincides with the Neumann vertex precisely when that vertex is non-obtuse or when the Neumann sides have equal length. This answers a question raised in the Polymath7 research thread 1 regarding the location of extrema for mixed boundary eigenfunctions in triangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06899v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray transform on the plane or on the three-dimensional Euclidean space can be considered as the measurements of CT scanners for normal human tissue. If the human body contains metal regions such as dental implants, stents in blood vessels, metal bones, etc., the beam hardening effect for the energy level of the X-ray causes streaking artifacts in its CT image. More precisely, if there are two strictly convex metal regions contained in the cross-section of normal human tissue, then streaking artifacts occur along the common tangent lines of the two regions. In this paper we study the geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on nontrapping simple compact Riemannian manifolds with strictly convex boundaries. We show that the streaking artifacts result from the propagation of conormal singularities on the boundary of metal regions along the common tangent geodesics under the strong and seemingly strange assumption that the manifolds are two dimensional or spaces of constant curvature. This condition ensures that every Jacobi field takes the form of the product of a scalar function and parallel transport along the geodesic. Our results clarify the geometric meaning of the theory, which was imperceptible in the known results on the Euclidean space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bottleneck in the theory of large-amplitude and multi-d viscous and relaxation shock stability is the development of nonlinear damping estimates controlling higher by lower derivatives. These have traditionally proceeded from time-evolution bounds based on Friedrichs symmetric and Kawashima or Goodman type energy estimates. Here, we propose an alternative program based on frequency-dependent pseudodifferential time-space damping estimates in the spirit of Kreiss. These are seen to be equivalent in the linear case to high-frequency spectral stability, and, just as for the constant-coefficient analysis of Kreiss, sharp in a pointwise, fixed-frequency, sense. This point of view leads to a number of simplifications and extensions using already-existing analysis. We point to the new issue of turning points, analogous to glancing points in the constant-coefficient case as an important direction for further development.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the asymptotic stability of solutions to the inflow problem for the one-dimensional barotropic Navier--Stokes equations in half space. When the boundary value is located at the subsonic regime, all the possible thirteen asymptotic patterns are classified in \cite{M01}. We consider the most complicated pattern, the superposition of the boundary layer solution, the 1-rarefaction wave, and the viscous 2-shock waves. In this superposition, the boundary layer is degenerate and large. We prove that, if the strengths of the rarefaction wave and shock wave are small, and if the initial data is a small perturbation of the superposition, then the solution asymptotically converges to the superposition up to a dynamical shift for the shock. As a corollary, our result implies the asymptotic stability for the simpler case where the superposition consists of the degenerate boundary layer solution and the viscous 2-shock. Therefore, we complete the study of the asymptotic stability of the inflow problem for the 1D barotropic Navier--Stokes equations for subsonic boundary values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isolated skyrmion solutions to the two-dimensional Landau-Lifshitz equation with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, Zeeman term, and easy-plane anisotropy of various strengths are studied. In the full range of parameter values for which the energy is a positive variation of the Bogomol'nyi case, we construct solutions to the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation and analyze their qualitative properties, including monotonicity, exponential decay, and stability. Our analysis is global and non-perturbative. Moreover, we derive precise estimates qualifying the difference between these solutions and those in the Bogomol'nyi regime. A key ingredient of our approach is a novel resolvent estimate for the linearized operator, which remains uniform with respect to additional implicit potentials arising in the problem.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear PDEs with modulated dispersion IV: normal form approach and unconditional uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the modulated Korteweg-de~Vries equation (KdV) on the circle with a time non-homogeneous modulation acting on the linear dispersion term. By adapting the normal form approach to the modulated setting, we prove sharp unconditional uniqueness of solutions to the modulated KdV in $L^2(\mathbb T)$ if a modulation is sufficiently irregular. For example, this result implies that if the modulation is given by a sample path of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $0 &lt; H &lt; \frac 25$, the modulated KdV on the circle is unconditionally well-posed in $L^2(\mathbb T)$. Our normal form approach provides the construction of solutions to the modulated KdV (and the associated nonlinear Young integral) {\it without} assuming any positive regularity in time. As an interesting byproduct of our normal form approach, we extend the construction of the nonlinear Young integral to a much larger class of functions, and obtain an improved Euler approximation scheme as compared to the classical sewing lemma approach.
  We also establish analogous sharp unconditional uniqueness results for the modulated Benjamin-Ono equation and the modulated derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with a quadratic nonlinearity. In the appendix, we prove sharp unconditional uniqueness of the cubic modulated NLS on the circle in $H^{\frac 16}(\mathbb T)$.</description>

      <title>Varifold solutions to Volume-Preserving Mean Curvature Flow: existence and weak-strong uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution we introduce a novel weak solution concept for two-phase volume-preserving mean curvature flow, having both properties of unconditional global-in-time existence and weak-strong uniqueness. These solutions extend the ones proposed by Hensel-Laux [J. Differential Geom. 130, 209-268 (2025)] for the standard mean curvature flow, and consist in evolving varifolds coupled with the phase volumes by a transport equation. First, we show that, in the same setting as in Takasao [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 247, 52 (2023)], any sharp interface limit of solutions to a slightly modified nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation is a varifold solution according to our new definition. Secondly, we crucially introduce a new notion of volume-preserving gradient-flow calibrations, allowing the extended velocity vector field to point in the normal direction on the interface. We show that any sufficiently regular strong solution is calibrated in this sense. Finally, we prove that any classical solution to volume-preserving mean curvature flow, which is then automatically a calibrated flow, is unique in the class of our new varifold solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18758v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence and multiplicity of weak solutions for the following quasilinear elliptic system: \[ \begin{cases} -\mathrm{div}(A_1(x,u_1)\nabla u_1) + \displaystyle\frac{1}{2} D_{u_1}A_1(x,u_1)\nabla u_1 \cdot \nabla u_1 = \lambda_1 u_1 + g_{\beta,1}(u) &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\[3mm] -\mathrm{div}(A_2(x,u_2)\nabla u_2) + \displaystyle\frac{1}{2} D_{u_2}A_2(x,u_2)\nabla u_2 \cdot \nabla u_2 = \lambda_2 u_2 + g_{\beta,2}(u) &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\[2mm] u_1 = u_2 = 0 &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega, \end{cases} \] where $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 &lt; \mu_1$, the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian, and $\Omega$ is a bounded domain. The nonlinearity derives from a potential $G_\beta$ with subcritical growth.
  Due to the lack of differentiability of the associated energy functional, we employ nonsmooth critical point theory and variational methods based on the concept of weak slope. We prove the existence of least energy solutions in both the cooperative ($\beta &gt; 0$) and competitive ($\beta &lt; 0$) regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of scale-invariant curvature energies defined on immersed $4$-dimensional manifolds and prove that weak immersions that are critical points of such energies are analytic in any given local harmonic chart. Because of the criticality of this variational problem, the regularity result is obtained through the identification of conservation laws by applying Noether theorem. The resulting identities generate a lower order elliptic system of PDEs to which methods from integrability by compensation and interpolation theory are applied.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic $O (N)$ linear sigma model and its mean-field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study large $N$ limits of the hyperbolic $O(N)$ linear sigma model ($\text{HLSM}_N$) on the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$, namely, a system of $N$ interacting stochastic damped nonlinear wave equations (SdNLW) with coupled cubic nonlinearities. After establishing (pathwise) global well-posedness of $\text{HLSM}_N$ and the limiting equation, called the mean-field SdNLW, we first establish global-in-time convergence of $\text{HLSM}_N$ to the mean-field SdNLW with general initial data (under a suitable assumption). In particular, for the local-in-time convergence, we obtain an optimal convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12}$ under an additional integrability assumption on initial data. We then show that the invariant Gibbs dynamics for $\text{HLSM}_N$ converges to that for the mean-field SdNLW with a convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12}$ on any large time intervals.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of (1+2)-dimensional linear partial differential of Asian options pricing. Special cases have been used to models of financial mathematics. We carry out group classification of a class equations. In particular, the maximum dimension Lie invariance algebra within the above class is eight-dimensional. It is shown that an equation with such an algebra can be transformed into the linear Kolmogorov equation with the help of the point transformations of variables. Using the operators of invariance algebra symmetry reduction is carried out and invariant exact solutions are constructed for some equations.</description>

      <title>On Poincar\'e-Sobolev level involving fractional GJMS operators on hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a qualitative analysis of the Poincar\'e--Sobolev level associated with the fractional GJMS operators \(\mathcal{P}_s\) \(\bigl(s\in(0,\tfrac n2)\setminus\mathbb N\bigr)\) on the hyperbolic space \(\mathbb H^n\). In contrast to the integer-order case, when \(s\notin\mathbb N\) the operator \(\mathcal{P}_s\) does not enjoy the conformal covariance that allows one, in the upper half-space or ball model, to relate it to the Euclidean fractional Laplacian \((-\Delta)^s\); this link is crucial for importing Euclidean theory. We therefore introduce \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_s\) (\(s&gt;0\)), which is conformally related to \((-\Delta)^s\). Our purpose in the paper is to analyze the monotonicity, attainability, and strict-gap regions of the Poincar\'e--Sobolev levels associated with \(\mathcal{P}_s\) and \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_s\). First, we reinterpret the Brezis--Nirenberg problem through the lens of Poincar\'e--Sobolev levels, connecting earlier results for the Euclidean Laplacian and for operators \(\mathcal{P}_k\) on \(\mathbb H^n\) with integer \(k\in(0,\tfrac n2)\). We then establish new, explicit lower bounds for the Hardy term in fractional Hardy--Sobolev--Maz'ya inequalities involving both \(\mathcal{P}_s\) and \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_s\). By applying the concentration--compactness principle together with a detailed analysis of the strict-gap regions for the Poincar\'e--Sobolev levels, we prove the existence of solutions to the Brezis--Nirenberg problem on \(\mathbb H^n\) for both operators. Finally, combining the Hardy lower bounds with criteria for attainability, we obtain a complete characterization of the Poincar\'e--Sobolev levels \(H_{n,s}\) and \(\widetilde H_{n,s}\).</description>

      <title>Resolvent approaches to elliptic regularity in stationary Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the local regularity of solutions to stationary Fokker-Planck equations on an open set $U \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. A central objective is to relax the classical assumptions on the coefficients by focusing on the case where the drift vector field $\mathbf{G}$ is only assumed to be locally square-integrable, i.e. $\mathbf{G} \in L^2_{loc}(U, \mathbb{R}^d)$, the symmetric diffusion matrix $A = (a_{ij})_{1 \leq i,j \leq d}$ is assumed to be locally uniformly strictly elliptic and bounded, with coefficients satisfying $a_{ij} \in VMO_{loc}(U)$ for all $1 \leq i,j \leq d$ and ${\rm div}A \in L^2_{loc}(U, \mathbb{R}^d)$. Our main result shows that any locally bounded function $h \in L^\infty_{loc}(U)$ satisfying the stationary Fokker-Planck equation $L^*(h\, dx) = 0$ must in fact belong to the local Sobolev space $H^{1,2}_{loc}(U)$. The proof is based on the construction of a sub-Markovian resolvent associated with the principal elliptic operator $L^A := {\rm trace}(A \nabla^2)$, combined with delicate energy-type inequalities. In particular, we show that the density $h$ can be realized as the weak $H^{1,2}$-limit of images of resolvent operators.</description>

Abstract: We construct examples and provide a classification of self-similar solutions to the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations whose pseudo-velocity fields possess more than one stagnation point. These solutions are also homogeneous steady states of the Euler equations. In contrast, we prove that any homogeneous self-similar solution with bounded vorticity away from the origin necessarily admits only a single stagnation point, located at the origin. The solutions we construct develop velocity cusps along rays from the origin, and this allows for additional stagnation points of the pseudo-velocity field.</description>

      <title>The Eigenvalue Problem for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of the first eigenvalue and an associated eigenfunction with Dirichlet condition for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator on a bounded strongly pseudoconvex domain in $\C^n$. We show that the eigenfunction is plurisubharmonic, smooth with bounded Laplacian in $\Omega$ and boundary values $0$. Moreover it is unique up to a positive multiplicative constant.
  To this end, we follow the strategy used by P.L. Lions in the real case. However, we have to prove a new theorem on the existence of solutions for some special complex degenerate Monge-Amp\`ere equations. This requires establishing new a priori estimates of the gradient and Laplacian of such solutions using methods and results of L. Caffarelli, J.J. Kohn, L. Nirenberg and J. Spruck \cite{CKNS85} and B. Guan \cite{GuanB98}.
  Finally we provide a Pluripotential variational approach to the problem and using our new existence theorem, we prove a Rayleigh quotient type formula for the first eigenvalue of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator.</description>

      <title>Structure versus regularity of set-valued maps in convex generalized Nash equilibrium problems in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) in Banach space consists of $N&gt;1$ optimal control problems with couplings in both the objective functions and, most importantly, in the feasible sets. We address the existence of equilibria for convex GNEPs in Banach space. We show that the standard assumption of lower semicontinuity of the set-valued constraint maps - foundational in the current literature on GNEPs - can be replaced by graph convexity or the so-called Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) property. Lower semicontinuity is often essential for obtaining upper semicontinuity of best response maps, crucial for the existence theory based on Kakutani-Fan fixed-point arguments. However, in function spaces or in settings with partial differential equation (PDE) constraints, verifying lower semicontinuity becomes much more challenging (even in convex cases), whereas graph convexity, for example, is often straightforward to check. Our results unify several existence theorems in the literature and clarify the structural role of constraint maps. We also extend Rosen's uniqueness condition to Banach spaces using a multiplier bias framework.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for the First Non-zero Basic Eigenvalue on a Singular Riemannian Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the lower bounds of the first non-zero basic eigenvalue on a closed singular Riemannian manifold $(M,\mathcal{F})$ with basic mean curvature that depends on the given non-negative lower bound of the Ricci curvature of $M$ and the diameter of the leaf space $M/\mathcal{F}$. These can be regarded as generalized versions of the Zhong-Yang estimate and a generalized Shi-Yang's estimate for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. We also provide a rigidity result corresponding to the generalized Zhong-Yang estimate, which is a generalized Hang-Wang rigidity for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. More precisely, when the first basic eigenvalue $\lambda_1^B$ is equal to $\frac{\pi^2}{d_{M/\mathcal{F}^2}} $, where $d_{M/\mathcal{F}}$ is the diameter of the leaf space, $M$ is isometric to a mapping torus of an isometry $\varphi:N\to N$ where $N$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature and $\mathcal{F}$ has the form $\{[\{\text{point}\}\times N]\}$.</description>
