      <title>Design and Linearity Assessment of the TRISTAN Detectors' Remote Analog to Digital Conversion DAQ System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TRISTAN detector is an upgrade to the KATRIN experiment to enable a differential measurement of the tritium $\beta$-decay spectrum to search for the experimental signature of keV scale sterile neutrinos. The TRISTAN detector upgrade consists of performing precision electron spectroscopy with over 1000 silicon drift detector pixels, each responsible for recording event rates of $10^5$ counts per second. A project specific data acquisition (DAQ) system is developed to meet the experimental challenges with a remote analog to digital conversion (RADC) design. In this work, the conceptual design of the RADC DAQ is presented along with the built system for operating the TRISTAN detector upgrade. The system includes flexible signal processing logic and data management that is optimized for the high-rate precision measurement. The non-linearity of the system's readout channels are measured and shown to be stable over time. The systematic effect of this non-linearity is propagated to the sensitivity to the sterile neutrino signature and is demonstrated to be reducible to a subdominant contribution.</description>

      <title>The Methodology and Implementation of a Real Time Monitoring System for Cryogenic Fridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the dilution refrigerator and magnet monitoring system developed for HAYSTAC at Yale University, Speller Lab at Johns Hopkins University developed the Fridge Real Time Monitoring System (FRTMS). The FRTMS accesses logs saved locally by the dilution refrigerator, saves these logs to various backup locations, edits the logs into a format for upload to a MySQL database, and allows the logs to be remotely monitored in near-real time.</description>

      <title>Dispersion in nonlinear interferometry: implications for optical coherence tomography with undetected photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear SU(1,1) quantum interferometers based on non-degenerate optical parametric down-conversion exhibit strong unbalanced group velocity dispersion (GVD). This feature is intrinsic to this type of interferometer as correlated photons of vastly different frequencies propagate through a dispersive nonlinear crystal; consequently, the dispersion arises from the source itself. The resulting GVD degrades the axial point-spread function (PSF) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) with undetected photons; and physical compensation is less straightforward, in particular for non-degenerate broadband regimes due to the limited number of suitable materials. In this contribution, we analyze dispersion in bulk nonlinear interferometry and describe its implications for OCT imaging. Aspects of hardware compensation are addressed, and a novel empirical numerical method of compensation is proposed. The approach is based on the extraction of the phase component directly from the time-domain modality (high precision linearized quantum Fourier transform infrared spectrometer) and its injection into the mid-IR spectral-domain OCT signals (central wavelength of around 3770 nm) before the Fourier transform. The proposed method is compared with an alternative numerical technique. The results demonstrate a 2.2-fold improvement in axial resolution and outperform the alternative correction method in overall imaging performance.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational wave background with equivalent configurations in the network of space based optical lattice clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The network of space based optical lattice clocks (OLCs) has been proposed to detect the stochastic gravitational wave background. We investigate the overlap reduction function (ORF) of the OLC detector network and analytically derive a transformation that leaves the ORF invariant. This transformation is applicable to configurations with two OLC detectors, each equipped with a one-way link. It can map a configuration with small separation and high noise correlation to another configuration with larger separation and reduced noise correlation. Using this transformation, we obtain a favourable OLC detector network configuration with high cross-correlation response, and compare its sensitivity to that of space-based laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Design and Measurements of Next-Generation 4H-SiC LGADs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This contribution presents the design, production, and initial testing of newly developed 4H-SiC Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs). The evaluation includes performance metrics such as the internal gain layer's efficiency in enhancing signal generation. Initial laboratory and Transient Current Technique (TCT) measurements provide insight into the device's stability and response to the signal.
  Due to the increase of availability provided by the industry, 4H-SiC is emerging as a strong candidate for the next-generation of semiconductor detectors. Such sensors are promising due to the inherent radiation tolerance of 4H-SiC and its stable operation across a wide temperature range. However, due to the wider-bandgap of 4H-SiC compared to standard silicon, and difficulty to produce high-quality layers thicker than 50 \textmu m, an internal charge multiplication layer needs to be introduced.
  The presented 4H-SiC LGADs, fabricated by onsemi, are optimized for an N-type substrate and epi wafer. The initial TCT and laboratory test results demonstrate fast charge collection and uniform multiplication across multiple samples produced on a single wafer.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for 3D Characterisation of AGATA Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise localisation of gamma-ray interactions is crucial for the performance of the Advanced GAmma Tracking Array (AGATA). The Pulse Shape Analysis (PSA) method used for the position estimation of gamma-ray interactions relies on a simulated signal database. The Pulse Shape Comparison Scanning (PSCS) method was used to scan AGATA crystals in order to produce an experimental database of signals. This paper presents a novel approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to determine the 3D interaction position of gamma rays within AGATA crystals, trained on data from IPHC Strasbourg, allowing for the construction of an experimental database. A custom masked loss function is introduced to enable training with incomplete position information. The database generated by this new method outperforms the existing simulated database, and the experimental database obtained from the conventional PSCS algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Intermediate Silicon Tracker (INTT), a two-layer barrel silicon strip tracker, is a key component of the tracking system for sPHENIX at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The INTT is designed to enable the association of reconstructed tracks with individual RHIC bunch crossings. To evaluate the performance of preproduction INTT ladders and the readout chain, a beam test was conducted at the Research Center for Accelerator and Radioisotope Science, Tohoku University, Japan. This paper presents the performance of the INTT evaluated through studies of the signal-to-noise ratio, residual distribution, spatial resolution, hit-detection efficiency, and multiple track reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Optimised neural networks for online processing of ATLAS calorimeter data on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A study of neural network architectures for the reconstruction of the energy deposited in the cells of the ATLAS liquid-argon calorimeters under high pile-up conditions expected at the HL-LHC is presented. These networks are designed to run on the FPGA-based readout hardware of the calorimeters under strict size and latency constraints. Several architectures, including Dense, Recurrent (RNN), and Convolutional (CNN) neural networks, are optimised using a Bayesian procedure that balances energy resolution against network size. The optimised Dense, CNN, and combined Dense+RNN architectures achieve a transverse energy resolution of approximately 80 MeV, outperforming both the optimal filtering (OF) method currently in use and RNNs of similar complexity. A detailed comparison across the full dynamic range shows that Dense, CNN, and Dense+RNN accurately reproduce the energy scale, while OF and RNNs underestimate the energy. Deep Evidential Regression is implemented within the Dense architecture to address the need for reliable per-event energy uncertainties. This approach provides predictive uncertainty estimates with minimal increase in network size. The predicted uncertainty is found to be consistent, on average, with the difference between the true deposited energy and the predicted energy.</description>

      <title>Characterization of thin optical filters for high purity Cherenkov light readout from scintillating crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hybrid dual-readout calorimeter concept, comprising both electromagnetic and hadronic sections, has recently been proposed to meet the performance requirements of experiments at future e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ colliders. The front compartment consists of a homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter made of high-density crystals, each coupled to a pair of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) providing the simultaneous readout of scintillation and Cherenkov light. To efficiently detect Cherenkov photons in the presence of dominant scintillation signals, an optical filter is placed in front of one of the two SiPMs to suppress photons in the wavelength region corresponding to that of scintillation emission. % In this study, PWO, BGO, and BSO crystals with different dimensions were tested to measure their scintillation light yield and decay time, as well as their transmission and emission spectra. A set of $\sim 100~\rm \mu m$-thick optical filters was also characterized by measuring their transmittance curves. The experimental results were used to model and estimate the expected filter performance in attenuating scintillation light for the various crystals. % The performance of each filter was experimentally validated by measuring the crystal light output with and without the filter using a $^{22}$Na radioactive source and a LYSO:Ce crystal, confirming the accuracy of the calculations. % The results show that interference filters are unsuitable for this application because their transmittance strongly depends on the photon incidence angle. Conversely, two absorptive long-pass filters with cutoff wavelengths around 590~nm were found to block more than 99\% of the scintillation light from PWO crystals, satisfying the calorimeter specifications.</description>

      <title>A rapid low-background assay of $^{210}$Pb in archaeological lead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a fast and highly efficient method for the measurement of $^{210}$Pb in metallic archaeological lead using the commercial low-background liquid scintillation counter Wallac Quantulus 1220 installed at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy). By combining an optimized chemical preparation with pulse-shape analysis (PSA), the technique achieves sensitivities at the level of a few $10^2$ mBq/kg within one week of measurement, using sample masses below 1 g. The method enables the simultaneous identification of the $\beta$ decays of $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Bi and the $\alpha$ decay of $^{210}$Po, allowing a direct verification of secular equilibrium within the decay chain. With extended acquisition times, detection limits below 100 mBq/kg are reached after approximately 40 days. This approach provides a rapid, accessible, and reliable tool for the radiopurity screening of lead, and is well suited for quality control and R&amp;D activities in next-generation low-background and rare-event physics experiments. Moreover, the method has the potential to be extended to other materials relevant for low-background applications.</description>
