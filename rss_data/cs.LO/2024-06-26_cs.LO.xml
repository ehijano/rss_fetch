      <title>A Strongly Normalising System of Dependent Types for Transparent and Opaque Probabilistic Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an extension of lambda-calculus with dependents types that enables us to encode transparent and opaque probabilistic programs and prove a strong normalisation result for it by a reducibility technique. While transparent non-deterministic programs are formalised in a rather usual way, opaque non-deterministic programs are formalised by introducing in the syntax oracle constants, the behaviour of which is governed by oracular functions. The generality of these functions and the fact that their values are determined by the form of the whole term inside which the relative oracle occurs also enable us to simulate learning-like behaviours.</description>

      <title>Pareto Fronts for Compositionally Solving String Diagrams of Parity Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open parity games are proposed as a compositional extension of parity games with algebraic operations, forming string diagrams of parity games. A potential application of string diagrams of parity games is to describe a large parity game with a given compositional structure and solve it efficiently as a divide-and-conquer algorithm by exploiting its compositional structure. Building on our recent progress in open Markov decision processes, we introduce Pareto fronts of open parity games, offering a framework for multi-objective solutions. We establish the positional determinacy of open parity games with respect to their Pareto fronts through a novel translation method. Our translation converts an open parity game into a parity game tailored to a given single-objective. Furthermore, we present a simple algorithm for solving open parity games, derived from this translation that allows the application of existing efficient algorithms for parity games. Expanding on this foundation, we develop a compositional algorithm for string diagrams of parity games.</description>

      <title>Positive and monotone fragments of FO and LTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the positive logic FO+ on finite words, and its fragments, pursuing and refining the work initiated in [Kuperberg 2023]. First, we transpose notorious logic equivalences into positive first-order logic: FO+ is equivalent to LTL+ , and its two-variable fragment FO2+ with (resp. without) successor available is equivalent to UTL+ with (resp. without) the "next" operator X available. This shows that despite previous negative results, the class of FO+-definable languages exhibits some form of robustness. We then exhibit an example of an FO-definable monotone language on one predicate, that is not FO+-definable, refining the example from [Kuperberg 2023] with 3 predicates. Moreover, we show that such a counter-example cannot be FO2-definable.</description>

      <title>Tolerance of Reinforcement Learning Controllers against Deviations in Cyber Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) with reinforcement learning (RL)-based controllers are increasingly being deployed in complex physical environments such as autonomous vehicles, the Internet-of-Things(IoT), and smart cities. An important property of a CPS is tolerance; i.e., its ability to function safely under possible disturbances and uncertainties in the actual operation. In this paper, we introduce a new, expressive notion of tolerance that describes how well a controller is capable of satisfying a desired system requirement, specified using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), under possible deviations in the system. Based on this definition, we propose a novel analysis problem, called the tolerance falsification problem, which involves finding small deviations that result in a violation of the given requirement. We present a novel, two-layer simulation-based analysis framework and a novel search heuristic for finding small tolerance violations. To evaluate our approach, we construct a set of benchmark problems where system parameters can be configured to represent different types of uncertainties and disturbancesin the system. Our evaluation shows that our falsification approach and heuristic can effectively find small tolerance violations.</description>

      <title>The Power of Counting Steps in Quantitative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study deterministic games of infinite duration played on graphs and focus on the strategy complexity of quantitative objectives. Such games are known to admit optimal memoryless strategies over finite graphs, but require infinite-memory strategies in general over infinite graphs.
  We provide new lower and upper bounds for the strategy complexity of mean-payoff and total-payoff objectives over infinite graphs, focusing on whether step-counter strategies (sometimes called Markov strategies) suffice to implement winning strategies. In particular, we show that over finitely branching arenas, three variants of limsup mean-payoff and total-payoff objectives admit winning strategies that are based either on a step counter or on a step counter and an additional bit of memory. Conversely, we show that for certain liminf total-payoff objectives, strategies resorting to a step counter and finite memory are not sufficient. For step-counter strategies, this settles the case of all classical quantitative objectives up to the second level of the Borel hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Understand DL-Lite Ontologies? An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant achievements in solving a wide range of tasks. Recently, LLMs' capability to store, retrieve and infer with symbolic knowledge has drawn a great deal of attention, showing their potential to understand structured information. However, it is not yet known whether LLMs can understand Description Logic (DL) ontologies. In this work, we empirically analyze the LLMs' capability of understanding DL-Lite ontologies covering 6 representative tasks from syntactic and semantic aspects. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate both the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs in understanding DL-Lite ontologies. We find that LLMs can understand formal syntax and model-theoretic semantics of concepts and roles. However, LLMs struggle with understanding TBox NI transitivity and handling ontologies with large ABoxes. We hope that our experiments and analyses provide more insights into LLMs and inspire to build more faithful knowledge engineering solutions.</description>

      <title>Towards Compositional Interpretability for XAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently based largely on black-box machine learning models which lack interpretability. The field of eXplainable AI (XAI) strives to address this major concern, being critical in high-stakes areas such as the finance, legal and health sectors.
  We present an approach to defining AI models and their interpretability based on category theory. For this we employ the notion of a compositional model, which sees a model in terms of formal string diagrams which capture its abstract structure together with its concrete implementation. This comprehensive view incorporates deterministic, probabilistic and quantum models. We compare a wide range of AI models as compositional models, including linear and rule-based models, (recurrent) neural networks, transformers, VAEs, and causal and DisCoCirc models.
  Next we give a definition of interpretation of a model in terms of its compositional structure, demonstrating how to analyse the interpretability of a model, and using this to clarify common themes in XAI. We find that what makes the standard 'intrinsically interpretable' models so transparent is brought out most clearly diagrammatically. This leads us to the more general notion of compositionally-interpretable (CI) models, which additionally include, for instance, causal, conceptual space, and DisCoCirc models.
  We next demonstrate the explainability benefits of CI models. Firstly, their compositional structure may allow the computation of other quantities of interest, and may facilitate inference from the model to the modelled phenomenon by matching its structure. Secondly, they allow for diagrammatic explanations for their behaviour, based on influence constraints, diagram surgery and rewrite explanations. Finally, we discuss many future directions for the approach, raising the question of how to learn such meaningfully structured models in practice.</description>

      <title>LLM-ARC: Enhancing LLMs with an Automated Reasoning Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LLM-ARC, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), by combining them with an Automated Reasoning Critic (ARC). LLM-ARC employs an Actor-Critic method where the LLM Actor generates declarative logic programs along with tests for semantic correctness, while the Automated Reasoning Critic evaluates the code, runs the tests and provides feedback on test failures for iterative refinement. Implemented using Answer Set Programming (ASP), LLM-ARC achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 88.32% on the FOLIO benchmark which tests complex logical reasoning capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over LLM-only baselines, highlighting the importance of logic test generation and iterative self-refinement. We achieve our best result using a fully automated self-supervised training loop where the Actor is trained on end-to-end dialog traces with Critic feedback. We discuss potential enhancements and provide a detailed error analysis, showcasing the robustness and efficacy of LLM-ARC for complex natural language reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Solving Hard Mizar Problems with Instantiation and Strategy Invention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove over 3000 previously ATP-unproved Mizar/MPTP problems by using several ATP and AI methods, raising the number of ATP-solved Mizar problems from 75\% to above 80\%. First, we start to experiment with the cvc5 SMT solver which uses several instantiation-based heuristics that differ from the superposition-based systems, that were previously applied to Mizar,and add many new solutions. Then we use automated strategy invention to develop cvc5 strategies that largely improve cvc5's performance on the hard problems. In particular, the best invented strategy solves over 14\% more problems than the best previously available cvc5 strategy. We also show that different clausification methods have a high impact on such instantiation-based methods, again producing many new solutions. In total, the methods solve 3021 (21.3\%) of the 14163 previously unsolved hard Mizar problems. This is a new milestone over the Mizar large-theory benchmark and a large strengthening of the hammer methods for Mizar.</description>

      <title>Alignment complete relational Hoare logics for some and all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10045v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In relational verification, judicious alignment of computational steps facilitates proof of relations between programs using simple relational assertions. Relational Hoare logics (RHL) provide compositional rules that embody various alignments of executions. Seemingly more flexible alignments can be expressed in terms of product automata based on program transition relations. A single degenerate alignment rule (self-composition), atop a complete Hoare logic, comprises a RHL for $\forall\forall$ properties that is complete in the ordinary logical sense (Cook'78). The notion of alignment completeness was previously proposed as a more satisfactory measure, and some rules were shown to be alignment complete with respect to a few ad hoc forms of alignment automata. This paper proves alignment completeness with respect to a general class of $\forall\forall$ alignment automata, for a RHL comprised of standard rules together with a rule of semantics-preserving rewrites based on Kleene algebra with tests. A new logic for $\forall\exists$ properties is introduced and shown to be alignment complete. The $\forall\forall$ and $\forall\exists$ automata are shown to be semantically complete. Thus the logics are both complete in the ordinary sense. Recent work by D'Osualdo et al highlights the importance of completeness relative to assumptions (which we term entailment completeness), and presents $\forall\forall$ examples seemingly beyond the scope of RHLs. Additional rules enable these examples to be proved in our RHL, shedding light on the open problem of entailment completeness.</description>

      <title>$\text{TT}^{\Box}_{\mathcal C}$: a Family of Extensional Type Theories with Effectful Realizers of Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\text{TT}^{\Box}_{{\mathcal C}}$ is a generic family of effectful, extensional type theories with a forcing interpretation parameterized by modalities. This paper identifies a subclass of $\text{TT}^{\Box}_{{\mathcal C}}$ theories that internally realizes continuity principles through stateful computations, such as reference cells. The principle of continuity is a seminal property that holds for a number of intuitionistic theories such as System T. Roughly speaking, it states that functions on real numbers only need approximations of these numbers to compute. Generally, continuity principles have been justified using semantical arguments, but it is known that the modulus of continuity of functions can be computed using effectful computations such as exceptions or reference cells. In this paper, the modulus of continuity of the functionals on the Baire space is directly computed using the stateful computations enabled internally in the theory.</description>

      <title>Robust non-computability of dynamical systems and computability of robust dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14448v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the relationship between the stability of the dynamical system $x^{\prime}=f(x)$ and the computability of its basins of attraction. We present a computable $C^{\infty}$ system $x^{\prime}=f(x)$ that possesses a computable and stable equilibrium point, yet whose basin of attraction is robustly non-computable in a neighborhood of $f$ in the sense that both the equilibrium point and the non-computability of its associated basin of attraction persist when $f$ is slightly perturbed. This indicates that local stability near a stable equilibrium point alone is insufficient to guarantee the computability of its basin of attraction. However, we also demonstrate that the basins of attraction associated with a structurally stable - globally stable (robust) - planar system defined on a compact set are computable. Our findings suggest that the global stability of a system and the compactness of the domain play a pivotal role in determining the computability of its basins of attraction.</description>

      <title>First-order Logic with Being a Thesis Modal Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce syntactic modal operator $\BOX$ for \textit{being a thesis} into first-order logic. This logic is a modern realization of R. Carnap's old ideas on modality, as logical necessity (J. Symb. Logic, 1946) \cite{Ca46}. We place it within the modern framework of quantified modal logic with a variant of possible world semantics with variable domains. We prove completeness using a kind of normal form and show that in the canonical frame, the relation on all maximal consistent sets, $R = \{\langle \Gamma, \Delta \rangle : \forall A (\BOX A \in \Gamma \Longrightarrow A \in \Delta)\}$, is a universal relation. The strength of the $\BOX$ operator is a proper extension of modal logic $\mathsf{S5}$. Using completeness, we prove that satisfiability in a model of $\BOX A$ under arbitrary valuation implies that $A$ is a thesis of formulated logic. So we can syntactically define logical entailment and consistency. Our semantics differ from S. Kripke's standard one \cite{Kr63} in syntax, semantics, and interpretation of the necessity operator. We also have free variables, contrary to Kripke's and Carnap's approaches, but our notion of substitution is non-standard (variables inside modalities are not free). All $\BOX$-free first-order theses are provable, as well as the Barcan formula and its converse. Our specific theses are \linebreak[4] $\BOX A \to \forall x A$, $\neg \BOX (x = y)$, $\neg \BOX \neg (x = y)$, $\neg \BOX P(x)$, $\neg \BOX \neg P(x)$. We also have $\POS \exists x A(x) \to \POS A(^{y}/_{x})$, and $\forall x \BOX A(x) \to \BOX A(^{y}/_{x})$, if $A$ is a $\BOX$-free formula.</description>
