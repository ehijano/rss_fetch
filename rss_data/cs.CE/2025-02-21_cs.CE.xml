      <title>ChemHTS: Hierarchical Tool Stacking for Enhancing Chemical Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in scientific research, particularly in chemistry-related tasks such as molecular design, reaction prediction, and property estimation. While tool-augmented LLMs have been introduced to enhance reasoning and computation in these domains, existing approaches suffer from tool invocation errors and lack effective collaboration among diverse tools, limiting their overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose ChemHTS (Chemical Hierarchical Tool Stacking), a novel method that optimizes tool invocation pathways through a hierarchical stacking strategy. ChemHTS consists of two key stages: tool self-stacking warmup and multi-layer decision optimization, enabling LLMs to refine tool usage dynamically. We evaluate ChemHTS across four classical chemistry tasks and demonstrate its superiority over strong baselines, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and chemistry-specific models, including ChemDFM. Furthermore, we define four distinct tool-stacking behaviors to enhance interpretability, providing insights into the effectiveness of tool collaboration. Our dataset and code are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Chang-pw/ChemHTS}.</description>

      <title>A Neural Operator-Based Emulator for Regional Shallow Water Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Accurate real-time forecasting of hydrodynamic processes in these areas is essential for infrastructure planning and climate adaptation. In this study, we present the Multiple-Input Temporal Operator Network (MITONet), a novel autoregressive neural emulator that employs dimensionality reduction to efficiently approximate high-dimensional numerical solvers for complex, nonlinear problems that are governed by time-dependent, parameterized partial differential equations. Although MITONet is applicable to a wide range of problems, we showcase its capabilities by forecasting regional tide-driven dynamics described by the two-dimensional shallow-water equations, while incorporating initial conditions, boundary conditions, and a varying domain parameter. We demonstrate MITONet's performance in a real-world application, highlighting its ability to make accurate predictions by extrapolating both in time and parametric space.</description>

      <title>A greedy non-intrusive reduced order model for shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.11329v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Models (NIROMs) that combine Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation method to construct efficient reduced order models for time-dependent problems arising in large scale environmental flow applications. The performance of the POD-RBF NIROM is compared with a traditional nonlinear POD (NPOD) model by evaluating the accuracy and robustness for test problems representative of riverine flows. Different greedy algorithms are studied in order to determine a near-optimal distribution of interpolation points for the RBF approximation. A new power-scaled residual greedy (psr-greedy) algorithm is proposed to address some of the primary drawbacks of the existing greedy approaches. The relative performances of these greedy algorithms are studied with numerical experiments using realistic two-dimensional (2D) shallow water flow applications involving coastal and riverine dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chasing the Timber Trail: Machine Learning to Reveal Harvest Location Misrepresentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Illegal logging poses a significant threat to global biodiversity, climate stability, and depresses international prices for legal wood harvesting and responsible forest products trade, affecting livelihoods and communities across the globe. Stable isotope ratio analysis (SIRA) is rapidly becoming an important tool for determining the harvest location of traded, organic, products. The spatial pattern in stable isotope ratio values depends on factors such as atmospheric and environmental conditions and can thus be used for geographical identification. We present here the results of a deployed machine learning pipeline where we leverage both isotope values and atmospheric variables to determine timber harvest location. Additionally, the pipeline incorporates uncertainty estimation to facilitate the interpretation of harvest location determination for analysts. We present our experiments on a collection of oak (Quercus spp.) tree samples from its global range. Our pipeline outperforms comparable state-of-the-art models determining geographic harvest origin of commercially traded wood products, and has been used by European enforcement agencies to identify illicit Russian and Belarusian timber entering the EU market. We also identify opportunities for further advancement of our framework and how it can be generalized to help identify the origin of falsely labeled organic products throughout the supply chain.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Parameter Inference and Uncertainty Quantification for a Computational Pulmonary Hemodynamics Model Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patient-specific modeling is a valuable tool in cardiovascular disease research, offering insights beyond what current clinical equipment can measure. Given the limitations of available clinical data, models that incorporate uncertainty can provide clinicians with better guidance for tailored treatments. However, such modeling must align with clinical time frameworks to ensure practical applicability. In this study, we employ a one-dimensional fluid dynamics model integrated with data from a canine model of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) to investigate microvascular disease, which is believed to involve complex mechanisms. To enhance computational efficiency during model calibration, we implement a Gaussian process emulator. This approach enables us to explore the relationship between disease severity and microvascular parameters, offering new insights into the progression and treatment of CTEPH in a timeframe that is compatible with a reasonable clinical timeframe.</description>

      <title>Cardiac Evidence Backtracking for Eating Behavior Monitoring using Collocative Electrocardiogram Imagining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eating monitoring has remained an open challenge in medical research for years due to the lack of non-invasive sensors for continuous monitoring and the reliable methods for automatic behavior detection. In this paper, we present a pilot study using the wearable 24-hour ECG for sensing and tailoring the sophisticated deep learning for ad-hoc and interpretable detection. This is accomplished using a collocative learning framework in which 1) we construct collocative tensors as pseudo-images from 1D ECG signals to improve the feasibility of 2D image-based deep models; 2) we formulate the cardiac logic of analyzing the ECG data in a comparative way as periodic attention regulators so as to guide the deep inference to collect evidence in a human comprehensible manner; and 3) we improve the interpretability of the framework by enabling the backtracking of evidence with a set of methods designed for Class Activation Mapping (CAM) decoding and decision tree/forest generation. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been validated on the largest ECG dataset of eating behavior with superior performance over conventional models, and its capacity of cardiac evidence mining has also been verified through the consistency of the evidence it backtracked and that of the previous medical studies.</description>

      <title>Stories that (are) Move(d by) Markets: A Causal Exploration of Market Shocks and Semantic Shifts across Different Partisan Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macroeconomic fluctuations and the narratives that shape them form a mutually reinforcing cycle: public discourse can spur behavioural changes leading to economic shifts, which then result in changes in the stories that propagate. We show that shifts in semantic embedding space can be causally linked to financial market shocks -- deviations from the expected market behaviour. Furthermore, we show how partisanship can influence the predictive power of text for market fluctuations and shape reactions to those same shocks. We also provide some evidence that text-based signals are particularly salient during unexpected events such as COVID-19, highlighting the value of language data as an exogenous variable in economic forecasting. Our findings underscore the bidirectional relationship between news outlets and market shocks, offering a novel empirical approach to studying their effect on each other.</description>

      <title>Predicting Filter Medium Performances in Chamber Filter Presses with Digital Twins Using Neural Network Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient solid-liquid separation is crucial in industries like mining, but traditional chamber filter presses depend heavily on manual monitoring, leading to inefficiencies, downtime, and resource wastage. This paper introduces a machine learning-powered digital twin framework to improve operational flexibility and predictive control. A key challenge addressed is the degradation of the filter medium due to repeated cycles and clogging, which reduces filtration efficiency. To solve this, a neural network-based predictive model was developed to forecast operational parameters, such as pressure and flow rates, under various conditions. This predictive capability allows for optimized filtration cycles, reduced downtime, and improved process efficiency. Additionally, the model predicts the filter mediums lifespan, aiding in maintenance planning and resource sustainability. The digital twin framework enables seamless data exchange between filter press sensors and the predictive model, ensuring continuous updates to the training data and enhancing accuracy over time. Two neural network architectures, feedforward and recurrent, were evaluated. The recurrent neural network outperformed the feedforward model, demonstrating superior generalization. It achieved a relative $L^2$-norm error of $5\%$ for pressure and $9.3\%$ for flow rate prediction on partially known data. For completely unknown data, the relative errors were $18.4\%$ and $15.4\%$, respectively. Qualitative analysis showed strong alignment between predicted and measured data, with deviations within a confidence band of $8.2\%$ for pressure and $4.8\%$ for flow rate predictions. This work contributes an accurate predictive model, a new approach to predicting filter medium cycle impacts, and a real-time interface for model updates, ensuring adaptability to changing operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Explicit adaptive time stepping for the Cahn-Hilliard equation by exponential Krylov subspace and Chebyshev polynomial methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard equation has been widely employed within various mathematical models in physics, chemistry and engineering. Explicit stabilized time stepping methods can be attractive for time integration of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, especially on parallel and hybrid supercomputers. In this paper, we propose an exponential time integration method for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and describe its efficient Krylov subspace based implementation. We compare the method to a Chebyshev polynomial local iteration modified (LIM) time stepping scheme. Both methods are explicit (i.e., do not involve linear system solution) and tested with both constant and adaptively chosen time steps.</description>

      <title>An enhanced single Gaussian point continuum finite element formulation using automatic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This contribution presents an improved low-order 3D finite element formulation with hourglass stabilization using automatic differentiation (AD). Here, the former Q1STc formulation is enhanced by an approximation-free computation of the inverse Jacobian. To this end, AD tools automate the computation and allow a direct evaluation of the inverse Jacobian, bypassing the need for a Taylor series expansion. Thus, the enhanced version, Q1STc+, is introduced. Numerical examples are conducted to compare the performance of both element formulations for finite strain applications, with particular focus on distorted meshes. Moreover, the performance of the new element formulation for an elasto-plastic material is investigated. To validate the obtained results, a volumetric locking-free element based on scaled boundary parametrization is used. Both the implementation of the element routine Q1STc+ and the corresponding material subroutine are made accessible to the public at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14259791</description>

      <title>ParetoFlow: Guided Flows in Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In offline multi-objective optimization (MOO), we leverage an offline dataset of designs and their associated labels to simultaneously minimize multiple objectives. This setting more closely mirrors complex real-world problems compared to single-objective optimization. Recent works mainly employ evolutionary algorithms and Bayesian optimization, with limited attention given to the generative modeling capabilities inherent in such data. In this study, we explore generative modeling in offline MOO through flow matching, noted for its effectiveness and efficiency. We introduce ParetoFlow, specifically designed to guide flow sampling to approximate the Pareto front. Traditional predictor (classifier) guidance is inadequate for this purpose because it models only a single objective. In response, we propose a multi-objective predictor guidance module that assigns each sample a weight vector, representing a weighted distribution across multiple objective predictions. A local filtering scheme is introduced to address non-convex Pareto fronts. These weights uniformly cover the entire objective space, effectively directing sample generation towards the Pareto front. Since distributions with similar weights tend to generate similar samples, we introduce a neighboring evolution module to foster knowledge sharing among neighboring distributions. This module generates offspring from these distributions, and selects the most promising one for the next iteration. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks.</description>
