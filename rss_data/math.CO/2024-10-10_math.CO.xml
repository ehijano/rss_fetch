      <title>Genus distribution polynomials for bicellular bicolored maps all with real zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 1960s, enumerating bicolored maps (thus maps) according to the numbers (and possibly types) of edges, faces, white vertices, black vertices and genus has been an important topic arising in many fields of mathematics and physics. To the best of our knowledge, no explicit formulas are known for the number of bicolored maps given the first four parameters unless the given number of faces is one. There is actually a vast literature for the one-face case. In particular, Jackson (1987), Zagier (1995) and Stanley (2011) respectively obtained some expressions for the generating polynomial of the numbers of one-face bicolored maps with given number of edges and white vertex degree distribution while tracking the number of black vertices. In this paper, we obtain an explicit formula for the corresponding generating polynomial for that of bicolored maps with two faces, i.e., bicellular, one face of length $p$ and the other of length $n-p$. We also prove that the polynomial essentially has only real zeros and thus the log-concavity of the counting sequence.</description>

      <title>On the Average Resistance of n-circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $n$-circuits are series-parallel networks composed of exactly $n$ unit resistors. This paper is focused on evaluating the mean resistance of all $n$-circuits, $M_n$, establishing that it lies between $1$ and $4.3954$ for all $n$. We ultimately conjecture that $M_n$ converges to $1.25$ as $n$ grows, based on computational analysis and other intuitive arguments. Although the number of $n$-circuits has been explored quite thoroughly, this paper also provides complete proofs of some important results.</description>

      <title>Isometric embeddings of resonance graphs as finite distributive lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a plane bipartite graph and $\mathcal{M}(G)$ be the set of all perfect matchings of $G$. The resonance graph $R(G)$ is a graph whose vertex set is $\mathcal{M}(G)$, and two perfect matchings are adjacent in $R(G)$ if their symmetric difference is a cycle forming the periphery of a finite face of $G$. It is known that any connected resonance graph can be isometrically embedded as a finite distributive lattice into hypercubes. The isometric dimension of a connected $R(G)$, denoted by $\mathrm{idim}(R(G))$, is the smallest dimension of a hypercube that $R(G)$ can be isometrically embedded into. Let $d$ be the number of finite faces of $G$ such that there are no forbidden edges on their peripheries. We show that any connected $R(G)$ has $\mathrm{idim}(R(G)) \ge d$ and provide characterizations on when the equality holds. Moreover, if a connected $R(G)$ has $\mathrm{idim}(R(G)) = d$, then we design an algorithm to generate a binary coding of length $d$ for all perfect matchings of $G$ which induces an isometric embedding of $R(G)$ as a finite distributive lattice into a $d$-dimensional hypercube without generating $\mathcal{M}(G)$. Our results provide answers for the fundamental cases of both open questions raised in [\textit{SIAM J. Discrete Math.} {\bf 22} (2008) 971--984.]</description>

      <title>Reconfigurations of Plane Caterpillars and Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a point set in the plane, $\mathcal{P}(S)$ and $\mathcal{C}(S)$ sets of all plane spanning paths and caterpillars on $S$. We study reconfiguration operations on $\mathcal{P}(S)$ and $\mathcal{C}(S)$. In particular, we prove that all of the commonly studied reconfigurations on plane spanning trees still yield connected reconfiguration graphs for caterpillars when $S$ is in convex position. If $S$ is in general position, we show that the rotation, compatible flip and flip graphs of $\mathcal{C}(S)$ are connected while the slide graph is disconnected. For paths, we prove the existence of a connected component of size at least $2^{n-1}$ and that no component of size at most $7$ can exist in the flip graph on $\mathcal{P}(S)$.</description>

      <title>The construction of a class of presentations for Specht modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build on the methods introduced by Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley, and Wachs, and further developed by Brauner and Friedmann, to construct additional classes of presentations of Specht modules. We obtain these presentations by defining a linear operator which is a symmetrized sum of dual Garnir relations on the space of column tabloids. Our presentations apply to the vast majority of shapes of Specht modules.</description>

      <title>The (Symbolic and Numeric) Computational Challenges of Counting 0-1 Balanced Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chessboard has the property that every row and every column has as many white squares as black squares. In this mostly methodological note, we address the problem of counting such rectangular arrays with a fixed (numeric) number of rows, but an arbitrary (symbolic) number of columns. We first address the ``vanilla" problem where there are no restrictions, and then go on to discuss the still-more-challenging problem of counting such binary arrays that are not permitted to contain a specified (finite) set of horizontal patterns, and a specified set of vertical patterns. While we can rigorously prove that each such sequence satisfies some linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients, actually finding these recurrences poses major {\it symbolic}-computational challenges, that we can only meet in some small cases. In fact, just generating as many as possible terms of these sequences is a big {\it numeric}-computational challenge. This was tackled by computer whiz Ron H. Hardin, who contributed several such sequences, and computed quite a few terms of each. We extend Hardin's sequences quite considerably. We also talk about the much easier problem of counting such restricted arrays without balance conditions.</description>

      <title>Minimally rigid tensegrity frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional tensegrity framework $(T,p)$ is an edge-labeled geometric graph in ${\mathbb R}^d$, which consists of a graph $T=(V,B\cup C\cup S)$ and a map $p:V\to {\mathbb R}^d$. The labels determine whether an edge $uv$ of $T$ corresponds to a fixed length bar in $(T,p)$, or a cable which cannot increase in length, or a strut which cannot decrease in length.
  We consider minimally infinitesimally rigid $d$-dimensional tensegrity frameworks and provide tight upper bounds on the number of its edges, in terms of the number of vertices and the dimension $d$. We obtain stronger upper bounds in the case when there are no bars and the framework is in generic position. The proofs use methods from convex geometry and matroid theory. A special case of our results confirms a conjecture of Whiteley from 1987. We also give an affirmative answer to a conjecture concerning the number of edges of a graph whose three-dimensional rigidity matroid is minimally connected.</description>

We consider the analogous Tur\'{a}n problems on hypergraphs with bounded matching number, and we obtain some exact results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutations are usually enumerated by size, but new results can be found by enumerating them by inversions instead, in which case one must restrict one's attention to indecomposable permutations. In the style of the seminal paper by Simion and Schmidt, we investigate all combinations of permutation patterns of length at most 3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $d\geq 2$ and any norm on $\mathbb R^d$, we prove that there exists a set of $n$ points that spans at least $(\tfrac d2-o(1))n\log_2n$ unit distances under this norm for every $n$. This matches the upper bound recently proved by Alon, Buci\'c, and Sauermann for typical norms (in the sense of the Baire category theorem). We also show that for $d\geq 3$ and a typical norm on $\mathbb R^d$, the unit distance graph of this norm contains a copy of $K_{d,m}$ for all $m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Along with his confirmation of the $e$-positivity of all cycle-chord graphs $\theta_{ab1}$, the third author conjectured the $e$-positivity of all theta graphs $\theta_{abc}$. In this paper, we establish the $e$-positivity of all clock graphs $\theta_{ab2}$ by using the composition method. The key idea is to investigate the fibers of certain partial reversal transformation on compositions with all parts at least $2$.</description>

      <title>Eigenvectors of the De Bruijn Graph Laplacian: A Natural Basis for the Cut and Cycle Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Laplacian of the undirected De Bruijn graph over an alphabet $A$ of order $k$. While the eigenvalues of this Laplacian were found in 1998 by Delorme and Tillich [1], an explicit description of its eigenvectors has remained elusive. In this work, we find these eigenvectors in closed form and show that they yield a natural and canonical basis for the cut- and cycle-spaces of De Bruijn graphs. Remarkably, we find that the cycle basis we construct is a basis for the cycle space of both the undirected and the directed De Bruijn graph. This is done by developing an analogue of the Fourier transform on the De Bruijn graph, which acts to diagonalize the Laplacian. Moreover, we show that the cycle-space of De Bruijn graphs, when considering all possible orders of $k$ simultaneously, contains a rich algebraic structure, that of a graded Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Bipartite and Euclidean Gallai-Ramsey Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the following Gallai-Ramsey question: how large must a complete bipartite graph $K_{n_1, n_2}$ be before any coloring of its edges with $r$ colors contains either a monochromatic copy of $G = K_{s,t}$ or a rainbow copy of $H = K_{s,t}$? We demonstrate that the answer is linear in $r$, and provide more precise bounds for the specific case $s = 2$. Furthermore, we also consider the following Euclidean Gallai-Ramsey question: given a configuration $H$ in Euclidean space, what is the smallest $n$ such that any $r$-coloring of $n$-dimensional Euclidean space contains a monochromatic or rainbow configuration congruent to $H$? Through a natural translation between edge colorings of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n_1,n_2}$ and colorings of a subset of $(n_1+n_2)$-dimensional Euclidean space, we prove new upper bounds on $n$ for some configurations which can be expressed as Cartesian products of simplices.</description>

      <title>The maximum spectral radius of $\theta_{1,3,3}$-free graphs with given size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be $F$-free if it does not contain $F$ as a subgraph. A theta graph, say $\theta_{l_1,l_2,l_3}$, is the graph obtained by connecting two distinct vertices with three internally disjoint paths of length $l_1, l_2, l_3$, where $l_1\leq l_2\leq l_3$ and $l_2\geq2$. Recently, Li, Zhao and Zou [arXiv:2409.15918v1] characterized the $\theta_{1,p,q}$-free graph of size $m$ having the largest spectral radius, where $q\geq p\geq3$ and $p+q\geq2k+1\geq7$, and proposed a problem on characterizing the graphs with the maximum spectral radius among $\theta_{1,3,3}$-free graphs. In this paper, we consider this problem and determine the maximum spectral radius of $\theta_{1,3,3}$-free graphs with size $m$ and characterize the extremal graph. Up to now, all the graphs in $\mathcal{G}(m,\theta_{1,p,q})$ which have the largest spectral radius have been determined, where $q\geq p\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Graphs with nonnegative resistance curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces and studies a new class of graphs motivated by discrete curvature. We call a graph resistance nonnegative if there exists a distribution on its spanning trees such that every vertex has expected degree at most two in a random spanning tree; these are precisely the graphs that admit a metric with nonnegative resistance curvature, a discrete curvature introduced by Devriendt and Lambiotte. We show that this class of graphs lies between Hamiltonian and $1$-tough graphs and, surprisingly, that a graph is resistance nonnegative if and only if its twice-dilated matching polytope intersects the interior of its spanning tree polytope. We study further characterizations and basic properties of resistance nonnegative graphs and pose several questions for future research.</description>

      <title>Solutions for $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers using Fuss-Catalan numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new expressions for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers, say $F_k(n)$.
  They satisfy the recurrence $F_k(n) = F_k(n-1) +\dots+F_k(n-k)$.
  Explicit expressions for the roots of the auxiliary (or characteristic) polynomial are presented, using Fuss-Catalan numbers.
  Properties of the roots are enumerated.
  We quantify the accuracy of asymptotic approximations for $F_k(n)$ for $n\gg1$.
  Our results subsume and extend some results published by previous authors.
  We also comment on the use of multinomial sums for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers and related sequences.
  We also employ the generating function to express $F_k(n)$ as a concise (non-nested) sum of binomial coefficients for arbitrary $k$.
  Finally, we present a basis (or `fundamental solutions') to solve the above recurrence for arbitrary initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Generic infinitesimal rigidity for rotational groups in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish combinatorial characterisations of symmetry-generic infinitesimally rigid frameworks in the Euclidean plane for rotational groups of order 4 and 6, and of odd order between 5 and 1000, where a joint may lie at the centre of rotation. This extends the corresponding results for these groups in the free action case obtained by R. Ikeshita and S. Tanigawa in 2015, and our recent results for the reflection group and the rotational groups of order 2 and 3 in the non-free action case. The characterisations are given in terms of sparsity counts on the corresponding group-labelled quotient graphs, and are obtained via symmetry-adapted versions of recursive Henneberg-type graph constructions. For rotational groups of even order at least 8, we show that the sparsity counts alone are not sufficient for symmetry-generic infinitesimal rigidity.</description>

      <title>Blocking Planes by Lines in $\operatorname{PG}(n,q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the cardinality of the smallest set of lines of the finite projective spaces $\operatorname{PG}(n,q)$ such that every plane is incident with at least one line of the set. This is the first main open problem concerning the minimum size of $(s,t)$-blocking sets in $\operatorname{PG}(n,q)$, where we set $s=2$ and $t=1$. In $\operatorname{PG}(n,q)$, an $(s,t)$-blocking set refers to a set of $t$-spaces such that each $s$-space is incident with at least one chosen $t$-space. This is a notoriously difficult problem, as it is equivalent to determining the size of certain $q$-Tur\'an designs and $q$-covering designs. We present an improvement on the upper bounds of Etzion and of Metsch via a refined scheme for a recursive construction, which in fact enables improvement in the general case as well.</description>

      <title>Switching methods of level 2 for the construction of cospectral graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A switching method is a graph operation that results in cospectral graphs (graphs with the same spectrum). Work by Wang and Xu [Discrete Math. 310 (2010)] suggests that most cospectral graphs with cospectral complements can be constructed using regular orthogonal matrices of level 2, which has relevance for Haemers' conjecture. We present two new switching methods and several combinatorial and geometrical reformulations of existing switching operations of level 2. We also introduce the concept of reducibility and use it to classify all irreducible switching methods that correspond to a conjugation with a regular orthogonal matrix of level 2 with one nontrivial indecomposable block, up to switching sets of size 12, extending previous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use algebraic methods in statistical mechanics to represent a multi-parameter class of polynomials in severable variables as partition functions of a new family of solvable lattice models. The class of polynomials, defined by A.N. Kirillov, is derived from the largest class of divided difference operators satisfying the braid relations of Cartan type $A$. It includes as specializations Schubert, Grothendieck, and dual-Grothendieck polynomials among others. In particular, our results prove positivity conjectures of Kirillov for the subfamily of Hecke--Grothendieck polynomials, while the larger family is shown to exhibit rare instances of negative coefficients.</description>

      <title>A uniform bound on almost colour-balanced perfect matchings in colour-balanced cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-colouring of a graph $G$ is said to be colour-balanced if there are equally many edges of each available colour. We are interested in finding a colour-balanced perfect matching within a colour-balanced clique $K_{2nk}$ with a palette of $k$ colours. While it is not necessarily possible to find such a perfect matching, one can ask for a perfect matching as close to colour-balanced as possible. In particular, for a colouring $c:E(K_{2nk})\rightarrow [k]$, we seek to find a perfect matching $M$ minimising $f(M) = \sum_{i=1}^k\bigl||c^{-1}(i)\cap M|-n\bigr|$.
  The previous best upper bound, due to Pardey and Rautenbach, was $\min f(M)\leq \mathcal{O}(k\sqrt{nk\log k})$. We remove the $n$-dependence, proving the existence of a matching $M$ with $f(M)\leq 4^{k^2}$ for all $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new formula for double Grothendieck polynomials based on Magyar's orthodontia algorithm for diagrams. Our formula implies a similar formula for double Schubert polynomials $\mathfrak S_w(\mathbf x;\mathbf y)$. We also prove a curious positivity result: for vexillary permutations $w\in S_n$, the polynomial $x_1^n\dots x_n^n \mathfrak S_w(x_n^{-1}, \dots, x_1^{-1}; 1,\dots,1)$ is a graded nonnegative sum of Lascoux polynomials. We conjecture that this positivity result holds for all $w\in S_n$. This conjecture would follow from a problem of independent interest regarding Lascoux positivity of certain products of Lascoux polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a parking function, a lucky car is a car that parks in its preferred parking spot and the parking outcome is the permutation encoding the order in which the cars park on the street. We give a characterization for the set of parking outcomes arising from parking functions with a fixed set of lucky cars. This characterization involves the descent bottom set of a permutation, and we use the characterization to we give a formula for the number of parking functions with a fixed set of lucky cars. Our work includes the cases where the number of cars is equal to the number of parking spots, and where there are more spots than cars. We also give product formulas for the number of weakly increasing parking functions having a fixed set of lucky cars, and when the number of cars equals the number of spots this is a product of Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>Hall-Littlewood polynomials, affine Schubert series, and lattice enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce multivariate rational generating series called Hall-Littlewood-Schubert ($\mathsf{HLS}_n$) series. They are defined in terms of polynomials related to Hall-Littlewood polynomials and semistandard Young tableaux. We show that $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series provide solutions to a range of enumeration problems upon judicious substitutions of their variables. These include the problem to enumerate sublattices of a $p$-adic lattice according to the elementary divisor types of their intersections with the members of a complete flag of reference in the ambient lattice. This is an affine analog of the stratification of Grassmannians by Schubert varieties. Other substitutions of $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series yield new formulae for Hecke series and $p$-adic integrals associated with symplectic $p$-adic groups, and combinatorially defined quiver representation zeta functions. $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series are $q$-analogs of Hilbert series of Stanley-Reisner rings associated with posets arising from parabolic quotients of Coxeter groups of type $\mathsf{B}$ with the Bruhat order. Special values of coarsened $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series yield analogs of the classical Littlewood identity for the generating functions of Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>Poset topology, moves, and Bruhat interval polytope lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the poset topology of lattices arising from orientations of 1-skeleta of directionally simple polytopes, with Bruhat interval polytopes $Q_{e,w}$ as our main example. We show that the order complex $\Delta ((u,v)_w)$ of an interval therein is homotopy equivalent to a sphere if $Q_{u,v}$ is a face of $Q_{e,w}$ and is otherwise contractible. This significantly generalizes the known case of the permutahedron. We also show that saturated chains from $u$ to $v$ in such lattices are connected, and in fact highly connected, under moves corresponding to flipping across a 2-face. When $w$ is a Grassmannian permutation, this implies a strengthening of the restriction of Postnikov's move-equivalence theorem to the class of BCFW bridge decomposable plabic graphs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there are $f$-vectors of balanced simplicial complexes giving a source of simplicial complexes exhibiting Boolean a decomposition similar to a geometric Lefschetz decomposition. The objects we are working with are $h$-vectors of flag spheres and balanced simplicial complexes whose $f$-vectors are equal to them. This builds on work of Nevo-Petersen-Tenner on a conjecture of Nevo-Petersen that the gamma vector of an odd-dimensional flag sphere is the $f$-vector of a balanced simplicial complex (which was for barycentric subdivisions by Nevo-Petersen-Tenner). We can connect our decomposition to positivity questions on reciprocal/palindromic polynomials associated to flag spheres and geometric questions motivating them. In addition, we note that that the degrees in the Lefschetz-like decomposition are not halved unlike the usual $h$-vector setting.</description>

We also compute the gonality sequence of $\Gamma$ and we prove it is divisorial complete. We prove that a general Martens-special discrete chain of cycles $G$ of type $k$ has the same gonality sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical.</description>

      <title>Geometric structure and transversal logic of quantum Reed-Muller codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient and noise-tolerant quantum computation protocols generally begins with an understanding of quantum error-correcting codes and their native logical operations. The simplest class of native operations are transversal gates, which are naturally fault-tolerant. In this paper, we aim to characterize the transversal gates of quantum Reed-Muller (RM) codes by exploiting the well-studied properties of their classical counterparts. We start our work by establishing a new geometric characterization of quantum RM codes via the Boolean hypercube and its associated subcube complex. More specifically, a set of stabilizer generators for a quantum RM code can be described via transversal $X$ and $Z$ operators acting on subcubes of particular dimensions. This characterization leads us to define subcube operators composed of single-qubit $\pi/2^k$ $Z$-rotations that act on subcubes of given dimensions. We first characterize the action of subcube operators on the code space: depending on the dimension of the subcube, these operators either (1) act as a logical identity on the code space, (2) implement non-trivial logic, or (3) rotate a state away from the code space. Second, and more remarkably, we uncover that the logic implemented by these operators corresponds to circuits of multi-controlled-$Z$ gates that have an explicit and simple combinatorial description. Overall, this suite of results yields a comprehensive understanding of a class of natural transversal operators for quantum RM codes.</description>

      <title>Modularity maximization and community detection in complex networks through recursive and hierarchical annealing in the D-Wave Advantage quantum processing units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic optimization has long been expected to outperform classical methods in solving NP-type problems. While this has been proven in certain experiments, its main applications still reside in academic problems where the size of the system to be solved would not represent an obstacle to any modern desktop computer. Here we develop a systematic procedure to find the global optima of the modularity function to discover community structure in complex networks solely relying on pure annealers rather than hybrid solutions. We bypass the one-hot encoding constraints by hierarchically and recursively encoding binary instances of the problem that can be solved without the need to guess the exact penalties for the Lagrange multipliers. We study the variability, and robustness of the annealer as a function of network size, directness of connections, topology, and the resolution of the communities. We show how our approach produces meaningful and at least equally optimal solutions to state-of-the-art community detection algorithms while maintaining tractable computing times. Lastly, due to its recursive nature, the annealing process returns intermediate subdivisions thus offering interpretable rather than black-box solutions. These \textit{dendrograms} can be used to unveil normal and pathological hidden hierarchies in brain networks hence opening the door to clinical workflows. Overall, this represents a first step towards an applicable practice-oriented usage of pure quantum annealing potentially bridging two segregated communities in modern science and engineering; that of network science and quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: This is a slightly edited translation of a paper in Dutch which appeared in Nieuw Archief voor Wiskunde (5) 25 (2024), No.2, 87-90 on the occasion of I.G. Macdonald's death in 2023, and aimed at a very broad mathematical audience. First we review some of Macdonald's most important older results. Then we focus on the period 1985-1995 when Macdonald often visited the Netherlands and there was much interaction between his work, notably the Macdonald polynomials, and the work by the authors. We end with some glimpses about Macdonald as a person.</description>

      <title>Classification of weak Bruhat interval modules of $0$-Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak Bruhat interval modules of the $0$-Hecke algebra in type $A$ provide a uniform approach to studying modules associated with noteworthy families of quasisymmetric functions. Recently this kind of modules were generalized from type $A$ to all Coxeter types. In this paper, we give an equivalent description, in a type-independent manner, when two left weak Bruhat intervals in a Coxeter group are descent-preserving isomorphic. As an application, we classify all left weak Bruhat interval modules of $0$-Hecke algebras up to isomorphism, and thereby answer an open question and resolve in the affirmative a conjecture of Jung, Kim, Lee, and Oh. Additionally, for finite Coxeter groups we show that the set of minimum (or maximum) elements of all left weak Bruhat intervals in each descent-preserving isomorphism class forms an interval under the right weak Bruhat order.</description>

      <title>Binary geometries from pellytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary geometries have recently been introduced in particle physics in connection with stringy integrals. In this work, we study a class of simple polytopes, called \emph{pellytopes}, whose number of vertices are given by Pell's numbers. We provide a new family of binary geometries determined by pellytopes as conjectured by He--Li--Raman--Zhang. We relate this family to the moduli space of curves by comparing the pellytope to the ABHY associahedron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopf algebroids are generalizations of Hopf algebras to less commutative settings. We show how the comultiplication defined by Kostant and Kumar turns the affine nil Hecke algebra associated to a Coxeter system a into Hopf algebroid without an antipode. The proof relies on mixed dihedral braid relations between Demazure operators and simple reflections. For researchers new to Hopf algebroids we include several additional examples from ring theory, representation theory and algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Dirac Traces and the Tutte Polynomial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbative calculations involving fermion loops in quantum field theories require tracing over Dirac matrices. A simple way to regulate the divergences that generically appear in these calculations is dimensional regularisation, which has the consequence of replacing 4-dimensional Dirac matrices with d-dimensional counterparts for arbitrary complex values of d. In this work, a connection between traces of d-dimensional Dirac matrices and computations of the Tutte polynomial of associated graphs is proven. The time complexity of computing Dirac traces is analysed by this connection, and improvements to algorithms for computing Dirac traces are proposed.</description>

Abstract: We construct, for every $d \geq 3$, a $d$-regular acyclic measurably bipartite graphing that admits no measurable perfect matching, resolving a problem of Kechris and Marks.
  A dense variant of our construction yields a coupling of two standard Borel probability measure spaces whose support contains no deterministic coupling, though the conditional probabilities of the coupling measure are atomless. This refutes a conjecture of Gurel-Gurevich and Peled.</description>

      <title>Radio labelling of two-branch trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A radio labelling of a graph $G$ is a mapping $f : V(G) \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2,\ldots\}$ such that $|f(u)-f(v)| \geq diam(G) + 1 - d(u,v)$ for every pair of distinct vertices $u,v$ of $G$, where $diam(G)$ is the diameter of $G$ and $d(u,v)$ is the distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$. The radio number $rn(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a radio labelling $f$ with $\max\{f(v):v \in V(G)\} = k$. The weight of a tree $T$ from a vertex $v \in V(T)$ is the sum of the distances in $T$ from $v$ to all other vertices, and a vertex of $T$ achieving the minimum weight is called a weight center of $T$. It is known that any tree has one or two weight centers. A tree is called a two-branch tree if the removal of all its weight centers results in a forest with exactly two components. In this paper we obtain a sharp lower bound for the radio number of two-branch trees which improves a known lower bound for general trees. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for this improved lower bound to be achieved. Using these results, we determine the radio number of two families of level-wise regular two-branch trees.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional expanders from Kac--Moody--Steinberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional expanders are a generalization of the notion of expander graphs to simplicial complexes and give rise to a variety of applications in computer science and other fields. We provide a general tool to construct families of bounded degree high-dimensional spectral expanders. Inspired by the work of Kaufman and Oppenheim, we use coset complexes over quotients of Kac-Moody-Steinberg groups of rank $d+1$, $d$-spherical and purely $d$-spherical. We prove that infinite families of such quotients exist provided that the underlying field is of size at least 4 and the Kac-Moody-Steinberg group is 2-spherical, giving rise to new families of bounded degree high-dimensional expanders. In the case the generalized Cartan matrix we consider is affine, we recover the construction of O'Donnell and Pratt from 2022, (and thus also the one of Kaufman and Oppenheim) by considering Chevalley groups as quotients of affine Kac-Moody-Steinberg groups. Moreover, our construction applies to the case where the root system is of type $\tilde{G}_2$, a case that was not covered in earlier works.</description>

      <title>Effect of graph operations on graph associahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, we determine the structure of the rotation graph of a graph obtained by applying certain operations to $G$. Specifically, we consider the operations of adding a simplicial vertex, adding a true twin to a vertex, and the two closely related operations of deleting the set of edges from a subgraph induced by a set of true twins, and adding a false twin to a vertex. We describe how applying these operations to a graph affects the structure of its rotation graph. Furthermore, by using this description, we study chromatic number, distance, and diameter in rotation graphs. In particular, we establish conditions under which the chromatic number of the rotation graphs is preserved. As an interesting consequence, we obtain that the chromatic number of the rotation graphs of threshold graphs (which includes complete split graphs and star graphs) and of complete bipartite graphs is 3. We also provide a new lower bound for $\text{diam}(\mathcal{R}(G-S))$ in terms of $\text{diam}(\mathcal{R}(G))$, where $S$ is the set of edges of the subgraph of $G$ induced by a set of true twins. As a consequence, we improve the known lower bound for the diameter of the rotation graph of balanced complete bipartite graphs, allowing us to compute the exact value of $\text{diam}(\mathcal{R}(K_{2,q}))$ for $q\in\{3,4,5,6,7,8\}$.</description>

Abstract: We provide a formula for the Poincar\'e dual of the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson (CSM) cycle of a matroid in the Chow ring of the matroid. We derive the formula from the case of matroids realizable over the complex numbers and prove that it satisfies a contraction-deletion formula. From this fact, we prove it holds for all matroids, confirming a conjecture of Fife and Rinc\'on.</description>

      <title>Infinite log-concavity and higher order Tur\'{a}n inequality for the sequences of Speyer's $g$-polynomial of uniform matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $U_{n,d}$ be the uniform matroid of rank $d$ on $n$ elements. Denote by $g_{U_{n,d}}(t)$ the Speyer's $g$-polynomial of $U_{n,d}$. The Tur\'{a}n inequality and higher order Tur\'{a}n inequality are related to the Laguerre-P\'{o}lya ($\mathcal{L}$-$\mathcal{P}$) class of real entire functions, and the $\mathcal{L}$-$\mathcal{P}$ class has close relation with the Riemann hypothesis. The Tur\'{a}n type inequalities have received much attention. Infinite log-concavity is also a deep generalization of Tur\'{a}n inequality with different direction. In this paper, we mainly obtain the infinite log-concavity and the higher order Tur\'{a}n inequality of the sequence $\{g_{U_{n,d}}(t)\}_{d=1}^{n-1}$ for any $t&gt;0$. In order to prove these results, we show that the generating function of $g_{U_{n,d}}(t)$, denoted $h_n(x;t)$, has only real zeros for $t&gt;0$. Consequently, for $t&gt;0$, we also obtain the $\gamma$-positivity of the polynomial $h_n(x;t)$, the asymptotical normality of $g_{U_{n,d}}(t)$, and the Laguerre inequalities for $g_{U_{n,d}}(t)$ and $h_n(x;t)$.</description>

We revisit the set $\mathcal{O}$, consisting of $(q^2+1)$-th roots of unity in $\mathbb{F}_{q^4}$, and prove that it forms an elliptic quadric within the cyclic presentation of $PG(3,q)$. Additionally, following the work of Glauberman on Suzuki groups, we offer a new description of Suzuki-Tits ovoids in the cyclic presentation of $PG(3,q)$, characterizing them as the zeroes of a polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_{q^4}$.</description>

      <title>Smoothed analysis for graph isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is no known polynomial-time algorithm for graph isomorphism testing, but elementary combinatorial "refinement" algorithms seem to be very efficient in practice. Some philosophical justification is provided by a classical theorem of Babai, Erd\H{o}s and Selkow: an extremely simple polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm (variously known as "na\"ive refinement", "na\"ive vertex classification", "colour refinement" or the "1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm") yields a so-called canonical labelling scheme for "almost all graphs". More precisely, for a typical outcome of a random graph $G(n,1/2)$, this simple combinatorial algorithm assigns labels to vertices in a way that easily permits isomorphism-testing against any other graph.
  We improve the Babai-Erd\H{o}s-Selkow theorem in two directions. First, we consider randomly perturbed graphs, in accordance with the smoothed analysis philosophy of Spielman and Teng: for any graph $G$, na\"ive refinement becomes effective after a tiny random perturbation to $G$ (specifically, the addition and removal of $O(n\log n)$ random edges). Actually, with a twist on na\"ive refinement, we show that $O(n)$ random additions and removals suffice. These results significantly improve on previous work of Gaudio-R\'acz-Sridhar, and are in certain senses best-possible.
  Second, we complete a long line of research on canonical labelling of random graphs: for any $p$ (possibly depending on $n$), we prove that a random graph $G(n,p)$ can typically be canonically labelled in polynomial time. This is most interesting in the extremely sparse regime where $p$ has order of magnitude $c/n$; denser regimes were previously handled by Bollob\'as, Czajka-Pandurangan, and Linial-Mosheiff. Our proof also provides a description of the automorphism group of a typical outcome of $G(n,p_n)$ (slightly correcting a prediction of Linial-Mosheiff).</description>

      <title>The number of edges in graphs with bounded clique number and circumference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\cal H$ be a family of graphs. The Tur\'an number ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal H})$ is the maximum possible number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph which does not contain any member of $\cal H$ as a subgraph. As a common generalization of Tur\'an's theorem and Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem on the Tur\'an number of matchings, Alon and Frankl determined ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal H})$ for ${\cal H}=\{K_r,M_k\}$, where $M_k$ is a matching of size $k$. Replacing $M_k$ by $P_k$, Katona and Xiao obtained the Tur\'an number of ${\cal H}=\{K_r,P_k\}$ for $r \leq \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$ and sufficiently large $n$. In addition, they proposed a conjecture for the case of $r \geq \lfloor k/2 \rfloor+1$ and sufficiently large $n$. Motivated by the fact that the result for ${\rm ex}(n,P_k)$ can be deduced from the one for ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal C}_{\geq k})$, we investigate the Tur\'an number of ${\cal H}=\{K_r, {\cal C}_{\geq k}\}$ in this paper. Namely, for such $\cal H$, we are able to show the value of ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal H})$ for $r \geq \lfloor (k-1)/2\rfloor+2$ and all $n$. As an application of this result, we confirm Katona and Xiao's conjecture in a stronger form. For $r \leq \lfloor (k-1)/2\rfloor+1$, we manage to show the value of ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal H})$ for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Proof of Two Multivariate $q$-Binomial Sums Arising in Gromov-Witten Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.02360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove two multivariate $q$-binomial identities conjectured by Bousseau, Brini and van Garrel [Geom. Topol. 28 (2024), 393-496, arXiv:2011.08830] which give generating series for Gromov-Witten invariants of two specific log Calabi-Yau surfaces. The key identity in all the proofs is Jackson's $q$-analogue of the Pfaff-Saalsch\"utz summation formula from the theory of basic hypergeometric series.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the cluster size distribution for the random current measure on the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the percolation configuration arising from the random current representation of the near-critical Ising model on the complete graph. We compute the scaling limit of the cluster size distribution for an arbitrary set of sources in the single and the double current measures. As a byproduct, we compute the tangling probabilities recently introduced by Gunaratnam, Panagiotis, Panis, and Severo in [GPPS22]. This provides a new perspective on the switching lemma for the $\varphi^4$ model introduced in the same paper: in the Gaussian limit we recover Wick's law, while in the Ising limit we recover the corresponding tool for the Ising model.</description>

      <title>On solving basic equations over the semiring of functional digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Endowing the set of functional graphs (FGs) with the sum (disjoint union of graphs) and product (standard direct product on graphs) operations induces on FGs a structure of a commutative semiring R. The operations on R can be naturally extended to the set of univariate polynomials R[X] over R. This paper provides a polynomial time algorithm for deciding if equations of the type AX=B have solutions when A is just a single cycle and B a set of cycles of identical size. We also prove a similar complexity result for some variants of the previous equation.</description>

      <title>A categorification of cluster algebras of type B and C through symmetric quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We express cluster variables of type $B_n$ and $C_n$ in terms of cluster variables of type $A_n$. Then we associate a cluster tilted bound symmetric quiver $Q$ of type $A_{2n-1}$ to any seed of a cluster algebra of type $B_n$ and $C_n$. Under this correspondence, cluster variables of type $B_n$ (resp. $C_n$) correspond to orthogonal (resp. symplectic) indecomposable representations of $Q$. We find a Caldero-Chapoton map in this setting. We also give a categorical interpretation of the cluster expansion formula in the case of acyclic quivers.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for complementary sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05844v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the n-th positive square number is easy, as it is simply $n^2$. But how do we find the complementary sequence, i.e. the n-th positive nonsquare number? For this case there is an explicit formula. However, for general constraints on a number, this is harder to find. In this paper, we study how to compute the n-th integer that does (or does not) satisfy a certain condition. In particular, we consider it as a fixed point problem, relate it to the iterative method of Lambek and Moser, study a bisection approach to this problem and provide formulas for various complementary sequences such as the non-k-gonal numbers, non-k-gonal pyramidal numbers, non-k-simplex numbers, non-sum-of-k-th powers and non-k-th powers.</description>
