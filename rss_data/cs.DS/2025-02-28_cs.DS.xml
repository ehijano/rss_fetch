      <title>Beyond Worst-Case Dimensionality Reduction for Sparse Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study beyond worst-case dimensionality reduction for $s$-sparse vectors. Our work is divided into two parts, each focusing on a different facet of beyond worst-case analysis:
  We first consider average-case guarantees. A folklore upper bound based on the birthday-paradox states: For any collection $X$ of $s$-sparse vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists a linear map to $\mathbb{R}^{O(s^2)}$ which \emph{exactly} preserves the norm of $99\%$ of the vectors in $X$ in any $\ell_p$ norm (as opposed to the usual setting where guarantees hold for all vectors). We give lower bounds showing that this is indeed optimal in many settings: any oblivious linear map satisfying similar average-case guarantees must map to $\Omega(s^2)$ dimensions. The same lower bound also holds for a wide class of smooth maps, including `encoder-decoder schemes', where we compare the norm of the original vector to that of a smooth function of the embedding. These lower bounds reveal a separation result, as an upper bound of $O(s \log(d))$ is possible if we instead use arbitrary (possibly non-smooth) functions, e.g., via compressed sensing algorithms.
  Given these lower bounds, we specialize to sparse \emph{non-negative} vectors. For a dataset $X$ of non-negative $s$-sparse vectors and any $p \ge 1$, we can non-linearly embed $X$ to $O(s\log(|X|s)/\epsilon^2)$ dimensions while preserving all pairwise distances in $\ell_p$ norm up to $1\pm \epsilon$, with no dependence on $p$. Surprisingly, the non-negativity assumption enables much smaller embeddings than arbitrary sparse vectors, where the best known bounds suffer exponential dependence. Our map also guarantees \emph{exact} dimensionality reduction for $\ell_{\infty}$ by embedding into $O(s\log |X|)$ dimensions, which is tight. We show that both the non-linearity of $f$ and the non-negativity of $X$ are necessary, and provide downstream algorithmic improvements.</description>

      <title>Differentially-private frugal estimation of quantiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate estimation of quantiles on data streams coming from communication networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and alike, is at the heart of important data processing applications including statistical analysis, latency monitoring, query optimization for parallel database management systems, and more. Indeed, quantiles are more robust indicators for the underlying distribution, compared to moment-based indicators such as mean and variance. The streaming setting additionally constrains accurate tracking of quantiles, as stream items may arrive at a very high rate and must be processed as quickly as possible and discarded, being their storage usually unfeasible. Since an exact solution is only possible when data are fully stored, the goal in practical contexts is to provide an approximate solution with a provably guaranteed bound on the approximation error committed, while using a minimal amount of space. At the same time, with the increasing amount of personal and sensitive information exchanged, it is essential to design privacy protection techniques to ensure confidentiality and data integrity. In this paper we present the following differentially private streaming algorithms for frugal estimation of a quantile: DP-FRUGAL-1U-L, DP-FRUGAL-1U-G, DP-FRUGAL-1U-\r{ho} and DP-FRUGAL-2U-SA. Frugality refers to the ability of the algorithms to provide a good approximation to the sought quantile using a modest amount of space, either one or two units of memory. We provide a theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results, in which we also compare DP-FRUGAL-1U-L with LDPQ, a recent state of the art algorithm, and show that DP-FRUGAL-1U-L outperforms LDPQ in both accuracy and speed.</description>

      <title>KeBaB: $k$-mer based breaking for finding super-maximal exact matches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose we have a tool for finding super-maximal exact matches (SMEMs) and we want to use it to find all the long SMEMs between a noisy long read $P$ and a highly repetitive pangenomic reference $T$. Notice that if $L \geq k$ and the $k$-mer $P [i..i + k - 1]$ does not occur in $T$ then no SMEM of length at least $L$ contains $P [i..i + k - 1]$. Therefore, if we have a Bloom filter for the distinct $k$-mers in $T$ and we want to find only SMEMs of length $L \geq k$, then when given $P$ we can break it into maximal substrings consisting only of $k$-mers the filter says occur in $T$ -- which we call pseudo-SMEMs -- and search only the ones of length at least $L$. If $L$ is reasonably large and we can choose $k$ well then the Bloom filter should be small (because $T$ is highly repetitive) but the total length of the pseudo-SMEMs we search should also be small (because $P$ is noisy). Now suppose we are interested only in the longest $t$ SMEMs of length at least $L$ between $P$ and $T$. Notice that once we have found $t$ SMEMs of length at least $\ell$ then we need only search for SMEMs of length greater than $\ell$. Therefore, if we sort the pseudo-SMEMs into non-increasing order by length, then we can stop searching once we have found $t$ SMEMs at least as long as the next pseudo-SMEM we would search. Our preliminary experiments indicate that these two admissible heuristics may significantly speed up SMEM-finding in practice.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms and lower bounds for eccentricity, radius, and diameter in undirected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problems of computing eccentricity, radius, and diameter are fundamental to graph theory. These parameters are intrinsically defined based on the distance metric of the graph. In this work, we propose quantum algorithms for the diameter and radius of undirected, weighted graphs in the adjacency list model. The algorithms output diameter and radius with the corresponding paths in $\widetilde{O}(n\sqrt{m})$ time. Additionally, for the diameter, we present a quantum algorithm that approximates the diameter within a $2/3$ ratio in $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{m}n^{3/4})$ time. We also establish quantum query lower bounds of $\Omega(\sqrt{nm})$ for all the aforementioned problems through a reduction from the minima finding problem.</description>

      <title>Instability of backoff protocols with arbitrary arrival rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17144v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contention resolution, multiple processors are trying to coordinate to send discrete messages through a shared channel with limited communication. If two processors send at the same time, the messages collide and are not transmitted successfully. Queue-free backoff protocols are an important special case - for example, Google Drive and AWS instruct their users to implement binary exponential backoff to handle busy periods. It is a long-standing conjecture of Aldous (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 1987) that no stable backoff protocols exist for any positive arrival rate of processors. This foundational question remains open; instability is only known in general when the arrival rate of processors is at least 0.42 (Goldberg et al. SICOMP 2004). We prove Aldous' conjecture for all backoff protocols outside of a tightly-constrained special case using a new domination technique to get around the main difficulty, which is the strong dependencies between messages.</description>

      <title>ExaLogLog: Space-Efficient and Practical Approximate Distinct Counting up to the Exa-Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces ExaLogLog, a new data structure for approximate distinct counting, which has the same practical properties as the popular HyperLogLog algorithm. It is commutative, idempotent, mergeable, reducible, has a constant-time insert operation, and supports distinct counts up to the exa-scale. At the same time, as theoretically derived and experimentally verified, it requires 43% less space to achieve the same estimation error.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial-Time Approximation for Pairwise Fair $k$-Median Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study pairwise fair clustering with $\ell \ge 2$ groups, where for every cluster $C$ and every group $i \in [\ell]$, the number of points in $C$ from group $i$ must be at most $t$ times the number of points in $C$ from any other group $j \in [\ell]$, for a given integer $t$. To the best of our knowledge, only bi-criteria approximation and exponential-time algorithms follow for this problem from the prior work on fair clustering problems when $\ell &gt; 2$. In our work, focusing on the $\ell &gt; 2$ case, we design the first polynomial-time $O(k^2\cdot \ell \cdot t)$-approximation for this problem with $k$-median cost that does not violate the fairness constraints. We complement our algorithmic result by providing hardness of approximation results, which show that our problem even when $\ell=2$ is almost as hard as the popular uniform capacitated $k$-median, for which no polynomial-time algorithm with an approximation factor of $o(\log k)$ is known.</description>

      <title>Computing Hamiltonian Paths with Partial Order Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When solving the Hamiltonian path problem it seems natural to be given additional precedence constraints for the order in which the vertices are visited. For example one could decide whether a Hamiltonian path exists for a fixed starting point, or that some vertices are visited before another vertex. We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path that observes all precedence constraints given in a partial order on the vertex set. We show that this problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete even if restricted to complete bipartite graphs and posets of height 2. In contrast, for posets of width $k$ there is a known $\mathcal{O}(k^2 n^k)$ algorithm for arbitrary graphs with $n$ vertices. We show that it is unlikely that the running time of this algorithm can be improved significantly, i.e., there is no $f(k) n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis. Furthermore, for the class of outerplanar graphs, we give an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ algorithm for arbitrary posets.</description>

      <title>Private Synthetic Data Generation in Small Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose $\mathtt{PrivHP}$, a lightweight synthetic data generator with \textit{differential privacy} guarantees. $\mathtt{PrivHP}$ uses a novel hierarchical decomposition that approximates the input's cumulative distribution function (CDF) in bounded memory. It balances hierarchy depth, noise addition, and pruning of low-frequency subdomains while preserving frequent ones. Private sketches estimate subdomain frequencies efficiently without full data access.
  A key feature is the pruning parameter $k$, which controls the trade-off between space and utility. We define the skew measure $\mathtt{tail}_k$, capturing all but the top $k$ subdomain frequencies. Given a dataset $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathtt{PrivHP}$ uses $M=\mathcal{O}(k\log^2 |X|)$ space and, for input domain $\Omega = [0,1]$, ensures $\varepsilon$-differential privacy. It yields a generator with expected Wasserstein distance: \[ \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log^2 M}{\varepsilon n} + \frac{||\mathtt{tail}_k(\mathcal{X})||_1}{M n}\right) \] from the empirical distribution. This parameterized trade-off offers a level of flexibility unavailable in prior work. We also provide interpretable utility bounds that account for hierarchy depth, privacy noise, pruning, and frequency estimation errors.</description>
