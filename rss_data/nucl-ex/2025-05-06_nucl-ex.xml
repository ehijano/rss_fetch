      <title>$^{28}$Al Half-life Measurement and the negative mirror asymmetry between the $^{28}$Al($\beta^-$)$^{28m}$Si and $^{28}$P($\beta^+$)$^{28m}$Si decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past, the mirror asymmetry parameter has been proposed as a probing mechanism for the presence of beyond the Standard Model second-class currents in nuclear beta decay transitions. However, this was hindered by large uncertainties in the required nuclear structure correction terms. Recently, a new calculation of these corrections attempted, but could not fully explain the negative mirror asymmetry between the $^{28}$Al($\beta^-$)$^{28m}$Si and $^{28}$P($\beta^+$)$^{28m}$Si decays. To put the mirror asymmetry parameter on a more solid footing, the half-life of $^{28}$Al was measured for the first time using a radioactive ion beam at the Nuclear Science Laboratory of the University of Notre Dame. The new result, $t_{1/2}=$134.432(34) s, is consistent with most of the past data except for one highly discrepant measurement. The new mirror asymmetry parameter of -3.5(10)$\%$ obtained still does not agree with nuclear structure calculations.</description>

      <title>The NA60+ experiment at SPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new apparatus, NA60+, is proposed for measuring muon pairs in the center-of-mass region from 5 to 17 GeV at CERN SPS in various collisional systems from Pb+Pb and down to $p$+Be. The physics scope of the new detector will cover topics from the measurement of thermal radiation coming from the hot and dense medium to chiral symmetry restoration, strangeness, and charm production.
  The proposed detector consists of a vertex spectrometer based on novel technology, allowing the production of large silicon sensors and a large-acceptance muon spectrometer based on gaseous detectors. With its high beam intensity, the new apparatus provides access to rare observables that have been scarcely studied until now. The new detector will come into operation after the Long Shutdown 3 of the LHC (past 2029) and is aimed at the first data-taking with Pb and proton beams. In this contribution, we review the project and recent R\&amp;D effort, including the technical aspects and the studies of the physics performances for the observables.</description>

      <title>Higher order flow coefficients -- A Messenger of QCD medium formed in heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic flow and fluctuations are sensitive observables to the initial state effects in heavy ion collisions and are characterized by the medium properties and final state interactions. Using event-shape observables, one can constrain the probability distributions of anisotropic flow coefficients, thus reducing the linear and nonlinear contributions in the measured higher-order harmonics. In this paper, we use transverse spherocity as an event shape observable to study the flow coefficients and elliptic flow fluctuations. Transverse spherocity is found to have a strong correlation with elliptic flow and its fluctuations. We exploit this feature of transverse spherocity to remove the contribution of elliptic flow from higher-order harmonics. The study is performed in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using a multi-phase transport model. The multi-particle Q-cumulant method estimates the anisotropic flow coefficients, which reduces the non-flow contributions. We observe a stronger system response to the flow coefficients for the events with smaller values of elliptic flow.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Approach for Interpolation of Sparse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of hadron resonances and their properties are limited by the accuracy and consistency of measured datasets, which can originate from many different experiments. We have used Gaussian Processes (GP) to build interpolated datasets, including quantification of uncertainties, so that data from different sources can be used in model fitting without the need for arbitrary weighting. GPs predict values and uncertainties of observables at any kinematic point. Bayesian inference is used to optimise the hyperparameters of the GP model. We demonstrate that the GP successfully interpolates data with quantified uncertainties by comparison with generated pseudodata. We also show that this methodology can be used to investigate the consistency of data from different sources. GPs provide a robust, model-independent method for interpolating typical datasets used in hadron resonance studies, removing the limitations of arbitrary weighting in sparse datasets.</description>

      <title>Pre-study of a Li2MoO4 based bolometer for 100Mo neutrinoless double beta decay experiment in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cryogenic phonon scintillating bolometer is a promising and extremely attractive option to search for the nuclide neutrinoless double beta decay. In this paper, a pre-study of bolometer based on Li2MoO4 (LMO) crystal is presented, in which the properties of the LMO crystal at the low temperature, including scintillation characteristics and specific heat, are investigated in detail. The excitation spectrum and light yield are measured from the room temperature down to 10 K, and heat capacity is measured down to temperature of O(200) mK. Furthermore, a (2 cm)3 cubic LMO based bolometer is manufactured and tested at ultra-low mK-level temperature in a ground-above cryostat platform, and a good energy resolution is achieved. The studies laid a foundation to manufacture the bolometer detector in China and conduct neutrinoless double beta decay research at the China Jinping Underground Laborator</description>

      <title>Tilted-axis-cranking covariant density functional theory for the high-spin spectroscopy in $^{69}$Ga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tilted-axis-cranking covariant density functional theory is applied to investigate the three newly-observed positive-parity bands SI, SII, and SIII in $^{69}$Ga. The energy spectra and angular momenta are calculated and compared with the experimental data. For the yrast band SI, pairing correlations play a crucial role for the states with spin $I\leq 23/2\hbar$. The bands SII and SIII are suggested to be signature partner bands with positive and negative signatures, respectively. The transition probabilities $B(E2)$ for these bands are predicted, and await further experimental verification. By analyzing the angular momentum alignments microscopicly, it is revealed that the $g_{9/2}$ protons and neutrons play an important role in the description of the collective structure of $^{69}$Ga.</description>

      <title>Probing $\Lambda$ potential via its $v_{2}$ flow in hypernuclei-induced reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hyperon potential, particularly its behavior at high densities, is crucial for resolving the ``hyperon puzzle'' in neutron stars and for advancing our understanding of the strong interactions between strange and non-strange particles in high baryon density environments. Using the hadronic transport model AMPT-HC, hypernucleus-nucleus collision is studied. It is found that at beam energies below the threshold for hyperon production, the hyperon elliptic flow exhibits noticeable asymmetry between the positive and negative rapidity regions and is sensitive to the strength of the hyperon potential, especially in the large negative rapidity region. One can extract the hyperon potential approximately twice the saturation density based on the hyperon elliptic flow in the negative rapidity region, and the hyperon potential around the saturation density based on the hyperon elliptic flow in the positive rapidity region.</description>

      <title>Improving Positron Lifetime Spectra Quality by Suppressing Corrupted Coincidences via Pulse-Height Spectrum Window Adjustments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) is a powerful technique for detecting microstructural defects in various material classes. In a commonly used 180{\deg} detector configuration equipped with plastic scintillators, measurement accuracy is mainly affected by simultaneous detection of 1275 keV and 511 keV gamma quanta in the same detector. This study introduces an optimization approach that significantly improves spectra quality without requiring hardware modifications. By systematically adjusting the upper threshold of the start window in the Pulse Height Spectrum (PHS), this method effectively reduces unwanted 1275/511 piled-up events. Experimental validation with high purity aluminium samples demonstrates that lowering this threshold effectively suppresses corrupted coincidences, yielding extracted characteristic lifetimes closer to those from a 90{\deg} configuration. While a reduced upper threshold slightly broadens the instrument response function (IRF) due to an effectively reduced number of scintillation photons, the overall impact on timing resolution remains negligible. This approach enhances the reliability of PALS measurements while still preserving the benefits of a 180{\deg} configuration, i.e. high solid-angle efficiency.</description>

      <title>Transverse momentum fluctuations as a probe of thermalization and collective dynamics of QGP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fluctuations of mean transverse momentum per particle ($[p_T]$) in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that the steep fall in the variance of transverse momentum fluctuation in ultracentral Pb+Pb collision serves as a natural consequence of the thermalization of the QGP medium. We study the correlation between the spectra and $[p_T]$ which maps these fluctuations differentially and dubbed as $v_0(p_T)$. We highlight the importance of $v_0(p_T)$ showing that it plays similar role as anisotropic flow when probing the collective nature of QGP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) approaches parametrize the interactions and dynamics of two and more hadrons and their response to different electroweak probes. The inclusion of unitarity, three-body channels, and other properties from scattering theory allows for a reliable extraction of resonance spectra and their properties from data. We review the formalism and application of the ANL-Osaka, the Juelich-Bonn-Washington, and other DCC approaches in the context of light baryon resonances from meson, (virtual) photon, and neutrino-induced reactions, as well as production reactions, strange baryons, light mesons, heavy meson systems, exotics, and baryon-baryon interactions. Finally, we also provide a connection of the formalism to study finite-volume spectra obtained in Lattice QCD, and review applications involving modern statistical and machine learning tools.</description>

      <title>A saga on the $\gamma$-decay branching ratio of the Hoyle state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiative branching ratio of the Hoyle state is crucial to estimate the triple-$\alpha$ reaction rate in stellar environments at medium temperatures of $T=0.1$ to 2 GK. Knowledge of the $\gamma$-decay channel is critical as this is the dominant radiative decay channel for the Hoyle state. A recent study by Kib\'edi et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 182701 (2020)] has challenged our understanding of this astrophysically significant branching ratio and its constraints. The main purpose was to perform a new measurement of the $\gamma$-decay branching ratio of the Hoyle state to deduce the radiative branching ratio of the Hoyle state, an additional objective was to independently verify aspects of the measurement conducted by Kib\'edi et al. For the primary experiment of this work the Hoyle state was populated by the $^{12}\textrm{C}(p,p')$ reaction at 10.8 MeV at the Oslo Cyclotron Laboratory. The $\gamma$-decay branching ratio was deduced through triple-coincidence events between a proton populating the Hoyle state and the subsequent $\gamma$-ray cascade. An independent analysis of the 2014 data published by Kib\'edi et al. has been carried out. From the main experiment of this work, a $\gamma$-decay branching ratio of the Hoyle state was determined as $\Gamma_{\gamma}^{7.65}/\Gamma^{7.65}=4.0(3)\times 10^{-4}$, yielding a radiative branching ratio of $\Gamma_{\textrm{rad}}/\Gamma=4.1(4) \times 10^{-4}$. The reanalysis of the 2014 experiment in this work yielded $\Gamma_{\gamma}^{7.65}/\Gamma^{7.65}=4.5(6)\times 10^{-4}$, with a radiative branching ratio of $\Gamma_{\textrm{rad}}/\Gamma=4.6(6) \times 10^{-4}$. The measurements of the radiative branching ratio of the Hoyle state in this work is in excellent agreement with several recent studies, as well as the previously adopted ENSDF average of $\Gamma_{\textrm{rad}}/\Gamma=4.16(11)\times 10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Search for the jet-induced diffusion wake in the quark-gluon plasma via measurements of jet-track correlations in photon-jet events in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{\mathrm{s}_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a measurement of jet-track correlations in photon-jet events, using 1.72 nb$^{-1}$ of Pb+Pb data at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events with energetic photon-jet pairs are selected, where the photon and jet are approximately back-to-back in azimuth. The angular correlation between jets and charged-particle tracks with transverse momentum ($p_\text{T}$) in the range 0.5-2.0 GeV in the hemisphere opposite to the jet, $|\Delta\phi\text{(jet,track)}|&gt;\pi/2$, is measured as a function of their relative pseudorapidity difference, $|\Delta\eta\text{(jet,track)}|$. In central Pb+Pb collisions, these correlations are predicted to be sensitive to the diffusion wake in the quark-gluon plasma resulting from the lost energy of high-$p_\text{T}$ partons traversing the plasma, with a characteristic modification as a function of $|\Delta\eta\text{(jet,track)}|$. The correlations are examined with different selections on the jet-to-photon $p_\text{T}$ ratio to select events with different degrees of energy loss. No diffusion wake signal is observed within the current sensitivity and upper limits at 95% confidence level on the diffusion wake amplitude are reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The production of Lambda hyperons and light hypernuclei in heavy-ion collisions provides critical insights into the nuclear equation of state (EoS) and hyperon interactions in dense matter, addressing the longstanding ``hyperon puzzle'' in neutron star physics. Using the INCL+ABLA and AMPT-HC models, we systematically investigate C+C collisions at beam energies of 1.1 and 1.9 GeV/nucleon to explore the sensitivity of hyperon and hypernuclei yields to the EoS and hyperon potential. Our results reveal that Lambda hyperon production is predominantly influenced by the nuclear EoS, while light hypernuclei formation (e.g., \(^3_{\Lambda}\)H) exhibits stronger sensitivity to the hyperon potential at high/low densities with the incident beam energies of 1.1/1.9 GeV. The study provides a framework for future experiments at facilities like HIAF and FAIR/GSI to resolve the hyperon puzzle, thus advancing our understanding of quantum chromodynamics in high-density regimes.</description>
