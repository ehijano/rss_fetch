      <title>Diffusive and Adiabatic Meridional Overturning Circulations in the Cooling Abyss of the Indo-Pacific Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent field campaigns have consistently documented bottom-intensified mixing near the seafloor, suggesting diabatic downwelling in the abyssal ocean. This phenomenon appears to contradict with the mass balance of the abyssal ocean, where dense bottom water plunges into the region from the Antarctic side. Previous studies have sought to resolve this apparent paradox by proposing mixing-induced diabatic upwelling along bottom slopes. In contrast, this study offers an alternative perspective, highlighting the role of isopycnal displacement in the transient abyss. Motivated by emerging evidence of a cooling phase in the abyssal Indo-Pacific, likely linked to the last Little Ice Age, this study reinterprets the interior-downwelling paradox from the perspective of unsteady thermal states. Idealized numerical experiments were conducted to explore the abyssal overturning dynamics, with a focus on the behavior of advective, adiabatic, and diffusive overturning circulation streamfunctions in both cooling and warming scenarios. The results reveal that while the direction of diabatic overturning (upwelling or downwelling) depends on the transient state of the ocean, advective overturning circulation consistently exhibits an upwelling pattern, underscoring the inherent robustness of upward water parcel movement within abyssal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Corrected values of turbulence generated by general geothermal convection in deep Mediterranean waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A correction by a reduction factor O(100) is proposed for previously calculated turbulence values on unresolved convection-overturns induced by general geothermal heating in the deep Western Mediterranean. The correction includes modified application of reordering method for calculating turbulence values in convection turbulence with and without stratification above or below. The result is improved correspondence between geophysical determined heat flow through the seafloor and turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate determined from high-resolution temperature sensors moored over 109 m in the overlying waters, with an average mixing coefficient of 0.5.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES) model with OpenACC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the GPU porting through OpenACC directives of the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES) application, a high-resolution atmospheric model. The code is written in Fortran~90 and features parallel (distributed) execution through spatial domain decomposition. We assess the performance of the GPU offloading, comparing the time-to-solution on regular and accelerated HPC nodes. %comparing the computational time between distributed and accelerated nodes. A weak scaling analysis is conducted and portability across NVIDIA A100 and H100 hardware %and AMD hardware is discussed. Finally, we show how targeted kernels can benefit from further optimization with Kernel Tuner, a GPU kernels auto-tuning package.</description>
