      <title>Dynamic neurons: A statistical physics approach for analyzing deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network architectures often consist of repetitive structural elements. We introduce a new approach that reveals these patterns and can be broadly applied to the study of deep learning. Similar to how a power strip helps untangle and organize complex cable connections, this approach treats neurons as additional degrees of freedom in interactions, simplifying the structure and enhancing the intuitive understanding of interactions within deep neural networks. Furthermore, it reveals the translational symmetry of deep neural networks, which simplifies the application of the renormalization group transformation - a method that effectively analyzes the scaling behavior of the system. By utilizing translational symmetry and renormalization group transformations, we can analyze critical phenomena. This approach may open new avenues for studying deep neural networks using statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in mass transport processes with center-of-mass conservation: Some exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize steady-state static and dynamic properties in a broad class of mass transport processes on a periodic hypercubic lattice of volume $L^d$, where both mass and {\it center-of-mass} (CoM) remain conserved and detailed balance is violated in the bulk; we specifically consider these models in $d=1$ and $2$ dimensions. Using a microscopic approach, we exactly determine the decay (or, growth) exponents for various dynamic and static correlation functions. We show that, despite constrained dynamics due to the CoM conservation (CoMC), the density relaxation is indeed diffusive. However, fluctuation properties are strikingly different from that in the diffusive systems with a single (mass) conservation law. In the thermodynamic limit, the steady-state variance $\langle {\cal Q}^2(T) \rangle_c$ of time-integrated bond current ${\cal Q}(T)$ across a bond in time interval $T$ exhibits the following long-time behavior: $\langle {\cal Q}^2(T) \rangle_c \simeq A_1 T + A_2 + A_3 T^{-d/2}$. Remarkably, depending on dimensions and microscopic details, the prefactor $A_1$ can vanish (e.g., for $d=1$), causing the variance to eventually {\it saturate}. The exponents governing the small-frequency behavior of the power spectrum $S_J(f) \sim f^{\psi_J}$ for bond current are exactly determined as $\psi_J=3/2$ and $2$ in $d=1$ and $2$ dimensions, respectively, implying a ``dynamic hyperuniformity''. We also compute the static structure factor $S(q)$, which, in the small-$q$ limit, varies as the square of wave number $q$, i.e., $S(q) \sim q^2$. Indeed, both dynamic and static fluctuations are anomalously suppressed, resulting in an extreme form of (``class I'') hyperuniformity in the systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic evolution elasto-plastic modeling of a metallic glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a general data-driven approach to stochastic elastoplastic modelling that leverages atomistic simulation data directly rather than by fitting parameters. The approach is developed in the context of metallic glasses, which present inherent complexities due to their disordered structure. By harvesting statistics from simulated metallic glass shear response histories, the material state is mapped onto a two-dimensional state space consisting of the shear stress and the inelastic contribution to the potential energy. The resulting elastoplastic model is intrinsically stochastic and represented as a non-deterministic dynamical map. The state space statistics provide insights into the deformation physics of metallic glasses, revealing that two state variables are sufficient to describe the main features of the elastoplastic response. In this two-dimensional state space, the gradually quenched metallic glass rejuvenates during the initial quasi-elastic shearing, ultimately reaching a steady state that fluctuates about a fixed point in the state space as rejuvenation and aging balance.</description>

      <title>First-passage times to a fractal boundary: local persistence exponent and its log-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the statistics of the first-passage time (FPT) to a fractal self-similar boundary of the Koch snowflake. When the starting position is fixed near the absorbing boundary, the FPT distribution exhibits an apparent power-law decay over a broad range of timescales, culminated by an exponential cut-off. By extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the local persistence exponent of the survival probability and reveal its log-periodic oscillations in time due to self-similarity of the boundary. The effect of the starting point onto this behavior is analyzed in depth. Theoretical bounds on the survival probability are derived from the analysis of diffusion in a circular sector. Physical rationales for the refined structure of the survival probability are presented.</description>

      <title>Generalization vs. Specialization under Concept Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are often brittle under distribution shift, i.e., when data distributions at test time differ from those during training. Understanding this failure mode is central to identifying and mitigating safety risks of mass adoption of machine learning. Here we analyze ridge regression under concept shift -- a form of distribution shift in which the input-label relationship changes at test time. We derive an exact expression for prediction risk in the high-dimensional limit. Our results reveal nontrivial effects of concept shift on generalization performance, depending on the properties of robust and nonrobust features of the input. We show that test performance can exhibit a nonmonotonic data dependence, even when double descent is absent. Finally, our experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST suggest that this intriguing behavior is present also in classification problems.</description>

      <title>A new series of 3D CFTs with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry on fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to discover new 3D CFTs has been intriguing for physicists. For this purpose, fuzzy sphere reguarlisation that studies interacting quantum systems defined on the lowest Landau level on a sphere has emerged as a powerful tool. In this paper, we discover a series of new CFTs with global symmetry $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ in the fuzzy sphere models that are closely related to the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ deconfined phase transition, and are described by a $\mathrm{Sp}(N)/(\mathrm{Sp}(M)\times \mathrm{Sp}(N-M))$ non-linear sigma model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. We numerically verify the emergent conformal symmetry by observing the integer-spaced conformal multiplets and studying the finite-size scaling of the conformality. We discuss possible candidates for these newly discovered CFTs, the most plausible ones being Chern-Simons-matter theories which have $N$ flavour of gapless bosons or fermions coupled to a non-Abelian (viz. $\mathrm{Sp}(1)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(2)$, etc.) Chern-Simons gauge field. Our work provides new avenues for studying interacting CFTs in 3D, possibly facilitating the non-perturbative study of critical gauge theories and previously undiscovered CFTs.</description>

      <title>Bionic fractionalization in the trimer model of twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the rapid experimental progress in twisted van der Waals materials, we study the triangular trimer model as a representative framework for extended Wannier orbitals in twisted bilayer graphene at 1/3-filling. This deceptively simple model exhibits a rich suite of complex phases, including unusual excitations exhibiting the physics of fractionalization and fractons. For our investigations, we carry out extensive Monte Carlo simulations using an efficient cluster algorithm. The so-obtained finite-temperature phase diagram reveals a novel polar fluid and an ordered brick-wall phase characterized by fractionally charged $e/3$ excitations with subdimensional lineonic dynamics. Notably, we identify a critical trimer liquid phase for the particularly simple model of hard trimers. For this, we derive a new field theory which takes the form of a U(1)$\times$U(1) gauge theory. Its $e/3$ monomers are fractionalized bionic excitations: they carry a {\it pair} of emergent gauge charges, as evidenced by algebraic correlations with two distinct exponents. These field theoretical predictions offer theoretical grounds for numerical observations of critical exponents. Our study highlights the triangular trimer model as a new key platform for investigating fractionalization and fractons, where trimer liquid bionic monomers can transform into lineons or fractons in proximate phases, and calls for experimental investigations of this physics in twisted van der Waals materials and a broader class of systems with intermediate-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Transient subtraction: A control variate method for computing transport coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics, transport coefficients measure the sensitivity of the invariant probability measure of the stochastic dynamics at hand with respect to some perturbation. They are typically computed using either the linear response of nonequilibrium dynamics, or the Green--Kubo formula. The estimators for both approaches have large variances, which motivates the study of variance reduction techniques for computing transport coefficients. We present an alternative approach, called the \emph{transient subtraction technique} (inspired by early work by Ciccotti and Jaccucci in 1975), which amounts to simulating a transient dynamics, from which we subtract a sensibly coupled equilibrium trajectory, resulting in an estimator with smaller variance. We present the mathematical formulation of the transient subtraction technique, give error estimates on the bias and variance of the associated estimator, and demonstrate the relevance of the method through numerical illustrations for various systems.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for computing perturbation series of dynamical mean field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to use diagrammatic techniques to compute the weak-coupling perturbation series of the self-consistent solution to a Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) problem. This approach constitutes an alternative to using diagrammatic techniques directly as an impurity solver. It allows one to bypass the need of multiple perturbative series resummations within the DMFT self-consistency loop. It can be applied at or out of equilibrium, with any diagrammatic formalism, such as real times, imaginary times, or Matsubara frequencies formalisms. As a proof of principle, we illustrate our method with the half-filled Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice in the DMFT approximation, using Quantum Quasi-Monte Carlo (QQMC) to obtain the impurity perturbation series on the real time axis.</description>

      <title>Domain Growth Kinetics in Active Binary Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in symmetric and asymmetric active binary mixtures. We start with the coarse-grained run-and-tumble bacterial model that provides evolution equations for the density fields $\rho_i(\vec r, t)$. Next, we study the phase separation dynamics by solving the evolution equations using the Euler discretization technique. We characterize the morphology of domains by calculating the equal-time correlation function $C(r, t)$ and the structure factor $S(k, t)$, both of which show dynamical scaling. The form of the scaling functions depends on the mixture composition and the relative activity of the species, $\Delta$. For $k\rightarrow\infty$, $S(k, t)$ follows Porod's law: $S(k, t)\sim k^{-(d+1)}$ and the average domain size $L(t)$ shows a diffusive growth as $L(t)\sim t^{1/3}$ for all mixtures.</description>

      <title>Absorbing State Phase Transitions and Stability of Long-Range Coherence in Dissipative Quantum State Preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the absorbing state phase transition in a purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model where the absorbing state itself has long range phase coherence. The model may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W-state with errors. The 'error' Lindblad jump operators preserve the W-state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates, and show that remnants of the coherence persist even after the phase transition to the decohering phase.</description>

Abstract: This is part of an unpublished work in collaboration with Ralph Kenna. It was probably not mature enough at the time it was submitted more than ten years ago and it was rejected by the editors, but some of the ideas had later been published partially in subsequent works. I believe that this "draft" reveals a lot about Ralph's enthusiasm and audacity and deserves to be published now, maybe as a part of his legacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied numerically the Lee-Yang singularities of the four dimensional Ising model at criticality, which is believed to be in the same universality class as the $\phi_4^4$ scalar field theory. We have focused in the numerical characterization of the logarithmic corrections to the scaling of the zeros of the partition function and its cumulative probability distribution, finding a very good agreement with the predictions of the renormalization group computation on the $\phi_4^4$ scalar field theory. To obtain these results, we have extended a previous study [R. Kenna, C. B. Lang, Nucl. Phys., 1993, B393, 461] in which there were computed numerically the first two zeros for $L\leqslant 24$ lattices, to the computation of the first four zeros for $L\leqslant 64$ lattices.</description>

Abstract: We report a model for hyperthermia therapies based on heat diffusion in a biological tissue containing a topological defect. Biological tissues behave like active liquid crystals with the presence of topological defects which are likely to anchor tumors during the metastatic phase of cancer evolution and the therapy challenge is to destroy the cancer cells without damaging surrounding healthy tissues. The defect creates an effective non-Euclidean geometry for low-energy excitations, modifying the bio-heat equation. Applications to protocols of thermal ablation for various biological tissues (liver, prostate, and skin) is analyzed and discussed.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to illustrate that generalized two-dimensional XY models (proposed by Romano and Zagrebnov) may also support a first-order phase transition. Two approaches are employed to accurately determine the critical parameter $q$ at which such a transition takes place. Furthermore, we show that the model is characterized by three distinct regions concerning both first-order and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions. Finally, the underlying mechanisms governing such transitions are presented, along with an estimation of the critical temperatures.</description>

      <title>Identifying Influential and Vulnerable Nodes in Interaction Networks through Estimation of Transfer Entropy Between Univariate and Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transfer entropy (TE) is a powerful tool for measuring causal relationships within interaction networks. Traditionally, TE and its conditional variants are applied pairwise between dynamic variables to infer these causal relationships. However, identifying the most influential or vulnerable node in a system requires measuring the causal influence of each component on the entire system and vice versa. In this paper, I propose using outgoing and incoming transfer entropy-where outgoing TE quantifies the influence of a node on the rest of the system, and incoming TE measures the influence of the rest of the system on the node. The node with the highest outgoing TE is identified as the most influential, or "hub", while the node with the highest incoming TE is the most vulnerable, or "anti-hub". Since these measures involve transfer entropy between univariate and multivariate time series, naive estimation methods can result in significant errors, particularly when the number of variables is comparable to or exceeds the number of samples. To address this, I introduce a novel estimation scheme that computes outgoing and incoming TE only between significantly interacting partners. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by using synthetic data, and by applying it to real data of oral microbiota. The method successfully identifies the bacterial species known to be key players in the bacterial community, demonstrating the power of the new method.</description>

      <title>Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current carrying steady state of a driven XXZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich structures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and energetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to maximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations and distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy per site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS solution in systems with $\Delta&gt;0$, to numerically exactly calculate the entropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks as large as $n\sim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The $z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations in the $z$ direction while the $x$-magnetization shows a double peak structure at larger $\Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that the distribution of $z$-magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current is maximized.</description>

      <title>Statistics of a Large Number of Renewals in Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Renewal Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The renewal process is a key statistical model for describing a wide range of stochastic systems in Physics. This work investigates the behavior of the probability distribution of the number of renewals in renewal processes in the short-time limit, with a focus on cases where the number of renewals is large. We find that the specific details of the sojourn time distribution $\phi(\tau)$ in this limit can significantly modify the behavior in the large-number-of-renewals regime. We explore both non-equilibrium and equilibrium renewal processes, deriving results for various forms of $\phi(\tau)$. Using saddle point approximations, we analyze cases where $\phi(\tau)$ follows a power-series expansion, includes a cutoff, or exhibits non-analytic behavior near $\tau = 0$. Additionally, we show how the short-time properties of $\phi(\tau)$ shape the decay of the number of renewals in equilibrium compared to non-equilibrium renewal processes. The probability of the number of renewals plays a crucial role in determining rare event behaviors, such as Laplace tails. The results obtained here are expected to help advance the development of a theoretical framework for rare events in transport processes in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic origin of the phonon Hall effect in a honeycomb antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The underlying mechanism of the thermal Hall effect (THE) generated by phonons in a variety of insulators is yet to be identified. Here, we report on a sizeable thermal Hall conductivity in NiPS$_3$, a van der Waals stack of honeycomb layers with a zigzag antiferromagnetic order below $T_N$ = 155 K. The longitudinal ($\kappa_{aa}$) and the transverse ($\kappa_{ab}$) thermal conductivities peak at the same temperature and the thermal Hall angle, at this peak, respects a previously identified bound. The amplitude of $\kappa_{ab}$ is extremely sensitive to the amplitude of magnetization along the $b$-axis, in contrast to the phonon mean free path, which is not at all. We show that the magnon and acoustic phonon bands cross each other along the $b^\ast$ orientation in the momentum space. The relevance of a thermodynamic property, combined with the irrelevance of the mean free path, points to an intrinsic origin.</description>

      <title>Theory for the Anomalous Phase Behavior of Inertial Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contrast to equilibrium systems, inertia can profoundly impact the phase behavior of active systems. This has been made particularly evident in recent years, with motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) exhibiting several intriguing dependencies on translational inertia. Here we report extensive simulations characterizing the phase behavior of inertial active matter and develop a mechanical theory for the complete phase diagram without appealing to equilibrium notions. Our theory qualitatively captures all aspects of liquid-gas coexistence, including the critical value of inertia above which MIPS ceases. Notably, our findings highlight that particle softness, and not inertia, is responsible for the MIPS reentrance effect at the center of a proposed active refrigeration cycle.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we compute the overlaps of the ground states for the open spin chains after a change of one of the boundary magnetic fields. It can be considered as the first step toward the study of the boundary quench problem: behaviour of an open spin chain after an abrupt change of one boundary magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Collective motion using quantum-like entanglement of neighbours in perceptual space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the collective motion of self-propelled agents through the lens of quantum-like entanglement in visual perception. This approach makes the non-linear dynamics in ordinary space a derivative of dynamics in the Hilbert space of perception. By appropriate choice of operators in this quantum-inspired model, we show how the familiar Vicsek model, a well-known paradigm for flocking behaviour, naturally emerges. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to explore how different types of entangled quantum states-such as GHZ states, W states, and cluster states-affect collective motion. Each type of entanglement introduces unique coordination patterns, interaction strength, and information sharing among agents, leading to different collective behaviours.</description>
