      <title>Static impurity in a mesoscopic system of SU($N$) fermionic matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of a static impurity, modeled by a localized barrier, in a one-dimensional mesoscopic system comprised of strongly correlated repulsive SU($N$)-symmetric fermions. For a mesoscopic sized ring under the effect of an artificial gauge field, we analyze the particle density and the current flowing through the impurity at varying interaction strength, barrier height and number of components. We find a non-monotonic behaviour of the persistent current, due to the competition between the screening of the impurity, quantum fluctuations, and the phenomenon of fractionalization, a signature trait of SU($N$) fermionic matter-waves in mesoscopic ring potentials. This is also highlighted in the particle density at the impurity site. We show that the impurity opens a gap in the energy spectrum selectively, constrained by the total effective spin and interaction. Our findings hold significance for the fundamental understanding of the localized impurity problem and its potential applications for sensing and interferometry in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and State Preparation in a Two-State System of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of two-level quantum systems to the thermal environment is a fundamental problem, with applications ranging from qubit state preparation to spin models. However, for the elementary problem of the thermodynamics of an ensemble of bosons populating a two-level system despite its conceptual simplicity experimental realizations are scarce. Using an optical dye microcavity platform, we thermalize photons in a two-mode system with tunable chemical potential, demonstrating N bosons populating a two-level system coupled to a heat bath. Under pulsed excitation, Josephson oscillations between the two quantum states demonstrate the possibility for coherent manipulation. In contrast, under stationary conditions the thermalization of the two-mode system is observed. As the energetic splitting between eigenstates is two orders of magnitude smaller than thermal energy, at low occupations an almost equal distribution of the modes occupation is observed, as expected from Boltzmann statistics. For larger occupation, we observe efficient population of the ground state and saturation of the upper level at high filling, expected from quantum statistics. Our experiment holds promise for state preparation in quantum technologies as well as for quantum thermodynamics studies.</description>

      <title>Edge-Edge Correlations without Edge-States: $\eta$-clustering State as Ground State of the Extended Attractive SU(3) Hubbard Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of the extended attractive SU($3$) Hubbard chain with two-body hopping and nearest-neighbor attraction at half-filling. In the large on-site attraction limit, we identify three different phases: phase separation (PS), Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), and charge density wave (CDW). Our analysis reveals that the $\eta$-clustering state, a three-component generalization of the $\eta$-pairing state, becomes the ground state at the boundary between the PS and TLL phases. On an open chain, this state exhibits an edge-edge correlation, which we call boundary off-diagonal long-range order (bODLRO). Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we numerically study the phase diagram of the model with large but finite on-site interactions and find that the numerical results align with those obtained in the strong coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Tunable Two-Species Spin Models with Rydberg Atoms in Circular and Elliptical States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for constructing versatile quantum simulators using ultracold Rydberg atoms in long-lived circular and elliptical states. By exciting different subspaces of internal atomic states, the atoms can be used to simulate two effective spin species with different spin-spin interactions. The strengths of transverse and longitudinal spin-spin interactions, both intra- and inter-species, can be controlled within a wide range of values. This setup can be used to simulate two-species spin models or lattice models with two sublattices. We show examples of specific models which can be realized.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of three-body loss in ${}^{166}$Er and optimised production of large Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold gases of highly magnetic lanthanide atoms have enabled the realisation of dipolar quantum droplets and supersolids. However, future studies could be limited by the achievable atom numbers and hindered by high three-body loss rates. Here we study density-dependent atom loss in an ultracold gas of ${}^{166}$Er for magnetic fields below 4 G, identifying six previously unreported, strongly temperature-dependent features. We find that their positions and widths show a linear temperature dependence up to at least $15\,\mu\textrm{K}$. In addition, we observe a weak, polarisation-dependent shift of the loss features with the intensity of the light used to optically trap the atoms. This detailed knowledge of the loss landscape allows us to optimise the production of dipolar BECs with more than $2 \times 10^5$ atoms and points towards optimal strategies for the study of large-atom-number dipolar gases in the droplet and supersolid regimes.</description>

      <title>Third quantization with Hartree approximation for open-system bosonic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The third quantization (3rd Q) for bosons provides the exact steady-state solution of the Lindblad equation with quadratic Hamiltonians. By decomposing the interaction of the Bose Hubbard model (BHM) according to Hartree approximation, we present a self-consistent formalism for solving the open-system bosonic Lindblad equation with weak interactions in the steady state. The 3rd Q with Hartree approximation takes into account the infinite Fock space of bosons while its demand of resource scales polynomially with the system size. We examine the method by analyzing three examples of the BHM, including the uniform chain, interaction induced diode effect, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hubbard model. When compared with the simulations with capped boson numbers for small systems, the 3rd Q with Hartree approximation captures the qualitative behavior and suggests an upper bound of the steady-state value. Finite-size scaling confirms the results from the 3rd Q with Hartree approximation converge towards the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the manageable method allows us to characterize and predict large-system behavior of quantum transport in interacting bosonic systems relevant to cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations and universal coarsening dynamics of a spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the collective excitation spectrum of a Raman-induced spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a quasi-one-dimensional harmonic trap while varying either the Raman coupling or quadratic Zeeman term by using the Bogoliubov approach. A few low-lying modes, which can be used to delineate the phase boundaries, are identified by exciting them with suitable perturbations. We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of a homogeneous quasi-two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 condensate by quenching from the zero-momentum into the plane wave phase through a sudden change in Raman coupling strength. We demonstrate that the correlation function of the order parameter displays dynamic scaling during the late-time dynamics, allowing us to determine the dynamic critical exponent.</description>

      <title>Nagaoka ferromagnetism in doped Hubbard models in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model has been a problem of outstanding interest since Nagaoka's original proposal in 1966. Recent advances in quantum simulation have today enabled the study of tunable doped Hubbard models in ultracold atomic systems. Employing large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we establish the existence of high-spin ground states of the Hubbard model on finite-sized triangular lattices, analyze the microscopic mechanisms behind their origin, and investigate the interplay between ferromagnetism and other competing orders, such as stripes. These results explain$\unicode{x2014}$and shed new light on$\unicode{x2014}$the intriguing observations of ferromagnetic correlations in recent optical-lattice experiments. Additionally, we examine a generalized variant of the Hubbard model, wherein any second electron on a single lattice site is weakly bound compared to the first one, and demonstrate how this modification can lead to enhanced ferromagnetism, at intermediate length scales, on the nonfrustrated square lattice as well.</description>

      <title>Polaronic mechanism of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in Hubbard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for elusive Nagaoka-type ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model has recently enjoyed renewed attention with the advent of a variety of experimental platforms enabling its realization, including moir\'e materials, quantum dots, and ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Here, we demonstrate a universal mechanism for Nagaoka ferromagnetism (that applies to both bipartite and nonbipartite lattices) based on the formation of ferromagnetic polarons consisting of a dopant dressed with polarized spins. Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we present a comprehensive study of the ferromagnetic polaron in an electron-doped Hubbard model, establishing various polaronic properties such as its size and energetics. Moreover, we systematically probe the internal structure of the magnetic state$\unicode{x2014}$through the use of pinning fields and three-point spin-charge-spin correlation functions$\unicode{x2014}$for both the single-polaron limit and the high-density regime of interacting polarons. Our results highlight the crucial role of mobile polarons in the birth of global ferromagnetic order from local ferromagnetism and provide a unified framework to understand the development and demise of the Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic state across dopings.</description>
