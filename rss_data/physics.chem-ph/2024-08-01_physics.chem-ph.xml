      <title>Efficient and Scalable Wave Function Compression Using Corner Hierarchical Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential scaling of complete active space (CAS) and full configuration interaction (CI) calculations limits the ability of quantum chemists to simulate the electronic structures of strongly correlated systems. Herein, we present corner hierarchically approximated CI (CHACI), an approach to wave function compression based on corner hierarchical matrices (CH-matrices) -- a new variant of hierarchical matrices based on a block-wise low-rank decomposition. By application to dodecacene, a strongly correlated molecule, we demonstrate that CH matrix compression provides superior compression compared to a truncated global singular value decomposition. The compression ratio is shown to improve with increasing active space size. By comparison of several alternative schemes, we demonstrate that superior compression is achieved by a) using a blocking approach that emphasizes the upper-left corner of the CI vector, b) sorting the CI vector prior to compression, and c) optimizing the rank of each block to maximize information density.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the molecular electron chirality by electronic excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, it was predicted that the parity-violating energy difference (PVED) between enantiomers and the molecular electron chirality (MEC), which is the integrated value of the electron chirality density over the entire molecule are enhanced for ionization or electronic excitation. Following the confirmation of the enhancement of the PVED by electronic excitation in our previous papers, the present work confirms that electronic excitation enhances the MEC for H$_2$Te$_2$ and H$_2$Se$_2$. The PVED in the first excited state is explained by the contribution from the highest occupied molecular orbital if the PVED contribution from the highest occupied molecular orbital in the ground state dominates over any other contributions. In this paper, it is checked whether this explanation can also be applicable to the MEC. It is also reported that the MEC is not the simple sum of contributions from each atom and the mixing by the superposition between atomic orbitals of different atoms is important.</description>

      <title>Accurate Tunneling Splittings for Ever-Larger Molecules from Transfer-Learned, CCSD(T) Quality Energy Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with highest-level electronic structure calculations and full-dimensional quantum tunneling calculations to obtain a quantitative characterization of tunneling splittings for system sizes that are currently out of reach using traditional approaches. For intramolecular hydrogen transfer in tropolone, the best computed splitting including perturbative corrections in the ring-polymer instanton calculations is 0.94 cm$^{-1}$ and compares with 0.974 cm$^{-1}$ from experiments. On the other hand, for intermolecular double hydrogen transfer in the (propiolic acid)-(formic acid) dimer, the computations yield 0.0147 cm$^{-1}$ which is larger by 40 % compared with experiment (0.0097 cm$^{-1}$) but still in much better agreement than previous attempts (0.63 cm$^{-1}$). The strategy pursued in the present work is applicable to yet larger systems and other properties of interest and provides a rational route for highest-accuracy energy functions for prediction and benchmarking electronic structure methods vis-a-vis experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Non-Abelian Point-Group Symmetry to Estimate the Exact Ground-State Correlation Energy of Benzene in a Polarized Split-Valence Triple-Zeta Basis Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local electronic-structure methods in quantum chemistry operate on the ability to compress electron correlations more efficiently in a basis of spatially localized molecular orbitals than in a parent set of canonical orbitals. However, many typical choices of localized orbitals tend to be related by selected, near-exact symmetry operations whenever a molecule belongs to a point group, a feature which remains largely unexploited in most local correlation methods. The present Letter demonstrates how to leverage a recent unitary protocol for enforcing symmetry properties among localized orbitals to yield a high-accuracy estimate of the exact ground-state correlation energy of benzene ($D_{6h}$) in correlation-consistent polarized basis sets of both double- and triple-$\zeta$ quality. Through an initial application to many-body expanded full configuration interaction (MBE-FCI) theory, we show how molecular point-group symmetry can lead to computational savings that are inversely proportional to the order of the point group in a manner generally applicable to the acceleration of modern local correlation methods.</description>

      <title>AtmoSpec -- A Tool to Calculate Photoabsorption Cross-Sections for Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the photolysis processes undergone by transient volatile organic compounds in the troposphere requires the knowledge of their photoabsorption cross-section - quantities often challenging to determine experimentally, particularly due to the reactivity of these molecules. We present a computational tool coined AtmoSpec, which can predict a quantitative photoabsorption cross-section for volatile organic compounds by using computational photochemistry. The user enters the molecule of interest as a SMILES code and, after selecting a level of theory for the electronic structure (and waiting for the calculations to take place), is presented with a photoabsorption cross-section for the low-energy conformers and an estimate of the photolysis rate coefficient for different standardized actinic fluxes. More specifically, AtmoSpec is an automated workflow for the nuclear ensemble approach, an efficient technique to approximate the absolute intensities and excitation wavelengths of a photoabsorption cross-section for a molecule in the gas phase. This work provides background information on the nuclear ensemble approach, a guided example of a typical AtmoSpec calculation, details about the architecture of the code, and the current limitations and future developments of this tool.</description>

      <title>A General and Transferable Local Hybrid Functional from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory has become the workhorse of quantum physics, chemistry, and materials science. Within these fields, a broad range of applications needs to be covered. These applications range from solids to molecular systems, from organic to inorganic chemistry, or even from electrons to other fermions such as protons or muons. This is emphasized by the plethora of density functional approximations that have been developed for various cases. In this work, a new local hybrid exchange-correlation density functional is constructed from first principles, promoting generality and transferability. We show that constraint satisfaction can be achieved even for admixtures with full exact exchange, without sacrificing accuracy. The performance of the new functional for electronic structure theory is assessed for thermochemical properties, excitation energies, M\"ossbauer isomer shifts, NMR spin-spin coupling constants, NMR shieldings and shifts, magnetizabilities, EPR hyperfine coupling constants, and EPR g-tensors. The new density functional shows a robust performance throughout all tests and is numerically robust only requiring small grids for converged results. Additionally, the functional can be easily generalized to arbitrary fermions as shown for electron-proton correlation energies. Therefore, we outline that density functionals generated in this way are general purpose tools for quantum mechanical studies.</description>

      <title>Topological Woodward-Hoffmann classification for cycloadditions in polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of cycloaddition mechanisms is central to the fabrication of extended sp2 carbon nanostructures. In the context of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the reaction modeling of these compounds has focused mostly on putative, energetically preferred, exothermic products with limited consideration for symmetry allowed or forbidden mechanistic effects. Here, we introduce a scheme for formally classifying symmetry-forbidden reaction coordinates in Woodward-Hoffmann correlation diagrams. Topological classifiers grant access to the study of reaction pathways and correlation diagrams in the same footing, and are employed to investigate cycloaddition reactions of polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide (PAMY) yielding PAHs with a tetracenoisoindole core by means of tight-binding modeling and density functional theory (DFT). Our scheme provides new insights into cycloadditions of PAMY with pentacene, as observed by mass spectrometry and scanning tunneling microscopy, resulting in topologically-allowed pathways if the product is endothermic, and topologically-forbidden if the product is exothermic. Using this approach, we find that an endothermic, multi-step mechanism is in much better agreement with the experiment than a putative exothermic mechanism. Our work unveils topological classification as a crucial element for reaction modeling, and highlights its fundamental role in the design of cycloadditions in on-surface and solid-state chemical reactions, while underscoring exothermic pathways which are topologically-forbidden.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Diffusion in Magnesium Using Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and accurately predicting hydrogen diffusion in materials is challenging due to the complex interactions between hydrogen defects and the crystal lattice. These interactions span large length and time scales, making them difficult to address with standard ab initio techniques. This work addresses this challenge by employing accelerated machine learning (ML) molecular dynamics simulations through active learning. We conduct a comparative study of different ML-based interatomic potential schemes, including VASP, MACE, and CHGNet, utilizing various training strategies such as on-the-fly learning, pre-trained universal models, and fine-tuning. We obtain an optimal hydrogen diffusion coefficient value of \(2.1 \cdot 10^{-8}\) m\(^2\)/s at 673 K in MgH\(_{0.06}\), which aligns exceptionally well with experimental results, underlining the efficacy and accuracy of ML-assisted methodologies in the context of diffusive dynamics. Particularly, our procedure significantly reduces the computational effort associated with traditional transition state calculations or ad-hoc designed interatomic potentials. The results highlight the limitations of pre-trained universal solutions for defective materials and how they can be improved by fine-tuning. Specifically, fine-tuning the models on a database produced during on-the-fly training of VASP ML force field allows the retrieving of DFT-level accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Exciton Fission Enhanced Silicon Solar Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While silicon solar cells dominate global photovoltaic energy production, their continued improvement is hindered by the single junction limit. One potential solution is to use molecular singlet exciton fission to generate two electrons from each absorbed high-energy photon. We demonstrate that the long-standing challenge of coupling molecular excited states to silicon solar cells can be overcome using sequential charge transfer. Combining zinc phthalocyanine, aluminum oxide, and a shallow junction crystalline silicon microwire solar cell, the peak charge generation efficiency per photon absorbed in tetracene is (138 +- 6)%, comfortably surpassing the quantum efficiency limit for conventional silicon solar cells and establishing a new, scalable approach to low cost, high efficiency photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>A phase-field model for wet snow metamorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microstructure of snow determines its fundamental properties such as the mechanical strength, reflectivity, or the thermo-hydraulic properties. Snow undergoes continuous microstructural changes due to local gradients in temperature, humidity or curvature, in a process known as snow metamorphism. In this work, we focus on wet snow metamorphism, which occurs when temperature is close to the melting point and involves phase transitions amongst liquid water, water vapor, and solid ice. We propose a pore-scale phase-field model that simultaneously captures the three relevant phase-change phenomena: sublimation (deposition), evaporation (condensation), and melting (solidification). The phase-field formulation allows one to track the temperature evolution amongst the three phases and the water vapor concentration in the air. Our three-phase model recovers the corresponding two-phase transition model when one phase is not present in the system. 2D simulations of the model unveils the impact of humidity and temperature on the dynamics of wet snow metamorphism at the pore scale. We also explore the role of liquid melt content in controlling the dynamics of snow metamorphism in contrast to the dry regime, before percolation onsets. The model can be readily extended to incorporate two-phase flow and may be the basis for investigating other problems involving water phase transitions in a vapor-solid-liquid system such as airplane icing or thermal spray coating.</description>

      <title>Advanced Techniques for High-Performance Fock Matrix Construction on GPU Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Article presents two optimized multi-GPU algorithms for Fock matrix construction, building on the work of Ufimtsev et al. and Barca et al. The novel algorithms, opt-UM and opt-Brc, introduce significant enhancements, including improved integral screening, exploitation of sparsity and symmetry, a linear scaling exchange matrix assembly algorithm, and extended capabilities for Hartree-Fock caculations up to $f$-type angular momentum functions. Opt-Brc excels for smaller systems and for highly contracted triple-$\zeta$ basis sets, while opt-UM is advantageous for large molecular systems. Performance benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs show that our algorithms in the EXtreme-scale Electronic Structure System (EXESS), when combined, outperform all current GPU and CPU Fock build implementations in TeraChem, QUICK, GPU4PySCF, LibIntX, ORCA, and Q-Chem. The implementations were benchmarked on linear and globular systems and average speed ups across three double-$\zeta$ basis sets of 1.5$\times$, 5.2$\times$, and 8.5$\times$ were observed compared to TeraChem, GPU4PySCF, and QUICK respectively. Strong scaling analysis reveals over 91% parallel efficiency on four GPUs for opt-Brc, making it typically faster for multi-GPU execution. Single-compute-node comparisons with CPU-based software like ORCA and Q-Chem show speedups of up to 42$\times$ and 31$\times$, respectively, enhancing power efficiency by up to 18$\times$.</description>

      <title>In-plane dielectric constant and conductivity of confined water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water is essential for almost every aspect of life on our planet and, unsurprisingly, its properties have been studied in great detail. However, disproportionately little remains known about the electrical properties of interfacial and strongly confined water where its structure deviates from that of bulk water, becoming distinctly layered. The structural change is expected to affect water's conductivity and particularly its polarizability, which in turn modifies intermolecular forces that play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes. Here we use scanning dielectric microscopy to probe the in-plane electrical properties of water confined between atomically flat surfaces separated by distances down to 1 nm. For confinement exceeding a few nm, water exhibits an in-plane dielectric constant close to that of bulk water and its proton conductivity is notably enhanced, gradually increasing with decreasing water thickness. This trend abruptly changes when the confined water becomes only a few molecules thick. Its in-plane dielectric constant reaches giant, ferroelectric-like values of about 1,000 whereas the conductivity peaks at a few S/m, close to values characteristic of superionic liquids. We attribute the enhancement to strongly disordered hydrogen bonding induced by the few-layer confinement, which facilitates both easier in-plane polarization of molecular dipoles and faster proton exchange. This insight into the electrical properties of nanoconfined water is important for understanding many phenomena that occur at aqueous interfaces and in nanoscale pores.</description>

      <title>Detection of antifreeze molecule ethylene glycol in the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of complex prebiotic molecules using millimeter and submillimeter telescopes allows us to understand how the basic building blocks of life are formed in the universe. In the interstellar medium (ISM), ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) is the simplest sugar alcohol molecule, and it is the reduced alcohol of the simplest sugar-like molecule, glycolaldehyde (CH$_{2}$OHCHO). We present the first detection of the rotational emission lines of $aGg^{\prime}$ conformer of ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The estimated column density of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 is (4.5$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 155$\pm$35 K. The abundance of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to H$_{2}$ is (1.4$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-8}$. Similarly, the abundances of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to CH$_{2}$OHCHO and CH$_{3}$OH are 3.1$\pm$0.5 and (6.1$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{-3}$. We compare the estimated abundance of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with the existing three-phase warm-up chemical model abundance of (CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$, and we notice the observed abundance and modelled abundance are nearly similar. We discuss the possible formation pathways of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the hot molecular cores, and we find that $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ is probably created via the recombination of two CH$_{2}$OH radicals on the grain surface of G358.93$-$0.03 MM1.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number ($\mathcal{\kappa}$) scaling of the $A$ matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the post-selection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) approach that involves a simple yet effective modification of the HHL algorithm to extract a feature of $|x\rangle$, and which leads to achieving optimal behaviour in $\mathcal{\kappa}$ (linear scaling) for large condition number situations. This has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. We carry out two sets of simulations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ matrices via: (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size $64 \times 64$ and $\mathcal{\kappa}$ values of up to $\approx$ 1 million, and (b) a deep-dive into quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size $256 \times 256$ that reach $\mathcal{\kappa}$ of about 466. The molecular systems that we consider are Li$_{\mathrm{2}}$, RbH, and CsH. Although the feature of $|x\rangle$ considered in our examples is an overlap between the input and output states of the HHL algorithm, our approach is general and can be applied in principle to any transition matrix element involving $|x\rangle$.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical justifications for the observed discriminations between enantiomers of prochiral alcohols by chirally blind EI-MS</title>

Abstract: To all appearances, electron impact mass spectrometer (EI-MS) is considered a "chirally blind" instrument. Yet, numerous non-identical R (right) and S (left) configurations of prochiral alcohols' mass spectra alcohols have appeared in the literature with almost no justification. Such observations are often attributed to impurities, experimental circumstances, inaccurate measurements, etc. In an experimental attempt to explain this phenomenon, here we have avoided the above mentioned pitfalls by conducting control experiments using different pure enantiomers under the same circumstances. Hence, we report the mass spectra of R- and S-enantiomers of 2-octanol (1R, 1S) and 1-octyn-3-ol (2R, 2S) collected by running 20 independent experiments for each R- and S-enantiomer. Statistical analyses confirmed that the peak intensities were significant to an acceptable level of confidence. The 1R and 1S enantiomers were separated reasonably in the PC space, implying that the chirally blind EI-MS is able to discriminate between R and S prochiral alcohols. Theoretically, self-complexation through H-bonding for S (or R) appears to give a new chiral center at the H-bonded oxygen atom, producing a new dimeric pair of diastereomers SRS and SSS (or RRR and RSR) before ionization, and SRS.+ and SSS.+ (or RRR.+ and RSR.+) after ionization. The results of our calculations have explicitly shown that these hydrogen bonds formed. Interestingly, the latter four ionized diastereomers appear with different structural and thermodynamic parameters at the M06-2X/6-311++g (d,p) level of theory.</description>

      <title>A Rotational/Roto-translational Constraint Method for Condensed Matter</title>

Abstract: In condensed matter physics, particularly in perovskite materials, the rotational motion of molecules and ions is associated with important issues such as ion conduction mechanism. Constrained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations offer a means to separate translational, vibrational, and rotational motions, enabling the independent study of their effects. In this study, we introduce a rotational and roto-translational constraint algorithm based on the Velocity Verlet integrator, which has been implemented into a homebrew version of the CP2K package. The MD results show that our program can selectively constrain the molecules and ions in the system and support long-time MD runs. The algorithm can help the future study of important rotation related dynamic problems in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Cavity-modified electronic interactions in molecular ensembles under vibrational strong coupling: Combined insights from cavity Born-Oppenheimer perturbation and ab initio wave function theories</title>

Abstract: Resonant vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between molecular vibrations and quantized field modes of low-frequency optical cavities constitutes the conceptual cornerstone of vibro-polaritonic chemistry. In this work, we theoretically investigate complementary nonresonant electron-cavity mode-interactions in the cavity Born-Oppenheimer (CBO) approximation. We focus on cavity-induced modifications of local and non-local electronic interactions in dipole-coupled molecular ensembles under VSC. Methodologically, we combine CBO perturbation theory (CBO-PT) [Fischer, Saalfrank, JCTC 19, 7215 (2023)] with non-perturbative CBO Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theories. Wave function approaches are reformulated to self-consistently address a cavity reaction potential (CRP), which minimizes the electronic energy in the cavity subspace. We derive up to second-order CBO-PT corrections of intra- and intermolecular energies revealing non-trivial corrections to dipole-dipole, dipole-induced-dipole and van-der-Waals interactions, and provide analytical second-order CRP for unimolecular and interacting bimolecular scenarios. In the unimolecular case, we find small local modifications of molecular PES for selected isomerization reactions dominantly captured by the first-order dipole fluctuation. Excellent agreement between CBO-PT and non-perturbative wave function results is obtained indicating minor VSC-induced state relaxation effects in the single-molecule limit. In the bimolecular scenario, CBO-PT reveals an explicit coupling of interacting dimers to cavity modes besides cavity-polarization dependent dipole-induced-dipole and van-der-Waals interactions with enhanced long-range character. An illustrative CBO-CCSD-based numerical analysis of selected molecular dimer models provides a complementary non-perturbative perspective on cavity-modified intermolecular interactions under VSC.</description>
