      <title>Evidence for evolving Dark Energy from a new cosmic probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmological model provides a remarkably successful description of the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe. However, a growing discrepancy between measurements of the expansion rate $H_0$ from the near and distant Universe now appears to be significant at the ~4-7 $\sigma$ level. This inconsistency, known as the ``Hubble tension'', has arisen either due to unrecognized systematics in these measurements or new physics beyond the standard model, such as an evolving dark energy equation of state. Modeling ~20-year, multi-band optical light curves for 6992 active galactic nuclei (AGN), we find a tight relation linking the variability amplitude and characteristic timescale to their intrinsic luminosity. This empirical law enables us to construct an AGN-based Hubble diagram to z ~3.5. Joint inference with supernova distances reveals evidence for an evolving dark energy equation of state at the 3.8-3.9 $\sigma$ level over constant w models and 4.4-4.8 $\sigma$ over $\Lambda$CDM. Our results establish AGN light curves as a powerful tool for cosmography that could offer a novel pathway to test deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM expansion history.</description>

      <title>Probing the Warm Dark Matter mass with [C II] intensity mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter (DM) is still debated. While cold DM (CDM) is the standard paradigm, warm DM (WDM) may ease some small-scale tensions in the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Line-intensity mapping (LIM) offers a novel probe of DM properties. To explore the potential of LIM surveys in constraining the WDM particle mass ($m_\mathrm{WDM}$) by means of the [C II] power spectrum (PS), we provide forecasts for the Deep Spectroscopic Survey (DSS) at $z\simeq3.6$ and extend the analysis to larger sky coverage, higher sensitivity, and/or increased spectral resolution. We develop a formulation for the [C II] PS based on the halo-model approach, incorporating the uncertainty in the luminosity function (LF) through two alternative parameterisations. We perform a Bayesian analysis on mock data to derive constraints on $m_\mathrm{WDM}$. In a CDM universe, the DSS yields lower limits on $m_\mathrm{WDM}$ at $95\%$ credibility level (CL) of $1.10$ keV and $0.58$ keV when considering the optimistic and pessimistic LF ($\alpha = -1.1$), respectively. Ambitious surveys can improve these figures to $5.82$ keV and $1.90$ keV, and assuming a steeper faint-end slope ($\alpha = -1.9$) further boosts these limits. A fivefold increase in spectral resolution enhances sensitivity to the damping scale associated to redshift-space distortions, tightening the constraints on $m_\mathrm{WDM}$ by a factor of up to $\sim1.8$. Finally, Bayesian inference on mock data with $m_\mathrm{WDM}=3$ keV results in a well-constrained and unbiased posterior only in futuristic survey setups. Upcoming LIM surveys can provide meaningful limits on $m_\mathrm{WDM}$, although the negligible contribution from small haloes reduces the constraining power of the [C II] PS. Future progress will benefit from combining multiple redshifts and emission lines, opening the way to competitive constraints on the nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the Hubble parameter from unedited compact object merger catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, constraints on the Hubble parameter using multiple dark sirens have been made,relying on a galaxy catalogue, correlations between the mass and redshift distributions, or both. Those studies have typically used only significant gravitational wave candidates. In this work, we present a framework for cosmological inference that bypasses per-candidate parameter estimation, uses only detection-level information. This allows the population inference from a candidate list produced directly by a search pipeline, without additional selection cuts. Our method is particularly suited to extracting information from marginal candidates, which are essential for probing the distant universe.</description>

      <title>Isocurvature Induced Gravitational Waves at Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are powerful probes of new physics in the early Universe. In particular, GWs induced by primordial isocurvature perturbations encode information of novel dynamics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Existing studies of isocurvature induced GWs focus on a particular type: cold dark matter (CDM) isocurvature. In this work, we present a more comprehensive study of four kinds of isocurvature involving CDM, baryons, neutrinos and free-streaming dark radiation (DR). We first reformulate initial conditions of isocurvature with coupled neutrinos because modes relevant for observations at Pulsar Timing Arrays enter the horizon before neutrino decoupling. With these new initial conditions, neutrino isocurvature is phenomenologically similar to CDM isocurvature up to an overall coefficient, which leads to an interesting conversion of isocurvature between radiation and matter sectors. We then find that the spectrum of isocurvature induced GWs from free-streaming DR is qualitatively different than that from CDM due to the presence of anisotropic stress. Unlike GWs induced by CDM isocurvature that are suppressed at high frequencies due to matter density being suppressed at early times, DR isocurvature induced GWs is proportional to the constant ratio between DR density and total radiation. Finally, we utilize two general parametrizations of the isocurvature power spectrum: a delta function and a broken power law, and derive novel constraints with recent NANOGrav data. Our results set stringent constraints on isocurvature around $10^{6}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, which are complementary to cosmological observations at large scales.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational-wave background search using data from five pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using public data from five pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), we search for a stationary, isotropic, and unpolarized nHz stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). We use pulse time-of-arrival data from 121 pulsars, which is more informative than previous searches, carried out separately by the individual PTA collaborations using only their own data. For pulsars observed by more than one PTA, we employ a new "direct combination" method to merge their astrophysical models and data. This avoids the challenge of reconciling the different PTA timing models to obtain a single "best" model. A central result of our analysis is posterior probability distributions for the amplitude $A_{gw}$ and exponent $\gamma_{gw}$ of the putative SGWB energy-density spectrum, modeled as a power law in frequency. While these results are consistent with a nonzero SGWB amplitude $A_{gw}$, the statistical significance--assessed via a Bayesian odds ratio and through noise-marginalized false-alarm probabilities ($p$-values) for three different detection statistics--remains below the conventional $5\sigma$ threshold for a confident detection. We also reconstruct the inter-pulsar timing-residual correlation as a function of the angle $\theta$ between the pulsar lines of sight. This is consistent with the curve predicted by Hellings and Downs (HD).</description>

      <title>The frame-dragging vector potential on galaxy scales from DM-only Newtonian $N$-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08703v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effects of General Relativity are usually neglected in the non-linear evolution of structures, where Newtonian $N$-body simulations are traditionally employed. In the post-Friedmann expansion framework, a weak-field relativistic approximation purpose-built for cosmology, a frame-dragging gravito-magnetic vector potential arises at leading order, sourced by momentum currents, contributing to the metric even if the dynamics of matter fields at this order is Newtonian, and can thus be extracted from $N$-body simulations. Using the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator code on the IllustrisTNG simulations, here we extend previous work in order to compute the power spectrum of this vector potential down to galactic scales. The magnitude of the vector potential is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by perturbation theory, and is a $1\% \sim 0.1\%$ effect compared to the non-linear Newtonian scalar gravitational potential. In the red-shift range considered here, the gravito-magnetic effect remains subdominant, without showing any enhancement during a particular phase in the evolution of structures, aside from the continuous growth of non-linearity at low redshift. Although this seems to suggest that, within the $\Lambda$CDM model, no significant gravito-magnetic effects contribute to the non-linear evolution of cosmic structures, i.e. to the dynamics of massive particles, possible observational consequences, e.g. in lensing, deserve further exploration.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass constraints in the context of 4-parameter dark energy equation of state and DESI DR2 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu$, are strongly shaped by assumptions about the dark-energy equation of state due to the well-known degeneracy between massive neutrinos and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this work, we move beyond the two-parameter Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) form adopted in recent DESI analyses and re-examine neutrino mass constraints using a flexible four-parameter dark energy equation of state (4pDE). We implement the 4pDE model in a modified version of CLASS and perform a full MCMC analysis using Planck, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon+ data. Relative to our previous 4pDE study based on pre-DESI BAO datasets, the inclusion of DESI DR2 substantially tightens the constraints on the transition parameters while still yielding a relaxed neutrino-mass bound compared to $\Lambda$CDM, $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.101$ eV ($95\%$ C.L.). This upper limit is more stringent than the DESI DR2 constraint obtained within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. From the best-fit parameters, we reconstruct the evolution of the 4pDE equation of state along with both $68\%$ and $95\%$C.L. We do not find a statistically significant phantom-crossing at $z \sim 0.5$, consistent with the conclusion from the DESI collaboration; at higher redshifts, the reconstructed $w(z)$ follows the CPL evolution and deviates only at low redshift. Additionally we also find reduction in $\Delta \chi^2_{\rm min}=-7.3$ compared to $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Probing the environment around GW170817 with DESI: insights on galaxy group peculiar velocities for standard siren measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, following the gravitational wave event GW170817 and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) observations. A standard siren measurement with a nearby (luminosity distance $\sim 40 $ Mpc) event such as GW170817 is typically sensitive to the peculiar motion of the host galaxy due to local dynamics. Previous measurements from this event have taken advantage of peculiar velocity measurements of nearby galaxies, including a handful of objects in the galaxy group that the host of the event, NGC 4993, has been associated with. Still, the group's properties and NGC 4993's membership were debated. We present DESI observations of thousands of galaxies in the vicinity of NGC 4993, resulting in 39 group galaxies and a five-fold increase in galaxies compared to previous observations with many of these galaxies contributing to a peculiar velocity measurement. Examining the local dynamics, our observations support the presence of a galaxy group of which NGC 4993 is part with a halo mass of order $\sim$$10^{13}~M_\odot$. Using peculiar velocity measurements from our Fundamental Plane galaxies observations, we find $H_0 =70.9^{+6.4}_{-8.5}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. In addition, using a peculiar velocity measurement for NGC 4993 from Surface Brightness Fluctuations in Cosmicflows-4 we find $H_0 =73.4^{+3.3}_{-3.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We study the impact of different galaxy selection criteria on the determination of the peculiar velocity and, in turn, on the $H_0$ measurement. Our results highlight the importance of multiplexed spectroscopic observations of the environments of gravitational wave events to probe local dynamics, which can ultimately affect standard siren measurements.</description>

      <title>Foreground Mitigation for CMB Lensing with the Global Minimum Variance Quadratic Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a powerful probe of cosmology, providing insight into structure formation and the evolution of the universe. Current and upcoming CMB experiments such as SPT-3G and the Simons Observatory (SO) provide high-resolution, low-noise temperature and polarization maps that are ideal for lensing reconstruction. The global minimum variance (GMV) quadratic estimator for CMB lensing reduces reconstruction noise over the standard quadratic estimator (SQE). In this work, we extend the GMV framework to incorporate the tSZ-deproj and cross-ILC foreground mitigation techniques, which enhance robustness against contamination from astrophysical sources. For SPT-3G Ext-10k and SO Extended at $\ell_{\mathrm{max}}^T = 3500$, the lensing bias at $L &lt; 1000$ is reduced from $\sim4\%$ with standard GMV and SQE to $2\%$ with tSZ-deproj, and to $&lt; 1\%$ with cross-ILC. These methods enable the construction of foreground-cleaned lensing maps suitable for cross-correlation analyses, with direct relevance for current and future surveys.</description>

      <title>Microlensing Signatures of Dyson Sphere-like Structures around Primordial Black Holes as Technosignatures of Extraterrestrial Advanced Civilizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the microlensing detectability of extraterrestrial technosignatures originating from Dyson sphere \textendash like structures, such as Dyson Swarms surrounding primordial black holes (PBHs). These hypothetical swarms consist of stochastically varying, partially opaque structures that could modulate standard microlensing light curves through time-dependent transmission effects. We introduce a probabilistic framework that includes a stochastic transmission model governed by variable optical depth and random gap distributions. We perform a parameter scan and generate heatmaps of the optical transit duration. We study the infrared excess radiation and peak emission wavelength as complementary observational signatures. Additionally, we define and analyze the effective optical depth and the anomalous microlensing event rate for these stochastic structures. Our findings provide a new avenue for searching for extraterrestrial advanced civilizations by extending microlensing studies to include artificial, dynamic modulation signatures.</description>

      <title>Infrared Freeze-In of Magnetic Dipole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for the cosmological production of keV - GeV mass dark matter that interacts with the Standard Model through a small effective magnetic dipole moment. Such an interaction can be radiatively generated if dark matter couples to heavier charged particles. Previous studies have focused on the case where these charged states are much heavier than the reheat temperature, such that freeze-in production of dark matter is sensitive to the ultraviolet details of reheating. Here, we instead consider the possibility that these heavy states have masses comparable to the dark matter mass and are charged under a new kinetically-mixed $U(1)'$. As a result, dark matter production is dominated by the infrared freeze-in of the heavy charged states that subsequently thermalize the rest of the dark sector to a temperature much below that of the visible bath. We delineate regions of parameter space consistent with cosmological and astrophysical constraints and identify benchmark scenarios that can guide the next generation of direct detection experiments searching for spin-dependent scattering of sub-GeV dark matter.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Particle Production and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of particle production during inflation in scenarios where an infinite tower of states features a mass scale that decreases exponentially along the inflationary trajectory. Such couplings naturally arise in string effective field theories and are in fact motivated by the Swampland Distance Conjecture (SDC). We show that the corrections to inflationary observables sourced by the tower scale as $(H/\Lambda_{\text{sp}})^{2+p}$, with $H$ being the Hubble scale, $\Lambda_{\text{sp}}$ being the species scale, that is the quantum gravity cut-off, and $p\geq 1$ characterizes the density of states in the tower. As a result, in gravitationally weakly coupled cosmological effective theories, the tower-induced contributions are suppressed relative to the standard single-field predictions, leaving the inflationary phenomenology essentially unchanged. We demonstrate this explicitly across a set of well-motivated inflationary potentials, and we compare the resulting predictions with the most recent observational constraints, including those from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.</description>

      <title>Open Effective Field Theory and the Physics of Cosmological Collider Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the origin of the cosmological collider signal using the framework of open effective field theories. Focusing on the single exchange of a massive scalar field, we demonstrate that the trispectrum splits cleanly into its local and non-local components once the heavy-field propagators are decomposed in the Keldysh basis. Integrating out the massive degree of freedom yields a single-field effective field theory for the light scalar that necessarily contains both unitary operators and non-unitary contributions associated with dissipation and stochastic noise. We show that the leading local signal in parity-preserving theories arises from the unitary part of this effective field theory, whereas the non-local signal is intrinsically associated with its stochastic sector. The effective field theory coefficients themselves are a priori non-analytic in the external kinematics; however, this non-analyticity can be softened when a scale hierarchy - such as the heavy-mass expansion - is imposed, up to spurious contributions that ultimately cancel in observables. Finally, we establish a connection between the cosmological collider signal and entropy production, linking the observable non-local signal to intrinsic properties of the quantum state, including its degree of mixedness.</description>

      <title>Tracing Nitrogen Enrichment across Cosmic Time with JWST</title>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio in star-forming galaxies at redshift z~1-6, with a median redshift of z=2.7, using deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy. Leveraging detections of faint auroral emission lines in 76 galaxies at z&gt;1 from both the MARTA survey and a large compilation of high-redshift literature objects, we derive direct electron temperature-based abundances for nitrogen and oxygen using rest-frame optical lines. We establish the first high-redshift calibrations of strong-line N/O diagnostics based on direct abundance measurements, finding no significant evolution for either N2O2 = [NII]6585/[OII]3727,3729 and N2S2 = [NII]6585/[SII]6717,6731 diagnostics compared to local realisations. We then investigate the N/O-O/H relation across cosmic time using both direct abundances and strong-line based measurements (additional 430 galaxies). We find evidence for mild but systematic nitrogen enhancement at high redshift: galaxies at z&gt;1 exhibit N/O ratios elevated by ~0.18 dex (median offset) at fixed O/H compared to the local relation, with a more pronounced enhancement at low metallicity (12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.1) where the offset reaches up to ~0.3-0.4 dex. We consider several scenarios to explain the observed trends, including bursty star formation, differential metal loading, and inflows of pristine gas. Our results provide the most extensive confirmation of elevated N/O ratios at high-redshift to date based on rest-optical diagnostics and within a self-consistent frame.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Dark Matter Subhalo Constraints from Stellar Streams using Implicit Likelihood Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evidence for dark matter (DM) remains compelling, although attempts to understand its particle nature remain inconclusive. One promising method to study DM is detecting DM subhalos through their gravitational interactions with stellar streams. In this study, we apply Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) to constrain subhalo interaction parameters, including mass, scale radius, velocity, and encounter geometry, from stellar stream kinematics. We generate particle spray simulations based on the Lagrange Cloud stripping technique, focusing on the ATLAS-Aliqa Uma stream as a test case. We train multiple NPE models across multiple observational scenarios, quantifying how kinematic completeness affects inference and forecasting constraints from upcoming surveys including LSST, 4MOST, and 10-year Gaia data. Our results demonstrate that NPE can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors. In the idealized case with full 6D coordinates, we achieve subhalo mass uncertainties of 15-20% for a $10^7 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ subhalo, with 5D coordinates (excluding radial velocities) achieving similar performance. Under realistic observational conditions, mass uncertainties range from 50% (present-day) to 20-40% (future scenarios), with comparable performance between the photometric-only LSST sample and a smaller sample that includes Gaia proper motions and 4MOST radial velocities. Most notably, we find that velocity bimodality emerges when phase space is poorly sampled, whether due to missing kinematic information or limited stellar tracers. Combining large photometric samples with targeted spectroscopic follow-up can effectively resolves this degeneracy. These results demonstrate the power of implicit likelihood inference for optimizing stellar stream observational strategies and forecasting DM subhalo constraints from upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>PolySwyft: sequential simulation-based nested sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PolySwyft, a novel, non-amortised simulation-based inference framework that unites the strengths of nested sampling (NS) and neural ratio estimation (NRE) to tackle challenging posterior distributions when the likelihood is intractable but a forward simulator is available. By nesting rounds of NRE within the exploration of NS, and employing a principled KL-divergence criterion to adaptively terminate sampling, PolySwyft achieves faster convergence on complex, multimodal targets while rigorously preserving Bayesian validity. On a suite of toy problems with analytically known posteriors of a dim(theta,D)=(5,100) multivariate Gaussian and multivariate correlated Gaussian mixture model, we demonstrate that PolySwyft recovers all modes and credible regions with fewer simulator calls than swyft's TNRE. As a real-world application, we infer cosmological parameters dim(theta,D)=(6,111) from CMB power spectra using CosmoPower. PolySwyft is released as open-source software, offering a flexible toolkit for efficient, accurate inference across the astrophysical sciences and beyond.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Strings via Black Hole Quasinormal Modes in Gravitational Wave Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes, the simplest solution to Einstein's field equations, do not emit light, making their observations a major challenge for researchers. However, discovery of binary black holes (BBHs) in 2015 by LIGO has transformed the study of compact objects, with over 300 BBHs recorded, providing a new avenue for probing new physics. GWs remain a prominent and precise method of observing not only BBHs, but also dark matter and cosmic strings. Cosmic strings -- hypothetical one dimensional topological defects formed in the early universe, are yet to be observed, with multiple detection methods such as particle radiation, gravitational waves and lensing being proposed. Here we present a novel framework to search for cosmic strings by modeling them as perturbations within non-rotating black hole spacetime, focusing on their imprint on the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our numerical simulations identify a lower limit on perturbation strength, $\lambda \sim 10^{-10}$ for uncharged string and $\lambda \sim 10^{-7}$ for charged string, below which cosmic string effects become unobservable in QNM signals. By analyzing eigenvalue splitting and centers, we show that cosmic string properties impart distinct and detectable features to GW signals. Our results establish QNM analysis as a powerful, alternative observational strategy for constraining or detecting cosmic strings, and offer an inverse approach to estimate string energy or charge if a signal is detected. With upgrades in LIGO technologies and advanced multimessenger astronomy under development, these findings highlight new potential for detecting cosmic strings.</description>

      <title>Time-Averaged Template for Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background Detection in Space-Based Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) poses significant challenges for data analysis and parameter inference in future space-based gravitational-wave missions, such as LISA and Taiji, as it appears as an additional stochastic component along with instrumental noise. Previous studies have developed various approaches to distinguish the SGWB from instrumental noise, often under simplified assumptions such as static or equal-arm configurations. However, in realistic scenarios, time-varying arm-lengths introduce additional complexities that require careful modeling. In this work, we investigate the impact of template construction on SGWB parameter estimation under realistic orbital configurations. Using the simulated SGWB signals and dominant instrumental noise sources, we compare three template strategies: time-averaged template constructed from segmented data, equal-arm template, and a template treating the arm-lengths as a free parameter. Our results show that the time-averaged template yield improves parameter estimation accuracy under time-varying arm-lengths, whereas introducing the effective arm-length as a free parameter increases estimation uncertainty. These findings highlight the importance of realistic template construction for high-precision SGWB analysis in future space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Measuring the diffuse Galactic synchrotron spectral index and curvature between 45 and 2300 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an all-sky map of the synchrotron spectral index and curvature between 45 and 2300 MHz at a resolution of 1 degree calculated from a combination of numerous partial sky empirical measurements. We employ a least-squares parametric fit which relies on removing a free-free emission template and a component separation technique which fits for both synchrotron and free-free emission. We compare our diffuse sky model estimates against those derived from the models widely used in the community (e.g. pysm3 and GSM) employing external datasets that were not included in the estimation process. Our evaluation focuses on identifying the enhanced consistency at both the map level and in pixel-to-pixel correlations, allowing for a more robust verification of our model's performance. We find our parametric, least-squares synchrotron estimate to be the most reliable across radio frequencies as it consistently provides sky models with average accuracies (when compared to empirical data) of around 20 per cent, whilst other model performances range on average between 10 and 70 per cent accurate. The results obtained have been made publicly accessible online and can be utilized to further develop and refine models of Galactic synchrotron emission.</description>

      <title>Dark Photons in the Early Universe: From Thermal Production to Cosmological Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, a generic class of light gauge bosons that interact with the Standard Model (SM) exclusively through kinetic mixing, arise naturally in many gauge extensions of the SM. Motivated by these theoretical considerations, we present a comprehensive analysis of their thermal production in the early universe. Our calculation covers a broad range of dark photon masses from 0.1 keV to 100 MeV and include inverse decay, annihilation, and semi-Compton processes. Wherever possible, we present analytical estimates of the production rates and yields, and verify their accuracy numerically. For dark photons lighter than twice the electron masses (around 1 MeV), we find that our analytical estimate of the freeze-in yield based on resonant production is very accurate, implying that off-resonance contributions can be neglected in practice. For heavy dark photons, although this conclusion no longer holds, we derive an interesting ratio, $4\pi e/27\approx0.14$, with $e$ the coupling constant of QED, that can be used to estimate the relative importance of on- and off-resonance contributions. Finally, using the calculated abundance of dark photons in the early universe, we derive cosmological constraints on the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing. Compared with bounds from stellar cooling and supernovae, the cosmological constraints are most stringent in the mass range from 0.1 MeV to 6 MeV, within which kinetic mixing at the level of $10^{-12}\sim10^{-10}$ can be probed.</description>

      <title>High-Redshift Galactic Outflows: Orientation Effects, Kinematics, and Metallicity in TNG50 and SERRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Recently, JWST/NIRSpec observations have provided the first detections of warm ionised outflows in low-mass galaxies at high redshifts (z&gt;3), revealing an occurrence rate of 25-40% depending on the intensity of the emission lines. This fraction is lower than predicted by simulations, which suggest that fast outflowing gas should be a common feature of all star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. Aims: In order to better understand the discrepancies between simulations and observations, we identify and characterize outflows in high-redshift galaxies using the TNG50 cosmological and SERRA zoom-in simulations. Our study examines how outflow detectability depends on the line of sight, explores the properties of the fast gas, and investigates its relationship with key galactic properties. Methods: We analyse approximately 60000 galaxies from TNG50 and 3000 galaxies from SERRA over the redshift ranges z=3-5 and z=4-5, respectively, spanning stellar masses of Mstar=10^7.5-10^11Msun. Outflows in the immediate vicinity of each galaxy are identified using a Gaussian mixture model algorithm that uses the gas velocity, star-formation-rate, and location as input parameters. We subsequently compare the simulated outflows to those observed in the JWST/JADES NIRSpec survey. Results: Outflow masses in both TNG50 and SERRA broadly reproduce the JWST/JADES measurements within roughly 0.5dex, though simulations tend to predict slightly higher values, suggesting that optical emission lines capture only a fraction of the multiphase outflow. However, simulated outflow velocities are typically an order of magnitude lower than those inferred from observations. TNG50 indicates a clear orientation dependence as outflows in face-on galaxies are approximately 15% more likely to be detected than in edge-on systems, with this difference increasing to nearly 40% for more massive, disc-shaped galaxies.</description>

      <title>Backwards Gamma-Ray Bursts: Searching for Exploding Primordial Black Holes in Short-Duration GRB Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for signatures of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) catalogs. An exploding primordial black hole (PBH) undergoing final-stage Hawking radiation is predicted to produce a distinctive "backwards burst"-a very short, spectrally hard transient with monotonically increasing flux and little or no longer-wavelength afterglow. We develop a forward-modeling framework that directly compares theoretical PBH evaporation light curves, computed with full Standard Model particle content and detector response folding, against empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzing 39 well-characterized Swift sGRBs with non-detected or extremely faint afterglows, we find that all events exhibit fast-rise, slow-decay temporal profiles inconsistent with the PBH prediction. Model comparison via Akaike and Bayesian information criteria decisively favors conventional FRED or ERCA fits over the PBH template for every burst. No candidates for terminal PBH evaporation are identified. The null result yields an upper bound on the local PBH explosion rate density $R_{\mathrm{PBH}} \lesssim 10^5~\mathrm{pc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to constraints from dedicated TeV $\gamma$-ray searches. Our methodology establishes a robust template-matching approach that can be scaled to larger multi-instrument catalogs, providing a foundation for future searches targeting this unique signature of quantum gravity and early-Universe physics.</description>

      <title>A search for successful and choked jets in nearby broad-lined Type Ic supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observational link between long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and broad-lined stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) is well established. Significant progress has been made in constraining what fraction of SNe Ic-BL may power high- or low-luminosity GRBs when viewed at small off-axis angles. However, the GRB-SN connection still lacks a complete understanding in the broader context of massive-star evolution and explosion physics. Models predict a continuum of outcomes for the fastest ejecta, from choked to ultra-relativistic jets, and observations from radio to X-rays are key to probing these scenarios across a range of viewing angles and velocities. Here, we present results from a coordinated radio-to-X-ray campaign targeting nearby (z&lt;=0.1) SNe Ic-BL designed to explore this diversity. With eight new radio-monitored events and updated data for one previously observed SN, we further tighten constraints on the fraction of SNe Ic-BL as relativistic as SN 1998bw/GRB 980425. We identify SN 2024rjw as a new radio-loud event likely powered by strong interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), and add evidence supporting a similar interpretation for SN 2020jqm. We also establish new limits on the properties of radio-emitting ejecta with velocities consistent with cocoons from choked jets, highlighting SN 2022xxf as a promising cocoon-dominated candidate. These results refine our understanding of the continuum linking ordinary SNe Ic-BL, engine-driven explosions, and GRBs, and contribute to building a sample that will inform future multi-messenger searches for electromagnetic counterparts to high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>The Strong-$CP$ Problem and its Gauge Axion solution as Evidence for Fundamental Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological susceptibility of the QCD vacuum provides an understanding of $\theta$-vacua as vacua of a Chern-Simons gauge theory. In this way, it gives an immediate proof of the physicality of the boundary $\theta$-term. This makes the essence of the strong-$CP$ puzzle very transparent and offers a solution in form of the gauge axion, which has exact quality. This axion represents an intrinsic part of the QCD gauge redundancy without any reference to an anomalous global symmetry. It is a two-form transforming under the QCD gauge symmetry. Due to its pure gauge nature, the gauge axion represents a powerful tool to monitor physics of $\theta$-vacua in various regimes. Unlike the ordinary Peccei-Quinn axion, which is UV-completed into a Goldstone phase of a complex scalar and thereby suffers from the quality problem, the gauge axion is UV-completed directly into a fundamental theory of gravity. We study the domain wall and string structure of the gauge axion and show that the strings sourcing it must be a part of this fundamental theory. We thus observe that the absence of the axion quality problem motivates the presence of fundamental strings. This provides a new argument for a connection between the axion and gravity.</description>

Abstract: When a moving gravitational-wave (GW) source travels behind a massive astrophysical object, its signal is gravitationally lensed, showing a waveform distortion similar to a Paczy\'{n}ski curve. We present a first study of the lensing signature of a massive black hole (MBH) on a frequency-dependent GW signal from a moving binary merger. For both light and GW sources in a Keplerian circular orbit around a MBH lens, the self-lensing geometry breaks the microlensing degeneracy in the Einstein radius crossing timescale $t_{\rm E}$. The duration of the curve ($2 t_{\rm E}$) becomes independent on the MBH mass $M_{\rm MBH}$, and provides a direct measure of the distance $d_{\rm LS}$ to the MBH. However, $M_{\rm MBH}$ remains unknown. We show that, in GW signals, the redshifted mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ can additionally be obtained from the interference pattern, by measuring the modulation period $T$, the GW frequency $f$, and $t_{\rm E}$: $M_{{\rm MBH},z}\simeq 2.5\times 10^6\,M_\odot\,(t_{\rm E}/[100\,{\rm s}])\,(f\,T)^{-1}$. If this lensing signature is not considered, it may be confused with other waveform distortions, especially in the modeling of overlapping signals in next generation ground-based GW detectors. The observation of one of these curves and its associated parameters may help (1) constrain the orbital distance $d_{\rm LS}$ of sources, especially around low mass MBHs at the centers of star clusters and galaxies, (2) additionally estimate the mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ of these MBHs, and (3) infer the orbital inclination of the binary. Simultaneously obtaining $d_{\rm LS}$ and $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ through self-lensing can help constrain the astrophysical environments where GW signals come from.</description>

      <title>The impact of lunar topography on the 21-cm power spectrum for grid-based arrays : Insights for the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Ages (DA) provides a crucial window into the physics of the infant Universe, with the 21-cm signal offering the only direct probe for mapping out the three-dimensional distribution of matter at this epoch. To measure this cosmological signal, the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX) has been proposed as a compact, grid-based radio array on the lunar farside. The minimal design consists of a 32 $\times$ 32 array of 3-m dipole antennas, operating in the $7 - 50$ MHz band. A practical challenge on the lunar surface is that the antennas may get displaced from their intended positions due to deployment imprecisions and non-coplanarity arising from local surface undulations. We present, for the first time, an end-to-end simulation pipeline, called SPADE-21cm, that integrates a sky model with a DA 21-cm signal model simulated in the lunar frame and incorporating lunar topography data. We study the effects of both lateral (xy) and vertical (z) offsets on the two-dimensional power spectra across the $7 - 12$ MHz and $30 - 35$ MHz spectral windows, with tolerance thresholds derived only for the latter. Our results show that positional offsets bias the power spectrum by $10 - 30$ per cent relative to the expected 21-cm power spectrum during DA. Lateral offsets within $\sigma_{xy}/\lambda \lesssim 0.027$ (at 32.5 MHz) keep the fraction of Fourier modes with strong contamination (&gt; 50 per cent of the signal) to less than 1 per cent, whereas vertical height offsets affect a larger fraction. This conclusion holds for the 21-cm window with $k_\parallel &gt; 0.5$ $h$ cMpc$^{-1}$ over the range of $k_\perp = 0.003 - 0.009$ $h$ cMpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Smooth sailing or ragged climb? -- Increasing the robustness of power spectrum de-wiggling and ShapeFit parameter compression</title>

Abstract: The baryonic features in the galaxy power spectrum offer tight, time-resolved constraints on the expansion history of the Universe but complicate the measurement of the broadband shape of the power spectrum, which also contains precious cosmological information. In the context of ShapeFit, the broadband information is compressed into a single parameter, the slope of the power spectrum at the pivot scale, $m$, is sensitive to matter-radiation equality and the baryonic suppression. To calculate this parameter, two steps are necessary: 1) smoothing the power spectrum to remove the baryonic oscillations and 2) calculating the derivative of the power spectrum ratio at the pivot scale. In this work we compare thirteen methods designed to separate the broadband and oscillating components and examine their performance. The systematic uncertainty between different de-wiggling procedures is at most $2$%, depending on the scale. For the obtained slope, we show that the de-wiggling procedures impart large 50% differences, but as long as the theory and data pipelines are consistent, this is of no concern for cosmological inference given the precision of existing and ongoing surveys. However, it still motivates the search for more robust ways of extracting the slope. We show that post-processing the power spectrum ratio before taking the derivative makes the slope values far more robust. We further investigate eleven ways of extracting the slope and highlight the two most successful ones. We derive a systematic uncertainty on the slope $m$ of $\sigma_{m,\mathrm{syst}} = 0.023 |m| + 0.001$ by studying the behavior of the slopes in different cosmologies and the impact in cosmological inference. In cosmologies with a feature in the matter-power spectrum, such as in the early dark energy cosmologies, this systematic uncertainty estimate does not necessarily hold, and further investigation is required.</description>

      <title>Isotropy Test with Quasars Using Method of Smoothed Residuals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To assess the significance and scale dependence of anomalous large scale modes in the CatWISE quasar data, we generate smoothed number density fields on the sphere and study their extreme values -- maximum, minimum, maximum antipodal difference. By comparing these summary statistics to those obtained from random isotropic realisations of the data, we determine the statistical significance of large scale modes as a function of smoothing scale. We perform our analysis using five different versions of the data -- the original quasar map, the maps after separately subtracting the ecliptic bias and the CMB dipole, the map obtained after subtracting both, and the map after subtracting the ecliptic bias and anomalous dipole inferred in \cite{Secrest2021}. We find that the ecliptic-corrected, CMB dipole-removed map exhibits large scale modes that are in tension with random realisations of the data (p-values $p \lesssim 10^{-4}$), over a wide range of smoothing scales $\pi/8 \leq \delta \leq \pi/2$. The most prominent feature in the data is an under-density in the southern galactic plane at $(b,\ell) = (-31^\circ,78^\circ)$, which reaches its highest statistical significance when smoothed on scales $\delta = \pi/6$ ($p = 1.2 \times 10^{-6}$). Notably, the minima statistics align with the maximum antipodal difference statistics, whereas the maxima do not. This suggests that the observed dipole-like behavior in the data is primarily driven by the under-density in the southern sky. The ecliptic corrected, anomalous dipole subtracted map reduces the significance of any residual anisotropic features, but an under-density in the south sky persists with p-value $p =0.0018$.</description>

      <title>Shapes and orientations of massive halos in the statistically anisotropic universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how statistical anisotropy (SA) in matter distributions affects the distributions of shapes and orientations of cluster-sized halos, using cosmological $N$-body simulations that incorporate SA. While the three-dimensional halo shape parameters show little dependence on SA, we find that halo orientations are significantly influenced, with halos tending to align either perpendicular or parallel to the SA direction. This SA-induced alignment becomes more prominent for more massive halos. We also study other vector quantities associated with the dynamics of halos, such as bulk velocity and angular momentum vectors. We find that their dependences on the SA are smaller than those of the orientation vectors. Our findings suggest that observational measurements of projected halo shapes derived from galaxy cluster-galaxy lensing could provide a novel probe of SA in the universe.</description>

      <title>Core Collapse Beyond the Fluid Approximation: The Late Evolution of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the gravothermal collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos can deviate from local thermodynamic equilibrium. As a consequence, the self-similar evolution predicted by the commonly adopted conducting fluid model can be altered or broken. Our results are obtained using a novel, efficient kinetic solver called KiSS-SIDM for tracing the gravothermal evolution based on the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) framework. In the long mean free path stage, the code is a viable alternative to the fluid model, yet requires no calibration parameters. Further, this method enables a fully kinetic treatment well into the late, short mean free path, stage of the collapse. We apply the method to a canonical case with isotropic, velocity independent scattering. We find that although a fluid treatment is appropriate deep in the short mean free path core, departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium develop in the intermediate mean free path region bounding the core, which modify the late-time evolution. KiSS-SIDM is publicly available at https://gitlab.com/Socob/KiSS-SIDM.</description>

      <title>Enhanced radio emission between a galaxy cluster pair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting pairs of galaxy clusters offer a unique opportunity to study the properties of the gas residing in the intracluster bridge connecting them. As a consequence of the encounter, both the X-ray and radio emission from the gas are expected to be enhanced by shocks and turbulence, facilitating their detection. PSZ2 G279.79+39.09 is likely an off-axis merging system at $z = 0.29$ with its two main cluster components observed at a projected distance of $\sim$1.3 Mpc. In this paper, we investigate the presence of diffuse radio emission associated with the system. We observed this cluster pair with the MeerKAT UHF band (544-1088 MHz) for 7.5 h and with the uGMRT band 3 (300-500 MHz) for 8 h. These are the first targeted radio observations of this system. We discover diffuse synchrotron emission in the system, with indication of enhanced emission in the region bridging the cluster pair. The detection is based on the MeerKAT UHF data, while the uGMRT band 3 observation does not allow us to derive a stringent limit on the spectral index of the source. This emission is likely generated by the turbulence injected as a consequence of the cluster-cluster encounter. However, the study of its physical properties is limited by the observations currently available on the target. If the two clusters have not yet collided, this emission would resemble the radio bridges observed in A399-A401 and A1758N-S. As other systems with multiple cluster components studied in recent years, the analyzed cluster pair represents an appealing target to investigate the presence of nonthermal phenomena beyond the well-studied denser regions of the intracluster medium. While in this work we presented a new detection, our analysis underlines the need for multi-band observations to fully understand these kinds of sources.</description>

      <title>Probing potential redshift-dependent systematics in the Hubble tension: Model-independent $H_0$ constraints from DESI R2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) using the latest observational data from multiple cosmological probes, providing an independent geometric calibration of the SN Ia distance scale. By combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the second data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2), cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and the Pantheon Plus Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, we reconstruct the cosmic expansion history through Gaussian process regression without assuming a specific cosmological model. Our analysis fully incorporates the complete covariance structure and yields $H_0$ constraints at five distinct redshifts: $65.72 \pm 1.99$ (z=0.51), $67.78 \pm 1.75$ (z=0.706), $70.74 \pm 1.39$ (z=0.934), $71.04 \pm 1.93$ (z=1.321), and $68.37 \pm 3.95~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (z=1.484). The Bayesian combination of these measurements gives $\hat{H}_0 = 69.29 \pm 0.81~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ with 1.2\% precision, which occupies an intermediate position between the Planck CMB result and the SH0ES local measurement. While we observe a non-monotonic pattern in $H_0$ values across redshifts, statistical tests show this apparent evolution is not significant (p = 0.208). Our approach delivers independent constraints at multiple redshifts, enabling investigation of potential redshift-dependent systematic effects in the Hubble tension. The results demonstrate that an independent geometric method yields an $H_0$ value consistent with the intermediate range of current measurements, providing a crucial cross-check of distance ladder determinations.</description>

      <title>A model-independent assessment of the late-time dark energy density evolution</title>

Abstract: Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $\Lambda$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $\Lambda$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the DESI BAO data has reported a preference of dynamical dark energy (DDE) over the \LambdaCDM cosmology. Apart from the BAO data, the DDE model should be also sensitive to low-redshift measurements of the matter power spectrum data. In this study, we address this point by combining the DESI Y1 data about the matter power spectrum, extracted from the DESI Full-Shape data, with the DESI DR2 BAO data among other probes. After building the DESI Y1 likelihood, we carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, showing that the constraints on $w_0$ and $w_a$ with DESI Y1 data included are improved over those without it for three different datasets widely considered, especially in the case of the DESY5 sample.</description>

      <title>DESI Strong Lens Foundry V: A Sample of HST-Observed Strong Lenses Modeled with GIGA-Lens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present six galaxy-scale strong lenses with HST imaging modeled using GIGA-Lens. This is Paper V of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry series. These systems were discovered in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using ML/AI methods and confirmed with DESI, Keck/NIRES, and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. They span $z_d = 0.39 - 1.1$ and $z_s = 1.4 - 3.3$. This is the first HST strong lens sample modeled with full forward modeling -- all lens and source parameters sampled simultaneously in a single inference -- with explicit convergence validation using both $\widehat{R}$ and effective sample size (ESS) for each system. All inferred parameters satisfy $\widehat{R} &lt; 1.1$ and ${\rm ESS} \gtrsim 10,000$, demonstrating that GIGA-Lens achieves statistically robust inference even for some of the most complex galaxy-scale lenses known. These results pave the way for scaling to much larger, high-resolution strong lens samples from HST, Euclid, JWST, and Roman. Convergence-validated modeling will be critical for key science goals, including constraining the mass-density profile of galaxies, detecting low-mass dark matter (sub)halos, and delivering precise and accurate cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>Bayesian luminosity function estimation in multi-depth datasets with selection effects: A case study for $3&lt;z&lt;5$ Lyman $\alpha$ emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10083</link>

Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework designed to infer the luminosity function of any class of object by jointly modelling data from multiple surveys with varying depth, completeness, and sky coverage. Our method explicitly accounts for selection effects and measurement uncertainties (e.g. in luminosity) and can be generalized to any extensive quantity, such as mass. We validated the model using mock catalogues; from this we determined that deep data reaching $\gtrsim 1.5$ dex below a characteristic luminosity ($\tilde{L}^\star$) are essential to reducing biases at the faint end ($\lesssim 0.1$ dex) and that wide-area data help constrain the bright end. As a proof of concept, we considered a combined sample of 1176 Lyman $\alpha$ emitters at redshift $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$ drawn from several MUSE surveys, ranging from ultra-deep ($\gtrsim 90$ hr) and narrow ($\lesssim 1$ arcmin$^2$) fields to shallow ($\lesssim 5$ hr) and wide ($\gtrsim 20$ arcmin$^2$) fields. With this complete sample, we constrain the luminosity function parameters $\log(\Phi^\star/\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}) = -2.86^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$, $\log(L^\star/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) = 42.72^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, and $\alpha = -1.81^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$, where the uncertainties represent the $90\%$ credible intervals. These values are in agreement with the results of studies based on gravitational lensing that reach $\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \approx 41$, although differences in the faint-end slope underscore how systematic errors are starting to dominate. In contrast, wide-area surveys represent the natural extension needed to constrain the brightest Lyman $\alpha$ emitters [$\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \gtrsim 43$], where statistical uncertainties still dominate.</description>

      <title>Power-Law Bounces in $f(R)$ Gravity: Analysis of the Ekpyrosis and Accelerating Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity using a compact, model-independent dynamical systems approach. By assuming a power-law scale factor, we explore ekpyrotic and accelerating solutions to address the big bang singularity. Our analysis demonstrates that a cosmological bounce, characterized by a transition from contraction to expansion, possibly avoids the singularity without directly using the Raychaudhuri equation, unlike previous approaches using specific $f(R) \simeq R^n$ forms. We identify a key fixed point in the phase space corresponding to the bounce, supported by perturbation analysis and qualitative description of trajectories in the phase space. The results suggest that $f(R)$ gravity provides a robust framework for non-singular cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Robust Extraction of Global 21 cm Spectrum from Experiments with a Chromatic Beam Based on Physics-Motivated Error Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extraction of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization faces significant challenges. The bright and anisotropic Galactic foreground, which is 4 - 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm signal, when convolved with the inevitably chromatic beam, introduces additional spectral structures that can easily mimic the real 21 cm signal. In this paper, we investigate the signal extraction for a lunar-orbit experiment, where the antenna moves fast in orbit and data from multiple orbits have to be used. We propose a physics-motivated and correlated modeling of both the foreground and the measurement errors. By dividing the sky into multiple regions according to the spectral index distribution and accounting for the full covariance of modeling errors, we jointly fit both the foreground and the 21 cm signal using simulated data for the Discovering the Sky at the Longest wavelength lunar orbit experiment. This method successfully extracts the 21 cm signals of various amplitudes from the simulated data even for a testing antenna with a relatively high level of chromaticity. This approach, which is robust against moderate beam chromaticity, significantly relaxes the stringent design and manufacturing requirements for the antenna, offering a practical solution for future 21 cm global signal experiments either on the ground or in space.</description>

      <title>SMILES Data Release II: Probing Galaxy Evolution during Cosmic Noon and Beyond with NIRSpec Medium-Resolution Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning $0 &lt; z &lt; 7.5$, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon ($z \sim 1$-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with \texttt{GELATO} for emission-line galaxies and \texttt{pPXF} fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Semianalytic calculation of the gravitational wave spectrum induced by curvature perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background is secondarily and inevitably induced by the primordial curvature perturbations beyond the first order of the cosmological perturbation theory. We analytically calculate the integration kernel of the power spectrum of the induced GWs, which is the universal part independent of the spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations, in the radiation-dominated era and in the matter-dominated era. We derive fully analytic expressions of the GW spectrum when possible. As a minor update, we study the case of the top-hat function as the spectrum of the curvature perturbations. We also discuss generalization in the presence of multiple cosmological eras with different equations of state.</description>

      <title>Photo-$z$ Estimation with Normalizing Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate photometric redshift (photo-$z$) estimation is a key challenge in cosmology, as uncertainties in photo-$z$ directly limit the scientific return of large-scale structure and weak lensing studies, especially in upcoming Stage IV surveys. The problem is particularly severe for faint galaxies with sparse spectroscopic training data. In this work, we introduce nflow-$z$, a novel photo-$z$ estimation method using the powerful machine learning technique of normalizing flow. nflow-$z$ explicitly models the redshift probability distribution conditioned on the observables such as fluxes and colors. We build two nflow-$z$ implementations, dubbed cINN and cNSF, and compare their performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of nflow-$z$ on several datasets, including a CSST mock, the COSMOS2020 catalog, and samples from DES Y1, SDSS, and DESCaLS. Our evaluation against state-of-the-art algorithms shows that nflow-$z$ performs favorably. For instance, cNSF surpasses Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neutral Network on the CSST mock test. We also achieve a ~30% improvement over official results for the faint DESCaLS sample and outperform conditional Generative Adversarial Network and Mixture Density Network methods on the DES Y1 dataset test. Furthermore, nflow-$z$ is computationally efficient, requiring only a fraction of the computing time of some of the competing algorithms. Our algorithm is particularly effective for the faint sample with sparse training data, making it highly suitable for upcoming Stage IV surveys.</description>

      <title>Holographic Constraints on the String Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that holography imposes strong and general constraints on scalar field potentials in the string landscape, determined by the asymptotic structure of the underlying spacetime. Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations on an averaged background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In relativistic cosmology, the formation of nonlinear inhomogeneities can induce non-negligible backreaction on late-time expansion. Among the important consequences for precision cosmology is the potential impact on the linear growth of large-scale structures. We address this impact by combining covariant spatial averaging with covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation theory. We focus on irrotational dust model spacetimes. The effects of backreaction and nontrivial dynamical curvature on the average cosmological dynamics are formulated as the addition of an effective perfect fluid with pressure. We then introduce an effective background driven by both the averaged dust density and the emergent effective fluid, and derive the general evolution equations for linear perturbations of this system. The residual freedom in this framework amounts to specifying the properties of the effective-fluid perturbations as a closure condition. We analyse two physically motivated choices for this condition. In addition, we clarify the conditions under which the coupling between linear structure growth and perturbations of the effective fluid can be neglected. Finally, we apply this formalism to four examples of averaged cosmological models from the literature, three of which -- intended as effective full descriptions of the largest scales -- have been shown to provide a good fit to observational data. Our results highlight the importance of backreaction effects in shaping linear structure growth in such models. Neglecting these effects may thus lead to biased predictions for the development of large structures, even when the models provide a good description of the general background observables.</description>
