      <title>Taming polymorphism of tubule self-assembly using templated growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-closing assembly is prone to polymorphism due to thermally-excited bending fluctuations, which permit the formation of off-target assemblies at the point of self-closure. One way to overcome this source of polymorphism is to use templated growth, a process in which assembly initiates from a precisely-defined seed rather than by spontaneous nucleation. We explore this approach to quelling polymorphism in the self-closing assembly of cylindrical tubules assembled from DNA-origami subunits with user-specified inter-subunit binding angles and specific interactions. We develop two strategies to create seeds with precisely-defined diameters and helicity: 1) using multicomponent assembly; and 2) purifying a specific seed-type from a polymorphic mixture using gel electrophoresis and gel extraction. By tuning the seed and monomer concentrations, and adjusting the assembly temperature, we determine the conditions under which tubules grow from the seed while avoiding spontaneous nucleation. We observe that templated tubules tend to follow the guidance of the seed, thereby increasing the selectivity of the target geometry. Also, we find that by tuning the diameter of the seed, one can template the growth of monodisperse tubules over a range of target diameters, even while using a single monomer type with a single preferred local curvature. Our results demonstrate that employing precisely defined seeds to guide assembly can significantly decrease polymorphism in self-closing assembly in a controllable and economical way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When liquids are cooled, their dynamics are slowed, and if crystallization is avoided, they will solidify into an amorphous structure referred to as a glass. Experiments show that chemically distinct glass-forming liquids have universal features of the spectrum and temperature dependence of the main structural relaxation. We introduce Randium, a generic energetically coarse-grained model of viscous liquids, and demonstrate that the intrinsic dynamics of viscous liquids emerges. These results suggest that Randium belongs to a universal class of systems whose dynamics capture the essential physics of viscous liquid relaxation, bridging microscopic molecular models and coarse-grained theoretical descriptions.</description>

      <title>Surface wakes on ultra-soft solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamical response of the free surface of an ultra-soft solid driven by a localized moving pressure disturbance. Experiments reveal a steady V-shaped wake analogous to a surface Mach wedge. A simple geometric argument provides a qualitative explanation consistent with observations. A theoretical framework combining elastodynamic, capillary, and gravitational effects yields a generalized dispersion relation that smoothly interpolates between Kelvin's theory of liquid interface wakes and Rayleigh's theory of elastic surface waves. Together, our experiments and theory reveal the existence of a soft wake regime that bridges fluid and solid surface wave physics, offering new routes for probing the dynamics of soft surfaces.</description>

      <title>Exchange controls coarsening of surface condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological membranes often exhibit heterogeneous protein patterns, which cells control. Strong patterns, like the polarity spot in budding yeast, can be described as surface condensates, formed by physical interactions between constituents. However, it is unclear how these interactions affect the material exchange with the bulk. To study this, we analyze a thermodynamically consistent model, which reveals that passive exchange generally accelerates the coarsening of surface condensates. Active exchange can further accelerate coarsening, although it can also fully arrest it and induce complex patterns involving various length scales. We reveal how these behaviors are related to non-local transport via diffusion through the bulk, rationalizing the various scaling laws we observe and allowing us to interpret biologically relevant scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for energy balance, local temperature variations, and the ensuing stochastic effects. By modelling active matter as a driven open system, we show that the source of active contributions to hydrodynamics, violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorems, and detailed balance is rooted in the breaking of time-translation symmetry due to the presence of fuel consumption and an external environmental bath. In addition, our framework allows for non-equilibrium steady states that produce entropy, with a well-defined notion of steady-state temperature. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions. We also show how to incorporate temperature, energy and noise in fluctuating hydrodynamics for active matter. Our work suggests a broader perspective on active matter that can leave an imprint across scales.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacterial colonies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid flow has a major effect on the aggregation and fragmentation of bacterial colonies. Yet, a generic framework to understand and predict how hydrodynamics affects colony size remains elusive. This study investigates how fluid flow affects the formation and maintenance of large colonial structures in cyanobacteria, using an experimental technique that precisely controls hydrodynamic conditions. We performed experiments on laboratory cultures and lake samples of the cyanobacterium Microcystis, while their colony size distribution was measured simultaneously by direct microscopic imaging. We demonstrate that EPS-embedded cells formed by cell division exhibit significant mechanical resistance to shear forces. However, at elevated hydrodynamic stress levels (exceeding those typically generated by surface wind mixing) these colonies experience fragmentation through an erosion process. We also show that single cells can aggregate into small colonies due to fluid flow. However, the structural integrity of these flow-induced colonies is weaker than that of colonies formed by cell division. We provide a mathematical analysis to support the experiments and demonstrate that a population model with two categories of colonies describes the measured size distributions. Our results shed light on the specific conditions wherein flow-induced fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacteria are decisive and indicate that colony formation under natural conditions is mainly driven by cell division, although flow-induced aggregation could play a role in dense bloom events. These findings can be used to improve prediction models and mitigation strategies for toxic cyanobacterial blooms and also offer potential applications in other areas such as algal biotechnology or medical settings where the dynamics of biological aggregates play a significant role.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dynamics of Superparamagnetic Colloidal Microrobots with Tailored Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living organisms have developed advanced motion strategies for efficient space exploration, serving as inspiration for the movements of microrobots. These real-life strategies often involve anomalous dynamics displaying random movement patterns that deviate from Brownian motion. Despite their biological inspiration, autonomous stochastic navigation strategies of current microrobots remain much less versatile than those of their living counterparts. Supported by theoretical reasoning, this work demonstrates superparamagnetic colloidal microrobots with fully customizable stochastic dynamics displaying the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, across statistically significant spatial and temporal scales (covering at least two decades). By simultaneously tuning microrobots' step-length distribution and, critically, their velocity autocorrelation function with magnetic fields, fundamental anomalous dynamics are reproduced with tailored properties mimicking L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion. These findings pave the way for programmable microrobotic systems that replicate optimal stochastic navigation strategies found in nature for applications in medical robotics and environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous grain dynamics and grain locomotion of odd crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline or polycrystalline systems governed by odd elastic responses are known to exhibit complex dynamical behaviors involving self-propelled dynamics of topological defects with spontaneous self-rotation of chiral crystallites. Unveiling and controlling the underlying mechanisms require studies across multiple scales. We develop such a type of approach that bridges between microscopic and mesoscopic scales, in the form of a phase field crystal model incorporating transverse interactions. This continuum density field theory features two-dimensional parity symmetry breaking and odd elasticity, and generates a variety of interesting phenomena that agree well with recent experiments and particle-based simulations of active and living chiral crystals, including self-rotating crystallites, dislocation self-propulsion and proliferation, and fragmentation in polycrystals. We identify a distinct type of surface cusp instability induced by self-generated surface odd stress that results in self-fission of single-crystalline grains. This mechanism is pivotal for the occurrence of various anomalous grain dynamics for odd crystals, particularly the predictions of a transition from normal to reverse Ostwald ripening for self-rotating odd grains, and a transition from grain coarsening to grain self-fragmentation in the dynamical polycrystalline state with an increase of transverse interaction strength. We also demonstrate that the single-grain dynamics can be maneuvered through the variation of interparticle transverse interactions. This allows to steer the desired pathway of grain locomotion and to control the transition between grain self-rotation, self-rolling, and self-translation. Our results provide insights for the design and control of structural and dynamical properties of active odd elastic materials.</description>

      <title>Bridging a gap: A heavy elastica between point supports</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the deformation and slip-through of a heavy elastic beam suspended above two point supports and subject to an increasing body force -- an idealized model of a fibre trapped in the pores of a filter as flow strength increases, for example. Using both asymptotic and numerical techniques, we investigate the behaviour of the beam under increasing body force and the maximum force that can be supported before it must slip between the supports. We quantify this maximum body force as a function of the separation between the two supports. Surprisingly, we show the existence of a critical separation below which the beam can withstand an arbitrarily large body force, even in the absence of friction. This is understood as the limit of a catenary between the supports that is connected to (and supported by the tension in) a vertically hanging portion outside the supports. We explore how frictional forces impact the deformation and load-bearing capacity of the beam and show that our results are consistent with laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Shape-Determined Kinetic Pathways in 2D Solid-Solid Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-solid phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, but the kinetic pathway of anisotropic particle systems remains elusive, where the coupling between translational and rotational motions plays a critical role in various kinetic processes. Here we investigate this problem by molecular dynamics simulation for two-dimensional ball-stick polygon systems, where pentagon, hexagon, and octagon systems all undergo an isostructural solid-solid phase transition. During heating, the translational motion exhibits merely a homogeneous expansion, whereas the time evolution of body-orientation is shape-determined. The local defects of body-orientation self-organize into a vague stripe for pentagon, a random pattern for hexagon, while a distinct stripe for octagon. The underlying kinetic pathway of octagon adheres to the quasi-equilibrium assumption, whereas the pathways of hexagon and pentagon are governed by translational and rotational motion, respectively. This diversity is originated from different kinetic coupling modes determined by the anisotropy of molecules, and can affect the phase transition rates. The reverse process in terms of cooling follows the same mechanism, with more diverse kinetic pathways attributed to the possible kinetic traps. Our findings promote the theoretical understanding of microscopic kinetics of solid-solid phase transitions as well as provide direct guidance for the rational design of materials utilizing desired kinetic features.</description>

      <title>Investigating the roles of hydrophobicity and electrostatics in the particle-scale dynamics and rheology of dense microgel suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colloidal microgel particles such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) shrink reversibly in an aqueous medium due to the expulsion of water at a volume phase transition temperature, VPTT $\sim$33$^\circ$C. Romeo et al. [Adv. Mater. 2010, 22, 3441-3445] had previously shown that dense aqueous PNIPAM suspensions transformed from one viscoelastic solid-like phase to another when suspension temperature was increased, with an intermediate viscoelastic liquid-like phase near the VPTT. They attributed this observation to a change in the inter-particle interaction from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Here, we show using a combination of experimental techniques that particle hydrophobicity can become significant even below the VPTT. We achieve this by incorporating dissociating additives such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride, or non-dissociating additives such as sucrose, into the aqueous medium. Above the VPTT, we observe that suspension rigidity is the highest in the presence of salts because of the combined effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic attractions. In the presence of non-dissociating sucrose, in contrast, the inter-microgel interaction remains hydrophobic across the VPTT. Such easy tunability of interactions by incorporating commonly available chemicals into the suspension medium opens up new avenues for the synthesis of novel metamaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from inflammation to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. Cell interactions are encoded in a dual signaling graph capable of handling signaling cascades. The dual graph architecture of our neural networks reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed for training, compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>Intracellular phagosome shell is rigid enough to transfer outside torque to the inner spherical particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intracellular phagosomes have a lipid bilayer encapsulated fluidic shell outside the particle, on the outer side of which, molecular motors are attached. An optically trapped spherical birefringent particle phagosome provides an ideal platform to probe fluidity of the shell, as the inner particle is optically confined both in translation and in rotation. Using a recently reported method to calibrate the translation and pitch rotations - yielding a spatial resolution of about 2 nm and angular resolution of 0.1 degrees - we report novel roto-translational coupled dynamics. We also suggest a new technique where we explore the correlation between the translation and pitch rotation to study extent of activity. Given that a spherical birefringent particle phagosome is almost a sphere, the fact that it turns due to the activity of the motors is not obvious, even implying high rigidity of shell. Applying a minimal model for the roto-translational coupling, we further show that this coupling manifests itself as sustained fluxes in phase space, a signature of broken detailed balance.</description>
