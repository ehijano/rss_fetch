      <title>Braided Gelfand-Zetlin algebras and their semiclassical counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct analogs of the Gelfand-Zetlin algebras in the Reflection Equation algebras, corresponding to Hecke symmetries, mainly to those coming from the quantum groups U_q(sl(N)). Corresponding semiclassical (i.e. Poisson) counterparts of the Gelfand-Zetlin algebras are described.</description>

      <title>A Lie-algebraic perspective on Tree-Adjoining Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a novel mathematical implementation of tree-adjoining grammars using two combinatorial definitions of graphs. With this lens, we demonstrate that the adjoining operation defines a pre-Lie operation and subsequently forms a Lie algebra. We demonstrate the utility of this perspective by showing how one of our mathematical formulations of TAG captures properties of the TAG system without needing to posit them as additional components of the system, such as null-adjoining constraints and feature TAG.</description>

      <title>Factorization of Basic Hypergeometric Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general problem of the factorization of a basic hypergeometric series is presented and discussed. The case of the general $_2\psi_2$ series is examined in detail. Connections are found with the theory of basic hypergeometric series on root systems. Alternative proofs of several well-known summation and transformation formulae, including Gustafson's generalization of Ramanujan's $_1\psi_1$ summation, are obtained incidentally.</description>

      <title>Quantum cluster algebras and representations of shifted quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new quantization $K_t(\mathcal{O}^{sh}_{\mathbb{Z}})$ of the Grothendieck ring of the category $\mathcal{O}^{sh}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ of representations of shifted quantum affine algebras (of simply-laced type). We establish that our quantization is compatible with the quantum Grothendieck ring $K_t(\mathcal{O}^{\mathfrak{b},+}_{\mathbb{Z}})$ for the quantum Borel affine algebra, namely that there is a natural embedding $K_t(\mathcal{O}^{\mathfrak{b},+}_{\mathbb{Z}})\hookrightarrow K_t(\mathcal{O}^{sh}_{\mathbb{Z}})$. Our construction is partially based on the cluster algebra structure on the classical Grothendieck ring discovered by Geiss-Hernandez-Leclerc. As first applications, we formulate a quantum analogue of $QQ$-systems (that we make completely explicit in type $A_1$). We also prove that the quantum oscillator algebra is isomorphic to a localization of a subalgebra of our quantum Grothendieck ring and that it is also isomorphic to the Berenstein-Zelevinsky's quantum double Bruhat cell $\mathbb{C}_t[SL_2^{w_0,w_0}]$.</description>

      <title>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the invariant operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries of a tensor product spin chain if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an on-site action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem. Using this, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exists gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain. Finally, we apply our framework to show that any state covariant under an anomalous Kramers-Wannier type duality must be gapless.</description>

      <title>An Algebra of Elliptic Commuting Variables and an Elliptic Extension of the Multinomial Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an algebra of elliptic commuting variables involving a base $q$, nome $p$, and $2r$ noncommuting variables. This algebra, which for $r=1$ reduces to an algebra considered earlier by the author, is an elliptic extension of the well-known algebra of $r$ $q$-commuting variables. We present a multinomial theorem valid as an identity in this algebra, hereby extending the author's previously obtained elliptic binomial theorem to higher rank. Two essential ingredients are a consistency relation satisfied by the elliptic weights and the Weierstrass type $\mathsf A$ elliptic partial fraction decomposition. From the elliptic multinomial theorem we obtain, by convolution, an identity equivalent to Rosengren's type $\mathsf A$ extension of the Frenkel-Turaev ${}_{10}V_9$ summation. Interpreted in terms of a weighted counting of lattice paths in the integer lattice $\mathbb Z^r$, this derivation of Rosengren's $\mathsf A_r$ Frenkel-Turaev summation constitutes the first combinatorial proof of that fundamental identity.</description>

      <title>Twisted intertwining operators and tensor products of (generalized) twisted modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the general twisted intertwining operators (intertwining operators among twisted modules) for a vertex operator algebra $V$. We give the skew-symmetry and contragredient isomorphisms between spaces of twisted intertwining operators and also prove some other properties of twisted intertwining operators. Using twisted intertwining operators, we introduce a notion of $P(z)$-tensor product of two objects for $z\in \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ in a category of suitable $g$-twisted $V$-modules for $g$ in a group of automorphisms of $V$ and give a construction of such a $P(z)$-tensor product under suitable assumptions. We also construct $G$-crossed commutativity isomorphisms and $G$-crossed braiding isomorphisms. We formulate a $P(z)$-compatibility condition and a $P(z)$-grading-restriction condition and use these conditions to give another construction of the $P(z)$-tensor product.</description>

      <title>What is a double star-product?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double Poisson brackets, introduced by M. Van den Bergh in 2004, are noncommutative analogs of the usual Poisson brackets in the sense of the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle: they induce Poisson structures on the space of $N$-dimensional representations $\operatorname{Rep}_N(A)$ of an associative algebra $A$ for any $N$. The problem of deformation quantization of double Poisson brackets was raised by D. Calaque in 2010, and had remained open since then.
  In this paper, we address this problem by answering the question in the title. We present a structure on $A$ that induces a star-product under the representation functor and, therefore, according to the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle, can be viewed as an analog of star-products in noncommutative geometry. We also provide an explicit example for $A=\Bbbk\langle x_1,\ldots,x_d\rangle$ and prove a double formality theorem in this case. Along the way, we invert the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle by introducing a notion of double algebra over an arbitrary operad.</description>

      <title>A Derived Decomposition for Equivariant $D$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:1705.04297v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the adjoint equivariant derived category of $D$-modules on a reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ carries an orthogonal decomposition in to blocks indexed by cuspidal data (in the sense of Lusztig). Each block admits a monadic description in terms a certain monad related to the homology of Steinberg varieties; this monad carries a filtration (the Mackey filtration) whose associated graded functor is given by the action of the relative Weyl group. Furthermore, we show that the Mackey filtration is generally non-split and thus the Springer-theoretic description of the entire equivariant derived category of $D$-modules appears to be substantially more subtle than either the case of the abelian category in earlier work of the author, or the derived category of nilpotent orbital sheaves in work of Rider and Russell. One notable feature of this setting is that the parabolic induction and restriction functors depend on the choice of parabolic subgroup containing a given Levi factor.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolization of Affine Lie Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1983, Feingold and Frenkel discovered a relation between Siegel modular forms of genus two and a rank-three hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebra extending the affine Lie algebra of type $A_1$. It inspires a problem to explore more general relations between affine Lie algebras, hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebras and modular forms. In this paper, we give an automorphic answer to this problem. We classify hyperbolic Borcherds--Kac--Moody superalgebras whose super-denominators define reflective automorphic products of singular weight on lattices of type $2U\oplus L$. As a consequence, we prove that there are exactly $81$ affine Lie algebras $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$ which have extensions to hyperbolic BKM superalgebras for which the leading Fourier--Jacobi coefficients of super-denominators coincide with the denominators of $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. We find that $69$ of them appear in Schellekens' list of semi-simple $V_1$ structures of holomorphic CFT of central charge $24$, while $8$ of them correspond to the $N=1$ structures of holomorphic SCFT of central charge $12$ composed of $24$ chiral fermions. The last $4$ cases are related to exceptional modular invariants from nontrivial automorphisms of fusion algebras. This clarifies the relationship of affine Lie algebras, vertex algebras and hyperbolic BKM superalgebras at the level of modular forms.</description>

      <title>Web bases in degree two from hourglass plabic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Webs give a diagrammatic calculus for spaces of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$-tensor invariants, but intrinsic characterizations of web bases are only known in certain cases. Recently, we introduced hourglass plabic graphs to give the first such $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$-web bases. Separately, Fraser introduced a web basis for Pl\"{u}cker degree two representations of arbitrary $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$. Here, we show that Fraser's basis agrees with that predicted by the hourglass plabic graph framework and give an intrinsic characterization of the resulting webs. A further compelling feature with many applications is that our bases exhibit rotation-invariance. Together with the results of our earlier paper, this implies that hourglass plabic graphs give a uniform description of all known rotation-invariant $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$-web bases. Moreover, this provides a single combinatorial model simultaneously generalizing the Tamari lattice, the alternating sign matrix lattice, and the lattice of plane partitions. As a part of our argument, we develop properties of square faces in arbitrary hourglass plabic graphs, a key step in our program towards general $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$-web bases.</description>

      <title>Lusztig sheaves and integrable highest weight modules in symmetrizable cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper continues the work of [10] and [6]. For any symmetrizable generalized Cartan Matrix $C$ and the corresponding quantum group $\mathbf{U}$, we consider the associated quiver $Q$ with an admissible automorphism $a$. We construct the category $\widetilde{\mathcal{Q}/\mathcal{N}}$ of the localization of Lusztig sheaves for the quiver with the automorphism of corresponding framed quiver and 2-framed quiver. Their Grothendieck groups give realizations of integrable highest weight module $L(\lambda)$ and the tensor product of integrable highest weights $\mathbf{U}-$module $L(\lambda_1)\otimes L(\lambda_2)$, and modulo the traceless ones Lusztig sheaves provide the (signed) canonical basis of $L(\lambda)$ and $L(\lambda_1)\otimes L(\lambda_2)$. As an application, the symmetrizable crystal structures on Nakajima's quiver/tensor product varieties and Lusztig's nilpotent varieties of preprojective algebras are deduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building further on work of Marin and Wagner, we give a braid-type skein theory of the Links-Gould polynomial invariant of oriented links, prove that it can be used to evaluate any oriented link and prove that it is also shared by the $V_1$-polynomial defined by two of the authors, deducing the equality of the two link polynomials. This implies specialization properties of the $V_1$-polynomial to the Alexander polynomial and to the $\mathrm{ADO}_3$-invariant, the fact that it is a Vassiliev power series invariant, as well as a Seifert genus bound for knots.</description>
