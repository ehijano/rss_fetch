      <title>The infimal convolution structure of the Hellinger-Kantorovich distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Hellinger-Kantorovich distance can be expressed as the metric infimal convolution of the Hellinger and the Wasserstein distances, as conjectured by Liero, Mielke, and Savar\'e. To prove it, we study with the tools of Unbalanced Optimal Transport the so called Marginal Entropy-Transport problem that arises as a single minimization step in the definition of infimal convolution. Careful estimates and results when the number of minimization steps diverges are also provided, both in the specific case of the Hellinger-Kantorovich setting and in the general one of abstract distances.</description>

      <title>Construction of self-similar energy forms and singularity of Sobolev spaces on Laakso-type fractal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct self-similar $p$-energy forms as normalized limits of discretized $p$-energies on a rich class of Laakso-type fractal spaces. Collectively, we refer to them as IGS-fractals, where IGS stands for (edge-)iterated graph systems. We propose this framework as a rich source of "toy models" that can be consulted for tackling challenging questions that are not well understood on most other fractal spaces. Supporting this, our framework uncovers a novel analytic phenomenon, which we term as singularity of Sobolev spaces. This means that the associated Sobolev spaces $\mathscr{F}_{p_1}$ and $\mathscr{F}_{p_2}$ for distinct $p_1,p_2 \in (1,\infty)$ intersect only at constant functions. We provide the first example of a self-similar fractal on which this singularity phenomenon occurs for all pairs of distinct exponents. In particular, we show that the Laakso diamond space is one such example.</description>

      <title>Geometric Properties of Periodic Lattices in Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic lattices are natural generalizations of lattices, which arise naturally in diophantine approximations with rationals of bounded denominators. In this paper, we prove analogues of classical theorems in geometry of numbers for periodic lattices in function fields. Moreover, we use special matrices to compute the covering and packing radii of special periodic lattices.</description>

      <title>Linear-Size Neural Network Representation of Piecewise Affine Functions in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that any continuous piecewise affine (CPA) function $\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ with $p$ pieces can be represented by a ReLU neural network with two hidden layers and $O(p)$ neurons. Unlike prior work, which focused on convex pieces, this analysis considers CPA functions with connected but potentially non-convex pieces.</description>

      <title>Affine Fractional Sobolev and Isoperimetric Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharp affine fractional Sobolev inequalities for functions on $\mathbb R^n$ are established. For each $0&lt;s&lt;1$, the new inequalities are significantly stronger than (and directly imply) the sharp fractional Sobolev inequalities of Almgren and Lieb. In the limit as $s\to 1^-$, the new inequalities imply the sharp affine Sobolev inequality of Gaoyong Zhang. As a consequence, fractional Petty projection inequalities are obtained that are stronger than the fractional Euclidean isoperimetric inequalities and a natural conjecture for radial mean bodies is proved.</description>

      <title>The Kneser--Poulsen phenomena for entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kneser--Poulsen conjecture asserts that the volume of a union of balls in Euclidean space cannot be increased by bringing their centres pairwise closer. We prove that its natural information-theoretic counterpart is true. This follows from a complete answer to a question asked in arXiv:2210.12842 about Gaussian convolutions, namely that the R\'enyi entropy comparisons between a probability measure and its contractive image are preserved when both undergo simultaneous heat flow. An inequality that unifies Costa's result on the concavity of entropy power with the entropic Kneser--Poulsen theorem is also presented.</description>

      <title>Metric properties of partial and robust Gromov-Wasserstein distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances define a family of metrics, based on ideas from optimal transport, which enable comparisons between probability measures defined on distinct metric spaces. They are particularly useful in areas such as network analysis and geometry processing, as computation of a GW distance involves solving for registration between the objects which minimizes geometric distortion. Although GW distances have proven useful for various applications in the recent machine learning literature, it has been observed that they are inherently sensitive to outlier noise and cannot accommodate partial matching. This has been addressed by various constructions building on the GW framework; in this article, we focus specifically on a natural relaxation of the GW optimization problem, introduced by Chapel et al., which is aimed at addressing exactly these shortcomings. Our goal is to understand the theoretical properties of this relaxed optimization problem, from the viewpoint of metric geometry. While the relaxed problem fails to induce a metric, we derive precise characterizations of how it fails the axioms of non-degeneracy and triangle inequality. These observations lead us to define a novel family of distances, whose construction is inspired by the Prokhorov and Ky Fan distances, as well as by the recent work of Raghvendra et al.\ on robust versions of classical Wasserstein distance. We show that our new distances define true metrics, that they induce the same topology as the GW distances, and that they enjoy additional robustness to perturbations. These results provide a mathematically rigorous basis for using our robust partial GW distances in applications where outliers and partial matching are concerns.</description>

Abstract: We establish a family of inequalities that hold true on any $6$ points in any $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space. We prove that the validity of these inequalities does not follow from any properties of $5$-point subsets of $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ spaces. In particular, the validity of these inequalities does not follow from the $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ $4$-point condition.</description>

      <title>Quasigeodesics on the Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quasigeodesic is a curve on the surface of a convex polyhedron that has $\le \pi$ surface to each side at every point. In contrast, a geodesic has exactly $\pi$ to each side and so can never pass through a vertex, whereas quasigeodesics can. Although it is known that every convex polyhedron has at least three simple closed quasigeodesics, little else is known. Only tetrahedra have been thoroughly studied.
  In this paper we explore the quasigeodesics on a cube, which have not been previously enumerated. We prove that the cube has exactly $15$ simple closed quasigeodesics (beyond the three known simple closed geodesics). For the lower bound we detail $15$ simple closed quasigeodesics. Our main contribution is establishing a matching upper bound. For general convex polyhedra, there is no known upper bound.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric problem and structure at infinity on Alexandrov spaces with nonnegative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider nonnegatively curved finite dimensional Alexandrov spaces with a non-collapsing condition, i.e., such that unit balls have volumes uniformly bounded from below away from zero. We study the relation between the isoperimetric profile, the existence of isoperimetric sets, and the asymptotic structure at infinity of such spaces. In this setting, we prove that the following conditions are equivalent: the space has linear volume growth; it is Gromov--Hausdorff asymptotic to one cylinder at infinity; it has uniformly bounded isoperimetric profile; the entire space is a tubular neighborhood of either a line or a ray. Moreover, on a space satisfying any of the previous conditions, we prove existence of isoperimetric sets for sufficiently large volumes, and we characterize the geometric rigidity at the level of the isoperimetric profile. Specializing our study to the $2$-dimensional case, we prove that unit balls have always volumes uniformly bounded from below away from zero, and we prove existence of isoperimetric sets for every volume, characterizing also their topology when the space has no boundary. The proofs exploit a variational approach, and in particular apply to Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature and to Euclidean convex bodies. Up to the authors' knowledge, most of the results are new even in these smooth cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present problems and results that combine graph-minors and coarse geometry. For example, we ask whether every geodesic metric space (or graph) without a fat $H$ minor is quasi-isometric to a graph with no $H$ minor, for an arbitrary finite graph $H$. We answer this affirmatively for a few small $H$. We also present a metric analogue of Menger's theorem and Konig's ray theorem. We conjecture metric analogues of the Erdos--Posa Theorem and Halin's grid theorem.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Approach to Zauner's Conjecture via the Stark Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of $d^2$ complex equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$, also known as SICPOVMs, conjectured by Zauner to exist for all d. The construction gives a putatively complete list of SICs with Weyl-Heisenberg symmetry in all dimensions d &gt; 3. Specifically, we give an explicit expression for an object we call a ghost SIC, which is constructed from the real multiplication values of a special function and which is Galois conjugate to a SIC. The special function, the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle, is more precisely a tuple of meromorphic functions indexed by a congruence subgroup of ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We prove our construction gives a valid SIC in every case assuming two conjectures: the order 1 abelian Stark conjecture for real quadratic fields and a special value identity for the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle. The former allows us to prove that the ghost and the SIC are Galois conjugate over an extension of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta})$ where $\Delta = (d+1)(d-3)$, while the latter allows us to prove idempotency of the presumptive fiducial projector. We provide computational tests of our SIC construction by cross-validating it with known solutions, particularly the extensive work of Scott and Grassl, and by constructing four numerical examples of nonequivalent SICs in d=100, three of which are new. We further consider rank-r generalizations called r-SICs given by maximal equichordal configurations of r-dimensional complex subspaces. We give similar conditional constructions for r-SICs for all r, d such that r(d-r) divides $(d^2-1)$. Finally, we study the structure of the field extensions conjecturally generated by the r-SICs. If K is any real quadratic field, then either every abelian Galois extension of K, or else every abelian extension for which 2 is unramified, is generated by our construction; the former holds for a positive density of field discriminants.</description>
