      <title>Multiphysics continuum mechanics models to advance glaucoma research: State-of-the-art and future perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review provides a broad vision on the use of mechanistic mathematical models based on continuum mechanics to tackle current challenges in glaucoma research. At present, the advent of Artificial Intelligence and data-based models have resulted in significant progress in drug candidate selection, target identification and drug delivery. Mechanistic models (not based on data gathered beforehand, but on fundamental physical principles), and specifically those based on continuum mechanics, have the potential to contribute to a better understanding of glaucoma, too. So far, these models have expanded our understanding of ocular fluid dynamics, including descriptions of fluid flow profiles within the anterior chamber of the eye under glaucomatous conditions. With the emergence of models with complex multiphysics capabilities (not only on fluid dynamics, but also diffusion, heat transfer and fluid-structure interaction), there are now even greater possibilities for the application of mechanistic models to help with current challenges in glaucoma, such as the design of drug-releasing implants, novel glaucoma drainage devices, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery procedures, and laser peripheral iridotomy.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the cellular determinants of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship of the heart via computational modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVr) is a key indicator of cardiac contractility. Despite its established importance, several studies suggested that the mechanical mode of contraction, such as isovolumetric or ejecting contractions, may affect the ESPVr, challenging the traditional notion of a single, consistent relationship. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether the observed effects of ejection on force generation are inherent to the ventricular chamber itself or are a fundamental property of the myocardial tissue, with the underlying mechanisms remaining poorly understood. We investigated these aspects by using a multiscale in silico model that allowed us to elucidate the links between subcellular mechanisms and organ-level function. Simulations of ejecting and isovolumetric beats with different preload and afterload resistance were performed by modulating calcium and cross-bridge kinetics. The results suggest that the ESPVr is not a fixed curve but depends on the mechanical history of the contraction, with potentially both positive and negative effects of ejection. Isolated tissue simulations suggest that these phenomena are intrinsic to the myocardial tissue, rather than properties of the ventricular chamber. Our results suggest that the ESPVr results from the balance of positive and negative effects of ejection, respectively related to a memory effect of the increased apparent calcium sensitivity at high sarcomere length, and to the inverse relationship between force and velocity. Numerical simulations allowed us to reconcile conflicting results in the literature and suggest translational implications for clinical conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where altered calcium dynamics and cross-bridge kinetics may impact the ESPVr.</description>

      <title>Cell bulging and extrusion in a three-dimensional bubbly vertex model for curved epithelial sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell extrusion is an essential mechanism for controlling cell density in epithelial tissues. Another essential element of epithelia is curvature, which is required to achieve complex shapes, like in the lung or intestine. Here we introduce a three-dimensional bubbly vertex model to study the interplay between extrusion and curvature. We find a generic cellular bulging instability at topological defects which is much stronger than for standard vertex models. To clarify the underlying mechanism, we analytically calculate the energy landscape for a single bulging cell in a mean field tissue. We find that extrusion is energetically preferred at topological defects due to a redistribution of Gaussian curvature into the defect. We show that it can be driven both by a decrease in apico-basal tension or by contractile line tensions. We also show that extrusion can be suppressed by luminal pressure and interfacial bending rigidity, allowing for additional control of this important process. Our theory suggests that epithelial curvature naturally leads to cell bulging and extrusion because the interfacial curvature of individual cells at the defects strongly amplifies buckling effected by tissue-scale topological defects in elastic sheets.</description>
