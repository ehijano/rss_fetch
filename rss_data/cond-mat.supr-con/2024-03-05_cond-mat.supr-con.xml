      <title>Pair density wave order in multiband systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An indispensable ingredient for pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity is the presence of an attractive pairing interaction at finite momentum. Here, we show how this condition can be met with straightforward electron-density interactions in multiband systems. The electron-density interaction, when projected to the band basis, acquires form factors with nontrivial momentum dependence and thereby exhibits a potential tendency to a finite-momentum pairing instability. By applying a mean-field analysis to two simple multiband models, the checkerboard lattice and three-band Hubbard model, we find that PDW order can indeed become the leading instability if a strong nearest-neighbour attraction is present. Moreover, the condition for the transition from a uniform superconductor to a PDW superconductor is shown via a simple quantum geometric argument.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and metallic behavior in heavily doped bulk single crystal diamond and graphene/diamond heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to extremely large band gap of 5.5 eV and high thermal conductivity, diamond is recognized as the most important semiconductor. The superconductivity of polycrystalline diamond has always been reported, but there are also many controversies over the existence of superconductivity in bulk single crystal diamond and it remains a question whether a metallic state exists for such a large band gap semiconductor. Herein, we realize a single crystal superconducting diamond with a Hall carrier concentration larger than 3*1020 cm-3 by co-doped of boron and nitrogen. Furthermore, we show that diamond can transform from superconducting to metallic state under similar carrier concentration with tuned carrier mobility degrading from 9.10 cm2 V-1 s-1 or 5.30 cm2 V-1 s-1 to 2.66 cm2 V-1 s-1 or 1.34 cm2 V-1 s-1. Through integrating graphene on a nitrogen and boron heavily co-doped diamond, the monolayer graphene can be superconducting through combining Andreev reflection and exciton mediated superconductivity, which may intrigue more interesting superconducting behavior of diamond heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical responses in superconductors under magnetic fields: quantum geometry and topological superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric superconductors offer fascinating phenomena of quantum transport and optics such as nonreciprocal and nonlinear responses. Time-reversal symmetry breaking often plays an essential role in the emergence and enhancement of nonreciprocal transport. In this paper, we show the nonreciprocal optical responses in noncentrosymmetric superconductors arising from time-reversal symmetry breaking by demonstrating them in $s$-wave superconductors with a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic field. Numerical results reveal the superconductivity-induced bulk photocurrent and second harmonic generation, which are forbidden at the zero magnetic field. We discuss the properties and mechanisms of the superconducting nonlinear responses emerging under the magnetic field. In particular, we investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the photocurrent conductivity and clarify the essential ingredients which give a contribution unique to superconductors under the magnetic field. This contribution is dominant in the low carrier density regime although the corresponding joint density of states is tiny. We attribute the enhancement to the quantum geometry. Moreover, the nonlinear conductivity shows peculiar sign reversal at the transition to the topological superconducting state. We propose a bulk probe of topological transition and quantum geometry in superconductors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular Aluminum is a superconductor known for more than eighty years, which recently found its application in qubits, microwave detectors and compact resonators, due to its high kinetic inductance, critical magnetic field and critical current. Here we report on the nonlinear dependence of granular Aluminum inductance on current, which hints towards parametric amplification of the microwave signal in granular Aluminum films. The phase shift of the microwave signal reached 4 radians at a frequency of 7 GHz, which makes it possible to estimate the nonlinearity of the system as 1.4 % and the potential gain of the order of 17 dB</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Mediated by Nematic Fluctuations in Tetragonal $\textrm{Fe}\textrm{Se}_{1-x}\textrm{S}_{x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nematic phases, where electrons in a solid spontaneously break rotational symmetry while preserving the translational symmetry, exist in several families of unconventional superconductors [1, 2]. Although superconductivity mediated by nematic fluctuations is well established theoretically [3-7], it has yet to be unambiguously identified experimentally [8, 9]. A major challenge is that nematicity is often intertwined with other degrees of freedom, such as magnetism and charge order. The FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ family of iron based superconductors provides a unique opportunity to explore this concept, as it features an isolated nematic phase that can be suppressed by sulfur substitution at a quantum critical point (QCP) near $x_c = 0.17$, where nematic fluctuations are the largest [10-12]. Here, we performed scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements to visualize Boguliubov quasiparticle interference patterns, from which we determined the momentum structure of the superconducting gap near the Brillouin zone $\Gamma$ point of FeSe$_{0.81}$S$_{0.19}$. The results reveal an anisotropic, near nodal gap with minima that are $45^\circ$ rotated with respect to the Fe-Fe direction, characteristic of a nematic pairing interaction, contrary to the usual isotropic gaps due to spin mediated pairing in other tetragonal Fe-based superconductors. The results are also in contrast with pristine FeSe, where the pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations and the gap minima are aligned with the Fe-Fe direction. Therefore, the measured gap structure demonstrates not only a fundamental change of the pairing mechanism across the phase diagram of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, but it also indicates the existence of superconductivity mediated by nematic fluctuations in FeSe$_{0.81}$S$_{0.19}$.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the superconducting diode effect through inhomogeneous magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting diode device comprising a central superconducting film flanked by two wires carrying an applied DC bias, suitably chosen so as to generate different asymmetric field profiles. Through numerical simulations of the coupled Ginzburg-Landau and heat-diffusion equations, we show that this design is capable of efficiently breaking the reciprocity of the critical current in the central superconductor, thus promoting the diode effect in response to an applied AC current. By adjusting the DC bias in the wires, we find the optimum inhomogeneous field profile that facilitates the entrance of vortices and antivortices in a given polarity of the applied AC current and impede their entrance in the other polarity. This way, the system behaves as an ideal superconducting half-wave rectifier, with diode efficiencies surpassing 70%. Furthermore, we detail the behavior and diode efficiency of the system under different experimental conditions, such as the substrate heat transfer coefficient and the sweep rate of the external current.</description>

      <title>Prospect of high-temperature superconductivity in layered metal borocarbides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delithiation of the known layered LiBC compound was predicted to induce conventional superconductivity at liquid nitrogen temperatures but extensive experimental work over the past two decades has detected no signs of the expected superconducting transition. Using a combination of first-principles stability analysis and anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism, we have investigated possible Li$_x$BC morphologies and established what particular transformations of the planar honeycomb BC layers are detrimental to the material's superconductivity. We propose that Li$_x$BC reintercalation with select alkali and alkaline earth metals could lead to synthesis of otherwise inaccessible metastable Li$_x$M$_y$BC superconductors with critical temperatures ($T_{c}$) up to 73 K. The large-scale exploration of metal borocarbides has revealed that NaBC and Li$_{1/2}$Na$_y$BC layered phases are likely true ground states at low temperatures. The findings indicate that this compositional space may host overlooked synthesizable compounds with potential to break the $T_{c}$ record for conventional superconductivity in ambient-pressure materials.</description>

      <title>Niobium coaxial cavities with internal quality factors exceeding 1.5 billion for circuit quantum electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group-V materials such as niobium and tantalum have become popular choices for extending the performance of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms allowing for quantum processors and memories with reduced error rates and more modes. The complex surface chemistry of niobium however makes identifying the main modes of decoherence difficult at millikelvin temperatures and single-photon powers. We use niobium coaxial quarter-wave cavities to study the impact of etch chemistry, prolonged atmospheric exposure, and the significance of cavity conditions prior to and during cooldown, in particular niobium hydride evolution, on single-photon coherence. We demonstrate cavities with quality factors of $Q_{\rm int}\gtrsim 1.4\times10^{9}$ in the single-photon regime, a $15$ fold improvement over aluminum cavities of the same geometry. We rigorously quantify the sensitivity of our fabrication process to various loss mechanisms and demonstrate a $2-4\times$ reduction in the two-level system (TLS) loss tangent and a $3-5\times$ improvement in the residual resistivity over traditional BCP etching techniques. Finally, we demonstrate transmon integration and coherent cavity control while maintaining a cavity coherence of \SI{11.3}{ms}. The accessibility of our method, which can easily be replicated in academic-lab settings, and the demonstration of its performance mark an advancement in 3D cQED.</description>

      <title>Surface Chern-Simons theory for third-order topological insulators and superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional 3rd-order topological insulators (TOTIs) and superconductors (TOTSCs), as the highestorder topological phases hosting zero corner modes in physical dimension, has sparked extensive research interest. However, such topological states have not been discovered in reality due to the lack of experimental schemes of realization. Here, we propose a novel surface Chern-Simons (CS) theory for 3rd-order topological phases, and show that the theory enables a feasible and systematic design of TOTIs and TOTSCs. We show that the emergence of zero Dirac (Majorana) corner modes is entirely captured by an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ CS term that can be further characterized by a novel two-particle Wess-Zumino (WZ) term uncovered here in the surfaces of three-dimensional topological materials. Importantly, our proposed CS term characterization and two-particle WZ term mechanism provide a unique perspective to design TOTIs (TOTSCs) in terms of minimal ingredients, feasibly guiding the search for underlying materials, with promising candidates being discussed. This work shall advance both the theoretical and experimental research for highest-order topological matters.</description>

      <title>Majorana zero-modes in a dissipative Rashba nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condensed matter systems are continuously subjected to dissipation, which often has adverse effects on quantum phenomena. We focus on the impact of dissipation on a superconducting Rashba nanowire. We reveal that the system can still host Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) with a finite lifetime in the presence of dissipation. Most interestingly, dissipation can also generate two kinds of dissipative boundary states: four robust zero-modes (RZMs) and two MZMs, in the regime where the non-dissipative system is topologically trivial. The MZMs appear via bulk gap closing and are topologically characterized by a winding number. The RZMs are not associated with any bulk states and possess no winding number, but their emergence is instead tied to exceptional points. Further, we confirm the stability of the dissipation-induced RZMs and MZMs in the presence of random disorder. Our study paves the way for both realizing and stabilizing MZMs in an experimental setup, driven by dissipation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of spin excitations and charge order in bulk crystals of the infinite-layer nickelate LaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent x-ray spectroscopic studies have revealed spin excitations and charge density waves in thin films of infinite-layer (IL) nickelates. However, clarifying whether the origin of these phenomena is intrinsic to the material class or attributable to impurity phases in the films has presented a major challenge. Here we utilize topotactic methods to synthesize bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$ with crystallographically oriented surfaces. We examine these crystals using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ni $L_3$-edge to elucidate the spin and charge correlations in the bulk of the material. While we detect the presence of prominent spin excitations in the crystals, fingerprints of charge order are absent at the ordering vectors identified in previous in thin-film studies. These results contribute to the understanding of the bulk properties of LaNiO$_2$ and establish topotactically synthesized crystals as viable complementary specimens for spectroscopic investigations.</description>

      <title>Reducing the error rate of a superconducting logical qubit using analog readout information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction enables the preservation of logical qubits with a lower logical error rate than the physical error rate, with performance depending on the decoding method. Traditional error decoding approaches, relying on the binarization (`hardening') of readout data, often ignore valuable information embedded in the analog (`soft') readout signal. We present experimental results showcasing the advantages of incorporating soft information into the decoding process of a distance-three ($d=3$) bit-flip surface code with transmons. To this end, we use the $3\times3$ data-qubit array to encode each of the $16$ computational states that make up the logical state $\ket{0_{\mathrm{L}}}$, and protect them against bit-flip errors by performing repeated $Z$-basis stabilizer measurements. To infer the logical fidelity for the $\ket{0_{\mathrm{L}}}$ state, we average across the $16$ computational states and employ two decoding strategies: minimum weight perfect matching and a recurrent neural network. Our results show a reduction of up to $6.8\%$ in the extracted logical error rate with the use of soft information. Decoding with soft information is widely applicable, independent of the physical qubit platform, and could reduce the readout duration, further minimizing logical error rates.</description>

      <title>Characterization of process-related interfacial dielectric loss in aluminum-on-silicon by resonator microwave measurements, materials analysis, and imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the influence of the fabrication process on dielectric loss in aluminum-on-silicon superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators with internal quality factors ($Q_i$) of about one million at the single-photon level. These devices are essential components in superconducting quantum processors; they also serve as proxies for understanding the energy loss of superconducting qubits. By systematically varying several fabrication steps, we identify the relative importance of reducing loss at the substrate-metal and the substrate-air interfaces. We find that it is essential to clean the silicon substrate in hydrogen fluoride (HF) prior to aluminum deposition. A post-fabrication removal of the oxides on the surface of the silicon substrate and the aluminum film by immersion in HF further improves the $Q_i$. We observe a small, but noticeable, adverse effect on the loss by omitting either standard cleaning (SC1), pre-deposition heating of the substrate to 300$\deg$C, or in-situ post-deposition oxidation of the film's top surface. We find no improvement due to excessive pumping meant to reach a background pressure below $6{\times} 10^{-8}$ mbar. We correlate the measured loss with microscopic properties of the substrate-metal interface through characterization with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).</description>

      <title>Study of superconductivity of very thin $\mathrm{FeSe}_{1-x}\mathrm{Te}_x$ films investigated by microwave complex conductivity measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex conductivity measurements spanning the entire temperature range, including the vicinity of $T_c$, were conducted on systematically varied FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ ($x$ = 0 - 0.5) very thin films. By applying a novel cavity measurement technique employing microwave electric fields parallel to FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ films, we observed distinct temperature-dependent alterations in superfluid fraction and quasiparticle scattering rate at the nematic boundary. These changes in the nematic boundary suggests variations in the superconducting gap structure between samples in the nematic and non-nematic phase. Moreover, fluctuation is visible up to 1.2 $T_c$ irrespective of nematic order, consistent with large superconducting fluctuations in iron chalcogenide superconductors reported previously in [H. Takahashi $\textit{et al}$, Phys. Rev. B 99, 060503(R) (2019)] and [F. Nabeshima $\textit{et al}$, Phys. Rev. B 97, 024504(R) (2018)].</description>

      <title>Spatially modulated superconductivity in the Kagome Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a superconducting order featuring spatial pair modulations on the kagome lattice subject to onsite Hubbard U and nearest neighbor V interactions. Within our functional renormalization group analysis, this state appears with a concomitant d-wave superconducting (SC) instability at zero lattice momentum, where it distinguishes itself through intra-unit cell modulations of the pairing function thus breaking the discrete space group symmetry. The relative weight of the sublattice modulated superconductor (SMS) and d-wave SC is influenced by the absolute interaction strength and coupling ratio V /U . Parametrically adjacent to this domain at weak coupling, we find an intra-unit cell modulated vestigial charge density wave and an s-wave SC instability.

Abstract: The Stoner instability remains a cornerstone for understanding metallic ferromagnets. This instability captures the interplay of Coulomb repulsion, Pauli exclusion, and two-fold fermionic spin degeneracy. In materials with spin-orbit coupling, this fermionic spin is generalized to a two-fold degenerate pseudospin which is typically believed to have symmetry properties as spin. Here we identify a distinct symmetry of this pseudospin that forbids it to couple to a Zeeman field. This `spinless' property is required to exist in five non-symmorphic space groups and has non-trivial implications for superconductivity and magnetism. With Coulomb repulsion, Fermi surfaces composed primarily of this spinless pseudospin feature give rise to Stoner instabilities into magnetic states that are qualitatively different than ferromagnets. These spinless-pseudospin ferromagnets break time-reversal symmetry, have a vanishing magnetization, are non-collinear, and exhibit altermagnetic-like energy band spin-splittings. In superconductors, for all pairing symmetries and field orientations, this spinless pseudospin extinguishes paramagnetic limiting. We discuss applications to superconducting UCoGe and magnetic NiS$_{2-x}$Se$_x$.</description>
