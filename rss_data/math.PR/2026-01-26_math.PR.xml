      <title>Local limit theorems for random isometries of the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random walk $(Y_N)_{N\geq 0}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ generated by successively applying independent random isometries, drawn from a fixed measure $\mu$, to the point $0$. When the support of $\mu$ is finite and includes an irrational rotation satisfying a Diophantine condition, we establish a local central limit theorem (LCLT) for $Y_N$ down to super-polynomially small scales. When $\mu$ includes rotations satisfying a further algebraic condition, we prove that a LCLT holds down to the scale $\exp(-cN^{1/3}/(\log N)^2)$. Due to group-theoretic obstructions, this is sharp for symmetric $\mu$, up to the $\log$ factor. Lastly for a special class of asymmetric $\mu$, we obtain an LCLT down to the much finer scale $\exp(-cN^{1/2})$. The proofs relate the fine-scale distribution of $Y_N$ to a question about the values of integer polynomials on the unit circle.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic asymptotics in discrete beta-ensembles and random tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out the asymptotic analysis of repulsive ensembles of N particles which are discrete analogues of continuous 1d log-gases or beta-ensembles of random matrix theory. The ensembles that we study have several groups of particles which can have different intensities of repulsion. They appear naturally in models of random domino and lozenge tilings, random partitions, supersymmetric gauge theory, asymptotic representation theory, discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles, etc. We allow filling fractions to be either fixed, or free, or to vary while respecting affine constraints. We are interested in the macroscopic behavior of the distribution of particles, captured by linear statistics, partition functions, and their finite-size corrections as N is large. We prove the law of large numbers and large deviations for the empirical measure around the equilibrium measure. To reach finite-size correction we assume off-criticality. For fixed filling fractions, we prove an asymptotic expansion for the partition function and for the cumulants of linear statistics, in particular establishing a central limit theorem. For varying filling fractions, we prove that the central limit theorem is perturbed by an additional discrete Gaussian component oscillating with N. We apply our general results to the study of uniformly random lozenge tilings on a large class of domains -- not necessarily planar, simply-connected, nor orientable. When the analogues of filling fractions are fixed and this domain is orientable, we show that the Gaussian fluctuations on the vertical extend to the whole liquid region and are governed there by the Gaussian free field, as predicted by the Kenyon-Okounkov conjecture. We also establish a modification of the Kenyon-Okounkov conjecture in the non-orientable case. Complementarily, we prove discrete Gaussian fluctuations for filling fractions, when they are not fixed.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional compound Poisson approximations for symmetric distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution of the sum of independent identically distributed symmetric lattice vectors is approximated by the accompanying compound Poisson law and the second-order Hipp-type signed compound Poisson measure. Bergstr\"om -type asymptotic expansion is constructed. The accuracy of approximation is estimated in the total variation metric and, in many cases, is of the order $O(n^{-1})$.</description>

      <title>Coin flipping and waiting times paradoxes: Why fair coins are exceptional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Penney's Ante exhibits non-transitivity when two target strings race to appear in a shared stream of coin tosses. We study instead independent string races, where each player observes their own independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) coin/die stream (possibly biased), and the winner is the player whose target appears first (under an explicit tie convention). We derive compact generating-function formulas for waiting times and a Hadamard-generating-function calculus for head-to-head odds. Our main theorem shows that for a fair -sided die, stochastic dominance induces a total pre-order on all strings, ordered by expected waiting time. For binary coins, we also prove a converse: total comparability under stochastic dominance characterises the fair coin (), and any bias yields patterns whose waiting times are incomparable under stochastic dominance. In contrast, bias allows both (i) reversals between mean waiting time and win probability and (ii) non-transitive cycles; we give explicit examples and certified computational classifications for short patterns.</description>

      <title>Feller Property and Absorption of Diffusions for Multi-Species Metacommunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider individuals of two species distributed over m patches, each with a hosting capacity \(d_i N\) , where \(d_i \in (0, 1]\). We assume that all the patches are linked by the dispersal of individuals. This work examines how the metacommunity evolves in these patches. The model incorporates Wright-Fisher intra-patch reproduction and a general exchange function representing dispersal. Under minimal assumptions, we demonstrate that as \(N\) approaches infinity, the processes converge to a diffusion process for which we establish the Feller property. We prove that the limiting process almost surely reaches the absorbing states in finite time.</description>

      <title>Some Spatial Point Processes of Poisson Family</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial Poisson point processes on finite-dimensional Euclidean space provide fundamental mathematical tools for modeling random spatial point patterns. In this paper, we introduce and analyze several Poisson-type spatial point processes. In particular, we propose and study a point process, namely, the generalized Poisson random field (GPRF), in which more than one point can be observed with positive probability, within a rectangular region having infinitesimal Lebesgue measure. A thinning of the GPRF into independent GPRFs with reduced rate parameters is discussed. Furthermore, we consider these processes indexed by the positive quadrant of the plane and analyze their fractional variants. Various distributional properties of these processes and related governing differential equations are obtained. Later, we define and analyze a spatial Skellam-type point process via GPRF. Moreover, a fractional variant of it in the two parameter case is studied in detail.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov-tamed Euler method for singular SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications, such as systems of interacting particles in physics, require the simulation of diffusion processes with singular coefficients. Standard Euler schemes are then not convergent, and theoretical guarantees in this situation are scarce. In this work we introduce a Lyapunov-tamed Euler scheme, for drift coefficients for which the weak derivative is dominated by a function that obeys a certain generic Lyapunov-type condition. This allows for a range of coefficients that explode to infinity on a bounded set. We establish that, in terms of Lp-strong error, the Lyapunov-tamed scheme is consistent and moreover achieves the same order of convergence as the standard Euler scheme for Lipschitz coefficients. The general result is applied to systems of mean-field particles with singular repulsive interaction in 1D, yielding an error bound with polynomial dependency in the number of particles.</description>

      <title>Measuring Financial Resilience Using Backward Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07502v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the resilience rate as a measure of financial resilience. It captures the expected rate at which a dynamic risk measure recovers, i.e., bounces back, when the risk-acceptance set is breached. We develop the corresponding stochastic calculus by establishing representation theorems for expected time-derivatives of solutions to backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with jumps, evaluated at stopping times. These results reveal that the resilience rate can be represented as a suitable expectation of the generator of a BSDE. We analyze the main properties of the resilience rate and the formal connection of these properties to the BSDE generator. We also introduce resilience-acceptance sets and study their properties in relation to both the resilience rate and the dynamic risk measure. We illustrate our results in several canonical financial examples and highlight their implications via the notion of resilience neutrality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantitative method to compare arbitrary pairs of graph centrality measures, based on the ordering of vertices induced by them. The proposed method is conceptually simple, mathematically elegant, and allows for a quantitative restatement of many conjectures that were previously cumbersome to formalize. Moreover, it produces an approximation scheme useful for network scientists. We explore some of these uses and formulate new conjectures that are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a general framework of distributional computational graphs: computational graphs whose inputs are probability distributions rather than point values. We analyze the discretization error that arises when these graphs are evaluated using finite approximations of continuous probability distributions. Such an approximation might be the result of representing a continuous real-valued distribution using a discrete representation or from constructing an empirical distribution from samples (or might be the output of another distributional computational graph). We establish non-asymptotic error bounds in terms of the Wasserstein-1 distance, without imposing structural assumptions on the computational graph.</description>

      <title>A Refinement of Vapnik--Chervonenkis' Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vapnik--Chervonenkis' theorem is a seminal result in machine learning. It establishes sufficient conditions for empirical probabilities to converge to theoretical probabilities, uniformly over families of events. It also provides an estimate for the rate of such uniform convergence.
  We revisit the probabilistic component of the classical argument. Instead of applying Hoeffding's inequality at the final step, we use a normal approximation with explicit Berry--Esseen error control. This yields a moderate-deviation sharpening of the usual VC estimate, with an additional factor of order $(\varepsilon\sqrt{n})^{-1}$ in the leading exponential term when $\varepsilon\sqrt{n}$ is large.</description>

      <title>Card guessing after an asymmetric riffle shuffle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a card guessing game with complete feedback. An ordered deck of $n$ cards labeled $1$ up to $n$ is riffle-shuffled exactly one time. Given a value $p\in(0{,}1)\setminus\{\frac12\}$, the riffle shuffle is assumed to be unbalanced, such that the cut is expected to happen at position $p\cdot n$. The goal of the game is to maximize the number of correct guesses of the cards: one after another a single card is drawn from the top, and shown to the guesser until no cards remain. We provide a detailed analysis of the optimal guessing strategy and study the distribution of the number of correct guesses.</description>

      <title>A new class of colored Gaussian graphical models with explicit normalizing constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Bayesian model selection in colored Gaussian graphical models (CGGMs), which combine sparsity of conditional independencies with symmetry constraints encoded by vertex- and edge-colored graphs. A computational bottleneck in Bayesian inference for CGGMs is the evaluation of Diaconis-Ylvisaker normalizing constants, given by gamma-type integrals over cones of precision matrices with prescribed zeros and equality constraints. While explicit formulas are known for standard Gaussian graphical models only in special cases (e.g. decomposable graphs) and for a limited class of RCOP models, no general tractable framework has been available for broader families of CGGMs.
  We introduce a new subclass of RCON models for which these normalizing constants admit closed-form expressions. On the algebraic side, we identify conditions on spaces of colored precision matrices that guarantee tractability of the associated integrals, leading to Block-Cholesky spaces (BC-spaces) and Diagonally Commutative Block-Cholesky spaces (DCBC-spaces). On the combinatorial side, we characterize the colored graphs inducing such spaces via a color perfect elimination ordering and a 2-path regularity condition, and define the resulting Color Elimination-Regular (CER) graphs and their symmetric variants. This class strictly extends decomposable graphs in the uncolored setting and contains all RCOP models associated with decomposable graphs. In the one-color case, our framework reveals a close connection between DCBC-spaces and Bose-Mesner algebras.
  For models defined on BC- and DCBC-spaces, we derive explicit closed-form formulas for the normalizing constants in terms of a finite collection of structure constants and propose an efficient method for computing them in the commutative case. Our results broaden the range of CGGMs amenable to principled Bayesian structure learning in high-dimensional applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish finite-dimensional central limit theorems for local, additive, interaction functions of temporally evolving point processes. The dynamics are those of a spatial Poisson process on the flat torus with points subject to a birth-death mechanism, and which move according to Brownian motion while alive. The results reveal the existence of a phase diagram describing at least three distinct structures for the limiting processes, depending on the extent of the local interactions and the speed of the Brownian motions. The proofs, which identify three different limits, rely heavily on Malliavin-Stein type CLTs for $U$-statistics on a representation of the dynamic point process via a distributionally equivalent marked point process.</description>

      <title>Aliasing Effects for Samples of Spin Random Fields on the Sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates aliasing effects emerging from the reconstruction from discrete samples of spin spherical random fields defined on the two-dimensional sphere. We determine the location in the frequency domain and the intensity of the aliases of the harmonic coefficients in the Fourier decomposition of the spin random field and evaluate the consequences of aliasing errors in the angular power spectrum when the samples of the random field are obtained by using some very popular sampling procedures on the sphere, the equiangular and the Gauss-Jacobi sampling schemes. Finally, we demonstrate that band-limited spin random fields are free from aliases, provided that a sufficiently large number of nodes is used in the selected quadrature rule.</description>

Abstract: We derive new Hanson-Wright-type inequalities tailored to the quadratic forms of random vectors with sparse independent components. Specifically, we consider cases where the components of the random vector are sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random variables with $\alpha&gt;0$. When $\alpha=\infty$, these inequalities can be seen as quadratic generalizations of the classical Bernstein and Bennett inequalities for sparse bounded random vectors. To establish this quadratic generalization, we also develop new Bernstein-type and Bennett-type inequalities for linear forms of sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random variables that go beyond the bounded case $(\alpha=\infty)$. Our proof relies on a novel combinatorial method for estimating the moments of both random linear forms and quadratic forms.
  We present two key applications of these new sparse Hanson-Wright inequalities: (1) A local law and complete eigenvector delocalization for sparse $\alpha$-subexponential Hermitian random matrices, generalizing the result of He et al. (2019) beyond sparse Bernoulli random matrices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first local law and complete delocalization result for sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random matrices down to the near-optimal sparsity $p\geq \frac{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}{n}$ when $\alpha\in (0,2)$ as well as for unbounded sparse sub-gaussian random matrices down to the optimal sparsity $p\gtrsim \frac{\log n}{n}.$ (2) Concentration of the Euclidean norm for the linear transformation of a sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random vector, improving on the results of G{\"o}tze et al. (2021) for sparse sub-exponential random vectors.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of nonlinear Burgers-type stochastic partial differential equations driven by additive space-time white noise in one spatial dimension. Building on the rough path framework initiated by Hairer, which provides a pathwise solution theory under spatial regularity $\alpha \in(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2})$, we extend this approach to the full subcritical regime $\alpha \in(0, \frac{1}{2})$. Our main contribution is the establishment of pathwise existence and uniqueness of mild (equivalently, weak) solutions when the spatial regularity of the solution lies strictly below the classical rough path threshold. This is achieved through refined estimates for controlled rough paths, including a new upper bound for compositions with smooth functions and a scaling analysis for rough integrals against heat kernels. In particular, we extend and sharpen key analytic estimates originating from Hairer's work, incorporating refined scaling arguments that are effective in the low-regularity regime. As a result, our framework significantly enlarges the class of Burgers-type SPDEs that can be treated pathwise using rough path techniques.</description>

      <title>Dimension Reduction in Martingale Optimal Transport: Geometry and Robust Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robust option pricing within the framework of Vectorial Martingale Optimal Transport (VMOT). We investigate the geometry of VMOT solutions for $N$-period market models and demonstrate that, when the number of underlying assets is $d=2$ and the payoff is sub- or supermodular, the extremal model reduces to a single-factor structure in the first period. This structural result allows for a significant dimension reduction, transforming the problem into a more tractable format. We prove that this reduction is specific to the two-asset case and provide counterexamples showing it generally fails for $d \geq 3$. Finally, we exploit this monotonicity to develop a reduced-dimension Sinkhorn algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this structure-preserving approach reduces computational time by approximately 99\% compared to standard methods while improving accuracy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Policies for Weakly Coupled Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing the expected average reward obtained over an infinite time horizon by $n$ weakly coupled Markov decision processes. Our setup is a substantial generalization of the multi-armed restless bandit problem that allows for multiple actions and constraints. We establish a connection with a deterministic and continuous-variable control problem where the objective is to maximize the average reward derived from an occupancy measure that represents the empirical distribution of the processes when $n \to \infty$. We show that a solution of this fluid problem can be used to construct policies for the weakly coupled processes that achieve the maximum expected average reward as $n \to \infty$, and we give sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions. Under certain assumptions on the constraints, we prove that these conditions are automatically satisfied if the unconstrained single-process problem admits a suitable unichain and aperiodic policy. In particular, the assumptions include multi-armed restless bandits and a broad class of problems with multiple actions and inequality constraints. Also, the policies can be constructed in an explicit way in these cases. Our theoretical results are complemented by several concrete examples and numerical experiments, which include multichain setups that are covered by the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on probability manifolds from reciprocal relations in Master equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations model physical irreversible processes from complex systems. Recently, it has been shown that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics on the probability simplex, leading to probability manifolds or finite-state Wasserstein--2 spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations on probability manifolds, deriving the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian operators of energies, parallel transport, and calculating both the Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. One example is the Levi-Civita connection from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction. The other example is the sectional, Ricci, and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a three-point lattice graph.</description>

      <title>Robust estimation of a Markov chain transition matrix from multiple sample paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov chains are fundamental models for stochastic dynamics, with applications in a wide range of areas such as population dynamics, queueing systems, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo methods. Estimating the transition matrix and stationary distribution from observed sample paths is a core statistical challenge, particularly when multiple independent trajectories are available. While classical theory typically assumes identical chains with known stationary distributions, real-world data often arise from heterogeneous chains whose transition kernels and stationary measures might differ from a common target. We analyse empirical estimators for such parallel Markov processes and establish sharp concentration inequalities that generalise Bernstein-type bounds from standard time averages to ensemble-time averages. Our results provide nonasymptotic error bounds and consistency guarantees in high-dimensional regimes, accommodating sparse or weakly mixing chains, model mismatch, nonstationary initialisations, and partially corrupted data. These findings offer rigorous foundations for statistical inference in heterogeneous Markov chain settings common in modern computational applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic redundancy and mortality in stochastic search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search processes are a fundamental part of natural and artificial systems. In such settings, the number of searchers is rarely constant: new agents may be recruited while others can abandon the search. Despite the ubiquity of these dynamics, their combined influence on search efficiency remains unexplored. Here we present a general framework for stochastic search in which independent agents progressively join and leave the process, a mechanism we term dynamic redundancy and mortality (DRM). Under minimal assumptions on the underlying search dynamics, this framework yields exact first-passage time statistics. It further reveals surprising connections to stochastic resetting, including a regime in which the resetting mean first-passage time emerges as a universal lower bound for DRM, as well as regimes in which DRM search is faster. We illustrate our results through a detailed analysis of one-dimensional Brownian DRM search. Altogether, this work provides a rigorous foundation for studying first-passage processes with a fluctuating number of searchers, with direct relevance across physical, biological, and algorithmic systems.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Dimensional LQ Mean Field Games with Common Noise: Small and Arbitrary Finite Time Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the results of (Liu and Firoozi, 2025), which develops the theory of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, by incorporating a common noise. This common noise is modeled as an infinite-dimensional Wiener process affecting the dynamics of all agents. In the presence of common noise, the mean-field consistency condition is characterized by a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic evolution equations (FBSEEs) in Hilbert spaces, whereas, in its absence it is represented by coupled forward-backward deterministic evolution equations. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the coupled linear FBSEEs associated with the LQ MFG framework for small time horizons and prove the $\epsilon$-Nash property of the resulting equilibrium strategy. Furthermore, we establish the well-posedness of these coupled linear FBSEEs for arbitrary finite time horizons. Beyond the specific context of MFGs, our analysis also yields a broader contribution by providing, to the best of our knowledge, the first well-posedness result for a class of infinite-dimensional linear FBSEEs, for which only mild solutions exist, over arbitrary finite time horizons.</description>
