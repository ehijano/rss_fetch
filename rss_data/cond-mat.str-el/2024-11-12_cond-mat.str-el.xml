      <title>Charge transfer spin-polarons and ferromagnetism in weakly doped AB-stacked TMD heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of ferromagnetic and magnetic polaron states in weakly doped heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides in the ``heavy fermion'' limit in which one layer hosts a dense set of local moments and the other hosts a low density of itinerant holes. We show that interactions among the carriers in the itinerant layer induces a ferromagnetic exchange. We characterize the ground state finding a competition, controlled by the carrier concentration and interlayer exchange, between a layer decoupled phase of itinerant carriers in a background of local moments, a fully polarized ferromagnet and a canted antiferromagnet. In the canted antiferromagnet phase the combination of the in-plane 120$^{\circ}$ N\'eel order and Ising spin orbit couplings induces winding in the electronic wavefunction giving rise to a topologically non-trivial spin texture and an observable anomalous Hall effect. At larger carrier density the ferromagnetically ordered phase transitions into a paramagnetic heavy Fermi liquid state. This theory enables a comprehensive understanding of the existing experimental observations while also making predictions including experimental signatures enabling direct imaging of spin polaron bound states with scanning tunneling microscopy. Our work shows that the prevailing paradigm of the (Doniach) phase diagram of heavy fermion metals is fundamentally modified in the low doping regime of heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>$SU(N)$ spin-phonon simulations of Floquet dynamics in spin $S &gt; 1/2$ Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of magnetic moments coupled to phonons is of great interest for understanding spin transport in solids as well as for our ability to control magnetism via tailored phonon modes. For spin $S &gt; 1/2$, spin-orbit coupling permits an unusual linear coupling of phonons to quadrupolar moments, so that phonons act as a dynamical transverse field for the spins. Here, we develop a generalized $SU(N)$ spin-phonon Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics technique to simulate the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of such spin-orbital-phonon coupled Mott insulators, and apply it to a spin-1 model with competing XY antiferromagnet (AFM) and quadrupolar paramagnet (QPM) phases which is relevant to the Mott insulator $\rm{Ba_2FeSi_2O_7}$. We uncover a rich variety of dynamical phenomena in this system induced by linear or chiral phonon drives, including the generation of a uniform magnetization in the QPM and AFM, strengthening of N\'eel order and gapping of the AFM Nambu-Goldstone mode by Floquet-Ising anisotropy, a non-equilibrium QPM to AFM transition, and creation of Floquet copies of transverse and longitudinal spin waves. We discuss implications of our work for $\rm{Ba_2FeSi_2O_7}$ and highlight future research directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Near-room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering in the pressure-induced collapsed-tetragonal phase in SrCo2P2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high pressure electrical transport, magnetization, and single crystal X-ray diffraction data on SrCo2P2 single crystals. X-ray diffraction data show that there is a transition to a collapsed tetragonal structure for p ~&gt; 10 GPa and measurements of resistance show that above ~ 10 GPa, a clear transition-like feature can be observed at temperatures up to 260 K. Further magnetization, magnetoresistance and Hall measurements made under pressure all indicate that this transition is to a ferromagnetic ground state. First principles-based density functional theory (DFT) calculations also show that there is a first-order transition between tetragonal and collapsed tetragonal (cT) phases, with an onset near ~ 10 GPa as well as the appearance of the ferromagnetic (FM) ordering in the cT phase. Above ~ 30 GPa, the experimental signatures of the magnetic ordering vanish in a first-order-like manner, consistent with the theoretical calculation results, indicating that SrCo2P2 is another example of the avoidance of quantum criticality in ferromagnetic intermetallic compounds. SrCo2P2 provides clear evidence that the structural, electronic and magnetic properties associated with the cT transition are strongly entangled and are not only qualitatively captured by our first principles-based calculations but are quantitatively reproduced as well.</description>

      <title>Proximate Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in a spin-1/2 ferromagnetic XXZ chain compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-1/2 ferromagnetic XXZ chain is a prototypical many-body quantum model, exactly solvable via the integrable Bethe ansatz method, hosting a Tomonaga-Luttinger spin liquid. However, its clear experimental realizations remain absent. Here, we present a thorough investigation of the magnetism of the structurally disorder-free compound LuCu(OH)$_3$SO$_4$. By conducting magnetization and electron-spin-resonance measurements on the single-crystal sample, we establish that the title compound approximates the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic XXZ chain model with a nearest-neighbor exchange strength of $J_1$ $\sim$ 65 K and an easy-plane anisotropy of $\sim$ 0.994. The specific heat demonstrates a distinctive power-law behavior at low magnetic fields (with energy scales $\leq$ 0.02$J_1$) and low temperatures ($T$ $\leq$ 0.03$J_1$). This behavior is consistent with the expectations of the ideal spin-1/2 ferromagnetic XXZ chain model, thereby supporting the formation of a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger spin liquid in LuCu(OH)$_3$SO$_4$.</description>

      <title>Long-time divergences in the nonlinear response of gapped one-dimensional many-particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider one dimensional many-particle systems that exhibit kinematically protected single-particle excitations over their ground states. We show that momentum and time-resolved 4-point functions of operators that create such excitations diverge linearly in particular time differences. This behaviour can be understood by means of a simple semiclassical analysis based on the kinematics and scattering of wave packets of quasiparticles. We verify that our wave packet analysis correctly predicts the long-time limit of the four-point function in the transverse field Ising model through a form factor expansion. We present evidence in favour of the same behaviour in integrable quantum field theories. In addition, we extend our discussion to experimental protocols where two times of the four-point function coincide, e.g. 2D coherent spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments. Finally, focusing on the Ising model, we discuss subleading corrections that grow as the square root of time differences. We show that the subleading corrections can be correctly accounted for by the same semiclassical analysis, but also taking into account wave packet spreading.</description>

      <title>Thermal Broadening of Phonon Spectral Function in Classical Lattice Models: Projective Truncation Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal broadening of the quasi-particle peak in the spectral function is an important physical feature in many statistical systems, but difficult to calculate. Within the projective truncation approximation (PTA) of Green's function equation of motion for classical systems, we produce the spectral function with thermal broadened quasi-particles peak using an $H$-expanded basis. We demonstrate this method on two model systems, the one-variable anharmonic oscillator model and the one-dimensional classical $\phi^4$ lattice model. Comparison with exact spectral function and the molecular dynamics simulation results shows that the method is semi-quantitatively accurate. Extension of the $H$-expanded basis to PTA for quantum system is possible.</description>

      <title>Uncovering hidden Fermi surface instabilities through visualizing unconventional quasiparticle interference in CeTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge density wave (CDW) state is a widespread phenomenon in low-dimensional metals/semimetals. The spectral weight of the associated folded bands (shadow bands) can be an intriguing trigger leading to additional Fermi surface instability and unexplored phase transitions. The rare earth tri-telluride CeTe3 exhibits a single CDW stabilized below ~400 K and antiferromagnetism below ~3 K. The distinct periodicities between the Te-square net, the CeTe block layer, and the CDW give rise to rich shadow band formations. In this work, we reveal the predominant scattering between the original and shadow bands at 4 K, with the scattering within the original bands being relatively suppressed at Fermi energy. This unconventional quasi-particle scattering collectively underscores the vital role of the shadow bands' spectral weight and the hidden matrix element effect, which are crucial for controlling electronic properties in this system. Furthermore, our finding points to the existence of rich and unexplored Fermi surface instabilities, which potentially play a role in controlling the nature of long-range antiferromagnetism at lower temperatures in the presence of finite charge-spin interaction.</description>

      <title>Revealing Pronounced Electron-Hole Fermi Pockets in the Charge Density Wave Semimetal LaTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth tri-tellurides (RTe3) are van der Waals (vdW) coupled semimetals ideal for exploring exotic electronic phases. LaTe3 is especially important for understanding the fundamental Fermiology of the RTe3 family because it is non-magnetic and has a simpler charge density wave structure. In this study, we used spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to measure the Landau levels of LaTe3 with high energy resolution at 300 mK. These measurements were taken under varying magnetic fields up to 15 T, with fine intervals of 0.02 - 0.03 T. Our results reveal a pair of pronounced electron-hole Fermi pockets of similar sizes and evidence of electron-boson coupling in both pockets. Given the strong charge susceptibility typical of low-dimensional conductors, the interactions and instabilities driven by the electron-hole Fermi pockets could be a basis for searching unexplored quantum phases in other antiferromagnetic RTe3 compounds.</description>

      <title>Entangled orbital, spin, and ferroelectric orders in $p$-electron magnet CsO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali superoxides differ from conventional transition metal magnets, exhibit magnetism from partially occupied oxygen molecular $\pi^*$-orbitals. Among them, CsO$_2$ stands out for its potential to exhibit novel quantum collective phenomena, such as an orbital order induced Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state. Using ab-initio Hubbard models, superexchange theory, and experimental spin wave measurements, we propose that CsO$_2$ exhibits unconventional magnetoelectric characteristics at low temperature. Our analysis confirms a canted antiferromagnetic ground state and a spin-flop transition, with ferroelectricity is induced by breaking inversion and time-reversal symmetry in the spin-flop phase. Consequently, our analysis reveals a strong interplay not only between exchange interactions but also among magnetically-induced polarization and orbital order. The magnetic structure, stabilized by orbital order, induces magnetically-induced polarization through an antisymmetric mechanism. Overall, our results reveal the coexistence of three highly entangled orders in CsO$_2$, namely, orbital, spin and ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>Charge Density Wave Coexisting with Amplified Nematicity in the Correlated Kagome Metal CsCr3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlated phenomena of flat bands have been extensively studied in twisted systems. However, the emergent ordered states arising from interactions in intrinsic multi-orbital flat bands in kagome lattice materials remain largely unexplored. In contrast to the vanadium-based AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs), the newly discovered kagome metal CsCr3Sb5, featuring pressurized superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, structural phase transition, and density wave orders, provides a rich platform for investigating strong electron correlations in multi-orbital flat bands at the Fermi surface. Here, using ultrafast optical techniques, we reveal the gap opening and the emergence of a distinct 1x4 charge density wave (CDW) at low temperatures in CsCr3Sb5. We also find that this CDW reduces the rotational symmetry to three inequivalent nematic domains, and the exotic nematicity is further amplified by the degeneracy lifting of the multi-orbital flat bands, similar to some iron-based superconductors. Surprisingly, both CDW and orbital nematicity appear concurrently with spin and structural orders at the same temperature, indicating that a single characteristic energy scale governs the low-energy flat band physics. Our study thus pioneers the investigation of ultrafast dynamics in flat band systems at the Fermi surface, offering new insights into the interactions between multiple elementary excitations in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Re-entrant topological order in strongly correlated nanowire due to Rashba spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of the Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC) on the topological properties of the one-dimensional (1D) extended \emph{s}-wave superconducting Hamiltonian, in the presence of strong electron-electron correlation, is investigated. It is found that a non-zero RSOC increases the periodicity of the effective Hamiltonian, which results in the folding of the Brillouin zone (BZ), and consequently in the emergence of an energy gap at the boundary of the BZ. If the chemical potential is inside the energy gap and it does not perceive the two-band structure of the resulting energy spectrum the topological phase is removed from the phase diagram.In contrast, if we move the chemical potential upwards towards the highest occupied band the opposite happens and the non-trivial topology is restored. This is the origin of re-entrant nature of the existent topological properties. This property of the system allows us to drive the system in and out of the topological phase only by the proper tuning of the chemical potential. A heterostructure involving van der Waals materials and a 1D Moire pattern for an investigation of the predicted effect has also been proposed and discussed in our work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) on the formation of charge-density wave (CDW) and superconducting (SC) phases in the Holstein model on a half-filled square lattice. Using unbiased finite-temperature Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we go beyond mean-field approaches to determine the ground state order parameter as a function of RSOC and phonon frequency. Our results reveal that the Rashba metal is unstable due to particle-hole instabilities, favoring the emergence of a CDW phase for any RSOC value. In the limit of a pure Rashba hopping, the model exhibits a distinct behavior with the appearance of four Weyl cones at half-filling, where quantum phase transitions are expected to occur at strong interactions. Indeed, a quantum phase transition, belonging to the Gross-Neveu Ising universality class between a semi-metal and CDW emerges at finite phonon frequency dependent coupling $\lambda_c$. In the antiadiabatic limit we observe an enhance symmetry in the IR that unifies SC and CDW orders. These results advance our understanding of competing CDW and SC phases in systems with spin-orbit coupling, providing insights that may help clarify the behavior of related materials.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive neural quantum states of Fermi Hubbard models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful ansatz for variational quantum Monte Carlo studies of strongly-correlated systems. Here, we apply recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and autoregressive transformer neural networks to the Fermi-Hubbard and the (non-Hermitian) Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. In both cases, we observe that the convergence of the RNN ansatz is challenged when increasing the interaction strength. We present a physically-motivated and easy-to-implement strategy for improving the optimization, namely, by ramping of the model parameters. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the autoregressive sampling property of both network architectures. For the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model, we identify convergence issues that stem from the autoregressive sampling scheme in combination with the non-Hermitian nature of the model. Our findings provide insights into the challenges of the NQS approach and make the first step towards exploring strongly-correlated electrons using this ansatz.</description>

      <title>Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07174</link>

Abstract: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T. Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized superconductivity from Majorana glue in the Kitaev-Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity usually emerges from a metallic normal state which follows the Fermi-liquid paradigm. If, in contrast, the normal state is a fractionalized non-Fermi liquid, then pairing may either eliminate fractionalization via a Higgs-type mechanism leading to a conventional superconducting state, or pairing can occur in the presence of fractionalization. Here we discuss a simple model for the latter case: Using a combination of perturbation theory and functional renormalization group, we show that the Kitaev--Kondo lattice model displays a fractionalized superconducting phase at weak Kondo coupling. This phase is characterized by Cooper pairing of conventional electronic quasiparticles, coexisting with a spin-liquid background and topological order. Depending on the sign of the Kitaev coupling, we find the pairing to be either of chiral $d$-wave or $p$-wave type for extended doping regions around the van-Hove filling. We discuss applications and extensions.</description>

      <title>Subleading logarithmic behavior in the parquet formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi-edge singularity in x-ray absorption spectra of metals is a paradigmatic case of a logarithmically divergent perturbation series. Prior work has thoroughly analyzed the leading logarithmic terms. Here, we investigate the perturbation theory beyond leading logarithms and formulate self-consistent equations to incorporate all leading and next-to-leading logarithmic terms. This parquet solution of the Fermi-edge singularity goes beyond the previous first-order parquet solution and sheds new light on the parquet formalism regarding logarithmic behavior. We present numerical results in the Matsubara formalism and discuss the characteristic power laws. We also show that, within the single-boson exchange framework, multi-boson exchange diagrams are needed already at the leading logarithmic level.</description>

Abstract: We classify (multi)fusion 2-categories in terms of braided fusion categories and group cohomological data. This classification is homotopy coherent -- we provide an equivalence between the 3-groupoid of (multi)fusion 2-categories up to monoidal equivalences and a certain 3-groupoid of commuting squares of $\mathrm{B}\mathbb{Z}/2$-equivariant spaces. Rank finiteness and Ocneanu rigidity for fusion 2-categories are immediate corollaries of our classification.</description>

      <title>Existence of dual topological phases in Sn-based ternary chalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is quite intriguing to investigate the transition from a topological insulator (TI) phase to topological crystalline insulator (TCI) phase in a material as the latter has an advantage over the former in controlled device applications. This work investigates the existence of this dual topological behavior in Sn-based ternary chalcogenides family PbSnX2 (X=S, Se, Te) under the hydrostatic pressure using first-principles approach. These materials are dynamically sTABLE at ambient and elevated pressure conditions up to which the topological phase transitions (TPTs) are studied. This family have a topologically trivial ground state with direct band gap values 0.338 eV, 0.183 eV and 0.217 eV for PbSnS2, PbSnSe2 and PbSnTe2, respectively. The first TPT i.e., TI phase for these materials is observed, under the effect of external pressure of 5 GPa, 2.5 GPa and 3.5 GPa, with a single band inversion at F-point in the bulk band structure and an odd number of Dirac cones along the (111) surface. A further increase in pressure to 5.5 GPa, 3 GPa and 4 GPa results in another band inversion at {\Gamma}-point and an even number of Dirac cones along the (111) plane. These even number of band inversions suggest that (\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)) surface has mirror symmetry around (\(\bar{1}0\bar{1}\)) plane and hence, the TCI phase is obtained. This TCI phase is further corroborated with even value of mirror Chern number calculated using winding of Wannier charge centers.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition in small-size 1d and 2d Josephson junction arrays: analysis of the experiments within the interacting plasmons picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretically, Josephson junction (JJ) arrays can exhibit either a superconducting or insulating state, separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). In this work, we analyzed published data on QPTs in three one-dimensional arrays and two two-dimensional arrays using a recently developed phenomenological model of QPTs. The model is based on the insight that the scaled experimental data depend in a universal way on two characteristic length scales of the system: the microscopic length scale $L_0$ from which the renormalization group flow starts, and the dephasing length, $L_{\varphi}(T)$ as given by the distance travelled by system-specific elementary excitations over the Planckian time. Our analysis reveals that the data for all five arrays (both 1D and 2D) can be quantitatively and self-consistently explained within the framework of interacting superconducting plasmons. In this picture, $L_{\varphi}=v_p\hbar/k_B T$, and $L_0 \approx \Lambda$, where $v_p$ is the speed of the plasmons and $\Lambda$ is the Coulomb screening length of the Cooper pairs. We also observe that, in 1D arrays, the transition is significantly shifted towards the insulating side compared to the predictions of the sine-Gordon model. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences with recent microwave studies of extremely long JJ chains, as well as with the pair-breaking QPT observed in superconducting nanowires and films.</description>

      <title>Calculations of Spin Fluctuation Spectral Functions $\alpha^{2}F$ in High-Temperature Superconducting Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin fluctuations have been proposed as a key mechanism for mediating superconductivity, particularly in high-temperature superconducting cuprates, where conventional electron-phonon interactions alone cannot account for the observed critical temperatures. Traditionally, their role has been analyzed through tight-binding based model Hamiltonians. In this work we present a method that combines density functional theory with a momentum- and frequency-dependent pairing interaction derived from the Fluctuation Exchange (FLEX) type Random Phase Approximation (FLEX-RPA) to compute Eliashberg spectral functions $\alpha ^{2}F(\omega )$ which are central to spin fluctuation theory of superconductivity. We apply our numerical procedure to study a series of cuprates where our extracted material specific $\alpha ^{2}F(\omega )$ are found to exhibit remarkable similarities characterized by a sharp peak in the vicinity of 40-60 meV and their rapid decay at higher frequencies. Our exact diagonalization of a linearized BCS gap equation extracts superconducting energy gap functions for realistic Fermi surfaces of the cuprates and predicts their symmetry to be $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ in all studied systems. Via a variation of on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$ for the copper $d$-electrons we show that that the range of the experimental values of $T_{c}$ can be reproduced in this approach but is extremely sensitive to the proximity of the spin density wave instability. These data highlight challenges in building first-principle theories of high temperature superconductivity but offer new insights beyond previous treatments, such as the confirmation of the usability of approximate BCS-like $T_{c}$ equations, together with the evaluations of the material specific coupling constant $\lambda $ without reliance on tight-binding approximations of their electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Persistence of vortexlike phase fluctuations in underdoped to heavily overdoped Bi-2201 cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanism that controls the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{0}$ as a function of doping is one of the central questions in cuprate high-temperature superconductors. While it is generally accepted that $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{0}$ in underdoped cuprates is not determined by the scale of pairing but by the onset of global phase coherence, the role of phase fluctuations in the overdoped region has been controversial. Here, our transport measurements in perpendicular magnetic fields ($H$) on underdoped Bi-2201 reveal immeasurably small Hall response for $T&gt;T_{\mathrm{c}}(H)$ as a signature of SC phase with vortexlike phase fluctuations. We find that the extent of such a regime in $T$ and $H$ is suppressed near optimal doping but becomes strongly enhanced in heavily overdoped Bi-2201. Our results thus show that vortexlike phase fluctuations play an important role in the field-tuned SC transition in the heavily overdoped region, in contrast to conventional mean-field Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer description. The unexpected nonmonotonic dependence of phase fluctuations on doping provides a new perspective on the SC transition in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Noise Spectroscopy and Electrical Transport in NbO2 Memristors with Dual Resistive Switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative differential resistance (NDR) behavior observed in several transition metal oxides is crucial for developing next-generation memory devices and neuromorphic computing systems. NbO2-based memristors exhibit two regions of NDR at room temperature, making them promising candidates for such applications. Despite this potential, the physical mechanisms behind the onset and the ability to engineer these NDR regions remain unclear, hindering further development of these devices for applications. This study employed electrical transport and ultra-low frequency noise spectroscopy measurements to investigate two distinct NDR phenomena in nanoscale thin films of NbO2. By analyzing the residual current fluctuations as a function of time, we find spatially inhomogeneous and non-linear conduction near NDR-1 and a two-state switching near NDR-2, leading to an insulator-to-metal (IMT) transition. The power spectral density of the residual fluctuations exhibits significantly elevated noise magnitudes around both NDR regions, providing insights into physical mechanisms and device size scaling for electronic applications. A simple theoretical model, based on the dimerization of correlated insulators, offers a comprehensive explanation of observed transport and noise behaviors near NDRs, affirming the presence of non-linear conduction followed by an IMT connecting macroscopic device response to transport signatures at atomic level.</description>

      <title>Driven Critical Dynamics in Measurement-induced Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT), characterizing abrupt changes in entanglement properties in quantum many-body systems subjected to unitary evolution with interspersed projective measurements, have garnered increasing interest. In this work, we generalize the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) driven critical dynamics that has achieved great success in traditional quantum and classical phase transitions to MIPT. By linearly changing the measurement probability $p$ to cross the critical point $p_c$ with driving velocity $R$, we identify the dynamic scaling relation of the entanglement entropy $S$ versus $R$ at $p_c$. For decreasing $p$ from the area-law phase, $S$ satisfies $S\propto \ln R$; while for increasing $p$ from the volume-law phase, $S$ satisfies $S\propto R^{1/r}$ in which $r=z+1/\nu$ with $z$ and $\nu$ being the dynamic and correlation length exponents, respectively. Moreover, we find that the driven dynamics from the volume-law phase violates the adiabatic-impulse scenario of the KZ mechanism. In spite of this, a unified finite-time scaling (FTS) form can be developed to describe these scaling behaviors. Besides, the dynamic scaling of the entanglement entropy of an auxiliary qubit $S_Q$ is also investigated to further confirm the universality of the FTS form. By successfully establishing the driven dynamic scaling theory of this newfashioned entanglement transition, we bring a new fundamental perspective into MIPT that can be detected in fast-developing quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Octupolar Weyl Superconductivity from Electron-electron Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity arising from electron-electron interaction can manifest exotic symmetry and topological properties. We investigate the superconducting pairing symmetry problem based on the 3D cubic $O_h$ symmetry with both weak- and strong-coupling approaches. The dominant pairing symmetries belong to the two-dimensional $E_g$ representation at low and intermediate doping levels, and the complex mixing gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}+id_{x^2-y^2}$-type is energetically favored in the ground state. Cooper pairs with such a symmetry do not possess orbital angular momentum (OAM) moments, which is different from other time-reversal symmetry breaking pairings such as $p_x+ip_y$ (e.g $^3$He-A) and $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ under the planar hexagonal symmetry. Instead, they develop the octupolar $O_{xyz}$ component of OAM, which results in 8 nodal points along the body diagonal directions exhibiting an alternating distribution of monopole charges $\pm 1$. This leads to an intriguing 3D Weyl topological SC, which accommodates nontrivial surface states of Majorana arcs. Our results appeal for material realizations and experimental tests in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Evidence of zero-field Wigner solids in ultra-thin films of cadmium arsenide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Wigner crystal is a many-body state where Coulombic repulsion quenches the kinetic energy of electrons, causing them to crystallize into a lattice. Experimental realization of a quantum Wigner crystal at zero magnetic field has been a long-sought goal. Here, we report on the experimental evidence of a Wigner solid in ultra-thin films of cadmium arsenide (Cd3As2) at zero magnetic field. We show that a finite bias depins the domains and produces an unusually sharp threshold current-voltage behavior. Hysteresis and voltage fluctuations point to domain motion across the pinning potential and disappear at finite temperature as thermal fluctuations overcome the potential. The application of a small magnetic field destroys the Wigner solid, pointing to an unconventional origin. We use Landau level spectroscopy to show that the formation of the Wigner solid is closely connected to a topological transition as the film thickness is reduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of SO($n$)-symmetric spin chains which generalize the transverse-field Ising chain for $n=1$. These spin chains are defined with Gamma matrices and can be exactly solved by mapping to $n$ species of itinerant Majorana fermions coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. Their phase diagrams include a critical point described by the $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_{1}$ conformal field theory as well as two distinct gapped phases. We show that one of the gapped phases is a trivial phase and the other realizes a symmetry-protected topological phase when $n \geq 2$. These two gapped phases are proved to be related to each other by a Kramers-Wannier duality. Furthermore, other elegant structures in the transverse-field Ising chain, such as the infinite-dimensional Onsager algebra, also carry over to our models.</description>

      <title>Magnetostatic modes and criticality in quantum-Ising materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze modes in a dipole-dipole coupled quantum-Ising material, taking into consideration shape effects present in any real magnet. We find that the soft mode governing quantum criticality in a non-ellipsoidal sample is a magnetostatic mode which nulls out the effects of dynamic-demagnetization-field fluctuations. The demagnetization field is analyzed from a microscopic perspective. Two additional modes are calculated relying solely on knowledge of the demagnetization factor of the sample, one of which has lower energy than the soft mode governing quantum criticality in the bulk of the magnet. Experimental evidence for these theoretical results is provided by analysis of electronuclear modes in LiHoF$_4$, an archetypal quantum-Ising material.</description>

      <title>Theory of robust quantum many-body scars in long-range interacting systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special non-equilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent $\alpha$ of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally-symmetric limit $\alpha=0$. First, we numerically establish that despite spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal $\alpha$, the towers of $\alpha=0$ energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as $\alpha$ is increased, and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor non-linearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analitycally solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation, and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$ (with $d$ = spatial dimension of the lattice). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g. near dynamical critical points or in presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a byproduct, we find a predictive criterion for presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$, beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.</description>

      <title>Quantized nonlinear Hall effect from chiral monopole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear Hall effect arises in materials without inversion symmetry, and the intrinsic contribution is typically from Berry curvature dipole of non-universal Fermi pockets. Here we propose that nonlinear Hall effect can reach quantization in chiral Weyl semimetals without mirror symmetries. The energy shift between a pair of Weyl nodes leads to chirally asymmetric intra-node relaxation, and the net trace of nonlinear Hall conductivity is thus quantized in units of $e^3/\hbar^2$ and determined by sum of monopole charge weighted by the transport relaxation time. Our theory also applies to mirror symmetric Weyl/Dirac semimetals with chiral anomaly. Additionally, besides DC transport probes, we anticipate that nonlinear circular dichroism measurements could detect chiral asymmetry-induced currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by advances in pump-probe experiments and light-driven phenomena, we theoretically study the impact of pumped and driven phonons in Mott insulators which host multipole moments, thus going beyond conventional dipolar magnetism. As a case study, we examine pseudospin-1/2 Mott insulators hosting quadrupolar and octupolar moments, and investigate the effect of resonantly exciting ${\cal E}_g$ phonon modes which couple linearly to the quadrupoles. We show that this leads to multipolar precession, with the back action resulting in chiral phonon dynamics below the octupolar phase transition. We further explore the impact of a coherent two-phonon Floquet drive, showing that it can be used to `train' octupolar order or even switch its sign on ultrafast timescales. Our results are obtained combining a generalized Monte Carlo code incorporating phonons with molecular dynamics simulations which numerically integrate the coupled spin-phonon equations of motion. Our work shows how phonon-driven dynamics can be used to probe and control hidden orders in solids.</description>

      <title>Thermally-induced mimicry of quantum cluster excitations and implications for the magnetic transition in FePX$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two dimensional magnets, the interplay of thermal fluctuations and spin anisotropy control the existence of long-range magnetic order. In the van der Waals antiferromagnets FePX$_3$, orbital degeneracy in the $t_{2g}$ levels of the Fe$^{2+}$ ions in octahedral coordination yields strong uniaxial anisotropy, which stabilizes magnetic order up to $T \approx 100$ K. Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements around the magnetic ordering transition have shown the existence of a broad spectrum of magnetic fluctuations with nontrivial momentum dependence, what has been interpreted as evidence for localized entangled cluster excitations. In this paper, we offer an alternative interpretation using classical non-linear spin dynamics simulations. We present stochastic Landau Lifshitz dynamics simulations that reproduce the neutron scattering measurements of Chen et al. [1] on FePX$_3$. These calculations faithfully explain the dynamical structure factor's momentum and energy dependence and point to a classical origin for the excitations observed in neutron spectroscopy and that the order-disorder transition can be understood in terms of thermal fluctuations overcoming the anisotropy energy.</description>

Abstract: We provide the phase diagram of a 2-parameter spin-1 chain that has a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase using computational algorithms along with tensor-network tools. We improve previous results, showing the existence of a new phase and new triple points. New striking features are the triple end of the Haldane phase and the complexity of phases bordering the Haldane phase in proximity allowing moving to nearby non-SPT phases via small perturbations. These characteristics make the system, which appears in Rydberg excitons, e.g. in Cu$_2$O, a prime candidate for applications.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of magnetic phase transition in correlated magnetic metal: insight into itinerant ferromagnet Fe$_{3-\delta}$GeTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing a comprehensive magnetic theory for correlated itinerant magnets poses challenges due to the difficulty in reconciling both local moments and itinerant electrons. In this work, we investigate the microscopic process of magnetic phase transition in ferromagnetic metal Fe$_{3-\delta}$GeTe$_2$. We find that Hund's coupling is crucial for establishing ferromagnetic order. During the ferromagnetic transition, we observe the formation of quasiparticle flat bands and an opposing tendency in spectral weight transfer, primarily between the lower and upper Hubbard bands, across the two spin channels. Moreover, our results indicate that one of the inequivalent Fe sites exhibits Mott physics, while the other Fe site exhibits Hund's physics, attributable to their distinct atomic environments. We suggest that ferromagnetic order reduces spin fluctuations and makes flat bands near the Fermi level more distinct. The hybridization between the distinctly flat bands and other itinerant bands offers a possible way to form heavy fermion behavior in ferromagnets. The complex interactions of competing orders drive correlated magnetic metals to a new frontier for discovering outstanding quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytical results on the correlation functions of strongly correlated many-body systems are rare in the literature and their importance cannot be overstated. We present determinant representations for the space-, time-, and temperature-dependent correlation functions of the strongly interacting one-dimensional Hubbard model in the presence of an external trapping potential. These representations are exact and valid in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios like the ones initiated by a sudden change of the confinement potential. In addition, they can be implemented numerically very easily significantly outperforming other numerical approaches. As applications of our results we investigate the single particle spectral functions of systems with harmonic trapping and show that dynamical quasicondensation occurs for both fermionic and bosonic spin-$1/2$ systems released from a Mott insulator state.</description>

Abstract: By utilizing a multi-orbital periodic Anderson model with parameters obtained from \textit{ab initio} band structure calculations, combined with degenerate perturbation theory, we derive effective Kondo-Heisenberg and spin Hamiltonians that capture the interaction among the effective magnetic moments. This derivation encompasses fluctuations via both nonmagnetic $4f^0$ and magnetic $4f^2$ virtual states, and its accuracy is confirmed through comparison with experimental data obtained from CeIn$_3$. The significant agreement observed between experimental results and theoretical predictions underscores the potential of deriving minimal models from first-principles calculations for achieving a quantitative description of $4f$ materials. Moreover, our microscopic derivation unveils the underlying origin of anisotropy in the exchange interaction between Kramers doublets, shedding light on the conditions under which this anisotropy may be weak compared to the isotropic contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most studies of non-trivial topological systems are carried out in non-interacting models that admit an exact solution. This raises the question, to which extent the consideration of electronic correlations and disorder, present in real systems, modify these results. Exact solutions of correlated electronic systems with non-trivial topological properties, although fundamental are scarce. Among the non-interacting soluble models, we single out the Kitaev p-wave superconducting chain. It plays a crucial role in clarifying the appearance of emergent quasi-particles, the Majorana modes, associated with non-trivial topological properties. Given the relevance of this model, it would be extremely useful if it could be extended to include correlations and still remain solvable. In this work we investigate a superconducting Kitaev chain that interacts through a Falicov-Kimball Hamiltonian with a background of localized electrons. For some relevant values of the parameters, this model can be solved exactly by mapping into a non-interacting one. This allows for a detailed study of the interplay between electronic correlations and non-trivial topological behavior. Besides, the random occupation of the chain by the local moments brings new interesting effects associated with disorder.</description>

Abstract: Interactions have strong effects in systems with flat bands. We examine the role of Coulomb interactions in two dimensional chiral anisotropic quasiparticles that disperse linearly in one direction and have relatively flat bands near the neutrality point in the other direction, dispersing with an arbitrary positive even power law $2n\geq 2$. As in the conventional semi-Dirac case ($n = 1$), we show using renormalization group that strong logarithmic divergences in the self-energy of generalized semi-Dirac fermions resum and lead to a restoration of the linearity of the spectrum for arbitrary n over a sizable energy window in the perturbative regime. We discuss those results in light of previous non-perturbative large $N_f$ results and address the implications for physical observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02742v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine perturbation theory with analytic and numerical bootstrap techniques to study the critical point of the long-range Ising (LRI) model in two and three dimensions. This model interpolates between short-range Ising (SRI) and mean-field behaviour. We use the Lorentzian inversion formula to compute infinitely many three-loop corrections in the two-dimensional LRI near the mean-field end. We further exploit the exact OPE relations that follow from bulk locality of the LRI to compute infinitely many two-loop corrections near the mean-field end, as well as some one-loop corrections near SRI. By including such exact OPE relations in the crossing equations for LRI we set up a very constrained bootstrap problem, which we solve numerically using SDPB. We find a family of sharp kinks for two- and three-dimensional theories which compare favourably to perturbative predictions, as well as some Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional LRI.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of edge-bulk incompatibility in fractional quantum Hall platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The edges of a two-dimensional topological phase of matter serve as a platform underlying its low-energy dynamics. The topology of the bulk phase dictates the structure of the gapless modes. Proximitizing boundary modes to another boundary, may lead to gap opening at the edge. Subsequently, one may engineer different segments of the boundary with intrinsic incompatibility of gap-generating mechanisms ("edge-edge incompatibility"), facilitating the generation of topological excitations, e.g. Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here we address the possibility of bulk-edge incompatibility, whereby the intrinsic bulk gap competes with a gap generated via boundary modes. Specifically, we consider two $\nu = 2/3$ fractional quantum Hall phases whose shared boundary modes are gapped out via disorder-generated tunneling across the boundary. A neutral superconducting phase, made up of neutral edge modes, is stabilized over a broad range of interaction parameters. This phase cannot coexist with the bulk gap. The resulting edge-bulk incompatibility gives rise to the emergence of MZMs (in the neutral sector). We propose an experimental setup to verify both the neutral superconductivity phase and the emergent MZMs.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport and current noise through a multilevel Anderson impurity: Three-body Fermi-liquid corrections in quantum dots and magnetic alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Fermi-liquid description for thermoelectric transport and current noise, applicable to multilevel quantum dots (QD) and magnetic alloys (MA) without electron-hole or time-reversal symmetry. Our formulation for the low-energy transport is based on an Anderson model with $N$ discrete impurity levels, and is asymptotically exact at low energies, up to the next-leading order terms in power expansions with respect to temperature $T$ and bias voltage $eV$. The expansion coefficients can be expressed in terms of the Fermi-liquid parameters, which include the three-body correlation functions defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state in addition to the linear susceptibilities and the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of impurity electrons. We apply this formulation to SU($N$) symmetric QD and MA, and calculate the correlation functions for $N=4$ and $6$, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The three-body correlations are shown to be determined by a single parameter over a wide range of electron fillings $1 \lesssim N_d^{} \lesssim N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions $U$, and they also exhibit the plateau structures due to the SU($N$) Kondo effects at integer values of $N_d^{}$. We find that the Lorenz number $L=\kappa/(T \sigma)$ for QD and MA, defined as the ratio of the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ to the electrical conductivity $\sigma$, deviates from the universal Wiedemann-Franz value $\pi^2/(3e^2)$ as the temperature increases from $T=0$, showing the $T^2$ dependence, the coefficient for which depends on the three-body correlations away from half filling. We also demonstrate the role of three-body correlations on the nonlinear current noise and the other transport coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a local spin system giving rise to a slow Hamiltonian dynamics is stable against generic, even time-dependent, local perturbations. The sum of these perturbations can cover a significant amount of the system's size. The stability of the slow dynamics follows from proving that the Lieb-Robinson bound for the dynamics of the total Hamiltonian is the sum of two contributions: the Lieb-Robinson bound of the unperturbed dynamics and an additional term coming from the Lieb-Robinson bound of the perturbations with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of the study of the stability of Many-Body-Localized systems, implying that if a so called ergodic region is present in the system, to spread across a certain distance it takes a time proportional to the exponential of such distance. The non-perturbative nature of our result allows us to develop a dual description of the dynamics of a system. As a consequence we are able to prove that the presence of a region of disorder in a ergodic system implies the slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of that region.</description>

      <title>Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons</title>

Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum error correcting codes from conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy subspace of a conformal field theory (CFT) can serve as a quantum error correcting code, with important consequences in holography and quantum gravity. We consider generic 1+1D CFT codes under extensive local dephasing channels and analyze their error correctability in the thermodynamic limit. We show that (i) there is a finite decoding threshold if and only if the minimal nonzero scaling dimension in the fusion algebra generated by the jump operator of the channel is larger than $1/2$ and (ii) the number of protected logical qubits $k \geq \Omega( \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits. As an application, we show that the one-dimensional quantum critical Ising model has a finite threshold for certain types of dephasing noise. Our general results also imply that a CFT code with continuous symmetry saturates a bound on the recovery fidelity for covariant codes.</description>

      <title>Supercell Wannier functions and a faithful low-energy model for Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a minimal low-energy model for Bernal bilayer graphene and related rhombohedral graphene multilayers at low electronic densities by constructing Wannier orbitals defined in real-space supercells of the original primitive cell. Starting from an ab-initio electronic structure theory comprising the atomic carbon $p_z$-orbitals, momentum locality of the Fermi surface pockets around $K,K'$ is circumvented by backfolding the $\pi$-bands to the concomitant mini-Brillouin zone of the supercell, reminiscent of their (twisted) moir\'e counterparts. The supercell Wannier functions reproduce the spectral weight and Berry curvature of the microscopic model and offer an intuitive real-space picture of the emergent physics at low electronic densities being shaped by flavor-polarized wave packets with mesoscopic extent. By projecting an orbital-resolved, dual-gated Coulomb interaction to the effective Wannier basis, we find that the low-energy physics of Bernal bilayer graphene is governed by weak electron-electron interactions. Our study bridges between existing continuum theories and ab-initio studies of small Fermi pocket systems like rhombohedral graphene stacks by providing a symmetric lattice description of their low-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hidden singularities in correlated electron systems, which are caused by pair fluctuations of electron-electron or electron-hole bubbles obeying Bose-Einstein statistics, are clarified theoretically. The correlation function of each pair fluctuation is shown to have a bound in the zero Matsubara frequency branch, similarly to the chemical potential of ideal Bose gases. Once the bound is reached, the self-energy starts to acquire a component proportional to Green's function itself, i.e., the structure called one-particle reducible, to keep the correlation function within the bound. The singularities are closely related to, but distinct from, phase transitions with broken symmetries. Passing down through them is necessarily accompanied by a change in the single-particle density of states around the excitation threshold, such as the pseudogap behavior found here for the negative-$U$ Hubbard model above the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Enhancement, SPT Absorption, and Duality in QED$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions (QED$_3$) with two Dirac fermions displays time reversal symmetry, nontrivial SPT phases and anomalies. The fate of this theory in its strongly coupled regime has been debated extensively. Surprisingly, we find that gluing together the phase diagrams of two standard Wilson-Fisher $O(4)$ theories suffices to reproduce all the SPT phases, anomalies, and semi-classical limits. A central mechanism behind it is ``SPT absorption''. The patching of the $O(4)$ transitions makes very concrete predictions for the behavior of the theory in its strongly coupled limits; for instance, the $\theta=\pi$ sigma model with $S^3$ topology appears due to monopole condensation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum resources like entanglement and magic are essential for characterizing the complexity of quantum states. However, when the number of copies of quantum states and the computational time are limited by numbers polynomial in the system size $n$, accurate estimation of the amount of these resources becomes difficult. This makes it impossible to distinguish between ensembles of states with relatively small resources and one that has nearly maximal resources. Such ensembles with small resources are referred to as "pseudo-quantum" ensembles. Recent studies have introduced an ensemble known as the random subset phase state ensemble, which is pseudo-entangled, pseudo-magical, and pseudorandom. While the current state-of-the-art implementation of this ensemble is conjectured to be realized by a circuit with $O(nt)$ depth, it is still too deep for near-term quantum devices to execute for small $t$. In addition, the strict linear dependence on $t$ has only been established as a lower bound on the circuit depth. In this work, we present significantly improved implementations that only require $\omega(\log n)\cdot O(t[\log t]^2)$ depth circuits, which almost saturates the theoretical lower bound. This is also the fastest known for generating pseudorandom states to the best of our knowledge. We believe that our findings will facilitate the implementation of pseudo-ensembles on near-term devices, allowing executions of tasks that would otherwise require ensembles with maximal quantum resources, by generating pseudo-ensembles at a super-polynomially fewer number of entangling and non-Clifford gates.</description>
