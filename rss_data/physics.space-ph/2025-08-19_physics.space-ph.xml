      <title>A Neural-Network Framework for Tracking and Identification of Cosmic-Ray Nuclei in the RadMap Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a neural-network framework designed to reconstruct the properties of cosmic-ray nuclei traversing the scintillating-fiber tracking calorimeter of the RadMap Telescope. Employing the Geant4 simulation toolkit and a simplified model of the detector to generate training and test data, we achieve the spectroscopic capabilities required for an accurate determination of the biologically relevant dose that astronauts receive in space. We can reconstruct a particle's trajectory with an angular resolution of better than $1.4^\circ$ and achieve a charge separation of better than $95\%$ for nuclei with $Z\leq8$; specifically, we reach an accuracy of $99.8\%$ for hydrogen. The energy resolution is $&lt;20\%$ for energies below 1 GeV/n and elements up to iron. We also discuss the limitations of our detector, the reconstruction framework, and this feasibility study, as well as possible improvements.</description>

      <title>Energy relaxation in superthermal collisions of carbon with oxygen: the influence of isotopic substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from a once-dense Martian atmosphere to the thin one observed today implies a substantial loss of carbon, either through atmospheric escape or surface deposition. Accurately modeling this carbon escape necessitates accounting for collisions between energetic carbon atoms and the primary atmospheric constituents, including oxygen. To this end, we computed a highly accurate and comprehensive set of potential energy curves (PECs) for the C($^3$P) + O($^3$P) system. Based on these PECs, we derived statistically averaged total elastic and differential cross sections. Comparison with literature data for O($^3$P) + O($^3$P) collisions reveals that cross sections involving carbon can differ by up to a factor of two, indicating that oxygen is not a good proxy for modeling carbon escape. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of all possible isotopic combinations in C($^3$P) + O($^3$P) collisions and found variations in cross sections of up to 8\%. Given the observed isotopic enrichment of carbon and oxygen in the Martian atmosphere, even such moderate differences can have a significant effect on escape models and the interpretation of planetary evolution.</description>

      <title>Energy Conversion and Electron Acceleration and Transport in 3D Simulations of Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations and simulations indicate that solar flares undergo extremely complex three-dimensional (3D) evolution, making 3D particle transport models essential for understanding electron acceleration and interpreting flare emissions. In this study, we investigate this problem by solving Parker's transport equation with 3D MHD simulations of solar flares. By examining energy conversion in the 3D system, we evaluate the roles of different acceleration mechanisms, including reconnection current sheet (CS), termination shock (TS), and supra-arcade downflows (SADs). We find that large-amplitude turbulent fluctuations are generated and sustained in the 3D system. The model results demonstrate that a significant number of electrons are accelerated to hundreds of keV and even a few MeV, forming power-law energy spectra. These energetic particles are widely distributed, with concentrations at the TS and in the flare looptop region, consistent with results derived from recent hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave (MW) observations. By selectively turning particle acceleration on or off in specific regions, we find that the CS and SADs effectively accelerate electrons to several hundred keV, while the TS enables further acceleration to MeV. However, no single mechanism can independently account for the significant number of energetic electrons observed. Instead, the mechanisms work synergistically to produce a large population of accelerated electrons. Our model provides spatially and temporally resolved electron distributions in the whole flare region and at the flare footpoints, enabling synthetic HXR and MW emission modeling for comparison with observations. These results offer important insights into electron acceleration and transport in 3D solar flare regions.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Dependence of Normalized Reconnection Rate on Upstream Plasma Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a multi-event study of the normalized reconnection rate integrating events spanning the three primary regimes of reconnection observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. We utilize a new method for determining the normalized reconnection rate with fewer sources of uncertainty by estimating the current sheet aspect ratio with magnetic field gradients, which are very well measured by MMS. This method is time-dependent and also captures spatiotemporal variation in the current sheet aspect ratio. After demonstrating this technique is valid in the guide field and asymmetric regimes of reconnection, we investigate any relationships between the normalized rate, aspect ratio, and spatiotemporal aspect ratio variability on the guide field, spatiotemporal variability of the upstream magnetic field, and upstream magnetic field and density asymmetry. We find no dependence of reconnection rate on upstream conditions, with the only statistically significant correlations between the spatiotemporal variability in the aspect ratio and the spatiotemporal angular variability in the upstream reconnecting component of the magnetic field. This result is consistent with previous work that found the spatiotemporal ``patchiness'' of energy conversion within the electron diffusion region is correlated with the same measure of spatiotemporal variability of the inflow magnetic field used here. Additionally, this analysis suggests that under typical magnetospheric conditions for density and magnetic field asymmetry with steady upstream magnetic field, the normalized reconnection rate is constant with a slight increase for higher guide fields, which may be significant in predicting the terrestrial effects of space weather by providing insight into the efficiency of solar wind-magnetospheric coupling.</description>

      <title>Direct High-Resolution Imaging of Earth-Like Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10 x 10 pixel map of a 1 R_E world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon-collection sufficient for SNR &gt;= 5 per "micro-pixel." We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external-starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based ELTs with extreme AO; (5) pupil-densified "hypertelescopes"; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); and (7) diffraction-occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals-exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization--each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the angular resolution and photon-budget thresholds needed to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in-situ platform delivered to &lt;= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits--but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens--providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once an imaging spacecraft reaches beyond &gt;=550 AU--appears uniquely capable of simultaneously meeting both the resolution and photon-budget requirements. The SGL thus enables true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood, provided several mission-specific risks (coronal calibration, focal-plane scanning, deconvolution) are retired.</description>
