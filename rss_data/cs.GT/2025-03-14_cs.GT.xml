      <title>Optimal Reward Allocation via Proportional Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the publication of Bitcoin's arguably most famous attack, selfish mining, various works have introduced mechanisms to enhance blockchain systems' game theoretic resilience. Some reward mechanisms, like FruitChains, have been shown to be equilibria in theory. However, their guarantees assume non-realistic parameters and their performance degrades significantly in a practical deployment setting. In this work we introduce a reward allocation mechanism, called Proportional Splitting (PRS), which outperforms existing state of the art. We show that, for large enough parameters, PRS is an equilibrium, offering the same theoretical guarantees as the state of the art. In addition, for practical, realistically small, parameters, PRS outperforms all existing reward mechanisms across an array of metrics. We implement PRS on top of a variant of PoEM, a Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol that enables a more accurate estimation of each party's mining power compared to e.g., Bitcoin. We then evaluate PRS both theoretically and in practice. On the theoretical side, we show that our protocol combined with PRS is an equilibrium and guarantees fairness, similar to FruitChains. In practice, we compare PRS with an array of existing reward mechanisms and show that, assuming an accurate estimation of the mining power distribution, it outperforms them across various well-established metrics. Finally, we realize this assumption by approximating the power distribution via low-work objects called "workshares" and quantify the tradeoff between the approximation's accuracy and storage overhead.</description>

      <title>Fair allocations with subadditive and XOS valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fair allocation of $m$ indivisible goods to $n$ agents with either subadditive or XOS valuations, in the arbitrary entitlement case. As fairness notions, we consider the anyprice share (APS) ex-post, and the maximum expectation share (MES) ex-ante.
  We observe that there are randomized allocations that ex-ante are at least $\frac{1}{2}$-MES in the subadditive case and $(1-\frac{1}{e})$-MES in the XOS case. Our more difficult results concern ex-post guarantees. We show that $(1 - o(1))\frac{\log\log m}{\log m}$-APS allocations exist in the subadditive case, and $\frac{1}{6}$-APS allocations exist in the XOS case. For the special case of equal entitlements, we show $\frac{4}{17}$-APS allocations for XOS.
  Our results are the first for subadditive and XOS valuations in the arbitrary entitlement case, and also improve over the previous best results for the equal entitlement case.</description>

      <title>Media and responsible AI governance: a game-theoretic and LLM analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex interplay between AI developers, regulators, users, and the media in fostering trustworthy AI systems. Using evolutionary game theory and large language models (LLMs), we model the strategic interactions among these actors under different regulatory regimes. The research explores two key mechanisms for achieving responsible governance, safe AI development and adoption of safe AI: incentivising effective regulation through media reporting, and conditioning user trust on commentariats' recommendation. The findings highlight the crucial role of the media in providing information to users, potentially acting as a form of "soft" regulation by investigating developers or regulators, as a substitute to institutional AI regulation (which is still absent in many regions). Both game-theoretic analysis and LLM-based simulations reveal conditions under which effective regulation and trustworthy AI development emerge, emphasising the importance of considering the influence of different regulatory regimes from an evolutionary game-theoretic perspective. The study concludes that effective governance requires managing incentives and costs for high quality commentaries.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Q-Learning Dynamics in Random Networks: Convergence due to Exploration and Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond specific settings, many multi-agent learning algorithms fail to converge to an equilibrium solution, and instead display complex, non-stationary behaviours such as recurrent or chaotic orbits. In fact, recent literature suggests that such complex behaviours are likely to occur when the number of agents increases. In this paper, we study Q-learning dynamics in network polymatrix games where the network structure is drawn from classical random graph models. In particular, we focus on the Erdos-Renyi model, a well-studied model for social networks, and the Stochastic Block model, which generalizes the above by accounting for community structures within the network. In each setting, we establish sufficient conditions under which the agents' joint strategies converge to a unique equilibrium. We investigate how this condition depends on the exploration rates, payoff matrices and, crucially, the sparsity of the network. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations and demonstrate that convergence can be reliably achieved in many-agent systems, provided network sparsity is controlled.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Preference Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI alignment, the challenge of ensuring AI systems act in accordance with human values, has emerged as a critical problem in the development of systems such as foundation models and recommender systems. Still, the current dominant approach, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) faces known theoretical limitations in aggregating diverse human preferences. Social choice theory provides a framework to aggregate preferences, but was not developed for the multidimensional applications typical of AI. Leveraging insights from a recently published urn process, this work introduces a preference aggregation strategy that adapts to the user's context and that inherits the good properties of the maximal lottery, a Condorcet-consistent solution concept.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibrium Constrained Auto-bidding With Bi-level Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many online advertising platforms provide advertisers with auto-bidding services to enhance their advertising performance. However, most existing auto-bidding algorithms fail to accurately capture the auto-bidding problem formulation that the platform truly faces, let alone solve it. Actually, we argue that the platform should try to help optimize each advertiser's performance to the greatest extent -- which makes $\epsilon$-Nash Equilibrium ($\epsilon$-NE) a necessary solution concept -- while maximizing the social welfare of all the advertisers for the platform's long-term value. Based on this, we introduce the \emph{Nash-Equilibrium Constrained Bidding} (NCB), a new formulation of the auto-bidding problem from the platform's perspective. Specifically, it aims to maximize the social welfare of all advertisers under the $\epsilon$-NE constraint. However, the NCB problem presents significant challenges due to its constrained bi-level structure and the typically large number of advertisers involved. To address these challenges, we propose a \emph{Bi-level Policy Gradient} (BPG) framework with theoretical guarantees. Notably, its computational complexity is independent of the number of advertisers, and the associated gradients are straightforward to compute. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the BPG framework.</description>

      <title>The Lagrangian Method for Solving Constrained Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the concept of a Lagrangian game to solve constrained Markov games. Such games model scenarios where agents face cost constraints in addition to their individual rewards, that depend on both agent joint actions and the evolving environment state over time. Constrained Markov games form the formal mechanism behind safe multiagent reinforcement learning, providing a structured model for dynamic multiagent interactions in a multitude of settings, such as autonomous teams operating under local energy and time constraints, for example. We develop a primal-dual approach in which agents solve a Lagrangian game associated with the current Lagrange multiplier, simulate cost and reward trajectories over a fixed horizon, and update the multiplier using accrued experience. This update rule generates a new Lagrangian game, initiating the next iteration. Our key result consists in showing that the sequence of solutions to these Lagrangian games yields a nonstationary Nash solution for the original constrained Markov game.</description>

      <title>Tightness without Counterexamples: A New Approach and New Results for Prophet Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00588v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities consist of many beautiful statements that establish tight performance ratios between online and offline allocation algorithms. Typically, tightness is established by constructing an algorithmic guarantee and a worst-case instance separately, whose bounds match as a result of some "ingenuity". In this paper, we instead formulate the construction of the worst-case instance as an optimization problem, which directly finds the tight ratio without needing to construct two bounds separately. Our analysis of this complex optimization problem involves identifying structure in a new "Type Coverage" dual problem. It can be seen as akin to the celebrated Magician and OCRS (Online Contention Resolution Scheme) problems, except more general in that it can also provide tight ratios relative to the optimal offline allocation, whereas the earlier problems only establish tight ratios relative to the ex-ante relaxation of the offline problem.
  Through this analysis, our paper provides a unified framework that derives new prophet inequalities and recovers existing ones, with our principal results being two-fold. First, we show that the "oblivious" method of setting a static threshold due to Chawla et al. (2020), surprisingly, is best-possible among all static threshold algorithms, under any number $k$ of starting units. We emphasize that this result is derived without needing to explicitly find any counterexample instances. This implies the tightness of the asymptotic convergence rate of $1-O(\sqrt{\log k/k})$ for static threshold algorithms, which dates back to from Hajiaghayi et al. (2007). Turning to the IID setting, our second principal result is to use our framework to characterize the tight guarantee (of adaptive algorithms) under any number $k$ of selection slots and any fixed number of agents $n$.</description>

      <title>The Price of Opportunity Fairness in Matroid Allocation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider matroid allocation problems under opportunity fairness constraints: resources need to be allocated to a set of agents under matroid constraints (which includes classical problems such as bipartite matching). Agents are divided into C groups according to a sensitive attribute, and an allocation is opportunity-fair if each group receives the same share proportional to the maximum feasible allocation it could achieve in isolation. We study the Price of Fairness (PoF), i.e., the ratio between maximum size allocations and maximum size opportunity-fair allocations. We first provide a characterization of the PoF leveraging the underlying polymatroid structure of the allocation problem. Based on this characterization, we prove bounds on the PoF in various settings from fully adversarial (wort-case) to fully random. Notably, one of our main results considers an arbitrary matroid structure with agents randomly divided into groups. In this setting, we prove a PoF bound as a function of the size of the largest group. Our result implies that, as long as there is no dominant group (i.e., the largest group is not too large), opportunity fairness constraints do not induce any loss of social welfare (defined as the allocation size). Overall, our results give insights into which aspects of the problem's structure affect the trade-off between opportunity fairness and social welfare.</description>

      <title>Optimal Security Response to Network Intrusions in IT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cybersecurity is one of the most pressing technological challenges of our time and requires measures from all sectors of society. A key measure is automated security response, which enables automated mitigation and recovery from cyber attacks. Significant strides toward such automation have been made due to the development of rule-based response systems. However, these systems have a critical drawback: they depend on domain experts to configure the rules, a process that is both error-prone and inefficient. Framing security response as an optimal control problem shows promise in addressing this limitation but introduces new challenges. Chief among them is bridging the gap between theoretical optimality and operational performance. Current response systems with theoretical optimality guarantees have only been validated analytically or in simulation, leaving their practical utility unproven.
  This thesis tackles the aforementioned challenges by developing a practical methodology for optimal security response in IT infrastructures. It encompasses two systems. First, it includes an emulation system that replicates key components of the target infrastructure. We use this system to gather measurements and logs, based on which we identify a game-theoretic model. Second, it includes a simulation system where game-theoretic response strategies are optimized through stochastic approximation to meet a given objective, such as mitigating potential attacks while maintaining operational services. These strategies are then evaluated and refined in the emulation system to close the gap between theoretical and operational performance. We prove structural properties of optimal response strategies and derive efficient algorithms for computing them. This enables us to solve a previously unsolved problem: demonstrating optimal security response against network intrusions on an IT infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Mean-Field Games with Function Approximation and Empirical Mean-Field Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent algorithms allow decentralised agents, possibly connected via a communication network, to learn equilibria in Mean-Field Games from a non-episodic run of the empirical system. However, these algorithms are for tabular settings: this computationally limits the size of agents' observation space, meaning the algorithms cannot handle anything but small state spaces, nor generalise beyond policies depending only on the agent's local state to so-called 'population-dependent' policies. We address this limitation by introducing function approximation to the existing setting, drawing on the Munchausen Online Mirror Descent method that has previously been employed only in finite-horizon, episodic, centralised settings. While this permits us to include the mean field in the observation for players' policies, it is unrealistic to assume decentralised agents have access to this global information: we therefore also provide new algorithms allowing agents to locally estimate the global empirical distribution, and to improve this estimate via inter-agent communication. We show theoretically that exchanging policy information helps networked agents outperform both independent and even centralised agents in function-approximation settings. Our experiments demonstrate this happening empirically, by an even greater margin than in tabular settings, and show that the communication network allows decentralised agents to estimate the mean field for population-dependent policies.</description>
