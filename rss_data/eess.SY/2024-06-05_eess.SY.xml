      <title>Unified Control of Voltage, Frequency and Angle in Electrical Power Systems: A Passivity and Negative-Imaginary based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a unified methodology for voltage regulation, frequency synchronization, and rotor angle control in power transmission systems considering a one-axis generator model with time-varying voltages. First, we formulate an output consensus problem with a passivity and negative-imaginary (NI) based control framework. We establish output consensus results for both networked passive systems and networked NI systems. Next, we apply the output consensus problem by controlling large-scale batteries co-located with synchronous generators -- using real-time voltage phasor measurements. By controlling the battery storage systems so as to dispatch real and reactive power, we enable simultaneous control of voltage, frequency, and power angle differences across a transmission network. Validation through numerical simulations on a four-area transmission network confirms the robustness of our unified control framework.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Control and State Estimation for Partially Observable Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Wasserstein distributionally robust control and state estimation algorithm for partially observable linear stochastic systems, where the probability distributions of disturbances and measurement noises are unknown. Our method consists of the control and state estimation phases to handle distributional ambiguities of system disturbances and measurement noises, respectively. Leveraging tools from modern distributionally robust optimization, we consider an approximation of the control problem with an arbitrary nominal distribution and derive its closed-form optimal solution. We show that the separation principle holds, thereby allowing the state estimator to be designed separately. A novel distributionally robust Kalman filter is then proposed as an optimal solution to the state estimation problem with Gaussian nominal distributions. Our key contribution is the combination of distributionally robust control and state estimation into a unified algorithm. This is achieved by formulating a tractable semidefinite programming problem that iteratively determines the worst-case covariance matrices of all uncertainties, leading to a scalable and efficient algorithm. Our method is also shown to enjoy a guaranteed cost property as well as a probabilistic out-of-sample performance guarantee. The results of our numerical experiments demonstrate the performance and computational efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent assignment via state augmented reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the conflicting requirements of a multi-agent assignment problem through constrained reinforcement learning, emphasizing the inadequacy of standard regularization techniques for this purpose. Instead, we recur to a state augmentation approach in which the oscillation of dual variables is exploited by agents to alternate between tasks. In addition, we coordinate the actions of the multiple agents acting on their local states through these multipliers, which are gossiped through a communication network, eliminating the need to access other agent states. By these means, we propose a distributed multi-agent assignment protocol with theoretical feasibility guarantees that we corroborate in a monitoring numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Leader-Follower Density Control of Spatial Dynamics in Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of controlling the density of a large ensemble of follower agents by acting on group of leader agents that interact with them. We formulate the problem as a system of coupled partial integro-differential equations describing for the dynamics of the leaders' and followers' densities. We define feasibility conditions and propose two control architectures for exponential global stability. The first architecture is a feed-forward scheme for the followers. It adjusts the leaders' density via a feedback loop, which leverages information about leaders and a fixed reference density, to direct followers towards a target distribution. The second, dual feedback strategy employs a reference-governor to dynamically adapt the leaders' reference density based on measurements on both leaders and followers. Initially analyzed in one dimension, our methods are expanded to multi-dimensional applications. Numerical validations and an application in continuification-based control of leader-follower multiagent systems confirm the effectiveness of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Windex: Realtime Neural Whittle Indexing for Scalable Service Guarantees in NextG Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the resource allocation challenges in NextG cellular radio access networks (RAN), where heterogeneous user applications demand guarantees on throughput and service regularity. We leverage the Whittle indexability property to decompose the resource allocation problem, enabling the independent computation of relative priorities for each user. By simply allocating resources in decreasing order of these indices, we transform the combinatorial complexity of resource allocation into a linear one. We propose Windex, a lightweight approach for training neural networks to compute Whittle indices, considering constraint violation, channel quality, and system load. Implemented on a real-time RAN intelligent controller (RIC), our approach enables resource allocation decision times of less than 20$\mu$s per user and efficiently allocates resources in each 1ms scheduling time slot. Evaluation across standardized 3GPP service classes demonstrates significant improvements in service guarantees compared to existing schedulers, validated through simulations and emulations with over-the-air channel traces on a 5G testbed.</description>

      <title>Development of Bayesian Component Failure Models in E1 HEMP Grid Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combined electric power system and High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) models are being developed to determine the effect of a HEMP on the US power grid. The work relies primarily on deterministic methods; however, it is computationally untenable to evaluate the E1 HEMP response of large numbers of grid components distributed across a large interconnection. Further, the deterministic assessment of these components' failures are largely unachievable. E1 HEMP laboratory testing of the components is accomplished, but is expensive, leaving few data points to construct failure models of grid components exposed to E1 HEMP. The use of Bayesian priors, developed using the subject matter expertise, combined with the minimal test data in a Bayesian inference process, provides the basis for the development of more robust and cost-effective statistical component failure models. These can be used with minimal computational burden in a simulation environment such as sampling of Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs).</description>

      <title>Fast networked data selection via distributed smoothed quantile estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collecting the most informative data from a large dataset distributed over a network is a fundamental problem in many fields, including control, signal processing and machine learning. In this paper, we establish a connection between selecting the most informative data and finding the top-$k$ elements of a multiset. The top-$k$ selection in a network can be formulated as a distributed nonsmooth convex optimization problem known as quantile estimation. Unfortunately, the lack of smoothness in the local objective functions leads to extremely slow convergence and poor scalability with respect to the network size. To overcome the deficiency, we propose an accelerated method that employs smoothing techniques. Leveraging the piecewise linearity of the local objective functions in quantile estimation, we characterize the iteration complexity required to achieve top-$k$ selection, a challenging task due to the lack of strong convexity. Several numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm and the correctness of the theory.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Relaxation based Non-Conservative Chance Constrained Stochastic MPC for Battery Scheduling Under Forecast Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chance constrained stochastic model predictive controllers (CC-SMPC) trade off full constraint satisfaction for economical plant performance under uncertainty. Previous CC-SMPC works are over-conservative in constraint violations leading to worse economic performance. Other past works require a-priori information about the uncertainty set, limiting their application to real-world systems. This paper considers a discrete linear time invariant system with hard constraints on inputs and chance constraints on states, with unknown uncertainty distribution, statistics, or samples. This work proposes a novel adaptive online update rule to relax the state constraints based on the time-average of past constraint violations, for the SMPC to achieve reduced conservativeness in closed-loop. Under an ideal control policy assumption, it is proven that the time-average of constraint violations converges to the maximum allowed violation probability. The time-average of constraint violations is also proven to asymptotically converge even without the simplifying assumptions. The proposed method is applied to the optimal battery energy storage system (BESS) dispatch in a grid connected microgrid with PV generation and load demand with chance constraints on BESS state-of-charge (SOC). Realistic simulations show the superior electricity cost saving potential of the proposed method as compared to the traditional MPC (with hard constraints on BESS SOC), by satisfying the chance constraints non-conservatively in closed-loop, thereby effectively trading off increased cost savings with minimal adverse effects on BESS lifetime.</description>

      <title>Electric Vehicle Adoption Modeling in France: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: France is one of the pioneer countries in the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs). The French government aims to complete the transition to EVs by 2040. Therefore, modeling related to the adoption of EVs is needed in order to determine the potential policies needed to achieve this goal. This modeling is based on a literature study to identify the factors and the causal relationship between those factors. The systematic literature review (SLR) analysis was performed on 20 journals selected based on PRISMA filtering. From this SLR analysis, five direct factors and four indirect factors were obtained which were then used as the basis for modeling. Based on the model developed, four balancing (B) loops and three reinforcing (R) loops were obtained. From the analysis, it was found that the advertising factor has a goal seeking structure, while the word of mouth, environmentally friendly image, and total cost of ownership factors have an S-shaped structure.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Carbon Footprint Tracing Methods in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the penetration of distributed energy resources (DER) and renewable energy sources (RES) increases, carbon footprint tracking requires more granular analysis results. Existing carbon footprint tracking methods focus on deterministic steady-state analysis where the high uncertainties of RES cannot be considered. Considering the deficiency of the existing deterministic method, this paper proposes two stochastic carbon footprint tracking methods to cope with the impact of RES uncertainty on load-side carbon footprint tracing. The first method introduces probabilistic analysis in the framework of carbon emissions flow (CEF) to provide a global reference for the spatial characteristic of the power system component carbon intensity distribution. Considering that the CEF network expands with the increasing penetration of DERs, the second method can effectively improve the computational efficiency over the first method while ensuring the computational accuracy on the large power systems. These proposed models are tested and compared in a synthetic 1004-bus test system in the case study to demonstrate the performance of the two proposed methods</description>

Abstract: Input-to-state stability (ISS) unifies the stability and robustness in one notion, and serves as a basis for broad areas of nonlinear control theory. In this contribution, we covered the most fundamental facts in the infinite-dimensional ISS theory with a stress on Lyapunov methods. We consider various applications given by different classes of infinite-dimensional systems. Finally, we discuss a Lyapunov-based small-gain theorem for stability analysis of an interconnection of two ISS systems.</description>

      <title>CityLight: A Universal Model Towards Real-world City-scale Traffic Signal Control Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is a promising low-cost measure to enhance transportation efficiency without affecting existing road infrastructure. While various reinforcement learning-based TSC methods have been proposed and experimentally outperform conventional rule-based methods, none of them has been deployed in the real world. An essential gap lies in the oversimplification of the scenarios in terms of intersection heterogeneity and road network intricacy. To make TSC applicable in urban traffic management, we target TSC coordination in city-scale high-authenticity road networks, aiming to solve the three unique and important challenges: city-level scalability, heterogeneity of real-world intersections, and effective coordination among intricate neighbor connections. Since optimizing multiple agents in a parameter-sharing paradigm can boost the training efficiency and help achieve scalability, we propose our method, CityLight, based on the well-acknowledged optimization framework, parameter-sharing MAPPO. To ensure the unified policy network can learn to fit large-scale heterogeneous intersections and tackle the intricate between-neighbor coordination, CityLight proposes a universal representation module that consists of two key designs: heterogeneous intersection alignment and neighborhood impact alignment for coordination. To further boost coordination, CityLight adopts neighborhood-integrated rewards to transition from achieving local optimal to global optimal. Extensive experiments on datasets with hundreds to tens of thousands of real-world intersections and authentic traffic demands validate the surprising effectiveness and generalizability of CityLight, with an overall performance gain of 11.66% and a 22.59% improvement in transfer scenarios in terms of throughput.</description>

      <title>Statistical Age of Information: A Risk-Aware Metric and Its Applications in Status Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age of information (AoI) is an effective measure to quantify the information freshness in wireless status update systems. It has been further validated that the peak AoI has the potential to capture the core characteristics of the aging process, and thus the average peak AoI is widely used to evaluate the long-term performance of information freshness. However, the average peak AoI is a risk-insensitive metric and therefore may not be well suited for evaluating critical status update services. Motivated by this concern, and following the spirit of entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) in the field of risk analysis, in this paper we present a concept, termed Statistical AoI, for providing a unified framework to guarantee various requirements of risk-sensitive status-update services with the demand on the violation probability of the peak age. In particular, as the constraint on the violation probability of the peak age varies from loose to strict, the statistical AoI evolves from the average peak AoI to the maximum peak AoI. We then investigate the statistical AoI minimization problem for status updates over wireless fading channels. It is interesting to note that the corresponding optimal sampling scheme varies from step to constant functions of the channel power gain with the peak age violation probability from one to zero. We also address the maximum statistical AoI minimization problem for multi-status updates with time division multiple access (TDMA), where longer transmission time can improve reliability but may also cause the larger age. By solving this problem, we derive the optimal transmission time allocation scheme. Numerical results show that our proposals can better satisfy the diverse requirements of various risk-sensitive status update services, and demonstrate the great potential of improving information freshness compared to baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Age of Trust (AoT): A Continuous Verification Framework for Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero Trust is a new security vision for 6G networks that emphasises the philosophy of never trust and always verify. However, there is a fundamental trade-off between the wireless transmission efficiency and the trust level, which is reflected by the verification interval and its adaptation strategy. More importantly, the mathematical framework to characterise the trust level of the adaptive verification strategy is still missing. Inspired by this vision, we propose a concept called age of trust (AoT) to capture the characteristics of the trust level degrading over time, with the definition of the time elapsed since the last verification of the target user's trust plus the initial age, which depends on the trust level evaluated at that verification. The higher the trust level, the lower the initial age. To evaluate the trust level in the long term, the average AoT is used. We then investigate how to find a compromise between average AoT and wireless transmission efficiency with limited resources. In particular, we address the bi-objective optimization (BOO) problem between average AoT and throughput over a single link with arbitrary service process, where the identity of the receiver is constantly verified, and we devise a periodic verification scheme and a Q-learning-based scheme for constant process and random process, respectively. We also tackle the BOO problem in a multiple random access scenario, where a trust-enhanced frame-slotted ALOHA is designed. Finally, the numerical results show that our proposals can achieve a fair compromise between trust level and wireless transmission efficiency, and thus have a wide application prospect in various zero-trust architectures.</description>

      <title>A Pipelined Memristive Neural Network Analog-to-Digital Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of high-speed, high-precision, and low-power mixed-signal systems, there is an ever-growing demand for accurate, fast, and energy-efficient analog-to-digital (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). Unfortunately, with the downscaling of CMOS technology, modern ADCs trade off speed, power and accuracy. Recently, memristive neuromorphic architectures of four-bit ADC/DAC have been proposed. Such converters can be trained in real-time using machine learning algorithms, to break through the speedpower-accuracy trade-off while optimizing the conversion performance for different applications. However, scaling such architectures above four bits is challenging. This paper proposes a scalable and modular neural network ADC architecture based on a pipeline of four-bit converters, preserving their inherent advantages in application reconfiguration, mismatch selfcalibration, noise tolerance, and power optimization, while approaching higher resolution and throughput in penalty of latency. SPICE evaluation shows that an 8-bit pipelined ADC achieves 0.18 LSB INL, 0.20 LSB DNL, 7.6 ENOB, and 0.97 fJ/conv FOM. This work presents a significant step towards the realization of large-scale neuromorphic data converters.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Enhanced Path Tracking and Autonomous Drifting through Direct Yaw Moment Control and Rear-Wheel-Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path tracking (PT) controllers capable of replicating race driving techniques, such as drifting beyond the limits of handling, have the potential of enhancing active safety in critical conditions. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach that integrates multiple actuation methods, namely four-wheel-steering, longitudinal tyre force distribution, and direct yaw moment control, to execute drifting when this is beneficial for PT in emergency scenarios. Simulation results of challenging manoeuvres, based on an experimentally validated vehicle model, highlight the substantial PT performance improvements brought by: i) vehicle operation outside the envelope enforced by the current generation of stability controllers; and ii) the integrated control of multiple actuators.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) formulation for preview-based traction control, which uses the information on the expected tire-road friction coefficient ahead to enhance the wheel slip control performance, in the context of connected vehicles with V2X features. Proof-of-concept experiments on an electric vehicle prototype highlight the real-time capability of the controller, and the wheel slip control performance improvement brought by the tire-road friction coefficient preview. Finally, an experimentally validated simulation model is used in sensitivity analyses, to evaluate the performance benefit of the preview-based controller for different dynamic characteristics (e.g., time constant and pure time delays) of the electric powertrains.</description>

      <title>Novel pre-emptive control solutions for V2X connected electric vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V2X technologies will become widespread in the next generation of passenger cars, and enable the development of novel vehicle control functionalities. Although a wide literature describes the energy efficiency benefits of V2X connectivity, e.g., in terms of vehicle speed profiling and platooning, there is a gap in the analysis of the potential of vehicle connectivity in enhancing the performance of active safety control systems. To highlight the impact vehicle connectivity could have on future active safety systems, this paper presents two novel control functions for connected vehicles, benefitting from the precise knowledge of the expected path and tire-road friction conditions ahead, as well as the current position of the ego vehicle. These functions, developed within recent and ongoing European projects, are: i) pre-emptive traction control; and ii) pre-emptive braking control.</description>

      <title>Computation-Aware Learning for Stable Control with Gaussian Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Gaussian Process (GP) dynamical model learning for robot control, particularly for systems constrained by computational resources like small quadrotors equipped with low-end processors, analyzing stability and designing a stable controller present significant challenges. This paper distinguishes between two types of uncertainty within the posteriors of GP dynamical models: the well-documented mathematical uncertainty stemming from limited data and computational uncertainty arising from constrained computational capabilities, which has been largely overlooked in prior research. Our work demonstrates that computational uncertainty, quantified through a probabilistic approximation of the inverse covariance matrix in GP dynamical models, is essential for stable control under computational constraints. We show that incorporating computational uncertainty can prevent overestimating the region of attraction, a safe subset of the state space with asymptotic stability, thus improving system safety. Building on these insights, we propose an innovative controller design methodology that integrates computational uncertainty within a second-order cone programming framework. Simulations of canonical stable control tasks and experiments of quadrotor tracking exhibit the effectiveness of our method under computational constraints.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Resonance in Strongly Coupled Inductor Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance coupling (MRC) is widely used for wireless power transfer (WPT) applications, but little work has explored how MRC phenomena could be exploited for sensing applications. This paper introduces, validates and evaluates the unique multi-resonant phenomena predicted by circuit theory for over-coupled inductive arrays, and presents eigen-formulae for calculating resonant frequencies and voltage modes within passively excited arrays. Finite-element simulations and experimental results demonstrate the validity of the multi-modal resonant principles for strongly-coupled inductor arrays. The results confirm the distinctive multi-modal resonant frequencies these arrays exhibit, corresponding to the specific magnetic excitation "modes" (comparable to vibrational modes in multi-degree-of-freedom systems). The theoretical and finite element models presented offer a framework for designing and optimizing novel inductive sensing arrays, capitalizing on the unique resonant effects of over-coupling and exploiting their potential magnetic field shaping.</description>

      <title>Dropout MPC: An Ensemble Neural MPC Approach for Systems with Learned Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are lately more and more often being used in the context of data-driven control, as an approximate model of the true system dynamics. Model Predictive Control (MPC) adopts this practise leading to neural MPC strategies. This raises a question of whether the trained neural network has converged and generalized in a way that the learned model encapsulates an accurate approximation of the true dynamic model of the system, thus making it a reliable choice for model-based control, especially for disturbed and uncertain systems. To tackle that, we propose Dropout MPC, a novel sampling-based ensemble neural MPC algorithm that employs the Monte-Carlo dropout technique on the learned system model. The closed loop is based on an ensemble of predictive controllers, that are used simultaneously at each time-step for trajectory optimization. Each member of the ensemble influences the control input, based on a weighted voting scheme, thus by employing different realizations of the learned system dynamics, neural control becomes more reliable by design. An additional strength of the method is that it offers by design a way to estimate future uncertainty, leading to cautious control. While the method aims in general at uncertain systems with complex dynamics, where models derived from first principles are hard to infer, to showcase the application we utilize data gathered in the laboratory from a real mobile manipulator and employ the proposed algorithm for the navigation of the robot in simulation.</description>

      <title>Motion Planning for Hybrid Dynamical Systems: Framework, Algorithm Template, and a Sampling-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the motion planning problem for the systems exhibiting both continuous and discrete behaviors, which we refer to as hybrid dynamical systems. Firstly, the motion planning problem for hybrid systems is formulated using the hybrid equation framework, which is general to capture most hybrid systems. Secondly, a propagation algorithm template is proposed that describes a general framework to solve the motion planning problem for hybrid systems. Thirdly, a rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) implementation of the proposed algorithm template is designed to solve the motion planning problem for hybrid systems. At each iteration, the proposed algorithm, called HyRRT, randomly picks a state sample and extends the search tree by flow or jump, which is also chosen randomly when both regimes are possible. Through a definition of concatenation of functions defined on hybrid time domains, we show that HyRRT is probabilistically complete, namely, the probability of failing to find a motion plan approaches zero as the number of iterations of the algorithm increases. This property is guaranteed under mild conditions on the data defining the motion plan, which include a relaxation of the usual positive clearance assumption imposed in the literature of classical systems. The motion plan is computed through the solution of two optimization problems, one associated with the flow and the other with the jumps of the system. The proposed algorithm is applied to an actuated bouncing ball system and a walking robot system so as to highlight its generality and computational features.</description>

      <title>High-speed odour sensing using miniaturised electronic nose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01904v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animals have evolved to rapidly detect and recognise brief and intermittent encounters with odour packages, exhibiting recognition capabilities within milliseconds. Artificial olfaction has faced challenges in achieving comparable results -- existing solutions are either slow; or bulky, expensive, and power-intensive -- limiting applicability in real-world scenarios for mobile robotics. Here we introduce a miniaturised high-speed electronic nose; characterised by high-bandwidth sensor readouts, tightly controlled sensing parameters and powerful algorithms. The system is evaluated on a high-fidelity odour delivery benchmark. We showcase successful classification of tens-of-millisecond odour pulses, and demonstrate temporal pattern encoding of stimuli switching with up to 60 Hz. Those timescales are unprecedented in miniaturised low-power settings, and demonstrably exceed the performance observed in mice. For the first time, it is possible to match the temporal resolution of animal olfaction in robotic systems. This will allow for addressing challenges in environmental and industrial monitoring, security, neuroscience, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Data-driven optimal prediction with control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the extension of the data-driven optimal prediction approach to the dynamical system with control. The optimal prediction is used to analyze dynamical systems in which the states consist of resolved and unresolved variables. The latter variables can not be measured explicitly. They may have smaller amplitudes and affect the resolved variables that can be measured. The optimal prediction approach recovers the averaged trajectories of the resolved variables by computing conditional expectations, while the distribution of the unresolved variables is assumed to be known. We consider such dynamical systems and introduce their additional control functions. To predict the targeted trajectories numerically, we develop a data-driven method based on the dynamic mode decomposition. The proposed approach takes the $\mathit{measured}$ trajectories of the resolved variables, constructs an approximate linear operator from the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, and reconstructs the $\mathit{averaged}$ trajectories of the same variables. It is demonstrated that the method is much faster than the Monte Carlo simulations and it provides a reliable prediction. We experimentally confirm the efficacy of the proposed method for two Hamiltonian dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: Drinking water is a vital resource for humanity, and thus, Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) are considered critical infrastructures in modern societies. The operation of WDNs is subject to diverse challenges such as water leakages and contamination, cyber/physical attacks, high energy consumption during pump operation, etc. With model-based methods reaching their limits due to various uncertainty sources, AI methods offer promising solutions to those challenges. In this work, we introduce a Python toolbox for complex scenario modeling \&amp; generation such that AI researchers can easily access challenging problems from the drinking water domain. Besides providing a high-level interface for the easy generation of hydraulic and water quality scenario data, it also provides easy access to popular event detection benchmarks and an environment for developing control algorithms.</description>

      <title>An Open and Reconfigurable User Interface to Manage Complex ROS-based Robotic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Robot Operating System (ROS) has significantly gained popularity among robotic engineers and researchers over the past five years, primarily due to its powerful infrastructure for node communication, which enables developers to build modular and large robotic applications. However, ROS presents a steep learning curve and lacks the intuitive usability of vendor-specific robotic Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Moreover, its modular and distributed nature complicates the control and monitoring of extensive systems, even for advanced users. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a highly adaptable and reconfigurable web-based GUI for intuitively controlling, monitoring, and configuring complex ROS-based robotic systems. The GUI leverages ROSBridge and roslibjs to ensure seamless communication with ROS systems via topics and services. Designed as a versatile platform, the GUI allows for the selective incorporation of modular features to accommodate diverse robotic systems and applications. An initial set of commonly used features in robotic applications is presented. To demonstrate its reconfigurability, the GUI was customized and tested for four industrial use cases, receiving positive feedback. The project's repository has been made publicly available to support the robotics community and lower the entry barrier for ROS in industrial applications.</description>

Abstract: The High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) represents a fourth-generation light source. This facility has made unprecedented advancements in accelerator technology, necessitating the development of new detectors to satisfy physical requirements such as single-photon resolution, large dynamic range, and high frame rates. Since 2016, the Institute of High Energy Physics has introduced the first user-experimental hybrid pixel detector, progressing to the fourth-generation million-pixel detector designed for challenging conditions, with the dual-threshold single-photon detector HEPS-Beijing PIXel (HEPS-BPIX) set as the next-generation target. HEPS-BPIX will employ the entirely new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) BP40 for pixel information readout. Data flow will be managed and controlled through readout electronics based on a two-tier Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) system: the Front-End Electronics (FEE) and the Input-Output Board (IOB) handle the fan-out for 12 ASICs, and the u4FCP is tasked with processing serial data on high-speed links, transferring pixel-level data to the back-end RTM and uTCA chassis, or independently outputting through a network port, enabling remote control of the entire detector. The new HEPS-BPIX firmware has undergone a comprehensive redesign and update to meet the electronic characteristics of the new chip and to improve the overall performance of the detector. We provide an overview of the core subunits of HEPS-BPIX, emphasizing the readout system, evaluating the new hardware and firmware, and highlighting some of its innovative features and characteristics.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Runtime Adaptation with Conformalized Neural Network Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to integrate real-time out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for neural network trajectory predictors, and to adapt the control strategy of a robot (e.g., a self-driving car or drone) to preserve safety while operating in OOD regimes. Specifically, we use a neural network ensemble to predict the trajectory for a dynamic obstacle (such as a pedestrian), and use the maximum singular value of the empirical covariance among the ensemble as a signal for OOD detection. We calibrate this signal with a small fraction of held-out training data using the methodology of conformal prediction, to derive an OOD detector with probabilistic guarantees on the false-positive rate of the detector, given a user-specified confidence level. During in-distribution operation, we use an MPC controller to avoid collisions with the obstacle based on the trajectory predicted by the neural network ensemble. When OOD conditions are detected, we switch to a reachability-based controller to guarantee safety under the worst-case actions of the obstacle. We verify our method in extensive autonomous driving simulations in a pedestrian crossing scenario, showing that our OOD detector obtains the desired accuracy rate within a theoretically-predicted range. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with real pedestrian data. We show improved safety and less conservatism in comparison with two state-of-the-art methods that also use conformal prediction, but without OOD adaptation.</description>

      <title>Applying Fine-Tuned LLMs for Reducing Data Needs in Load Profile Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for utilizing fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to minimize data requirements in load profile analysis, demonstrated through the restoration of missing data in power system load profiles. A two-stage fine-tuning strategy is proposed to adapt a pre-trained LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5, for missing data restoration tasks. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the fine-tuned model in accurately restoring missing data, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art specifically designed models such as BERT-PIN. Key findings include the importance of prompt engineering and the optimal utilization of fine-tuning samples, highlighting the efficiency of few-shot learning in transferring knowledge from general user cases to specific target users. Furthermore, the proposed approach demonstrates notable cost-effectiveness and time efficiency compared to training models from scratch, making it a practical solution for scenarios with limited data availability and computing resources. This research has significant potential for application to other power system load profile analysis tasks. Consequently, it advances the use of LLMs in power system analytics, offering promising implications for enhancing the resilience and efficiency of power distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Fuel-Optimal Collision Avoidance Maneuvers in Long-Term Encounters with Station-Keeping Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a sequential convex program method to compute fuel-optimal collision avoidance maneuvers for long-term encounters. The low-thrust acceleration model is used to account for the control, but the method can compute high-thrust maneuvers by increasing the maximum available acceleration. Dealing with the long-term conjunction poses additional challenges compared to the short-term problem because the encounter is not instantaneous. Thus, under the assumption of Gaussian statistics, the probability of collision is replaced by a simpler metric, the instantaneous probability of collision (IPoC) and a keep-out zone constraint is formulated as a continuous condition to be respected throughout the time frame of interest. The robustness of the solution is improved by introducing a constraint on the sensitivity of the IPoC. Furthermore, the collision avoidance problem is coupled with the classical station-keeping requirement for geostationary Earth orbit satellites and with a return to the nominal orbit condition for low Earth orbit satellites. Even though no guarantee is given for the recovery of the global optimum solution, numerical simulations in different orbital regimes show that the proposed approach can yield a local fuel-optimal solution with a run-time suitable for autonomous applications.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Energy Efficiency Modelling in Large-scale Networks: An Expert Knowledge and ML-based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy consumption of mobile networks poses a critical challenge. Mitigating this concern necessitates the deployment and optimization of network energy-saving solutions, such as carrier shutdown, to dynamically manage network resources. Traditional optimization approaches encounter complexity due to factors like the large number of cells, stochastic traffic, channel variations, and intricate trade-offs. This paper introduces the simulated reality of communication networks (SRCON) framework, a novel, data-driven modeling paradigm that harnesses live network data and employs a blend of machine learning (ML)- and expert-based models. These mix of models accurately characterizes the functioning of network components, and predicts network energy efficiency and user equipment (UE) quality of service for any energy carrier shutdown configuration in a specific network. Distinguishing itself from existing methods, SRCON eliminates the reliance on expensive expert knowledge, drive testing, or incomplete maps for predicting network performance. This paper details the pipeline employed by SRCON to decompose the large network energy efficiency modeling problem into ML and expert-based submodels. It demonstrates how, by embracing stochasticity, and carefully crafting the relationship between such submodels, the overall computational complexity can be reduced and prediction accuracy enhanced. Results derived from real network data underscore the paradigm shift introduced by SRCON, showcasing significant gains over a state-of-the art method used by a operator for network energy efficiency modeling. The reliability of this local, data-driven modeling of the network proves to be a key asset for network energy-saving optimization.</description>

      <title>Robust Safety-Critical Control for Systems with Sporadic Measurements and Dwell Time Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents extensions of control barrier function (CBF) theory to systems with disturbances wherein a controller only receives measurements infrequently and operates open-loop between measurements, while still satisfying state constraints. The paper considers both impulsive and continuous actuators, and models the actuators, measurements, disturbances, and timing constraints as a hybrid dynamical system. We then design an open-loop observer that bounds the worst-case uncertainty between measurements. We develop definitions of CBFs for both actuation cases, and corresponding conditions on the control input to guarantee satisfaction of the state constraints. We apply these conditions to simulations of a satellite rendezvous in an elliptical orbit and autonomous orbit stationkeeping.</description>

      <title>Impact of Dynamic Operating Envelopes on Distribution Network Hosting Capacity for Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The examination of the maximum number of electric vehicles (EVs) that can be integrated into the distribution network (DN) without causing any operational incidents has become increasingly crucial as EV penetration rises. This issue can be addressed by utilizing dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs), which are generated based on the grid status. While DOEs improve the hosting capacity of the DN for EVs (EV-HC) by restricting the operational parameters of the network, they also alter the amount of energy needed for charging each EV, resulting in a decrease in the quality of service (QoS). This study proposes a network-aware hosting capacity framework for EVs (EV-NAHC) that i) aims to assess the effects of DOEs on active distribution networks, ii) introduces a novel definition for HC and calculates the EV-NAHC based on the aggregated QoS of all customers. A small-scale Belgian feeder is utilized to examine the proposed framework. The results show a substantial increase in the EV-NAHC with low, medium, and high-daily charging energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Long-term usage of the off-grid photovoltaic system with lithium-ion battery-based energy storage system on high mountains: A case study in Payiun Lodge on Mt. Jade in Taiwan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy supply on high mountains remains an open issue since grid connection is unavailable. In the past, diesel generators with lead-acid battery energy storage systems (ESSs) are applied in most cases. Recently, photovoltaic (PV) system with lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery ESS is an appropriate method for solving this problem in a greener way. In 2016, an off-grid PV system with Li-ion battery ESS has been installed in Paiyun Lodge on Mt. Jade (the highest lodge in Taiwan). After operation for more than 7 years, the aging problem of the whole electric power system becomes a critical issue for long-term usage. In this work, a method is established for analyzing the massive energy data (over 7 million rows) and estimating the health of the Li-ion battery system, such as daily operation patterns as well as C-rate, temperature, and accumulated energy distributions. The accomplished electric power improvement project dealing with the power system aging is reported. Based on the long-term usage experience, a simple cost analysis model between lead-acid and Li-ion battery systems is built, explaining that the expensive Li-ion batteries can compete with the cheap lead-acid batteries for long-term usage on high mountains. This case study provides engineers and researchers a fundamental understanding of the long-term usage of off-grid PV ESSs and engineering on high mountains.</description>

      <title>How to discretize continuous state-action spaces in Q-learning: A symbolic control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Q-learning is widely recognized as an effective approach for synthesizing controllers to achieve specific goals. However, handling challenges posed by continuous state-action spaces remains an ongoing research focus. This paper presents a systematic analysis that highlights a major drawback in space discretization methods. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a symbolic model that represents behavioral relations, such as alternating simulation from abstraction to the controlled system. This relation allows for seamless application of the synthesized controller based on abstraction to the original system. Introducing a novel Q-learning technique for symbolic models, the algorithm yields two Q-tables encoding optimal policies. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that these Q-tables serve as both upper and lower bounds on the Q-values of the original system with continuous spaces. Additionally, the paper explores the correlation between the parameters of the space abstraction and the loss in Q-values. The resulting algorithm facilitates achieving optimality within an arbitrary accuracy, providing control over the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. The obtained results provide valuable insights for selecting appropriate learning parameters and refining the controller. The engineering relevance of the proposed Q-learning based symbolic model is illustrated through two case studies.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Population Games: A Tractable Intersection of Mean-Field Games and Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world large-scale decision problems, self-interested agents have individual dynamics and optimize their own long-term payoffs. Important examples include the competitive access to shared resources (e.g., roads, energy, or bandwidth) but also non-engineering domains like epidemic propagation and control. These problems are natural to model as mean-field games. Existing mathematical formulations of mean field games have had limited applicability in practice, since they require solving non-standard initial-terminal-value problems that are tractable only in limited special cases. In this letter, we propose a novel formulation, along with computational tools, for a practically relevant class of Dynamic Population Games (DPGs), which correspond to discrete-time, finite-state-and-action, stationary mean-field games. Our main contribution is a mathematical reduction of Stationary Nash Equilibria (SNE) in DPGs to standard Nash Equilibria (NE) in static population games. This reduction is leveraged to guarantee the existence of a SNE, develop an evolutionary dynamics-based SNE computation algorithm, and derive simple conditions that guarantee stability and uniqueness of the SNE. We provide two examples of applications: fair resource allocation with heterogeneous agents and control of epidemic propagation.

      <title>Temporal Difference Learning with Compressed Updates: Error-Feedback meets Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In large-scale distributed machine learning, recent works have studied the effects of compressing gradients in stochastic optimization to alleviate the communication bottleneck. These works have collectively revealed that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is robust to structured perturbations such as quantization, sparsification, and delays. Perhaps surprisingly, despite the surge of interest in multi-agent reinforcement learning, almost nothing is known about the analogous question: Are common reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms also robust to similar perturbations? We investigate this question by studying a variant of the classical temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm with a perturbed update direction, where a general compression operator is used to model the perturbation. Our work makes three important technical contributions. First, we prove that compressed TD algorithms, coupled with an error-feedback mechanism used widely in optimization, exhibit the same non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees as their SGD counterparts. Second, we show that our analysis framework extends seamlessly to nonlinear stochastic approximation schemes that subsume Q-learning. Third, we prove that for multi-agent TD learning, one can achieve linear convergence speedups with respect to the number of agents while communicating just $\tilde{O}(1)$ bits per iteration. Notably, these are the first finite-time results in RL that account for general compression operators and error-feedback in tandem with linear function approximation and Markovian sampling. Our proofs hinge on the construction of novel Lyapunov functions that capture the dynamics of a memory variable introduced by error-feedback.</description>

      <title>Dynamics Harmonic Analysis of Robotic Systems: Application in Data-Driven Koopman Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the use of harmonic analysis to decompose the state space of symmetric robotic systems into orthogonal isotypic subspaces. These are lower-dimensional spaces that capture distinct, symmetric, and synergistic motions. For linear dynamics, we characterize how this decomposition leads to a subdivision of the dynamics into independent linear systems on each subspace, a property we term dynamics harmonic analysis (DHA). To exploit this property, we use Koopman operator theory to propose an equivariant deep-learning architecture that leverages the properties of DHA to learn a global linear model of the system dynamics. Our architecture, validated on synthetic systems and the dynamics of locomotion of a quadrupedal robot, exhibits enhanced generalization, sample efficiency, and interpretability, with fewer trainable parameters and computational costs.</description>

      <title>Morphological Symmetries in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for studying and leveraging morphological symmetries in robotic systems. These are intrinsic properties of the robot's morphology, frequently observed in animal biology and robotics, which stem from the replication of kinematic structures and the symmetrical distribution of mass. We illustrate how these symmetries extend to the robot's state space and both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensor measurements, resulting in the equivariance of the robot's equations of motion and optimal control policies. Thus, we recognize morphological symmetries as a relevant and previously unexplored physics-informed geometric prior, with significant implications for both data-driven and analytical methods used in modeling, control, estimation and design in robotics. For data-driven methods, we demonstrate that morphological symmetries can enhance the sample efficiency and generalization of machine learning models through data augmentation, or by applying equivariant/invariant constraints on the model's architecture. In the context of analytical methods, we employ abstract harmonic analysis to decompose the robot's dynamics into a superposition of lower-dimensional, independent dynamics. We substantiate our claims with both synthetic and real-world experiments conducted on bipedal and quadrupedal robots. Lastly, we introduce the repository MorphoSymm to facilitate the practical use of the theory and applications outlined in this work.</description>

      <title>SLS-BRD: A system-level approach to seeking generalised feedback Nash equilibria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a policy learning algorithm for seeking generalised feedback Nash equilibria in $N_P$-players non-cooperative dynamic games. We consider linear-quadratic games with stochastic dynamics and design a best-response dynamics in which players update and communicate a parametrisation of their state-feedback policies. Our approach leverages the System Level Synthesis framework to formulate each player's update rule as the solution to a tractable robust optimisation problem. Under certain conditions, rates of convergence to a feedback Nash equilibrium can be established. The algorithm is showcased in exemplary problems ranging from the decentralised control of unstable systems to competition in oligopolistic markets.</description>

      <title>An excursion onto Schr\"odinger's bridges: Stochastic flows with spatio-temporal marginals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of the present work is to expand substantially the type of control and estimation problems that can be addressed following the paradigm of Schr\"odinger bridges, by incorporating termination (killing) of stochastic flows. Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication and position sensing are among the most important capabilities for swarm robots to interact with their peers and perform tasks collaboratively. However, the hardware required to facilitate communication and position sensing is often too complicated, expensive, and bulky to be carried on swarm robots. Here we present Maneuverable Piccolissimo 3 (MP3), a minimalist, single motor drone capable of executing inter-robot communication via infrared light and triangulation-based sensing of relative bearing, distance, and elevation using message arrival time. Thanks to its novel design, MP3 can communicate with peers and localize itself using simple components, keeping its size and mass small and making it inherently safe for human interaction. We present the hardware and software design of MP3 and demonstrate its capability to localize itself, fly stably, and maneuver in the environment using peer-to-peer communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.</description>
