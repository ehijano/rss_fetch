      <title>Randomness with constraints: constructing minimal models for high-dimensional biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biologists and physicists have a rich tradition of modeling living systems with simple models composed of a few interacting components. Despite the remarkable success of this approach, it remains unclear how to use such finely tuned models to study complex biological systems composed of numerous heterogeneous, interacting components. One possible strategy for taming this biological complexity is to embrace the idea that many biological behaviors we observe are ``typical'' and can be modeled using random systems that respect biologically-motivated constraints. Here, we review recent works showing how this approach can be used to make close connection with experiments in biological systems ranging from neuroscience to ecology and evolution and beyond. Collectively, these works suggest that the ``random-with-constraints'' paradigm represents a promising new modeling strategy for capturing experimentally observed dynamical and statistical features in high-dimensional biological data and provides a powerful minimal modeling philosophy for biology.</description>

      <title>Applying a Gaussian networking theory to model motor-driven transport along cytoskeletal filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper builds on a recently introduced dynamical networking framework, applying it to model motor-driven transport along cytoskeletal filament networks. Within this approach, the networking functional describes the periodic binding and unbinding of motors to available filament sites,whilst accounting for all possible pairing, enabling a field-theoretic treatment of constrained motion in complex networks. In this application, the dynamical networking theory is introduced into a Martin-Siggia-Rose representation of the Langevin dynamics describing the motion of a motor protein and its cargo. Results are presented in a collective description of motors on a network, for two different scenarios, namely homogeneous and non-homogeneous networks. A diffusion coefficient is presented for homogeneous networks, whilst it is shown that various possibilities remain for disordered averaging over network densities for non-homogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>Optimal rate-variance coding due to firing threshold adaptation near criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrently connected neuron populations play key roles in sensory perception and memory storage across various brain regions. While these populations are often assumed to encode information through firing rates, this method becomes unreliable with weak stimuli. We propose that in such cases, information can be transmitted via spatial spike patterns, employing a sparse or combinatorial coding based on firing rate variance. Around the critical point of a stochastic recurrent excitable network, we uncover a synergistic dual-coding scheme, enabled by single-cell threshold adaptation. This scheme optimizes variance coding for weak signals without compromising rate coding for stronger inputs, thus maximizing input/output mutual information. These optimizations are robust across adaptation rules and coupling strengths through self-suppression of internal noise, particularly around the network's phase transition, and are linked to threshold recovery times observed in hippocampal memory circuits (~$10^2$-$10^3$ms). In contrast, nonadaptive networks perform similarly only at criticality, suggesting that threshold adaptation is essential for reliable encoding of weak signals into diverse spatial patterns. Our results imply a fundamental role for near-critical latent adaptive dynamics enabled by dual coding in biological and artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Control of lumen morphology by lateral and basal cell surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across development, the morphology of fluid-filled lumina enclosed by epithelial tissues arises from an interplay of lumen pressure, mechanics of the cell cortex, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we explore the mechanical basis for the control of this interplay using the shape space of MDCK cysts and the instability of their apical surfaces under tight junction perturbations [Mukenhirn et al., Dev. Cell 59, 2886 (2024)]. We discover that the cysts respond to these perturbations by significantly modulating their lateral and basal tensions, in addition to the known modulations of pressure and apical belt tension. We develop a mean-field three-dimensional vertex model of these cysts that reproduces the experimental shape instability quantitatively. This reveals that the observed increase of lateral contractility is a cellular response that counters the instability. Our work thus shows how regulation of the mechanics of all cell surfaces conspires to control lumen morphology.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of binding three independent ligands to a single scaffold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note considers a system in which three ligands can independently bind to a scaffold. Such systems arise in diverse applications, including immunotherapy and synthetic biology. It is shown that there are unique steady states in each conservation class, and these are asymptotically stable. The dependency of the steady-state amount of fully bound complex, as a function of total scaffold, is analyzed as well.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorem and optimal control of an active tracking particle with information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems often function with regulatory interactions, but the question of how activity, stochasticity and regulations work together for achieving different goals still remains puzzling. We propose the model of an active tracking particle with information processing, based on which the entropy production, information flow, and generalised fluctuation theorem are derived. Moreover, the system performance, in terms of the first passage steps and the total energy consumption, are analysed in the variable space of (measurement error, control field), leading to discussions on the optimal control of the system. Not only elucidating the basic concepts involved in a stochastic active system with information processing, this prototypical model could also inspire more elaborated modelings of natural smart organisms and industrial designs of controllable active systems with desired physical performances in the future.</description>
