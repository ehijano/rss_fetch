      <title>The Stationary Behavior of Reflecting Coupled Brownian Motions with Applications to Shortest Remaining Processing Time Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the objective of characterizing the stationary behavior of the scaling limit for shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) queues with a heavy-tailed processing time distribution, as obtained in Banerjee, Budhiraja, and Puha (BBP, 2022), we study reflecting coupled Brownian motions (RCBM) $(W_t(a), a, t \geq 0)$. These RCBM arise by regulating coupled Brownian motions (CBM) $(\chi_t(a), a,t \geq 0)$ to remain nonnegative. Here, for $t\geq 0$, $\chi_t(0)=0$ and $\chi_t(a):=w(a)+\sigma B_t-\mu(a)t$ for $a&gt;0$, $w(\cdot)$ is a suitable initial condition, $\sigma$ is a positive constant, $B$ is a standard Brownian motion, and $\mu(\cdot)$ is an unbounded, positive, strictly decreasing drift function. In the context of the BBP (2022) scaling limit, the drift function is determined by the model parameters, and, for each $a\geq 0$, $W_{\cdot}(a)$ represents the scaling limit of the amount of work in the system of size $a$ or less. Thus, for the BBP (2022) scaling limit, the time $t$ values of the RCBM describe the random distribution of the size of the remaining work in the system at time $t$. Our principal results characterize the stationary distribution of the RCBM in terms of a maximum process $M_*(\cdot)$ associated with CBM starting from zero. We obtain an explicit representation for the finite-dimensional distributions of $M_*(\cdot)$ and a simple formula for its covariance. We further show that the RCBM converge in distribution to $M_*(\cdot)$ as time $t$ approaches infinity. From this, we deduce the stationary behavior of the BBP (2022) scaling limit, including obtaining an integral expression for the stationary queue length in terms of the associated maximum process. While its distribution appears somewhat complex, we compute the mean and variance explicitly, and we connect with the work of Lin, Wierman, and Zwart (2011) to offer an illustration of Little's Law.</description>

      <title>Graphon particle system with common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonlinear graphon particle system driven by both idiosyncratic and common noise, where interactions are governed by a graphon and represented as positive finite measures. Each particle evolves via a McKean-Vlasov-type SDE with graphon-weighted conditional laws. We prove a law of large numbers for the empirical and interaction measures, using generalized Wasserstein metrics and weak convergence techniques suited for the non-Markovian structure induced by common noise.</description>

      <title>On one-dimensional Cluster cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cluster-cluster model was introduced by Meakin et al in 1984. Each $x\in \mathbb{Z}^d$ starts with a cluster of size 1 with probability $p \in (0,1]$ independently. Each cluster $C$ performs a continuous-time SRW with rate $|C|^{-\alpha}$. If it attempts to move to a vertex occupied by another cluster, it does not move, and instead the two clusters connect via a new edge. Focusing on dimension $d=1$, we show that for $\alpha&gt;-2$, at time $t$, the cluster size is of order $t^\frac{1}{\alpha + 2}$, and for $\alpha &lt; -2$ we get an infinite cluster in finite time a.s. Additionally, for $\alpha = 0$ we show convergence in distribution of the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Fading Memory Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the exponentially fading memory (EFM) signature, a time-invariant transformation of an infinite (possibly rough) path that serves as a mean-reverting analogue of the classical path signature. We construct the EFM-signature via rough path theory, carefully adapted to accommodate improper integration from minus infinity. The EFM-signature retains many of the key algebraic and analytical properties of classical signatures, including a suitably modified Chen identity, the linearization property, path-determinacy, and the universal approximation property. From the probabilistic perspective, the EFM-signature provides a "stationarized" representation, making it particularly well-suited for time-series analysis and signal processing overcoming the shortcomings of the standard signature. In particular, the EFM-signature of time-augmented Brownian motion evolves as a group-valued Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We establish its stationarity, Markov property, and exponential ergodicity in the Wasserstein distance, and we derive an explicit formula \`a la Fawcett for its expected value in terms of Magnus expansions. We also study linear combinations of EFM-signature elements and the computation of associated characteristic functions in terms of a mean-reverting infinite dimensional Riccati equation.</description>

      <title>Perturbative renormalisation of the $\Phi^4_{4-\varepsilon}$ model via generalized Wick maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the perturbative renormalisation of the $\Phi^4_d$ model from Euclidean Quantum Field Theory for any, possibly non-integer dimension $d&lt;4$. The so-called BPHZ renormalisation, named after Bogoliubov, Parasiuk, Hepp and Zimmermann, is usually encoded into extraction-contraction operations on Feynman diagrams, which have a complicated combinatorics. We show that the same procedure can be encoded in the much simpler algebra of polynomials in two unknowns $X$ and $Y$, which represent the fourth and second Wick power of the field. In this setting, renormalisation takes the form of a \lq\lq Wick map\rq\rq\ which maps monomials into Bell polynomials. The construction makes use of recent results by Bruned and Hou on multiindices, which are algebraic objects of intermediate complexity between Feynman diagrams and polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Supermarket Model on a Dynamic Regular Hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supermarket model is a system of $n$ queues each with serving rates $1$ and arrival rates $\lambda$ per vertex, where tasks will move on arrival to the shortest adjacent queue. We consider the supermarket model in the small $\lambda$ regime on a large dynamic configuration hypergraph with stubs swapping their hyperedge membership at rate $\kappa$.
  This interpolates previous investigations of the supermarket model on static graphs of bounded degree (where an exponential tail produces a logarithmic queue) and with independently drawn neighbourhoods (where the ``power of two choices'' phenomenon is a doubly logarithmic queue). We find with high probability, over any polynomial timeframe, the order of the longest queue is \[ \log\log n + \frac{\log n}{\log \kappa} \wedge \log n \] so in the sense of controlling the order of maximal queue length, we identify which speed orders are sufficiently fast that there is no gain in moving the environment faster. Additional results describe mixing of the system and propagation of chaos over time.</description>

      <title>Crossings and diffusion in Poisson driven marked random connection models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to stochastic homogenization, we study crossing statistics in random connection models built on marked Poisson point processes on $\mathbb R^d$. Under general assumptions, we show exponential tail bounds for the number of crossings of a box contained in the infinite cluster for supercritical intensity of the point process. This entails the non-degeneracy of the homogenized diffusion matrix arising in random walks, exclusion processes, diffusions and other models on the RCM. As examples, we apply our result to Poisson-Boolean models and Mott variable range hopping random resistor network, providing a fundamental ingredient used in the derivation of Mott's law. The proof relies on adaptations of Tanemura's growth process, the Duminil-Copin, Kozma and Tassion seedless renormalisation scheme, Chebunin and Last's uniqueness, as well as new ideas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of $d$-dimensional stochastic differential equations that model a non-colliding random particle system. We provide a sufficient condition, which does not depend on the dimension $d$, for the existence of negative moments of the gap between two particles, and then apply this result to study the strong rate of convergence of the semi-implicit Euler-Maruyama approximation scheme. Our finding improves a recent result of Ngo and Taguchi (Annals of Applied Probability, 2020).</description>

      <title>Divergence-Kernel method for scores of random systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the scores of random dynamical systems, then formally pass to the continuous-time limit of SDEs. Our formula works for multiplicative noise systems over any period of time; it does not require hyperbolicity. We also consider several special cases: (1) for additive noise, we give a pure kernel formula; (2) for short-time, we give a pure divergence formula; (3) we give a formula which does not involve scores of the initial distribution. Based on the new formula, we derive a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm for scores, and demonstrate it on the 40-dimensional Lorenz 96 system with multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>Effective Gaps between singular values of non-stationary matrix products subject to non-degenerate noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the singular values and Lyapunov exponents of non-stationary random matrix products subject to small, absolutely continuous, additive noise. Consider a fixed sequence of matrices of bounded norm. Independently perturb the matrices by additive noise distributed according to Lebesgue measure on matrices with norm less than $\epsilon$. Then the gaps between the log of the singular values of the random product of $n$ of these matrices is of order $\epsilon^2n$ in expectation, and almost surely the gap grows like $\epsilon^2n$.</description>

      <title>Parallel spin wave for the Villain model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Villain model in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$. It is conjectured, that the parallel correlation function in the infinite volume Gibbs state, i.e., the map
  $$
  x \mapsto \langle \cos\theta(0) \cos\theta(x) \rangle_{\mu_{\mathrm{Vil}, \beta}} -\left( \langle \cos\theta(0) \rangle_{\mu_{\mathrm{Vil}, \beta}} \right)^2,
  $$
  decays like $|x|^{-2(d-2)}$ as $|x| \to \infty$ at low temperature. The results of Bricmont, Fontaine, Lebowitz, Lieb, and Spencer (1981) show that for the related XY model, this correlation decays at least as fast as $|x|^{2-d}$. We prove the optimal upper and lower bounds for the Villain model in $d=3$, up to a logarithmic correction, and also improve the upper bound in general dimensions.
  Our proof builds upon the approach developed in our previous article, which in turn is inspired by a key observation of Fr\"{o}hlich and Spencer (1982): in the low temperature regime, a combination of duality transformation and renormalisation allows certain properties of the Villain model to be analysed in terms of a (vector-valued) $\nabla \varphi$ interface model. This latter model can be investigated using the Helffer-Sj\"{o}strand representation formula combined with tools of elliptic and parabolic regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the persistence probabilities of a moving average process of order one with uniform innovations. We identify a number of regions, characterized by the location of the uniform distribution and the coupling parameter of the process, where the persistence probabilities have qualitatively different behaviour. We obtain the generating functions of the persistence probabilities explicitly in all possible regions. In some of the regions, the persistence probabilities can be expressed explicitly in terms of various combinatorial quantities.</description>

      <title>Heights of butterfly trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary search trees (BSTs) are fundamental data structures whose performance is largely governed by tree height. We introduce a block model for constructing BSTs by embedding internal BSTs into the nodes of an external BST -- a structure motivated by parallel data architectures -- corresponding to composite permutations formed via Kronecker or wreath products. Extending Devroye's result that the height $h_n$ of a random BST satisfies $h_n / \log n \to c^* \approx 4.311$, we show that block BSTs with $nm$ nodes and fixed external size $m$ satisfy $h_{n,m} / \log n \to c^* + h_m$ in distribution. We then analyze height growth under iterated products. For simple butterfly trees (from iterated Kronecker products of $S_2$), we give a full distributional description showing polynomial height growth: $\mathbb{E} h_n^{\operatorname{B}} = \Theta(N^\alpha)$ with $\alpha \approx 0.58496$. For nonsimple butterfly trees (from wreath products), we prove power-law bounds: $cN^\alpha\cdot (1 + o(1)) \le \mathbb{E} h_n^{\operatorname{B}} \le dN^\beta\cdot (1 + o(1))$, with $\beta \approx 0.913189$.</description>

      <title>Boundary contacts for reflected random walks in the quarter plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate reflected random walks in the quarter plane, with particular emphasis on the time spent along the reflection boundary axes. Assuming the drift of the random walk lies within the cone, the local time converges -- without the need for normalization -- to a limiting random variable as the walk length tends to infinity. This paper focuses on the properties of these discrete limiting variables. The problem is rooted in probability theory but also has natural connections to statistical physics and analytic combinatorics. We present two main sets of results, each based on different assumptions regarding the random walk parameters. First, when the reflections on the horizontal and vertical boundaries are assumed to be similar, we reveal the recursive structure of the problem through a coupling approach. Second, in the case of more general reflection rules but singular random walks, we derive an explicit closed-form expression for the limiting distribution using the compensation approach. Our results are illustrated via concrete computations on various examples.</description>

      <title>Critical Point Processes Obtained from a Gaussian Random Field with a View Towards Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for statistical applications of an intriguing new type of spatial point processes called critical point processes. These point processes, residing in Euclidean space, consist of the critical points of latent smooth Gaussian random fields or of subsets of critical points like minima, saddle points etc. Despite of the simplicity of their definition, the mathematical analysis of critical point processes is non-trivial involving for example deep results on the geometry of random fields, Sobolev space theory, chaos expansions, and multiple Wiener-It{\^o} integrals. We provide explicit expressions for fundamental moment characteristics used in spatial point process statistics like the intensity parameter, the pair correlation function, and higher order intensity functions. The crucial dependence structure (attraction or repulsiveness) of a critical point process is discussed in depth and is in particular related to the dimension of the points and the type of critical points (extrema, saddle points, or all of the critical points). We propose simulation strategies based on spectral methods or smoothing of grid-based simulations and show that resulting approximate critical point process simulations asymptotically converge to the exact critical point process distribution. Finally, under the increasing domain framework, we obtain asymptotic results for linear and bilinear statistics of a critical point process. In particular, we obtain a multivariate central limit theorem for the intensity parameter estimate and a modified version of Ripley's K-function.</description>

      <title>Contact process with viral load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce two new variants of the contact process. In the first variant, instead of just being infected, individuals carry a viral load, indicating how severe the infection is. If the viral load reaches zero, an individual is considered to be healthy and if an individual becomes infected, a viral load of 1 is assigned that evolves according to a Birth-Death process. Thus, in this model, individuals with a higher viral load are more infectious, and the recovery times, are in most cases, not exponentially distributed. In fact, they can be chosen to be distributed according to a power-law distribution. For this model, we study the phase transition of survival and of an existing non-trivial upper invariant law. In the case where the infection rate is constant, that is, it does not depend on the viral load, we derive a duality relation to another new variant, where individuals are always infected and never truly healthy. They are either actively infected or the infection is in a dormant state, which is again modelled by a Birth-Death process. A dormant infection can re-emerge on its own or through an infection of an actively infected neighbour.</description>

      <title>Fractional Bessel Process with Constant Drift: Spectral Analysis and Queueing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fractional Bessel process with constant negative drift, defined as a time-changed Bessel process via the inverse of a stable subordinator, independent of the base process. This construction yields a model capable of capturing subdiffusive behavior and long-range dependence, relevant in various complex systems. We derive an explicit spectral representation of its transition density, extending the non-fractional setting. Using this representation, we establish several analytical properties of the process, including its stationary distribution and correlation structure. These results provide new insights into the behavior of fractional diffusions and offer analytical tools for applications in queueing theory, mathematical finance, and related domains. In particular, we demonstrate their applicability through a concrete problem in queueing theory.</description>

      <title>Local limit of Prim's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local evolution of Prim's algorithm on large finite weighted graphs. When performed for $n$ steps, where $n$ is the size of the graph, Prim's algorithm will construct the minimal spanning tree (MST). We assume that our graphs converge locally in probability to some limiting rooted graph. In that case, Aldous and Steele already proved that the local limit of the MST converges to a limiting object, which can be thought of as the MST on the limiting infinite rooted graph.
  Our aim is to investigate {\em how} the local limit of the MST is reached \textit{dynamically}. For this, we take $tn+o(n)$ steps of Prim, for $t\in[0,1]$, and, under some reasonable assumptions, show how the local structure interpolates between performing Prim's algorithm on the local limit when $t=0$, to the full local limit of the MST for $t=1$. Our proof relies on the use of the recently developed theory of {\em dynamic local convergence}. We further present several examples for which our assumptions, and thus our results, apply.</description>

      <title>A Discretization Scheme for BSDEs with Random Time Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a natural extension of the backward Euler approximation for a class of BSDEs with Lipschitz generators and random (unbounded) time horizons. We derive strong error bounds in terms of the underlying stepsize; the distance between the continuous terminal time and a discrete-time approximation; the distance between the terminal condition and a respective approximation; and an integrated distance depending on an approximation of the time component of the generator - all are scaled by the exponential of the maximal terminal time. As application we consider decoupled FBSDEs on bounded domains. We use an Euler-Maruyama scheme to approximate the diffusion and further refine our error bounds to only depend on the distance of the exit times.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the L\'evy-driven stochastic heat equation on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic heat equation on the sphere driven by additive L\'evy random field is approximated by a spectral method in space and forward and backward Euler-Maruyama schemes in time, in analogy to the Wiener case. New regularity results are proven for the stochastic heat equation. The spectral approximation is based on a truncation of the series expansion with respect to the spherical harmonic functions. To do so, we restrict to square-integrable random field and optimal strong convergence rates for a given regularity of the initial condition and two different settings of regularity for the driving noise are derived for the Euler-Maruyama methods. Besides strong convergence, convergence of the expectation and second moment is shown. Weak rates for the spectral approximation are discussed. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Doob's type optional sampling theorems and a central limit theorem for demimartingales with applications to associated sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends classical probabilistic results to the broader class of demimartingales and demisubmartingales. We establish variants of Doob's-type optional sampling theorem under minimal structural conditions on stopping times, relying on monotonicity properties of indicator functions. Building on these foundations, we derive maximal inequalities, moment bounds, and a concentration inequality of Azuma- Hoeffding type for demimartingales with bounded increments. A central limit theorem and a strong law of large numbers are also obtained for demimartingales, demonstrating convergence under conditions considerably weaker than those required for martingales or independent sequences. These results are then applied to partial sums of positively associated random variables, yielding expectation bounds, concentration inequalities, and exponential bounds without requiring covariance decay or truncation arguments. The paper concludes with a strong law of large numbers for associated random variables, established under very mild conditions, highlighting the power of the demimartingale framework in handling dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible bandwidth needlets provide a localized multiscale framework with scale-adaptive frequency resolution, enabling effective analysis of spherical Poisson random fields exhibiting spatial inhomogeneity and scale variation. We establish here quantitative Central Limit Theorems for finite-dimensional distributions of spherical Poisson needlets and for the related Poisson needlet coefficients constructed via needlets with shrinking bandwidth on the sphere, and using Stein-Malliavin techniques, we derive explicit rates of normal approximation. In addition, we study the functional convergence of the associated needlet-based random fields. Indeed, our framework provides quantitative control on the limiting behavior in appropriate function spaces. Together, these results offer rigorous probabilistic guarantees for high-resolution spherical data modeling under Poisson sampling.</description>

      <title>A tightness criterion for fragmentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note presents a simple criterion for the tightness of stochastic fragmentation processes. Our work is motivated by an application to a fragmentation process derived from deleting edges in a conditioned Galton-Watson tree studied by Berzunza-Ojeda and Holmgren (2023). In that paper, while finite-dimensional convergence was established, the claimed functional convergence relied on Lemma 22 of Broutin and Marckert (2016), which is unfortunately incorrect. We show how our results can correct the proof of Berzunza-Ojeda and Holmgren (2023).
  Furthermore, we show the applicability of our results by establishing tightness for fragmentation processes derived from various random tree models previously studied in the literature, such as Cayley trees, trees with specified degree sequences, and $\mathbf{p}$-trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the correlation of analytic functions of general Gaussian fields in terms of multigraphs and Feynman diagrams on the lattice Z^d. Then, we connect its scaling limit to tensors of the correlation functionals of Fock space fields. Afterwards, we investigate the relation with fermionic Gaussian field states for even functions. For instance, we characterize the correlation functionals of the exponential of a continuous Gaussian Free Field or general analytic functions of fractional Gaussian fields as limits of quantities constructed via a sequences of discrete fields. Finally, we show that the duality between even powers of bosonic Gaussian fields and "complex" fermionic Gaussian fields can be reformulated in terms of a principal minors assignment problem of the corresponding covariance matrices.</description>

      <title>Optimization, Isoperimetric Inequalities, and Sampling via Lyapunov Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02979v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that optimizability of any function F using Gradient Flow from all initializations implies a Poincar\'e Inequality for Gibbs measures mu_{beta} = e^{-beta F}/Z at low temperature. In particular, under mild regularity assumptions on the convergence rate of Gradient Flow, we establish that mu_{beta} satisfies a Poincar\'e Inequality with constant O(C'+1/beta) for beta &gt;= Omega(d), where C' is the Poincar\'e constant of mu_{beta} restricted to a neighborhood of the global minimizers of F. Under an additional mild condition on F, we show that mu_{beta} satisfies a Log-Sobolev Inequality with constant O(beta max(S, 1) max(C', 1)) where S denotes the second moment of mu_{beta}. Here asymptotic notation hides F-dependent parameters. At a high level, this establishes that optimizability via Gradient Flow from every initialization implies a Poincar\'e and Log-Sobolev Inequality for the low-temperature Gibbs measure, which in turn imply sampling from all initializations.
  Analogously, we establish that under the same assumptions, if F can be initialized from everywhere except some set S, then mu_{beta} satisfies a Weak Poincar\'e Inequality with parameters (O(C'+1/beta), O(mu_{beta}(S))) for \beta = Omega(d). At a high level, this shows while optimizability from 'most' initializations implies a Weak Poincar\'e Inequality, which in turn implies sampling from suitable warm starts. Our regularity assumptions are mild and as a consequence, we show we can efficiently sample from several new natural and interesting classes of non-log-concave densities, an important setting with relatively few examples. As another corollary, we obtain efficient discrete-time sampling results for log-concave measures satisfying milder regularity conditions than smoothness, similar to Lehec (2023).</description>

      <title>Random time-shift approximation enables hierarchical Bayesian inference of mechanistic within-host viral dynamics models on large datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic mathematical models of within-host viral dynamics are tools for understanding how a virus' biology and its interaction with the immune system shape the infectivity of a host. The biology of the process is encoded by the structure and parameters of the model that can be inferred statistically by fitting to viral load data. The main drawback of mechanistic models is that this inference is computationally expensive because the model must be repeatedly solved. This limits the size of the datasets that can be considered or the complexity of the models fitted. In this paper we develop a much cheaper inference method by implementing a novel approximation of the model dynamics that uses a combination of random and deterministic processes. This approximation also properly accounts for process noise early in the infection when cell and virion numbers are small, which is important for the viral dynamics but often overlooked. Our method runs on a consumer laptop and is fast enough to facilitate a full hierarchical Bayesian treatment of the problem with sharing of information to allow for individual level parameter differences. We apply our method to simulated data and a reanalysis of COVID-19 monitoring data in an National Basketball Association cohort of 163 individuals.</description>

      <title>Error correction, authentication, and false acceptance, probabilities for communication over noisy quantum channels: converse upper bounds on the bit transmission rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain strict upper bounds on the bit transmission rate for communication of Classical bit codewords over Quantum channels. Albeit previous arguments in arXiv: 1804.01797 which have demonstrated that lower bounds can be shown to hold for the bit transmission rate without the presence of significant noise over the channel shared by Alice and Bob for the purposes of encoding, decoding, transmission and authentication, the author suggests that upper bounding the bit transmission rate could be of use towards classifying paradoxical aspects of communication protocols, as well as constructing error correcting codes which are resilient to noise. The upper bound that is obtained in this work for the bit transmission rate, as a converse result, is dependent upon the natural logarithm of the size of each player's alphabet, as well as smaller alphabets, which can be leveraged for simultaneously realizing Quantum advantage for maximizing error correction and minimizing false acceptance. Crucially, the upper bound to the bit transmission rate is dependent upon a pruning procedure, which seeks to determine whether letters from player's alphabets can be removed so that prospective Quantum advantage, in order for Alice and Bob to implement error correction protocols with high probability, despite the fact that there is more noise over the channel between Alice and Bob in comparison to that between Bob and Eve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of these expository notes is to give an introduction to random matrices for non-specialist of this topic focusing on the link between random matrices and systems of particles in interaction. We first recall some general results about the random matrix theory that create a link between random matrices and systems of particles through the knowledge of the law of the eigenvalues of certain random matrices models. We next focus on a continuous in time approach of random matrices called the Dyson Brownian motion. We detail some general methods to study the existence of system of particles in singular interaction and the existence of a mean field limit for these systems of particles. Finally, we present the main result of large deviations when studying the eigenvalues of random matrices. This method is based on the fact that the eigenvalues of certain models of random matrices can be viewed as log gases in dimension 1 or 2.</description>

      <title>A perturbed cellular automaton with two phase transitions for the ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The positive rates conjecture states that a one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) with strictly positive transition rates must be ergodic. The conjecture has been refuted by G\'acs, whose counterexample is a cellular automaton that is non-ergodic under uniform random noise with sufficiently small rate. For all known counterexamples, non-ergodicity has been proved under small enough rates. Conversely, all cellular automata are ergodic with sufficiently high-rate noise. No other types of phase transitions of ergodicity are known, and the behavior of known counterexamples under intermediate noise rates is unknown.
  We present an example of a cellular automaton with two phase transitions. Using G\'acs's result as a black box, we construct a cellular automaton that is ergodic under small noise rates, non-ergodic for slightly higher rates, and again ergodic for rates close to 1.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Weakly Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major breakthroughs in science of the last (20th) century was building a bridge between the worlds of stochastic (random) systems and deterministic (dynamical) systems. It was started by the celebrated 1958 paper by A.N.Kolmogorov \cite{Kolmo}, who called this new theory (and actually a new way of thinking about deterministic systems) stochasticity of dynamical systems. Later, this name was essentially replaced by a short (sexier but more vague ``chaos theory"). Kolmogorov's discovery demonstrated that the time evolution of deterministic systems could be indistinguishable from the evolution of purely random (stochastic) systems. Moreover, it has been later established that typical deterministic systems are chaotic. However, as well as stochastic systems, which could be more or less random (from random processes with independent values to random processes with long memory) , chaotic dynamical systems could be strongly or weakly chaotic. Actually, the majority of chaotic systems are weakly chaotic, especially those that are relevant models for various real-world processes. Naturally, the theory of weakly chaotic systems is less developed because it deals with more complicated problems than the studies of strongly chaotic systems. We present here a brief review of this theory, including recently published and some new results.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for stochastic porous media equations via regularity structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03575v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a priori bounds for solutions of singular stochastic porous media equations with multiplicative noise in their natural $L^1$-based regularity class. We consider the first singular regime, i.e.~noise of space-time regularity $\alpha-2$ for $\alpha\in(2/3,1)$, and prove modelledness of the solution in the sense of regularity structures with respect to the solution of the corresponding linear stochastic heat equation. The proof relies on the kinetic formulation of the equation and a novel renormalized energy inequality. A careful analysis allows to balance the degeneracy of the diffusion coefficient against sufficiently strong damping of the multiplicative noise for small values of the solution.</description>

      <title>Analysing the Moments of the Determinant of a Random Matrix Via Analytic Combinatorics of Permutation Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following natural question. Given a matrix $A$ with i.i.d. random entries, what are the moments of the determinant of $A$? In other words, what is $\mathbb{E}[\det(A)^k]$? While there is a general expression for $\mathbb{E}[\det(A)^k]$ when the entries of $A$ are Gaussian, much less is known when the entries of $A$ have some other distribution.
  In two recent papers, we answered this question for $k = 4$ when the entries of $A$ are drawn from an arbitrary distribution and for $k = 6$ when the entries of $A$ are drawn from a distribution which has mean $0$. These analyses used recurrence relations and were highly intricate. In this paper, we show how these analyses can be simplified considerably by using analytic combinatorics on permutation tables.</description>

Abstract: We give some results relating asymptotic characterisations of maximum entropy probability measures to characterisations of Bayes optimal classifiers. Our main theorems show that maximum entropy is a universally Bayes optimal decision rule given constraints on one's knowledge about some observed data in terms of an expected loss. We will extend this result to the case of uncertainty in the observations of expected losses by generalising Sanov's theorem to distributions of constraint values.</description>

      <title>On the discrete Poincar\'e inequality for B-schemes of 1D Fokker-Planck equations in full space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two approaches to derive the discrete Poincar\'e inequality for the B-schemes, a family of finite volume discretization schemes, for the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation in full space. We study the properties of the spatially discretized Fokker-Planck equation in the viewpoint of a continuous-time Markov chain. The first approach is based on Gamma-calculus, through which we show that the Bakry-\'Emery criterion still holds in the discrete setting. The second approach employs the Lyapunov function method, allowing us to extend a local discrete Poincar\'e inequality to the full space. The assumptions required for both approaches are roughly comparable with some minor differences. These methods have the potential to be extended to higher dimensions. As a result, we obtain exponential convergence to equilibrium for the discrete schemes by applying the discrete Poincar\'e inequality.</description>

      <title>Nested importance sampling for Bayesian inference: error bounds and the role of dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many Bayesian inference problems involve high dimensional models for which only a subset of the model variables are actual estimation targets. All other variables are just nuisance variables that one would ideally like to integrate out analytically. Unfortunately, such integration is often impossible. However, there are several computational methods that have been proposed over the past 15 years that replace intractable analytical marginalisation by numerical integration, typically using different flavours of importance sampling (IS). Such methods include particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, sequential Monte Carlo squared (SMC$^2$), IS$^2$, nested particle filters and others. In this paper, we investigate the role of the dimension of the nuisance variables in the error bounds achieved by nested IS methods in Bayesian inference. We prove that, under suitable regularity assumptions on the model, the approximation errors increase at a polynomial (rather than exponential) rate with respect to the dimension of the nuisance variables. Our analysis relies on tools from functional analysis and measure theory and it includes the case of polynomials of degree zero, where the approximation error remains uniformly bounded as the dimension of the nuisance variables increases without bound. We also show how the general analysis can be applied to specific classes of models, including linear and Gaussian settings, models with bounded observation functions, and others. These findings improve our current understanding of when and how IS can overcome the curse of dimensionality in Bayesian inference problems.</description>

      <title>Time-inconsistent singular control problems: Reflection and Absolutely continuous controls with exploding rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a time-inconsistent singular stochastic control problem for a general one-dimensional diffusion, where time-inconsistency arises from a non-exponential discount function. To address this, we adopt a game-theoretic framework and study the optimality of a novel class of controls that encompasses both traditional singular controls -- responsible for generating multiple jumps and reflective boundaries (strong thresholds) -- and new mild threshold control strategies, which allow for the explosion of the control rate in absolutely continuous controls, thereby creating an inaccessible boundary (mild threshold) for the controlled process. We establish a general verification theorem, formulated in terms of a system of variational inequalities, that provides both necessary and sufficient conditions for equilibrium within the proposed class of control strategies and their combinations. To demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical results, we examine case studies in inventory management. We show that for certain parameter values, the problem admits a strong threshold control equilibrium in the form of Skorokhod reflection. In contrast, for other parameter values, we prove that no such equilibrium exists, necessitating the use of our extended control class. In the latter case, we explicitly construct an equilibrium using a mild threshold control strategy with a discontinuous, increasing, and exploding rate that induces an inaccessible boundary for the optimally controlled process, marking the first example of a singular control problem with such a solution structure.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric properties of one-dimensional Markov generators with the links to Markov-dualities and to shape-invariance-exact-solvability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For diffusion process involving the force $F(x)$ and the diffusion coefficient $D(x)$, the continuity equation $\partial_t P_t(x)=- \partial_xJ_t(x)$ gives the dynamics of the probability $P_t( x)$ in terms of the current $J_t( x)=F(x)P_t(x)-D(x)\partial_x P_t(x)={\cal J}P_t( x)$ obtained from $P_t( x) $ via the application of the first-order differential current-operator ${\cal J}$. So the dynamics of the probability $P_t( x)$ is governed by the factorized Fokker-Planck generator ${\cal F}=-\partial_x{\cal J}$, while the dynamics of the current $J_t( x)$ is governed by its supersymmetric partner ${\hat {\cal F} }= - {\cal J}\partial_x$, so that their right and left eigenvectors are directly related using the two intertwining relations ${\cal J}{\cal F}=-{\cal J}\partial_x{\cal J}={\hat {\cal F}}{\cal J}$ and ${\cal F}\partial_x=-\partial_x{\cal J}\partial_x=\partial_x{\hat {\cal F} }$. We also describe the link with the factorization of the adjoint $ {\cal F}^{\dagger}=\frac{d}{dm(x)}\frac{d}{ds(x)} $ in terms of the scale function $s(x)$ and speed measure $m(x)$. We then analyze how the supersymmetric partner ${\hat {\cal F} } = - {\cal J} \partial_x$ can be re-interpreted in two ways: (1) as the adjoint ${\mathring {\cal F}}^{\dagger} ={\mathring {\cal J} }^{\dagger} \partial_x$ of the Fokker-Planck generator ${\mathring {\cal F}}=- \partial_x{\mathring {\cal J} }$ associated to the dual force ${\mathring F}(x)=-F(x)-D'(x)$, that unifies various known Markov dualities; (2) as the non-conserved Fokker-Planck generator ${\tilde {\cal F}}_{nc} = -\partial_x{\tilde {\cal J}}-{\tilde K }(x)$ involving the force ${\tilde F}(x)=F(x) +D'(x)$ and the killing rate ${\tilde K }(x)=-F'(x)-D''(x)$, with application to shape-invariance-solvability. Finally, we describe how all these ideas can be also applied to Markov jump processes with nearest-neighbors transition rates $w(x \pm 1,x)$.</description>

      <title>Monitoring for a Phase Transition in a Time Series of Wigner Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop methodology and theory for the detection of a phase transition in a time-series of high-dimensional random matrices. In the model we study, at each time point \( t = 1,2,\ldots \), we observe a deformed Wigner matrix \( \mathbf{M}_t \), where the unobservable deformation represents a latent signal. This signal is detectable only in the supercritical regime, and our objective is to detect the transition to this regime in real time, as new matrix--valued observations arrive. Our approach is based on a partial sum process of extremal eigenvalues of $\mathbf{M}_t$, and its theoretical analysis combines state-of-the-art tools from random-matrix-theory and Gaussian approximations. The resulting detector is self-normalized, which ensures appropriate scaling for convergence and a pivotal limit, without any additional parameter estimation. Simulations show excellent performance for varying dimensions. Applications to pollution monitoring and social interactions in primates illustrate the usefulness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear parameter measures the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), offering a crucial test of early universe models. While standard single field inflation predicts nearly Gaussian fluctuations, more complex scenarios yield subtle non Gaussian signals, particularly captured by the CMB bispectrum. In the local model, these signals arise through a quadratic correction to a Gaussian field. To estimate the nonlinear parameter, we adopt a Komatsu Spergel Wandelt (KSW) type estimator, based on spherical harmonics and Wigner 3j symbols, and adapted to narrow band configurations that depend on the range of multipoles considered. In this paper, we rigorously study its asymptotic properties by applying fourth-moment theorems from Wiener chaos theory. More in detail, we establish a quantitative central limit theorem for the KSW estimator, with an explicit convergence rate controlled by number of admissible multipoles. Our results establish both theoretical guarantees and practical robustness for high resolution CMB analyses.</description>

Abstract: We study a system of random walks, known as the frog model, starting from a profile of independent Poisson($\lambda$) particles per site, with one additional active particle planted at some vertex $\mathbf{o}$ of a finite connected simple graph $G=(V,E)$. Initially, only the particles occupying $\mathbf{o}$ are active. Active particles perform $t \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty \}$ steps of the walk they picked before vanishing and activate all inactive particles they hit. This system is often taken as a model for the spread of an epidemic over a population. Let $\mathcal{R}_t$ be the set of vertices which are visited by the process, when active particles vanish after $t$ steps. We study the susceptibility of the process on the underlying graph, defined as the random quantity $\mathcal{S}(G):=\inf \{t:\mathcal{R}_t=V \}$ (essentially, the shortest particles' lifetime required for the entire population to get infected). We consider the cases that the underlying graph is either a regular expander or a $d$-dimensional torus of side length $n$ (for all $d \ge 1$) $\mathbb{T}_d(n)$ and determine the asymptotic behavior of $\mathcal{S} $ up to a constant factor. In fact, throughout we allow the particle density $\lambda$ to depend on $n$ and for $d \ge 2$ we determine the asymptotic behavior of $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{T}_d(n))$ up to smaller order terms for a wide range of $\lambda=\lambda_n$.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for random walk on random graphs with a community structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the configuration model with an embedded community structure and study the mixing properties of a simple random walk on it. Every vertex has an internal $\mathrm{deg}^{\text{int}}\geq 3$ and an outgoing $\mathrm{deg}^{\text{out}}$ number of half-edges. Given a stochastic matrix $Q$, we pick a random perfect matching of the half-edges subject to the constraint that each vertex $v$ has $\mathrm{deg}^{\text{int}}(v)$ neighbours inside its community and the proportion of outgoing half-edges from community $i$ matched to a half-edge from community $j$ is $Q(i,j)$. Assuming the number of communities is constant and they all have comparable sizes, we prove the following dichotomy: simple random walk on the resulting graph exhibits cutoff if and only if the product of the Cheeger constant of $Q$ times $\log n$ (where $n$ is the number of vertices) diverges.
  In [4], Ben-Hamou established a dichotomy for cutoff for a non-backtracking random walk on a similar random graph model with 2 communities. We prove the same characterisation of cutoff holds for simple random walk.</description>

Abstract: The Cohen-Lenstra heuristic predicts the distribution of ideal class groups over number fields. Random matrix models provide a natural framework for explaining this heuristic, and recent results demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools. In this paper, we extend the analysis of the random matrix model to examine the error term in the Cohen-Lenstra heuristic. Additionally, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the corank of random matrices over finite fields, which can be modeled as a special class of Markov chains.</description>

Both models exhibit hard regimes where all known polynomial-time algorithms fail and possess the multi Overlap Gap Property ($m$-OGP), an intricate geometrical property that rigorously rules out a broad class of algorithms exhibiting input stability.
  We establish that, in both models, the symmetric $m$-OGP undergoes a sharp phase transition, and we pinpoint its exact threshold. For the Ising $p$-spin glass, our results hold for all sufficiently large $p$; for the random $k$-SAT, they apply to all $k$ growing mildly with the number of Boolean variables. Notably, our findings yield qualitative insights into the power of OGP-based arguments. A particular consequence for the Ising $p$-spin glass is that the strength of the $m$-OGP in establishing algorithmic hardness grows without bound as $m$ increases.
  These are the first sharp threshold results for the $m$-OGP. Our analysis hinges on a judicious application of the second moment method, enhanced by concentration. While a direct second moment calculation fails, we overcome this via a refined approach that leverages an argument of~\cite{frieze1990independence} and exploiting concentration properties of carefully constructed random variables.</description>

      <title>Tightness of exponential metrics for log-correlated Gaussian fields in arbitrary dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03996v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the tightness of a natural approximation scheme for an analog of the Liouville quantum gravity metric on $\mathbb R^d$ for arbitrary $d\geq 2$. More precisely, let $\{h_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ be a suitable sequence of Gaussian random functions which approximates a log-correlated Gaussian field on $\mathbb R^d$. Consider the family of random metrics on $\mathbb R^d$ obtained by weighting the lengths of paths by $e^{\xi h_n}$, where $\xi &gt; 0$ is a parameter. We prove that if $\xi$ belongs to the subcritical phase (which is defined by the condition that the distance exponent $Q(\xi)$ is greater than $\sqrt{2d}$), then after appropriate re-scaling, these metrics are tight and that every subsequential limit is a metric on $\mathbb R^d$ which induces the Euclidean topology. We include a substantial list of open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17573v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of unique solutions is established for rough differential equations (RDEs) with path-dependent coefficients and driven by c\`adl\`ag rough paths. Moreover, it is shown that the associated solution map, also known as It\^o-Lyons map, is locally Lipschitz continuous. These results are then applied to various classes of rough differential equations, such as controlled RDEs and RDEs with delay, as well as stochastic differential equations with delay. To that end, a joint rough path is constructed for a c\`adl\`ag martingale and its delayed version, that corresponds to stochastic It\^o integration.</description>

      <title>Tight matrices and heavy traffic steady state convergence in queueing networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested to prove that the stationary distribution of a multiclass queueing network converges to the stationary distribution of a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM) in heavy traffic. A key condition for this convergence is that the sequence of the pre-limit stationary distributions under appropriate scaling is tight. In Braverman et al.(2025), a sufficient condition for this tightness is introduced in the term of the reflection matrix $R$ of the SRBM, which is coined for $R$ to be ``tight''. In this paper, we study how we can verify this tightness of $R$ of an SRBM. For a $2$-dimensional SRBM, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $R$ to be tight, while, for a general dimension, we only give sufficient conditions. We then apply these results to the SRBMs arising from the diffusion approximations of multiclass queueing networks with static buffer priority service disciplines that are studied in Braverman et al.(2025). It is shown that $R$ is always tight for this network with two stations if $R$ is completely-$\sr{S}$. For the case of more than two stations, it is shown that $R$ is tight for reentrant lines with last-buffer-first-service (LBFS) discipline, but it is not always tight for reentrant line with first-buffer-first-service (FBFS) discipline.</description>

      <title>Specific Wasserstein divergence between continuous martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defining a divergence between the laws of continuous martingales is a delicate task, owing to the fact that these laws tend to be singular to each other. An important idea, put forward by N. Gantert, is to instead consider a scaling limit of the relative entropy between such continuous martingales sampled over a finite time grid. This gives rise to the concept of specific relative entropy. In order to develop a general theory of divergences between continuous martingales, it is only natural to replace the role of the relative entropy in this construction by a different notion of discrepancy between finite dimensional probability distributions. In the present work we take a first step in this direction, taking a power $p$ of the Wasserstein distance instead of the relative entropy. We call the newly obtained scaling limit the specific $p$-Wasserstein divergence.
  In our first main result we prove that the specific $p$-Wasserstein divergence is well-defined, exhibit an explicit expression for it in terms of the quadratic variations of the martingales involved, and compare it with the specific relative entropy and adapted Wasserstein distance on a class of SDEs. Next we consider the specific $p$-Wasserstein divergence optimization over the set of win-martingales. In our second main result we characterize the solution of this optimization problem for all $p&gt;0$ and, somewhat surprisingly, we single out the case $p=1/2$ as the one with the best probabilistic properties. For instance, the optimal martingale in this case is very explicit and can be connected to the solution of a variant of the Schr\"odinger problem.</description>

      <title>Skew-symmetric schemes for stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift: an unadjusted Barker algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14373v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new simple and explicit numerical scheme for time-homogeneous stochastic differential equations. The scheme is based on sampling increments at each time step from a skew-symmetric probability distribution, with the level of skewness determined by the drift and volatility of the underlying process. We show that as the step-size decreases the scheme converges weakly to the diffusion of interest. We then consider the problem of simulating from the limiting distribution of an ergodic diffusion process using the numerical scheme with a fixed step-size. We establish conditions under which the numerical scheme converges to equilibrium at a geometric rate, and quantify the bias between the equilibrium distributions of the scheme and of the true diffusion process. Notably, our results do not require a global Lipschitz assumption on the drift, in contrast to those required for the Euler--Maruyama scheme for long-time simulation at fixed step-sizes. Our weak convergence result relies on an extension of the theory of Milstein \&amp; Tretyakov to stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift, which could also be of independent interest. We support our theoretical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Glauber dynamics and coupling-from-the-past for Gaussian fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the representation of stationary Gaussian Markov random fields as factors of i.i.d. processes, with a focus on their approximation by finitely dependent distributions. Our model is a Gaussian field on $\mathbf{Z}^d$ such that the conditional law of the field at any site is Gaussian of mean $\varepsilon$ times the average of its neighbours, and of variance 1. Building on coupling-from-the-past (CFTP) techniques, we prove that for sufficiently small $\varepsilon$, the distribution of the field can be written as an explicit factor of an i.i.d. process. Furthermore, we construct approximations by finitely dependent fields that are close in total variation to the original field, with exponential decay when the allowed range of dependence grows. We first do the proof for a truncated version of this Gaussian model, showing in this case that the associated field admits a finitary coding with exponential tails, providing a new application of high-noise condition of H\"aggstr\"om and Steif \cite{HaggstromSteif} for an uncountable state space. The proof for the original model is more intricate. Our approach extends classical CFTP-based constructions by developing a stratified coupling method tailored to the continuous and unbounded nature of the Gaussian setting.</description>

Abstract: A basic question about the directed landscape is how much of it can be reconstructed simply by knowing the shapes of its geodesics. We prove that the directed landscape can be reconstructed from the shapes of its semi-infinite geodesics. In order to show this result, we make use of the Busemann process of the directed landscape together with a novel ``coordinate system" and ``differential distance" to capture the behaviour of semi-infinite geodesics.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence and uniqueness of the barycenter of a signed distribution of probability measures on a Hilbert space. The barycenter is found, as usual, as a minimum of a functional. In the case where the positive part of the signed measure is atomic, we can show also uniqueness. In the one-dimensional case, we characterize the quantile function of the unique minimum as the orthogonal projection of the $L^2$-barycenter of the quantiles on the cone of nonincreasing functions in $L^2(0,1)$. Further, we provide a stability estimate in dimension one and a counterexample to uniqueness in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Finally, we address the consistency of the barycenters and we prove that barycenters of a sequence of approximating measures converge (up to subsequences) to a barycenter of the limit measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the classical coupon collector problem with uniform probabilities. Since the seminal paper by P. Erd\"os and A. R\'enyi \cite{ErRe}, it is well-known that the renormalized number of attempts required to complete a collection of $n$ items distributed with uniform probability tends to a Gumbel distribution when $n$ goes to infinity. We propose to determine how fast this convergence takes place for a certain distance to be introduced by using the so-called generator approach of Stein's method. To do so, we introduce a semi-group similar to the classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semi-group and whose stationary measure is the standard Gumbel distribution. We give its essential properties and apply them to prove that the renormalized number of attempts converges to the Gumbel distribution at rate $\log n/n$.</description>

Under a local integrability condition on the time-spatial singular drift, the well-posedness and Lipschitz continuity in initial values are proved, which is new even in the distribution independent case. Moreover, under a monotone condition, the asymptotic log-Harnack inequality is established, which extends the corresponding result of [5] derived in the distribution independent case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence to (quasi--)equilibrium of a density dependent Markov chain in~${\mathbb Z}^d$, whose drift satisfies a system of ordinary differential equations having an attractive fixed point. For a sequence of such processes~${\mathbb X}^N$, indexed by a size parameter~$N$, the time taken until the distribution of~${\mathbb X}^N$, started in some given state, approaches its equilibrium distribution~$\pi^N$ typically increases with~$N$. To first order, it corresponds to the time~$t_N$ at which the solution to the drift equations reaches a distance of~$\sqrt N$ from their fixed point. However, the length of the time interval over which the total variation distance between ${\mathcal L} ({\mathbb X}^N(t))$ and its equilibrium distribution~$\pi^N$ changes from being close to~$1$ to being close to zero is asymptotically of smaller order than~$t_N$. In this sense, the chains exhibit `cut--off', and we are able to prove that the cut-off window is of (optimal) constant size.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of multiscale McKean-Vlasov stochastic systems, where the entire system depends on the distributions of both fast and slow components. First of all, by applying the Poisson equation method, we prove that the slow component converges to the solution of the averaging equation in the $L^p$ ($p\geq 2$) space with the optimal convergence order $\frac12$. Then we establish a central limit theorem for these systems and derive the weak convergence rate using the Poisson equation technique and the regularity properties of the associated Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>CIR bridge for modeling of fish migration on sub-hourly scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bridges, which are stochastic processes with pinned initial and terminal conditions, have recently been applied to various problems. We show that a bridge based on the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process, called a CIR bridge in this paper, reasonably models the intraday number of migrating fish at an observation point in a river. The studied fish migrates between sunrise and sunset each day, which are considered the initial and terminal times, respectively. The CIR bridge is well-defined as a unique pathwise continuous solution to a stochastic differential equation with unbounded drift and diffusion coefficients and potentially represents the on-off intermittency of the fish count data. Our bridge is theoretically novel in that it admits closed-form time-dependent averages and variances, with which the model parameters can be identified efficiently, and is computable by a recently-developed one-step numerical method. The CIR bridge is applied to the sub-hourly migration data of the diadromous fish Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis in the Nagara River, Japan, from February to June.</description>

Abstract: We consider a nonlinear filtering problem for a signal-observation system driven by a Volterra-type Gaussian rough path, whose sample paths may exhibit greater roughness than those of Brownian motion. The observation process includes a Volterra-type drift, introducing both memory effects and low regularity in the dynamics. We prove well-posedness of the associated rough differential equations and the Kallianpur-Striebel. We then establish robustenss properties of the filter and study the existence, smoothness, and time regularity of its density using partial Malliavin calculus. Finally, we show that, in the one-dimensional case, the density of the unnormalized filter solves a rough partial differential equation, providing a rough-path analogue of the Zakai equation.</description>

Abstract: An $N$-dimer cover of a graph is a collection of edges (with multiplicity) such that each vertex is contained in exactly $N$ edges in the collection. The multinomial dimer model is a natural probability measure on $N$-dimer covers. We study the behavior of these measures on periodic bipartite graphs in ${\mathbb R}^d$, in the scaling limit as the multiplicity $N$ and then the size of the graph go to infinity.
  In this iterated limit, we prove a large deviation principle, where the rate function is the integral of an explicit surface tension, and show that random configurations concentrate on a limit shape which is the unique solution to an associated Euler-Lagrange equation. We further show that the associated critical gauge functions, which exist in the $N\to\infty$ limit on each finite graph, converge in the scaling limit to a limiting gauge function which solves a dual Euler-Lagrange equation.
  We use our techniques to compute explicit limit shapes in some two and three dimensional examples, such as the Aztec diamond and ``Aztec cuboid". These $3d$ examples are the first stat mech models in dimensions $d\ge3$ where limit shapes can be computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>The geometry of financial institutions -- Wasserstein clustering of financial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of granular and big data on various objects of interest has made it necessary to develop methods for condensing this information into a representative and intelligible map. Financial regulation is a field that exemplifies this need, as regulators require diverse and often highly granular data from financial institutions to monitor and assess their activities. However, processing and analyzing such data can be a daunting task, especially given the challenges of dealing with missing values and identifying clusters based on specific features.
  To address these challenges, we propose a variant of Lloyd's algorithm that applies to probability distributions and uses generalized Wasserstein barycenters to construct a metric space which represents given data on various objects in condensed form. By applying our method to the financial regulation context, we demonstrate its usefulness in dealing with the specific challenges faced by regulators in this domain. We believe that our approach can also be applied more generally to other fields where large and complex data sets need to be represented in concise form.</description>

      <title>On the quality of randomized approximations of Tukey's depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tukey's depth (or halfspace depth) is a widely used measure of centrality for multivariate data. However, exact computation of Tukey's depth is known to be a hard problem in high dimensions. As a remedy, randomized approximations of Tukey's depth have been proposed. In this paper we explore when such randomized algorithms return a good approximation of Tukey's depth. We study the case when the data are sampled from a log-concave isotropic distribution. We prove that, if one requires that the algorithm runs in polynomial time in the dimension, the randomized algorithm correctly approximates the maximal depth $1/2$ and depths close to zero. On the other hand, for any point of intermediate depth, any good approximation requires exponential complexity.</description>

      <title>Transformers Can Solve Non-Linear and Non-Markovian Filtering Problems in Continuous Time For Conditionally Gaussian Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of attention-based deep learning models in stochastic filtering, e.g.\ transformers and deep Kalman filters, has recently come into focus; however, the potential for these models to solve stochastic filtering problems remains largely unknown. The paper provides an affirmative answer to this open problem in the theoretical foundations of machine learning by showing that a class of continuous-time transformer models, called \textit{filterformers}, can approximately implement the conditional law of a broad class of non-Markovian and conditionally Gaussian signal processes given noisy continuous-time (possibly non-Gaussian) measurements. Our approximation guarantees hold uniformly over sufficiently regular compact subsets of continuous-time paths, where the worst-case 2-Wasserstein distance between the true optimal filter and our deep learning model quantifies the approximation error. Our construction relies on two new customizations of the standard attention mechanism: The first can losslessly adapt to the characteristics of a broad range of paths since we show that the attention mechanism implements bi-Lipschitz embeddings of sufficiently regular sets of paths into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces; thus, it incurs no ``dimension reduction error''. The latter attention mechanism is tailored to the geometry of Gaussian measures in the $2$-Wasserstein space. Our analysis relies on new stability estimates of robust optimal filters in the conditionally Gaussian setting.</description>

      <title>Variational convergence for an irreversible exchange-driven stochastic particle system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the variational convergence of an irreversible Markov jump process describing a finite stochastic particle system to the solution of a countable infinite system of deterministic time-inhomogeneous quadratic differential equations known as the exchange-driven growth model, which has two conserved quantities. As a bounded perturbation of the reversible kernel, the variational formulation is a generalization of the gradient flow formulation of the reversible process and can be interpreted as the large deviation functional of the Markov jump process. As a consequence of the variational convergence result, we show the propagation of chaos of the Markov processes to the limiting equation and the $\Gamma$-convergence of the energy functional. The latter convergence is consistent with related results for reversible coagulation-fragmentation equations and reveals the connection of stochastic processes to the long-time condensation phenomena in the limit equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming a uniform $q$-variant of the prime $k$-tuple conjecture, we compute moments of the number of primes in arithmetic progressions to a large modulus $q$ as the residue classes vary. Consequently, depending on the size of $\varphi(q)$, the prime count follows either a Gaussian or a Poisson distribution. In particular, the least prime in progressions follows an exponential distribution, with some unexpected discrepancies observed for smooth moduli.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional bootstrap and asymptotic expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05006v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent seminal work of Chernozhukov, Chetverikov and Kato has shown that bootstrap approximation for the maximum of a sum of independent random vectors is justified even when the dimension is much larger than the sample size. In this context, numerical experiments suggest that third-moment match bootstrap approximations would outperform normal approximation even without studentization, but the existing theoretical results cannot explain this phenomenon. In this paper, we develop an asymptotic expansion formula for the bootstrap coverage probability and show that it can give an explanation for the above phenomenon. In particular, we find the following interesting blessing of dimensionality phenomenon: The third-moment match wild bootstrap is second-order accurate in high-dimensions even without studentization if the covariance matrix has identical diagonal entries and bounded eigenvalues. We also show that a double wild bootstrap method is second-order accurate regardless of the covariance structure. The validity of these results is established under the existence of Stein kernels.</description>

      <title>Upgraded free independence phenomena for random unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study upgraded free independence phenomena for unitary elements $u_1$, $u_2$, \dots representing the large-$n$ limit of Haar random unitaries, showing that free independence extends to several larger algebras containing $u_j$ in the ultraproduct of matrices $\prod_{n \to \mathcal{U}} M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Using a uniform asymptotic freeness argument and volumetric analysis, we prove free independence of the Pinsker algebras $\mathcal{P}_j$ containing $u_j$. The Pinsker algebra $\mathcal{P}_j$ is the maximal subalgebra containing $u_j$ with vanishing $1$-bounded entropy defined by Hayes; $\mathcal{P}_j$ in particular contains the relative commutant $\{u_j\}' \cap \prod_{n \to \mathcal{U}} M_n(\mathbb{C})$, more generally any unitary that can be connected to $u_j$ by a sequence of commuting pairs of Haar unitaries, and any unitary $v$ such that $v\mathcal{P}_j v^* \cap \mathcal{P}_j$ is diffuse. Through an embedding argument, we go back and deduce analogous free independence results for $\mathcal{M}^{\mathcal{U}}$ when $\mathcal{M}$ is a free product of Connes embeddable tracial von Neumann algebras $\mathcal{M}_i$, which thus yields (in the Connes-embeddable case) a generalization and a new proof of Houdayer--Ioana's results on free independence of approximate commutants. It also yields a new proof of the general absorption results for Connes-embeddable free products obtained by the first author, Hayes, Nelson, and Sinclair.</description>

      <title>Locally Stationary Distributions: A Framework for Analyzing Slow-Mixing Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20849v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural Markov chains fail to mix to their stationary distribution in polynomially many steps. Often, this slow mixing is inevitable since it is computationally intractable to sample from their stationary measure.
  Nevertheless, Markov chains can be shown to always converge quickly to measures that are locally stationary, i.e., measures that don't change over a small number of steps. These locally stationary measures are analogous to local minima in continuous optimization, while stationary measures correspond to global minima.
  While locally stationary measures can be statistically far from stationary measures, do they enjoy provable theoretical guarantees that have algorithmic implications? We study this question in this work and demonstrate three algorithmic applications of locally stationary measures:
  1. We show that Glauber dynamics on the hardcore model can be used to find independent sets of size $\Omega\left(\frac{\log d}{d} \cdot n\right)$ in triangle-free graphs of degree at most $d$.
  2. Let $W$ be a symmetric real matrix with bounded spectral diameter and $v$ be a unit vector. Given the matrix $M = \lambda vv^\top + W$ with a planted rank-one spike along vector $v$, for sufficiently large constant $\lambda$, Glauber dynamics on the Ising model defined by $M$ samples vectors $x \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ that have constant correlation with the vector $v$.
  3. Let $M = A_{\mathbf{G}} - \frac{d}{n}\mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}^\top$ be a centered version of the adjacency matrix where the graph $\mathbf{G}$ is drawn from a sparse 2-community stochastic block model. We show that for sufficiently large constant signal-to-noise ratio, Glauber dynamics on the Ising model defined by $M$ samples vectors $x \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ that have constant correlation with the hidden community vector $\mathbf{\sigma}$.</description>

      <title>Matrix Majorization in Large Samples with Varying Support Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a matrix $P$ with non-negative entries majorizes another such matrix $Q$ if there is a stochastic matrix $T$ such that $Q=TP$. We study matrix majorization in large samples and in the catalytic regime in the case where the columns of the matrices need not have equal support, as has been assumed in earlier works. We focus on two cases: either there are no support restrictions (except for requiring a non-empty intersection for the supports) or the final column dominates the others. Using real-algebraic methods, we identify sufficient and almost necessary conditions for majorization in large samples or when using catalytic states under these support conditions. These conditions are given in terms of multivariate divergences that generalize the R\'enyi divergences. We notice that varying support conditions dramatically affect the relevant set of divergences. Our results find an application in the theory of catalytic state transformation in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantitative direct method to prove the local stability of a stationary solution for a rough differential equation and its regular discretization scheme. Using Doss-Sussmann technique and stopping time analysis, we provide stability criteria for a stationary solution of the continuous system to be exponentially stable, provided the diffusion term is bounded and its derivatives exhibit small growth. The same conclusions hold for the regular discretization scheme with a sufficiently small step size, but one needs to apply the sewing lemma and stopping times for the discrete time set. Our stability criteria are based on the linearization of the drift and require only information about the bound and growth rates of the diffusion, making them data-driven criteria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to surplus providers. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction between entropy and Wasserstein distance in free probability theory. In particular, we give lower bounds for several versions of free entropy dimension along Wasserstein geodesics, as well as study their topological properties with respect to Wasserstein distance. We also study moment measures in the multivariate free setting, showing the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a regularized version of Santambrogio's variational problem. The role of probability distributions in these results is played by types, functionals which assign values not only to polynomial test functions, but to all real-valued logical formulas built from them using suprema and infima. We give an explicit counterexample showing that in the framework of non-commutative laws, the usual notion of probability distributions using only non-commutative polynomial test functions, one cannot obtain the desired large-$n$ limiting behavior for both Wasserstein distance and entropy simultaneously in random multi-matrix models.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of behavioral singular stochastic control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness of a general class of singular stochastic control problems in which controls are processes of finite variation. We develop an abstract framework, which we then apply to storage management and portfolio investment problems under proportional transaction costs. Within this setting, we establish the existence of an optimal strategy in the class of randomized controls for a range of goal functionals, including cumulative prospect theory (CPT) preferences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first treatment of behavioral storage management with the CPT goal functional. For the portfolio management problem, our analysis exploits the metrizable Meyer-Zheng topology to simplify proofs. We thoroughly investigate the applicability of the Skorokhod representation theorem for adapted random processes. Overall, the presented framework provides a clear separation between constraints imposed on the market model and properties required of the goal functional.</description>

      <title>Galton-Watson processes, simple varieties of trees and Khinchin families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a unified analytic framework that connects simple varieties of trees, Bienayme-Galton-Watson processes and Khinchin families. Using Lagrange's inversion formula, we derive new coefficient-based expressions for extinction probabilities and reinterpret them as boundary phenomena tied to the domain of the inverse of the solution to Lagrange's equation. This perspective reveals a structural bridge between combinatorial and probabilistic models, simplifying classical arguments and yielding new results. It also leads to a computationally efficient method for simulating Galton-Watson processes via power series coefficients.</description>
