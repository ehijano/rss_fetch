      <title>Stratified equatorial flows in cylindrical coordinates with surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a mathematical model of steady flows of an inviscid and incompressible fluid moving in the azimuthal direction. The water density varies with depth and the waves are propagating under the force of gravity, over a flat bed and with a free surface, on which acts a force of surface tension. Our solution pertains to large scale equatorial dynamics of a fluid with free surface expressed in cylindrical coordinates. We also prove a regularity result for the free surface.</description>

      <title>Mass conservation and gelation for the Smoluchowski coagulation equation: a generalized moment approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Smoluchowski coagulation equation (SCE) is a population balance model that describes the time evolution of cluster size distributions resulting from particle aggregation. Although it is formally a mass-conserving system, solutions may exhibit a gelation phenomenon-a sudden loss of mass-when the coagulation kernel grows superlinearly. In this paper, we rigorously analyze mass conservation and gelation for weak solutions to the SCE with inhomogeneous coagulation kernels. By introducing a generalized moment framework, we derive sharp sufficient conditions for both mass conservation and gelation, expressed in terms of the initial data and the properties of the coagulation kernel.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation under meromorphic initial conditions by quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the solvability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation under meromorphic initial conditions by quadrature when the inverse scattering transform (IST) is applied. It is a key to solve the Schr\"odinger equation appearing in the Lax pair in application of the IST. We show that the Schr\"odinger equation is always integrable in the sense of differential Galois theory, i.e., solvable by quadrature, if and only if the meromporphic potential is reflectionless, under the condition that the potential is absolutely integrable on $\mathbb{R}\setminus(-R_0,R_0)$ for some $R_0&gt;0$.This statement was previously proved to be true by the author for a limited class of potentials. We also show that the Schr\"odinger equation is not integrable in this sense for rational potentials that decay at infinity but do not satisfy the weak condition.</description>

      <title>The Riemann problem for three-phase foam flow in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas injection in the context of the three-phase flow in porous media appears in applications such as Enhanced Oil Recovery, aquifer remediation, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). In general, this technique suffers from a difficulty related to excessive gas mobility, which can be circumvented by using foam. This study addresses the non-linear system of differential equations describing the three-phase foam flow based on Corey relative permeability functions. A major obstacle is an umbilic point, where the characteristic wave velocities for different families coincide, complicating the identification of stable wave structures.
  We developed a methodology to solve the Riemann problem describing the three-phase foam displacement in the case when the gas viscosity exceeds that of oil and water. To allow the analysis, we assume foam in local equilibrium (or maximum foam texture), resulting in a constant mobility reduction factor (MRF). These simplifications allowed the classification of possible solutions for the injection of foamed gas and water mixtures under a wide range of initial conditions within the framework of non-classical Conservation Law Theory. As a relevant industrial application of the proposed solution, we investigate the conditions resulting in oil bank formation. Besides improving the general physical understanding of foam flow in a porous medium, this analysis can be applied to calibrate numerical simulators and perform uncertainty quantification. Our analytical estimates were validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A porous medium equation with rough weights: sharp Widder theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an optimal \emph{Widder theory} for a weighted porous medium equation with rough and inhomogeneous density that may be singular at a point and tends to zero at spatial infinity. Specifically, for this equation, we identify a class $X$ of initial measure data that give rise to very weak solutions, we show that non-negative very weak solutions necessarily admit an initial trace in $X$ at time $t=0$, and we prove that any two non-negative solutions having the same initial trace are equal. The corresponding theory for the classical (unweighted) equation was established by exploiting various properties that are not available in our weighted setting, such as the continuity of solutions, the explicit scale invariance of the equation, Aleksandrov's reflection principle, and the Aronson--B\'enilan inequality. Therefore, to complete the Widder theory, we must devise several proofs by means of entirely new methods. We also establish an optimal quantitative \emph{a priori} smoothing estimate for unsigned local solutions without resorting to scale invariance, which seems to be new in this form even for the classical porous medium equation. Finally, we show that non-negative very weak solutions are always locally bounded, and in particular that they have locally finite energy.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of elasto-plastic plate equations with vanishing hardening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on recent work analyzing the interaction between homogenization and dimension reduction in perfectly plastic materials, we focus on the extreme regime where the plate thickness vanishes much faster than the period of oscillation of the heterogeneous material. Our investigation is devoted to the derivation of the existence of a quasistatic evolution for a multiphase elasto-plastic composite without imposing any kind of ordering constraints on admissible yield surfaces of the various phases. The analysis is carried out in two steps: we first derive a heterogeneous plate model with hardening via dimension reduction using evolutionary $\Gamma$-convergence techniques, and then perform two-scale homogenization while simultaneously letting the hardening parameters tend to zero using a stress-strain approach. This approach allows us to reconcile the Kirchhoff-Love structure of limiting displacements with the expected requirement that the effective dissipation potential at each point of the interface between two phases needs to be the pointwise-in-space inf-convolution of that in either phase.</description>

      <title>Refined regularity at critical points for linear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the regularity of solutions to linear elliptic equations in both divergence and non-divergence forms, particularly when the principal coefficients have Dini mean oscillation. We show that if a solution $u$ to a divergence-form equation satisfies $Du(x^o)=0$ at a point, then the second derivative $D^2u(x^o)$ exists and satisfies sharp continuity estimates. As a consequence, we obtain ``$C^{2,\alpha}$ regularity'' at critical points when the coefficients of $L$ are $C^\alpha$. This result refines a theorem of Teixeira (Math. Ann. 358 (2014), no. 1--2, 241--256) in the linear setting, where both linear and nonlinear equations were considered. We also establish an analogous result for equations in non-divergence form.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and symmetry breaking in interpolation inequalities for two-dimensional spinors -- Preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the two-dimensional Euclidean space, we study a spinorial analogue of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality involving weighted gradient norms. This (SCKN) inequality is equivalent to a spinorial Gagliardo-Nirenberg type interpolation inequality on a cylinder as well as to an interpolation inequality involving Aharonov-Bohm magnetic fields, which was analyzed in a paper of 2020. We examine the symmetry properties of optimal functions by linearizing the associated functional around radial minimizers. We prove that the stability of the linearized problem is equivalent to the positivity of a $2\times2$ matrix-valued differential operator. We study the positivity issue via a combination of analytical arguments and numerical computations. In particular, our results provide numerical evidence that the region of symmetry breaking extends beyond what was previously known, while the threshold of the known symmetry region is linearly stable. Altogether, we obtain refined estimates of the phase transition between symmetry and symmetry breaking. Our results also put in evidence striking differences with the three-dimensional (SCKN) inequality that was recently investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a continuation of our earlier work [14] on the Monge-Amp\`ere obstacle problem \[ \det D^2 v = v^q \chi_{\{v&gt;0\}}, \quad v \geq 0 \text{ convex} \] with $q \in [0,n)$, where we studied the regularity of the strictly convex part of the free boundary.
  In this work, we examine the non-strictly convex part of the free boundary and establish optimal dimension bounds for its flat portion. Additionally, we investigate the strong maximum principle and a stability property for this Monge-Amp\`ere obstacle problem.</description>

      <title>MHS equilibria in the non-resistive limit to the randomly forced resistive magnetic relaxation equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider randomly forced resistive magnetic relaxation equations (MRE) with resistivity $\kappa&gt;0$ and a force proportional to $\sqrt{\kappa}\ $ on the flat $d$-torus $\mathbb{T}^{d}$ for $d\geq 2$. We show the path-wise global well-posedness of the system and the existence of the invariant measures, and construct a random magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equilibrium $B(x)$ in $H^{1}(\mathbb{T}^{d})$ with law $D(B)=\mu$ as a non-resistive limit $\kappa\to 0$ of statistically stationary solutions $B_{\kappa}(x,t)$. For $d=2$, the measure $\mu$ does not concentrate on any compact sets in $H^{1}(\mathbb{T}^{2})$ with finite Hausdorff dimension. In particular, all realizations of the random MHS equilibrium $B(x)$ are almost surely not finite Fourier mode solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit a family of second-order hyperbolic differential operators presenting spectral transition of the Hamilton map. As a consequence we prove that the Cauchy problem is not locally solvable at the origin in Gevrey classes of order greater than some fixed value. The main feature of these operators is that they may all have bicharacteristics tangent to the double manifold.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a resonant system comprising $N$ closely packed spherical resonators ($N&gt;2$). We analyze how the spatial arrangement of these resonators influences the distribution of resonant frequencies, focusing on leading-order terms. Furthermore, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of resonant modes linked to their respective frequencies. Our results demonstrate distinct trends across configurations: For single-row alignment, the system exhibits $N$ clearly separated resonant frequencies; For multi-row arrangements, the resonant frequency range broadens, though the total number of frequencies may diminish; while for ring configurations, comparable frequency ranges to chain arrangements emerge, but with fewer resonant frequencies. We derive explicit analytical expressions to quantify these frequency distributions. Regarding resonant modes, we identify that at specific frequencies, the gradient of these modes may exhibit different asymptotic behavior between different resonators.</description>

      <title>Averaged models for compressible two-phase stratified flows on thin domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the derivation of compressible two-phase flow models. We use a thin domain approximation of a two-layer configuration governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, following the works [H. B. Stewart and B. Wendroff, J. Comp. Phys., 56 (1984)] and [V. H. Ransom and D. L. Hicks, J. Comput. Phys., 75 (1988)]. In order to recover source terms and two-velocity models directly from this asymptotic analysis, we remove the continuity of the tangential component of the velocity at the interface, and properly scale friction and viscosity coefficients. We are then able to derive two-velocity one-pressure models, first in the barotropic case and then in the full Navier-Stokes-Fourier case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the one dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is globally well posed in $L^p$ for $2\le p &lt;13/6$. In particular, we prove that the global solution enjoys the persistence property for a twisted variable at any time, which implies the result is a natural exetension of the classical global well-posedness in $L^2$ to $L^p$. The proof exploits the data-decomposition argument originally developed by Vargas-Vega in the functional framework introduced by Zhou.</description>

      <title>Boundary Control for Wildfire Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a feedback control strategy to protect vulnerable areas from wildfires. We consider a system of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) that models heat propagation and fuel depletion in wildfires and study two cases. First, when the wind velocity is known, we design a Neumann-type boundary controller guaranteeing that the temperature of some protected region converges exponentially, in the $L^2$ norm, to the ambient temperature. Second, when the wind velocity is unknown, we design an adaptive Neumann-type boundary controller guaranteeing the asymptotic convergence, in the $L^2$ norm, of the temperature of the protected region to the ambient temperature. In both cases, the controller acts along the boundary of the protected region and relies solely on temperature measurements along that boundary. Our results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Pohozaev-type identities for classes of quasilinear elliptic local and nonlocal equations and systems, with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish Pohozaev-type identities for a class of quasilinear elliptic equations and systems involving both local and nonlocal $p$-Laplace operators. Specifically, we obtain these identities in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for the purely anisotropic $p$-Laplace equations, the purely fractional $p$-Laplace equations, as well as for equations that incorporate both anisotropic and fractional $p$-Laplace features. We also extend these results to the corresponding systems. To the best of our knowledge, the identities we derive in the mixed case are new even when $p=2$. Finally, we illustrate some of the applications of our main results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the semilinear wave equation with potential on weighted graphs. We establish sufficient conditions for the nonexistence of global-in-time solutions. Both nonnegative and sign-changing solutions are considered. In particular, the proof for sign-changing solutions relies on a novel technique for this type of result.</description>

      <title>Unbounded sets of solutions of non-cooperative elliptic systems on symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to show that, for a class of non-cooperative elliptic systems on compact symmetric spaces, any continuum of nontrivial solutions bifurcating from the set of trivial solutions is unbounded. The main tool is the degree for invariant strongly indefinite functionals. The analysis relies on the torus-equivariant structure of the Laplace--Beltrami eigenspaces. The result is obtained by ruling out return to the trivial branch in an equivariant version of the Rabinowitz alternative.</description>

      <title>New Trends in Kinetic Theory Towards the Complexity of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of a mathematics for living systems is one of the most challenging prospects of this century. The search began with the pioneering contribution of Ilia Prigogine, who developed methods from statistical physics to describe the dynamics of vehicular traffic. This visionary seminal research contribution has given rise to a great deal of research activity, which began at the end of the last century and has been further developed in this century by several authors who have developed mathematical methods, generally focused on applications. These methods are somewhat inspired by the classical kinetic theory, but significant differences have led to the concept of active particles and to a kinetic theory that is ultimately very different from the classical theory. Different approaches have been developed, each of which is in some way an alternative to the others. This paper develops a critical analysis of the scientific activity after Prigogine with the aim of developing a unified mathematical theory, taking into account the conceivable interactions that a mathematical theory of living systems can have with studies of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Stability of Stochastically Driven Couette Flow in 2D with Navier Boundary Conditions at high Reynolds number via Averaging Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the behavior of stochastic Navier-Stokes on $\mathbb{T} \times [-1,1]$ with Navier boundary conditions at high Reynolds number when initialized near Couette flow subject to small additive stochastic forcing. We take additive noise of strength $\nu^{1/2+} \Phi dV_t + \nu^{2/3+\alpha} \Psi dW_t$, where $\Phi dV_t$ has spatial correlation in $H_0^3$ and acts only on $x$-independent modes of the vorticity, while $\Psi dW_t$ has spatial correlation in a lower order, anisotropic, Sobolev space $\mathcal{H}$ and acts on $x$-dependent-modes. We take the initial $x$-independent modes in the perturbation to be small in $H_0^3$ in a $\nu$-independent sense, while the non-zero $x$-modes are taken to be $O(\nu^{1/2 + \alpha})$ in $\mathcal{H}$. Letting $\omega$ solve the resulting perturbation equation, we split $\omega$ into the zero $x$-modes $\omega_0$ and the non-zero $x$-modes $\omega_{\neq}$. We demonstrate an averaging principle holds wherein $\omega_{\neq}$ is the fast variable and $\omega_0$ is the slow variable, deriving a closed nonlinear evolution equation on $\omega_0$ that holds over long time-scales (while the fast $\omega_{\neq}$ modes solve a `pseudo-linearized' equation to leading order with dynamics dominated by inviscid damping and enhanced dissipation). This work can also be considered the stochastic analogue of the stability threshold problem for shear flows.</description>

      <title>Dispersive estimates for Dirac Operators in dimension four with obstructions at threshold energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate $L^1\to L^\infty$ dispersive estimates for the Dirac equation with a potential in four spatial dimensions. We classify the structure of the obstructions at the thresholds as being composed of an at most two dimensional space of resonances per threshold, and finitely many eigenfunctions. Similar to the Schr\"odinger evolution, we prove the natural $t^{-2}$ decay rate when the thresholds are regular. When there is a threshold resonance or eigenvalue, we show that there is a time dependent, finite rank operator satisfying $\|F_t\|_{L^1\to L^\infty}\lesssim (\log t)^{-1}$ for $t&gt;2$ such that $$
  \|e^{it\mathcal H}P(\mathcal H)-F_t\|_{L^1\to L^\infty}\lesssim t^{-1} \quad \text{for } t&gt;2, $$ with $P$ a projection onto a subspace of the absolutely continuous spectrum in a small neighborhood of the thresholds. We further show that the operator $F_t=0$ if there is a threshold eigenvalue but no threshold resonance. We pair this with high energy bounds for the evolution and provide a complete description of the dispersive bounds.</description>

      <title>Mass inflation from rough initial data for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system with $\Lambda$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent rigorous results on black hole interiors clearly suggest that the strong cosmic censorship conjecture fails in its most fundamental, i.e. weak, formulation: violations are expected for a class of spherically symmetric charged black holes in the presence of a positive cosmological constant near extremality. These results require sufficiently regular solutions. Conversely, when non-smooth, finite-energy initial data are prescribed for linear waves propagating on a fixed black hole background belonging to the aforementioned family, it was shown that the local energy of these linear waves blows up at the Cauchy horizon, hence hinting that non-smooth initial data may suppress the possible violations of the $H^1$ formulation of strong cosmic censorship. In line with this intuition, we prove that rough initial data can also trigger an instability at the Cauchy horizon in the non-linear setting, via mass inflation. In particular, we analyse a characteristic initial value problem for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-real scalar field system describing the interior of a black hole. Our results show that, when prescribing 1) initial data asymptotically approaching those of a sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter solution, and 2) initial data belonging to $W^{1, 2}\setminus W^{1, q}$, for every $q &gt; 2$, along the initial ingoing compact segment; then the Hawking mass diverges at the Cauchy horizon of the black hole solution we construct, for every parameter choice of the reference black hole. In this larger family of configurations, we prove that the smooth data suggesting violations of strong cosmic censorship are non-generic in a ``positive co-dimension'' sense, conditionally to the validity of the expected Price law bounds. Moreover, we illustrate the transition between smooth and rough initial data.</description>

      <title>On the domains of first order differential operators on the Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the first order structure of $L^2$-differential one-forms on the Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket. We consider piecewise energy finite functions related to one-forms, normal parts, and show self-similarity properties of one-forms as in the case of energy finite functions on the Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket. We introduce first order differential operators, taking functions into functions, that can be understood as total derivatives with respect to some reference function or form. The main result is a pointwise representation result for certain elements in the domain of said first order differential operator by a ratio of normal derivatives. At last we provide three classes of examples in the domain of said first order differential operator with different types of discontinuities.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Nonlinear Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes are meant as an introduction to the theory of nonlinear spectral theory. We will discuss the variational form of nonlninear eigenvalue problems and the corresponding non-linear Euler--Lagrange equations, as well as connections with gradient flows. For the latter ones, we will give precise conditions for finite time extinction and discuss convergence rates. We will use this theory to study asymptotic behaviour of nonlinear PDEs and present applications in $L^\infty$ variational problems. Finally we will discuss numerical methods for solving gradient flows and computing nonlinear eigenfunctions based on a nonlinear power method. Our main tools are convex analysis and calculus of variations, necessary background on which will be provided. It is expected that the reader is familiar with Hilbert spaces; familiarity with Banach spaces is beneficial but not strictly necessary. The notes are based on the lectures taught by the authors at the universities of Bonn and Cambridge in 2022.</description>

      <title>Superlinear Drift in Consensus-Based Optimization with Condensation Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consensus-based optimization (CBO) is a class of metaheuristic algorithms designed for global optimization problems. In the many-particle limit, classical CBO dynamics can be rigorously connected to mean-field equations that ensure convergence toward global minimizers under suitable conditions. In this work, we draw inspiration from recent extensions of the Kaniadakis--Quarati model for indistinguishable bosons to develop a novel CBO method governed by a system of SDEs with superlinear drift and nonconstant diffusion. The resulting mean-field formulation in one dimension exhibits condensation-like phenomena, including finite-time blow-up and loss of $L^2$-regularity. To avoid the curse of dimensionality a marginal based formulation which permits to leverage the one-dimensional results to multiple dimensions is proposed. We support our approach with numerical experiments that highlight both its consistency and potential performance improvements compared to classical CBO methods.</description>

      <title>Refined bilinear Strichartz estimates with application to the well-posedness of periodic generalized KdV type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve our previous result [L. Molinet and T. Tanaka, Unconditional well-posedness for some nonlinear periodic one-dimensional dispersive equations, J. Funct. Anal. 283 (2022), 109490] on the Cauchy problem for one dimensional dispersive equations with a quite general nonlinearity in the periodic setting. Under the same hypotheses that the dispersive operator behaves for high frequencies as a Fourier multiplier by $ i |\xi|^\alpha \xi $ with $ 1 \le \alpha\le 2 $, and that the nonlinear term is of the form $ \partial_x f(u) $ where $f $ is a real analytic function whose Taylor series around the origin has an infinite radius of convergence, we prove the unconditional LWP of the Cauchy problem in $H^s(\mathbb{T}) $ for $ s\ge 1-\frac{\alpha}{4} $ with $ s&gt;1/2 $. It is worth noting that this result is optimal in the case $\alpha=2$ (generalized KdV equation) in view of the restriction $ s&gt;1/2 $ for the continuous injection of $ H^s(\mathbb{T}) $ into $ L^\infty(\mathbb{T}) $. Our main new ingredient is the replacement of refined Strichartz estimates with refined bilinear estimates in the treatment of the worst resonant interactions. Such refined bilinear estimates already appeared in the work of Hani in the context of Schr\"odinger equations on a compact manifold. Finally, the main theorem yields global existence results for $ \alpha \in [4/3,2] $.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study the semiclassical asymptotics of the Martinet sub-Laplacian on the flat toroidal cylinder $M = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}^2$. We describe the asymptotic distribution of sequences of eigenfunctions oscillating at different scales prefixed by Rothschild-Stein estimates via the introduction of adapted two-microlocal semiclassical measures. We obtain concentration and invariance properties of these measures in terms of effective dynamics governed by harmonic or an-harmonic oscillators depending on the regime, and we show additional regularity properties with respect to critical points of the eigenvalues of the Montgomery family of quartic oscillators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a weakly non-linear Fokker-Planck equation with BGK heat thermostats in a spatially bounded domain with conservative Maxwell boundary conditions, presenting a space-dependent accommodation coefficient and a space-dependent temperature on the spatial boundary. The model is based from a problem introduced in [E. A. Carlen, R. Esposito, J. L. Lebowitz, R. Marra, and C. Mouhot. Approach to the steady state in kinetic models with thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. J. Stat. Phys., 172(2):522--543, 2018] where the authors studied the properties of the non-equilibrium steady states for non-linear kinetic Fokker-Planck equations with BGK thermostats in the torus. We generalize those results for bounded domains using the recent results presented in [K. Carrapatoso, P. Gabriel, R. Medina, and S. Mischler. Constructive krein-rutman result for kinetic Fokker-Planck equations in a domain, 2024] for the study of general kinetic Fokker-Planck equations with Maxwell boundary conditions. More precisely, in a weakly non-linear regime, we obtain the existence of a non-equilibrium steady state and its stability in the perturbative regime. .</description>

      <title>Precise asymptotics of the spin $+2$ Teukolsky field in the Kerr black hole interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a purely physical-space analysis, we prove the precise oscillatory blow-up asymptotics of the spin $+2$ Teukolsky field in the interior of a subextremal Kerr black hole. In particular, this work gives a new proof of the blueshift instability of the Kerr Cauchy horizon against linearized gravitational perturbations that was first shown by Sbierski \cite{sbierski}. In that sense, this work supports the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture in Kerr spacetimes. The proof is an extension to the Teukolsky equation of the work \cite{scalarMZ} by Ma and Zhang that treats the scalar wave equation in the interior of Kerr. The analysis relies on the generic polynomial decay on the event horizon of solutions of the Teukolsky equation that arise from compactly supported initial data, as recently proved by Ma and Zhang \cite{pricelaw} and Millet \cite{millet} in subextremal Kerr.</description>

Abstract: We study the convergence of semilinear parabolic stochastic evolution equations, posed on a sequence of Banach spaces approximating a limiting space and driven by additive white noise projected onto the former spaces. Under appropriate uniformity and convergence conditions on the linear operators, nonlinear drifts and initial data, we establish convergence of the associated mild solution processes when lifted to a common state space. Our framework is applied to the case where the limiting problem is a stochastic partial differential equation whose linear part is a generalized Whittle-Mat\'ern operator on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$, discretized by a sequence of graphs constructed from a (random) point cloud. In this setting we obtain various discrete-to-continuum convergence results for solutions lifted to $L^q(\mathcal{M})$ for $q \in [2,\infty]$, one of which recovers the $L^\infty$-convergence of a finite-difference discretization of certain (fractional) stochastic Allen-Cahn equations.</description>

      <title>Accurate semiclassical analysis of light propagation on tilted hyperplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the scalar light model given by Helmholtz' equation in R^{1+d} , we consider the transformation of an initial scene (a hologram) in {0}xR^d by an arbitrary affine transformation (which can be viewed as a propagation into a tilted hyperplane). In the high frequency regime, we use microlocal and semiclassical analysis to describe the propagator as a semiclassical Fourier integral operator, thus generalising the well-known Angular Spectrum formula from optics. We then prove new precise Egorov theorems, including subprincipal terms, which indicate how to take into account the propagation along rays of geometric optics.</description>

      <title>BridgeNet: A Hybrid, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of rotationally invariant polynomial root sets under iterated differentiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We associate to an $N$-sample of a given rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_0$ with compact support in the complex plane, a polynomial $P_N$ with roots given by the sample. Then, for $t \in (0,1)$, we consider the empirical measure $\mu_t^{N}$ associated to the root set of the $\lfloor t N\rfloor$-th derivative of $P_N$. A question posed by O'Rourke and Steinerberger [21], reformulated as a conjecture by Hoskins and Kabluchko [10], and recently reaffirmed by Campbell, O'Rourke and Renfrew [5], states that under suitable conditions of regularity on $\mu_0$, for an i.i.d. sample, $\mu_t^{N}$ converges to a rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_t$ when $N$ tends to infinity, and that $(1-t)\mu_t$ has a radial density $x \mapsto \psi(x,t)$ satisfying the following partial differential equation:
  \begin{equation} \label{PDErotational}
  \frac{ \partial \psi(x,t) }{\partial t} = \frac{ \partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{ \psi(x,t) }{ \frac{1}{x} \int_0^x \psi(y,t) dy } \right).
  \end{equation} In [10], this equation is reformulated as an equation on the distribution function $\Psi_t$ of the radial part of $(1-t) \mu_t$: \begin{equation} \label{equationPsixtabstract} \frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial t} = x \frac{\frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial x} } {\Psi_t(x)} - 1. \end{equation} Restricting our study to a specific family of $N$-samplings, we are able to prove a variant of the conjecture above. We also emphasize the important differences between the two-dimensional setting and the one-dimensional setting, illustrated in our Theorem 2.1.</description>
