      <title>Length spectrum of periodic rays for billard flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study for several compact strictly convex disjoint obstacles the length spectrum $\mathcal L$ formed by the lengths of all primitive periodic reflecting rays. We prove the existence of sequences $\{\ell_j\},\: \{m_j\}$ with $\ell_j \in \mathcal L,\: m_j \in \mathbb N$ such that the condition (LB) related to the dynamical zeta function $\eta_D(s)$ is satisfied. This condition implies the existence of lower bounds for the number of the scattering resonances for Dirichlet Laplacian. We construct such sequences under some separation condition for a small subset of $\mathcal L$ corresponding to lengths of the periodic rays with even reflexions. Our separation condition is weaker than the assumption of exponentially separated length spectrum $\mathcal L.$ Moreover, we show that the periodic orbits in the phase space are exponentially separated.</description>

      <title>Indirect Reciprocity with Environmental Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity maintains cooperation in stranger societies by mapping individual behaviors onto reputation signals via social norms. Existing theoretical frameworks assume static environments with constant resources and fixed payoff structures. However, in real-world systems, individuals' strategic behaviors not only shape their reputation but also induce collective-level resource changes in ecological, economic, or other external environments, which in turn reshape the incentives governing future individual actions. To overcome this limitation, we establish a co-evolutionary framework that couples moral assessment, strategy updating, and environmental dynamics, allowing the payoff structure to dynamically adjust in response to the ecological consequences of collective actions. We find that this environmental feedback mechanism helps lower the threshold for the emergence of cooperation, enabling the system to spontaneously transition from a low-cooperation state to a stable high-cooperation regime, thereby reducing the dependence on specific initial conditions. Furthermore, while lenient norms demonstrate adaptability in static environments, norms with strict discrimination are shown to be crucial for curbing opportunism and maintaining evolutionary resilience in dynamic settings. Our results reveal the evolutionary dynamics of coupled systems involving reputation institutions and environmental constraints, offering a new theoretical perspective for understanding collective cooperation and social governance in complex environments.</description>

      <title>A Distinct Communication Strategies Model of the Double Empathy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double empathy problem recasts the difficulty of forming empathy bonds in social interactions between autistic and neurotypical individuals as a bidirectional problem, rather than due to a deficit exclusive to the person on the spectrum. However, no explicit mechanism to explain such a phenomenon has been proposed. Here we build a feedback-loop mathematical model that would theoretically induce the empathy degradation observed during communication in neurotypical-autistic pairs solely due to differences in communication preferences between neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals. Numerical simulations of dyadic interactions show the model, whose mechanism is based solely on communication preferences, can illustrate the breakdown of empathic bonding observed clinically. Stability analysis of the model provides a way to predict the overall trajectory of the interaction in the empathy space. Furthermore, we suggest experimental designs to measure several parameters outlined here and discuss the future directions for testing the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Propagation for Non-Conservative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a physics-inspired learning algorithm that uses stationary states of a dynamical system both for inference and learning. In its original formulation it is limited to conservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ to dynamics which derive from an energy function. Given their importance in applications, it is important to extend EP to nonconservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ systems with non-reciprocal interactions. Previous attempts to generalize EP to such systems failed to compute the exact gradient of the cost function. Here we propose a framework that extends EP to arbitrary nonconservative systems, including feedforward networks. We keep the key property of equilibrium propagation, namely the use of stationary states both for inference and learning. However, we modify the dynamics in the learning phase by a term proportional to the non-reciprocal part of the interaction so as to obtain the exact gradient of the cost function. This algorithm can also be derived using a variational formulation that generates the learning dynamics through an energy function defined over an augmented state space. Numerical experiments using the MNIST database show that this algorithm achieves better performance and learns faster than previous proposals.</description>

      <title>Point Vortex Dynamics on Closed Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of point vortex dynamics has existed since Kirchhoff's proposal in 1891 and is still under development with connections to many fields in mathematics. As a strong simplification of the concept of vorticity it excels in computational speed for vorticity based fluid simulations at the cost of accuracy. Recent finding by Stefanella Boatto and Jair Koiller allowed the extension of this theory on to closed surfaces. A comprehensive guide to point vortex dynamics on closed surfaces with genus zero and vanishing total vorticity is presented here. Additionally fundamental knowledge of fluid dynamics and surfaces are explained in a way to unify the theory of point vortex dynamics of the plane, the sphere and closed surfaces together with implementation details and supplement material.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap for Pollicott-Ruelle resonances on random coverings of Anosov surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian surface with Anosov geodesic flow. We prove the existence of a spectral gap for Pollicott--Ruelle resonances on random finite coverings of $M$ in the limit of large degree, which is expected to be optimal. The proof combines the recent strong convergence results of Magee, Puder and van Handel for permutation representations of surface groups with an analysis of the spherical mean operator on the universal cover of $M$.</description>

      <title>Emergent structures in coupled opinion and network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a model of opinion formation on an adaptive social network, consisting of a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for individuals' opinions and corresponding network edge weights. A key driver of the system's behaviour is the form of the interaction function, which determines the strength of interactions based on the distance between individuals' opinions and appears in both opinion and network dynamics. Two cases are examined: in the first the interaction function is always positive and in the second case the interaction function is of bounded-confidence type. In both cases there is positive feedback between opinion clustering and the emergence of community structure in the social network. This is confirmed through analytical results on long-term behaviour, extending existing results for a fixed network, as well as through numerical simulations. Transient network dynamics are also examined through a short-time approximation that captures the `typical' early network dynamics. Each approach improves some aspect of our understanding of the interplay between opinion and network evolution.</description>

      <title>Factor-balancedness, linear recurrence, and factor complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of infinite words, various notions of balancedness provide quantitative measures for how regularly letters or factors occur, and they find applications in several areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science. In this paper, we study factor-balancedness and uniform factor-balancedness, making two main contributions. First, we establish general sufficient conditions for an infinite word to be (uniformly) factor-balanced, applicable in particular to any given linearly recurrent word. These conditions are formulated in terms of $\mathcal{S}$-adic representations and generalize results of Adamczewski on primitive substitutive words, which show that balancedness of length-2 factors already implies uniform factor-balancedness. As an application of our criteria, we characterize the Sturmian words and ternary Arnoux--Rauzy words that are uniformly factor-balanced as precisely those with bounded weak partial quotients. Our second main contribution is a study of the relationship between factor-balancedness and factor complexity. In particular, we analyze the non-primitive substitutive case and construct an example of a factor-balanced word with exponential factor complexity, thereby making progress on a question raised in 2025 by Arnoux, Berth\'e, Minervino, Steiner, and Thuswaldner on the relation between balancedness and discrete spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable infinite discrete group. We show that a subset $F$ of $G$ contains a return time set of some piecewise syndetic recurrent point $x$ in a compact Hausdorff space $X$ with a $G$-action if and only if $F$ is a quasi-central set. As an application, we show that if a nonempty closed subsemigroup $S$ of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification $\beta G$ contains the smallest ideal $K(\beta G)$ of $\beta G$ then $S$-product recurrent is equivalent to distality, which partially answers a question of Auslander and Furstenberg (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 343, 1994, 221--232).</description>

Abstract: We show that, on a standard non-atomic probability space, invertible measure-preserving transformations form a dense $G_\delta$ subset of the space of all measure-preserving transformations endowed with the strong (=weak) operator topology. This implies that all properties which are generic for invertible transformations are also generic for general ones.</description>

      <title>Emergent order spectrum for transitive homeomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Emergent Order Spectrum $\Omega(x,y)$ is a topological invariant of dynamical systems providing order-types induced by the limit order of order-compatible nested $\varepsilon_n$-chains (with $\varepsilon_n\to 0$) from $x$ to $y$. In this paper, we investigate how rich these spectra can be under natural dynamical hypotheses. For a transitive homeomorphism $f$ of a compact metric space $X$ without isolated points and of cardinality $\mathfrak{c}$, we show that the global spectrum $\Omega_f(X^2)$ is universal at the countable scattered level: every countable scattered order-type together with the order-type of the rationals appears in $\Omega_f(X^2)$. More precisely, there exists a comeagre subset $M\subseteq X^2$ such that, for every $(x,y)\in M$, the individual spectrum $\Omega_f(x,y)$ already realizes all countably infinite scattered order-types; moreover, the order-type of the rationals belongs to $\Omega_f(x,y)$ for every pair $(x,y)\in X^2$.</description>

      <title>Smooth Fractal Trees: Analytic Generators and Discrete Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for constructing fractal trees via analytic generator fields, replacing discrete affine transformations and symbolic rewriting rules by the integration of smooth vector fields in an internal state space. In this setting, geometric curves are obtained as projections of generator trajectories, and branching is implemented as a primitive operation through exact inheritance of generator state.
  At every finite depth, the resulting structure is a finite union of analytic curve segments that is smooth across branch events. Two structural results relate this generator-driven construction to classical discrete models of tree-based fractals. First, a combinatorial universality theorem shows that any discrete tree specification, including those arising from iterated function systems and L-systems, can be compiled into an analytic generator tree whose induced discrete scaffold is isomorphic at every finite depth. Second, under standard contractive assumptions, a canopy set equivalence theorem establishes that the accumulation set of analytic branch endpoints coincides with the attractor of the corresponding discrete construction.
  These results separate local geometric regularity from global fractal complexity, showing that fractality is determined by recursive branching and scaling rather than by local non-smoothness. The framework provides a smooth representation of tree-based fractals that preserves both their finite combinatorial structure and their asymptotic limit geometry.</description>
