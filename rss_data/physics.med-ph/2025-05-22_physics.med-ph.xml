      <title>LET-modifying joint optimization for mixed-modality photon-proton treatment planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As depth increases, linear energy transfer (LET) rises toward the distal edge of the Bragg peak, boosting the radiobiological effectiveness (RBE). To manage the biological variation and limit normal-tissue damage, LET-modifying objective functions on, e.g., dose-weighted LET or dirty dose and/or usage of variable RBE models were introduced. Because shaping LET by proton irradiation alone has its limits, this work proposes to jointly optimize mixed-modality proton-photon treatments based on directly LET-modifying objective functions. The investigated objective functions rely on either dose-weighted LET or dirty dose concepts. To formulate a consistent combined optimization problem, the contribution of secondary electron LET in photon treatments is considered (and discussed) as well. Combined dose/LET calculation and optimization are realized in the open source toolkit matRad. Phantom plans as well as a patient plans are optimized for analysis on the method, combining five proton fractions with 25 photon fractions. Dose-optimized combined plans are used as a reference. The reference plan shows that protons are, in general, dosimetrically superior and thus preferred, with photons aiding in achieving conformity. The introduction of LET modified objectives locally modifies the proton contribution in the targeted regions of interest. Especially at the distal edge, the photon contribution increases to move high-LET/dirty dose out of the OARs. Dirty dose objectives seem to allow a more comprehensive steering of the high-LET regions compared to LETxDose. Incorporating LET-based objectives into a jointly optimized proton-photon system allows for improved dose conformity and reduced high-LET exposure in critical regions in proximity to the distal proton edge. This approach enables the utilization of modality-specific strengths and can contribute to safer, more effective treatment plans.</description>

      <title>In Silico Trials for Sex-Specific patient Inclusion Criteria in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy: Advancing Precision in Heart Failure Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) guidelines are based on clinical trials with limited female representation and inconsistent left bundle branch block (LBBB) definitions. Conventional QRS duration (QRSd) criteria show variable diagnostic accuracy between sexes, partly due to differences in heart size and remodeling. We evaluated the influence of sex, heart size, LBBB, and conduction delay on QRSd and assessed the diagnostic performance of conventional and indexed QRSd criteria using a population-based modelling approach. Simulated QRSd were derived from electrophysiological simulations conducted in 2627 UK Biobank healthy participants and 359 patients with ischemic heart disease, by modelling LBBB and normal activation combined with/without conduction delay. QRSd criteria under-selected LBBB females and over-selected non-LBBB patients. Indexing by LVEDV and LV mass reduced sex disparities but increased the over-selection in non-LBBB patients. Height-indexed QRSd effectively resolved sex differences and maintained low non-LBBB selection rates, demonstrating superior performance and potential for more equitable CRT selection.</description>

      <title>Federated prediction for scalable and privacy-preserved knowledge-based planning in radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Deep learning has potential to improve the efficiency and consistency of radiation therapy planning, but clinical adoption is hindered by the limited model generalizability due to data scarcity and heterogeneity among institutions. Although aggregating data from different institutions could alleviate this problem, data sharing is a practical challenge due to concerns about patient data privacy and other technical obstacles. Purpose: This work aims to address this dilemma by developing FedKBP+, a comprehensive federated learning (FL) platform for predictive tasks in real-world applications in radiotherapy treatment planning. Methods: We implemented a unified communication stack based on Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) to support communication between participants whether located on the same workstation or distributed across multiple workstations. In addition to supporting the centralized FL strategies commonly available in existing open-source frameworks, FedKBP+ also provides a fully decentralized FL model where participants directly exchange model weights to each other through Peer-to-Peer communication. We evaluated FedKBP+ on three predictive tasks using scale-attention network (SA-Net) as the predictive model. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that FedKBP+ is highly effective, efficient and robust, showing great potential as a federated learning platform for radiation therapy.</description>

      <title>ComBAT Harmonization for diffusion MRI: Challenges and Best Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the years, ComBAT has become the standard method for harmonizing MRI-derived measurements, with its ability to compensate for site-related additive and multiplicative biases while preserving biological variability. However, ComBAT relies on a set of assumptions that, when violated, can result in flawed harmonization. In this paper, we thoroughly review ComBAT's mathematical foundation, outlining these assumptions, and exploring their implications for the demographic composition necessary for optimal results.
  Through a series of experiments involving a slightly modified version of ComBAT called Pairwise-ComBAT tailored for normative modeling applications, we assess the impact of various population characteristics, including population size, age distribution, the absence of certain covariates, and the magnitude of additive and multiplicative factors. Based on these experiments, we present five essential recommendations that should be carefully considered to enhance consistency and supporting reproducibility, two essential factors for open science, collaborative research, and real-life clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Virtual Fluoroscopy for Interventional Guidance using Magnetic Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: In conventional fluoroscopy-guided interventions, the 2D projective nature of X-ray imaging limits depth perception and leads to prolonged radiation exposure. Virtual fluoroscopy, combined with spatially tracked surgical instruments, is a promising strategy to mitigate these limitations. While magnetic tracking shows unique advantages, particularly in tracking flexible instruments, it remains under-explored due to interference from ferromagnetic materials in the C-arm room. This work proposes a virtual fluoroscopy workflow by effectively integrating magnetic tracking, and demonstrates its clinical efficacy. Methods: An automatic virtual fluoroscopy workflow was developed using a radiolucent tabletop field generator prototype. Specifically, we developed a fluoro-CT registration approach with automatic 2D-3D shared landmark correspondence to establish the C-arm-patient relationship, along with a general C-arm modelling approach to calculate desired poses and generate corresponding virtual fluoroscopic images. Results: Testing on a dataset with views ranging from RAO 90 degrees to LAO 90 degrees, simulated fluoroscopic images showed visually imperceptible differences from the real ones, achieving a mean target projection distance error of 1.55 mm. An endoleak phantom insertion experiment highlighted the effectiveness of simulating multiplanar views with real-time instrument overlays, achieving a mean needle tip error of 3.42 mm. Conclusions: Results demonstrated the efficacy of virtual fluoroscopy integrated with magnetic tracking, improving depth perception during navigation. The broad capture range of virtual fluoroscopy showed promise in improving the users understanding of X-ray imaging principles, facilitating more efficient image acquisition.</description>

      <title>A Generative Diffusion Model to Solve Inverse Problems for Robust in-NICU Neonatal MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first acquisition-agnostic diffusion generative model for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to solve a range of inverse problems for shortening scan time and improving motion robustness. In-NICU MRI scanners leverage permanent magnets at lower field-strengths (i.e., below 1.5 Tesla) for non-invasive assessment of potential brain abnormalities during the critical phase of early live development, but suffer from long scan times and motion artifacts. In this setting, training data sizes are small and intrinsically suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This work trains a diffusion probabilistic generative model using such a real-world training dataset of clinical neonatal MRI by applying several novel signal processing and machine learning methods to handle the low SNR and low quantity of data. The model is then used as a statistical image prior to solve various inverse problems at inference time without requiring any retraining. Experiments demonstrate the generative model's utility for three real-world applications of neonatal MRI: accelerated reconstruction, motion correction, and super-resolution.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for improving radiomic-based models in radiation pneumonitis prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Radiation pneumonitis is a side effect of thoracic radiation therapy. Recently, machine learning models with radiomic features have improved radiation pneumonitis prediction by capturing spatial information. To further support clinical decision-making, this study explores the role of post hoc uncertainty quantification methods in enhancing model uncertainty estimate. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 101 esophageal cancer patients. This study evaluated four machine learning models: logistic regression, support vector machines, extreme gradient boosting, and random forest, using 15 dosimetric, 79 dosiomic, and 237 radiomic features to predict radiation pneumonitis. We applied uncertainty quantification methods, including Platt scaling, isotonic regression, Venn-ABERS predictor, and conformal prediction, to quantify uncertainty. Model performance was assessed through an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and adaptive calibration error using leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: Highest AUROC is achieved by the logistic regression model with the conformal prediction method (AUROC 0.75+-0.01, AUPRC 0.74+-0.01) at a certainty cut point of 0.8. Highest AUPRC of 0.82+-0.02 (with AUROC of 0.67+-0.04) achieved by The extreme gradient boosting model with conformal prediction at the 0.9 certainty threshold. Radiomic and dosiomic features improve both discriminative and calibration performance. Conclusions: Integrating uncertainty quantification into machine learning models with radiomic and dosiomic features may improve both predictive accuracy and calibration, supporting more reliable clinical decision-making. The findings emphasize the value of uncertainty quantification methods in enhancing applicability of predictive models for radiation pneumonitis in healthcare settings.</description>
