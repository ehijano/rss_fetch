      <title>Functional Limits of Generalized Jackson Networks in Multi-scale Heavy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the functional limits of generalized Jackson networks in a multi-scale heavy traffic regime where stations approach full utilization at distinct, separated rates. Our main result shows that the appropriately scaled queue length processes converge weakly to a limit process whose coordinates are mutually independent. This finding provides the fundamental dynamic mechanism that explains the asymptotic independence previously observed only in stationary distributions. The specific form of the limit processes is shown to depend on the initial conditions. Moreover, we introduce and analyze a blockwise multi-scale heavy traffic regime. In this regime, the network's stations are partitioned into blocks, where stations in different blocks approach the heavy traffic at different rates, while stations within the same block share a common rate. We obtain the functional limits in this regime as well, showing that the limit process exhibits blockwise independence.</description>

      <title>Properties of the full replica symmetry breaking free energy functional of the Ising spin glass on random regular graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the full replica symmetry breaking (full--RSB) free energy functional for the Ising spin glass on a random regular graph proposed by the author in \cite{MyPaper}. We prove that the full--RSB formulation provides an improvement over any replica symmetry breaking approximation with a finite number of steps (finite--RSB), based on the M\'ezard-Parisi ansatz \cite{ParMezRRG1}. We provide a representation of that functional as the unique solution to a well-posed backward stochastic differential equation. This stochastic formulation enables a refined analysis of the functional and the computation of the derivatives with respect to the order parameters of the model. The techniques developed here hold potential interest for broader areas such as calculus of variations, stochastic optimal control, and functional analysis.</description>

      <title>Boolean and Free Symmetrization of Bernoulli Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17112v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study variance bounds under symmetry constraints in classical, free, and Boolean probability. Starting from the classical fact that for a Bernoulli random variable $X$ and an independent $Y$ with $X+Y$ symmetric about $0$, one must have $\mathrm{Var}(Y)\geq pq$, we establish exact analogues in the free and Boolean settings. Using projections as the noncommutative counterpart of Bernoulli variables, we prove that the same bound persists for freely and Boolean independent symmetrizers. These results not only unify variance inequalities across different probabilistic frameworks but also have potential applications in quantum information and noncommutative stochastic modeling.</description>

      <title>A scaling limit theorem for controlled branching processes with a size-divisible term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish general sufficient conditions for a sequence of controlled branching processes to converge weakly on the Skorokhod space. We focus on a class of controlled random variables that extends previous results by considering them as a sum of an immigration size-dependent term and a size-divisible term. Our assumptions are established in terms of the probability generating functions of the offspring and control distributions, distinguishing in this latter case between the immigration and the size-divisible parts. The limit process is a continuous-state process with dependent immigration.</description>

      <title>Existence of nonnegative mild solutions of stochastic evolution inclusions via weak topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the existence of nonnegative mild solutions for stochastic evolution inclusions through a weak topology approach. Precisely, the study focuses on stochastic evolution inclusions characterized by multivalued nonlinearities and perturbed by a Q-Wiener process within a Hilbert space framework. The primary objective is to establish the existence of mild solutions under conditions that ensure sublinear growth for the involved functions and multivalued mappings. By means of the weak topology method, we establish the existence of at least one mild solution in an appropriate function space. Additionally, when the associated semigroup is positive and a specific sign condition is met, we show the existence of nonnegative solutions. The methodological approach involves approximating the problem via truncation on bounded intervals and applying fixed-point theorems in weak topology to extend local solutions to the entire half-line.</description>

      <title>The Free Energy of an Enriched Continuous Random Energy Model in the Weak Correlation Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the proof of the limiting free energy of the continuous random energy model (CREM) using the Hamilton--Jacobi approach for mean-field disordered systems. To achieve this, we introduce an enriched model that interpolates between the CREM and the Ruelle probability cascade. We focus on the weak correlation regime, where the CREM's covariance function $A$ is bounded above by the identity function.
  In the weak correlation regime, we show that the free energy is given by the Hopf formula. The resulting expression is independent of $A$, confirming that in this regime the free energy does not depend on the precise form of the covariance function. Outside of the weak correlation regime, the Hamilton--Jacobi framework no longer applies. Moreover, we provide an example where a formal application of the associated variational principle fails to yield the correct free energy.</description>

      <title>Benford Behavior in Stick Fragmentation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benford's law is the statement that in many real-world data sets, the probability of having digit \(d\) in base \(B\), where \(1 \leq d \leq B\), as the first digit is \(\log_{B}\left(\tfrac{d+1}{d}\right)\). We sometimes refer to this as weak Benford behavior, and we say that a data set exhibits strong Benford behavior in base \(B\) if the probability of having significand at most \(s\), where \(s \in [1,B)\), is \(\log_{B}(s)\). We examine Benford behaviors in the stick fragmentation model. Building on the work on the 1-dimensional stick fragmentation model, we employ combinatorial identities on multinomial coefficients to reduce the high-dimensional stick fragmentation model to the 1-dimensional model and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the lengths of the stick fragments to converge to strong Benford behavior.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the discrete Gaussian free field with degenerate random conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider discrete Gaussian free fields with ergodic random conductances on a class of random subgraphs of $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $d \geq 2$, including i.i.d.\ supercritical percolation clusters, where the conductances are possibly unbounded but satisfy a moment condition. As our main result, we show that, for almost every realization of the environment, the rescaled field converges in law towards a continuum Gaussian free field. We also present a scaling limit for the covariances of the field. To obtain the latter, we establish a quenched local limit theorem for the Green's function of the associated random walk among random conductances with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A law of large numbers for predicting several steps ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note proves a law of large numbers for predicting several steps ahead, which, in the case of uniformly bounded random variables, generalizes the standard law of large numbers for martingales; the standard law of large numbers corresponds to predicting one step ahead. Its main result shows that the law of large numbers holds for predicting $N$ uniformly bounded random variables $o(N)$ steps ahead, but it is much more precise and in some respects optimal. This law of large numbers is applied to a problem of decision making with a bounded loss function limiting the impact of each decision to $o(N)$ steps.</description>

      <title>Strong averaging principle for nonautonomous multi-scale SPDEs with fully local monotone and almost periodic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of nonautonomous multi-scale stochastic partial differential equations with fully local monotone coefficients. By introducing the evolution system of measures for time-inhomogeneous Markov semigroups, we study the averaging principle for such kind of system. Specifically, we first prove the slow component in the multi-scale stochastic system converges strongly to the solution of an averaged equation, whose coefficients retain the dependence of the scaling parameter. Furthermore, if the coefficients satisfy uniformly almost periodic conditions, we establish that the slow component converges strongly to the solution of another averaged equation, whose coefficients are independent of the scaling parameter. The main contribution of this paper extends the basic nonautonomous framework investigated by Cheng and Liu in [11] to a fully coupled framework, as well as the autonomous framework explored by Liu et al. in [27] to the more general nonautonomous framework. Additionally, we improve the locally monotone coefficients discussed in [11,27] to the fully local monotone coefficients, thus our results can be applied to a wide range of cases in nonlinear nonautonomous stochastic partial differential equations, such as multi-scale stochastic Cahn-Hilliard-heat equation and multi-scale stochastic liquid-crystal-porous-media equation.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ be an $N\times n$ random matrix whose entries are coordinates of an isotropic log-concave random vector in $\mathbb{R}^{Nn}$. We prove sharp lower tail estimates for the smallest singular value of $A$ in the following cases: (1) when $N=n$ and $A$ is drawn from an unconditional distribution, with no independence assumption; (2) when the columns of $A$ are independent and $N\geq n$; (3) when $A$ is sufficiently tall, that is $N\geq (1+\lambda)n$ for any positive constant $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Edge Universality for Inhomogeneous Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider symmetric and Hermitian random matrices whose entries are independent and symmetric random variables with an arbitrary variance pattern. Under a novel Short-to-Long Mixing condition, which is sharp in the sense that it precludes a corrected shift at the spectral edge, we establish GOE/GUE edge universality for such inhomogeneous random matrices. This condition effectively reduces the universality problem to verifying the mixing properties of a random walk governed by the variance profile matrix.
  Our universality results are applicable to a remarkably broad class of random matrix ensembles that may be highly inhomogeneous, sparse, or far beyond the mean-field setting of classical random matrix theory. Notable examples include:
  1. Inhomogeneous Wishart-type random matrices;
  2. Random band matrices whose entries are independent random variables with general variance profile, particularly with an optimal bandwidth in dimensions $d \le 2$;
  3. Sparse random matrices with structured variance profiles;
  4. Generalized Wigner matrices under significantly weaker sparsity constraints and heavy-tailed entry distributions;
  5. Wegner orbital models under sharp mixing assumptions;
  6. Random 2-lifts of random $d$-regular graphs where $d\geq N^{2/3+\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the expected value of the pair correlation statistics of randomized point configurations on the sphere, with the emphasis on point configurations generated by determinantal point processes. We study the cases of the spherical ensemble, the harmonic ensemble, and jittered sampling, and compare our results with those for the ''truly random'' (i.i.d.) case. Our results give evidence of the small-scale repulsion phenomenon which is characteristic for determinantal point processes, while on larger scales there is good agreement between all our studied cases and the i.i.d. case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a lower bound, independent of the initial condition, for the solution of the KPZ equation on the torus through its representation as the value function of a (conditional) stochastic control problem. With the same techniques, we also prove a bound for its oscillation, again independent of initial conditions, from which a Harnack type inequality for the rough heat equation (on the torus) can be obtained.</description>

      <title>The circular law for non-Hermitian random band matrices up to bandwidth $N^{1/2+c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18143v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider inhomogeneous square random matrices of size $N$ with independent entries of mean 0 and finite variance. We assume that the variance profile of this matrix is doubly stochastic and has a band-like structure with an appropriately defined bandwidth $W$. We prove that when the entries have a bounded density and a subgaussian tail, then the empirical spectral measure for the eigenvalues of the matrix converges to the circular law as $N$ tends to infinity whenever $W\geq N^{1/2+c}$ for any $c&gt;0$. In the special case of block band matrices the density assumption is not needed and the moment condition is relaxed. This establishes the circular law limit throughout the entire delocalization regime in 1-d: $W\geq N^{1/2+c}$ and extends the previous thresholds for the circular law limit with exponent $\frac{5}{6},\frac{8}{9},\frac{33}{34}$ in $N$. The main technical input is a new lower bound on the small-ish singular values via Green function estimates and a new lower bound on the least singular value with fewer moment conditions.</description>

      <title>De-Preferential Attachment Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18144v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider a growing random graph sequence where a new vertex is less likely to join to an existing vertex with high degree and more likely to join to a vertex with low degree. In contrast to the well studied \emph{preferential attachment random graphs} \cite{BarAlb99}, we call such a sequence a \emph{de-preferential attachment random graph model}. We consider two types of models, namely, \emph{inverse de-preferential}, where the attachment probabilities are inversely proportional to the degree and \emph{linear de-preferential}, where the attachment probabilities are proportional to $c-$degree, where $c &gt; 0$ is a constant. For the case when each new vertex comes with exactly one half-edge we show that the degree of a fixed vertex is asymptotically of the order $\sqrt{\log n}$ for the inverse de-preferential case and of the order $\log n$ for the linear case. These show that compared to preferential attachment, the degree of a fixed vertex grows to infinity at a much slower rate for these models. We also show that in both cases limiting degree distributions have exponential tails. In fact we show that for the inverse de-preferential model the tail of the limiting degree distribution is faster than exponential while that for the linear de-preferential model is exactly the $\mbox{Geometric}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ distribution. For the case when each new vertex comes with $m &gt; 1$ half-edges, we show that similar asymptotic results hold for fixed vertex degree in both inverse and linear de-preferential models. Our proofs make use of the martingale approach as well as embedding to certain continuous time age dependent branching processes.</description>

      <title>Higher moments under dependence uncertainty with applications in insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the significance of higher-order moments - such as coskewness - in portfolio optimization within the financial domain. This paper extends that focus to the field of actuarial science by examining the impact of these moments on key actuarial applications. In the first part, we derive analytical lower and upper bounds for mixed moments of the form $\mathbb{E}(X_1X_2^d)$, where $X_i \sim F_i$ for $i=1,2$, assuming known marginal distributions but unspecified dependence structure. The results are general and applicable to arbitrary marginals and positive integer orders $d$, and we also identify the dependence structures that attain these bounds. These findings are then applied to bound centered mixed moments and explore their mathematical properties.
  The second part of the paper investigates the influence of higher-order centered mixed moments on key actuarial quantities, including expected shortfall (ES), marginal expected shortfall (MES), and life annuity valuation. Under a copula-based mixture model, we show that coskewness and other odd-order mixed moments exhibit a monotonic relationship with both ES and annuity premiums. However, the effect on MES is more nuanced and may remain invariant depending on the underlying dependence structure.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Markov Chains: Lyapunov Functions, Poisson's Equation, and Stationary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyapunov functions are fundamental to establishing the stability of Markovian models, yet their construction typically demands substantial creativity and analytical effort. In this paper, we show that deep learning can automate this process by training neural networks to satisfy integral equations derived from first-transition analysis. Beyond stability analysis, our approach can be adapted to solve Poisson's equation and estimate stationary distributions. While neural networks are inherently function approximators on compact domains, it turns out that our approach remains effective when applied to Markov chains on non-compact state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology through several examples from queueing theory and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate typical graphs in a region of the Strauss model of random graphs with constraints on the densities of edges and triangles. This region, where typical graphs had been expected to be bipodal but turned out to be tripodal, involves edge densities $e$ below $e_0 = (3-\sqrt{3})/6 \approx 0.2113$ and triangle densities $t$ slightly below $e^3$. We determine the extent of this region in $(e,t)$ space and show that there is a discontinuous phase transition at the boundary between this region and a bipodal phase. We further show that there is at least one phase transition within this region, where the parameters describing typical graphs change discontinuously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A random ensemble of cusp forms for the full modular group is introduced. For a weight-$k$ cusp form, restricted to a compact subdomain of the modular surface, the true order of magnitude of its expected supremum is determined to be $\asymp \sqrt{\log{k}}$, in line with the conjectured bounds. Additionally, the exponential concentration of the supremum around its median is established. Contrary to the compact case, it is shown that the global expected supremum, which is attained around the cusp, grows like $k^{1/4}$, up to a logarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>$(H,H^3)$-smoothing effect and convergence of solutions of stochastic two-dimensional anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations driven by colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the higher regularity and convergence of solutions of anisotropic Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with additive colored noise and white noise on two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$. Under the conditions that the external force $f(\textbf{x})$ belongs to the phase space $ H$ and the noise intensity function $h(\textbf{x})$ satisfies $\|\nabla h\|_{L^\infty} \leq \sqrt{\pi\delta} \frac{\nu \lambda_1}{2}$, it was proved that the random anisotropic NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^2)$-random attractor whose (box-counting) fractal dimension in $H^2$ is finite. This was achieved by establishing, first, an $H^2$ bounded absorbing set and, second, an $(H,H^2)$-smoothing effect of the system which lifts the compactness and finite-dimensionality of the attractor in $H$ to that in $H^2$. Since the force $f$ belongs only to $H$, the $H^2$-regularity of solutions as well as the $H^2$-bounded absorbing set was constructed by an indirect approach of estimating the $H^2$-distance between the solution of the random anisotropic NS equations and that of the corresponding deterministic anisotropic NS equations. When the external force $f(\textbf{x})$ belongs to $H^2$ and the noise intensity function $h(\textbf{x})$ satisfies the Assumption 2, it was proved that the random anisotropic NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^3)$-random attractor whose (box-counting) fractal dimension in $H^3$ is finite. Finally, we prove the upper semi-continuity of random attractors and the convergence of solutions of (8.3) as $\delta\rightarrow0$ in the spaces $(H,H)$, $(H,H^1)$, $(H^1,H^2)$ and $(H^2,H^3)$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Sig-DEG for Distillation: Making Diffusion Models Faster and Lighter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in generative modelling but remain computationally intensive at inference time, often requiring thousands of discretization steps. To this end, we propose Sig-DEG (Signature-based Differential Equation Generator), a novel generator for distilling pre-trained diffusion models, which can universally approximate the backward diffusion process at a coarse temporal resolution. Inspired by high-order approximations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), Sig-DEG leverages partial signatures to efficiently summarize Brownian motion over sub-intervals and adopts a recurrent structure to enable accurate global approximation of the SDE solution. Distillation is formulated as a supervised learning task, where Sig-DEG is trained to match the outputs of a fine-resolution diffusion model on a coarse time grid. During inference, Sig-DEG enables fast generation, as the partial signature terms can be simulated exactly without requiring fine-grained Brownian paths. Experiments demonstrate that Sig-DEG achieves competitive generation quality while reducing the number of inference steps by an order of magnitude. Our results highlight the effectiveness of signature-based approximations for efficient generative modeling.</description>

Abstract: We obtain explicit bounds on the truncation error of the cumulant series of a bounded complex function of a random vector with independent components. The bounds are based on multidimensional differences. This extends the theory of the author with Brendan McKay and Rui-Ray Zhang (J. Combin. Th., Ser. B, 2025) from real functions to complex functions. We demonstrate some initial applications including a Berry--Esseen bound, an Edgeworth expansion for triangles in random graphs, and enumeration of regular graphs.</description>

      <title>On a family of pseudo-Anosov-like maps on the infinite ladder surface</title>

Abstract: Let $S_g$ be the closed surface of genus $g$, $\mathcal{L}$ be the infinite Jacob's ladder surface, and $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ denote the mapping class group of a surface $S$. Let $q_g:\mathcal{L}\to S_g$ be the regular infinite-sheeted cover with deck transformation group $\mathbb{Z}$. In this paper, we show the existence of ``pseudo-Anosov-like'' maps on $\mathcal{L}$ that arise as the lifts of Penner-type pseudo-Anosov maps on $S_g$ under the cover $q_g$. Furthermore, we establish that these lifts are topologically transitive, mixing, and support null recurrent dynamics. Moreover, we present concrete examples of infinite families of such maps on $\mathcal{L}$.</description>

Abstract: This paper firstly presents the necessary and sufficient conditions for a kind of discrete-time robust stochastic optimal control problem with convex control domains. As it is an "inf sup problem", the classical variational method is invalid. We obtain the variational inequality with a common reference probability by systematically using weak convergence approach and the minimax theorem. Moreover, a discrete-time robust investment problem is also studied where the explicit optimal control is given.</description>

      <title>Persistence of Invariant Tori for Stochastic Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger in the Sense of Most Probable Paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of KAM theory to the stochastic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation on infinite lattices, focusing on the stability of low-dimensional invariant tori in the sense of most probable paths. For generality, we provide an abstract proof within the framework of stochastic Hamiltonian systems on infinite lattices. We begin by constructing the Onsager-Machlup functional for these systems in a weighted infinite sequence space. Using the Euler-Lagrange equation, we identify the most probable transition path of the system's trajectory under stochastic perturbations. Additionally, we establish a large deviation principle for the system and derive a rate function that quantifies the deviation of the system's trajectory from the most probable path, especially in rare events. Combining this with classical KAM theory for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we demonstrate the persistence of low-dimensional invariant tori under small deterministic and stochastic perturbations. Furthermore, we prove that the probability of the system's trajectory deviating from these tori can be described by the derived rate function, providing a new probabilistic framework for understanding the stability of stochastic Hamiltonian systems on infinite lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Langevin algorithms are popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for large-scale sampling problems that often arise in data science. We propose Monte Carlo algorithms based on the discretizations of $P$-th order Langevin dynamics for any $P\geq 3$. Our design of $P$-th order Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithms is by combining splitting and accurate integration methods. We obtain Wasserstein convergence guarantees for sampling from distributions with log-concave and smooth densities. Specifically, the mixing time of the $P$-th order LMC algorithm scales as $O\left(d^{\frac{1}{R}}/\epsilon^{\frac{1}{2R}}\right)$ for $R=4\cdot 1_{\{ P=3\}}+ (2P-1)\cdot 1_{\{ P\geq 4\}}$, which has a better dependence on the dimension $d$ and the accuracy level $\epsilon$ as $P$ grows. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a class of non-Lipschitz G-BSDEs and the corresponding stochastic recursive optimal control problem. More precisely, we suppose that the generator of G-BSDE is uniformly continuous and monotonic with respect to the first unknown variable. Using the comparison theorem for G-BSDE and the stability of viscosity solutions, we establish the dynamic programming principle and the connection between the value function and the viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.We provide an example of continuous time Epstein-Zin utility to demonstrate the application of our study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a practical approach to stochastic Lie systems, i.e. stochastic differential equations whose general solutions can be written as a function depending only on a generic family of particular solutions and some constants related to initial conditions. We correct the stochastic Lie theorem characterising stochastic Lie systems, proving that, contrary to previous claims, it retains its classical form in the Stratonovich approach. Meanwhile, we show that the form of stochastic Lie systems may significantly differ from the classical one in the It\^{o} formalism. New generalisations of stochastic Lie systems, like the so-called stochastic foliated Lie systems, are introduced. Subsequently, we focus on stochastic Lie systems that are Hamiltonian systems relative to different geometric structures. Special attention is paid to the symplectic case. We study their stability properties and lay the foundations of a stochastic energy-momentum method. A stochastic Poisson coalgebra method is developed to derive superposition rules for Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems. Potential applications of our results are presented for biological stochastic models, stochastic oscillators, stochastic Lotka--Volterra systems, Palomba--Goodwin models, among others. Our findings complement previous approaches by using stochastic differential equations instead of deterministic equations designed to capture some of the features of models of stochastic nature.</description>

Abstract: We consider the mollified versions of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation and the stochastic heat equation (SHE) in high dimensions $d\geq 3$ and analyze their probability distributions as the mollification is removed. Up to the $L^2$-criticality, we prove Gaussian limits, possibly with random perturbations, for the space-time fluctuations of the mollified versions around their stationarity. This result establishes a continuous analogue of the discrete case obtained by Cosco and Nakajima (2021), and further extends it to a multi-point framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a new spatial Markov property of the Brownian half-plane. According to this property, if one removes a hull centered at a boundary point, the remaining space equipped with an intrinsic metric is still a Brownian half-plane, which is independent of the part that has been removed. This is an analog of the well-known peeling procedure for random planar maps. We also investigate several distributional properties of hulls centered at a boundary point, and we provide a new construction of the Brownian half-plane giving information about distances from a half-boundary.</description>

      <title>Restricted Path Characteristic Function Determines the Law of Stochastic Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central question in rough path theory is characterising the law of stochastic processes on path spaces. It is established in [I. Chevyrev &amp; T. Lyons, Characteristic functions of measures on geometric rough paths, Ann. Probab. 44 (2016), 4049--4082] that the characteristic function of a probability measure on group-like elements, which is a subspace of the extended tensor algebra $\mathcal{T}\left(\mathbb{R}^d\right) = \prod_{n=0}^\infty\left(\mathbb{R}^d\right)^{\otimes n}$, uniquely determines the measure. In this work, we show that the characteristic function restricted to special orthogonal Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ is sufficient to achieve this goal. The key to our arguments is an explicit algorithm -- as opposed to the non-constructive approach in [I. Chevyrev &amp; T. Lyons, op. cit.] -- for determining a generic element $X \in \mathcal{T}\left(\mathbb{R}^d\right)$ from its generating function when restricting its domain to a sparse subspace of real tridiagonal skew-symmetric matrices. Our only assumption is that $X$ has a non-zero ROC, which relaxes the condition of having an infinite ROC in the literature.
  As an application, we propose the restricted path characteristic function distance (RPCFD), a novel distance function for probability measures on the path space that serves as the sparse counterpart of path characteristic function distance. It has enormous advantages in dimension reduction and potential in generative modeling for synthetic time series generation, validated in this paper via hypothesis testing on fractional Brownian motions.</description>

Abstract: We consider a discrete one-dimensional random interface on the half-space whose height at any positive point is composed of a function of the heights at its two closest neighbours and an independent random noise background. In [AC24], Adhikari and Chatterjee proved for the full-space model that the height function of such a Markov process converges to the Cole-Hopf solution of the 1D KPZ equation under a parabolic rescaling as the variance of the noise variables goes to zero in the intermediate disorder regime, assuming the dependency of neighboring heights is equivariant, symmetric, and at least six times differentiable in a neighborhood of zero. In this paper, we obtained the same convergence result for the half-space model with a Neumann boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Lower tail large deviations of the stochastic six vertex model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study lower tail probabilities of the height function $\mathfrak{h}(M,N)$ of the stochastic six-vertex model. We introduce a novel combinatorial approach to demonstrate that the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\mathfrak{h}(M,N) \ge r)$ are log-concave in a certain weak sense. We prove further that for each $\alpha&gt;0$ the lower tail of $-\mathfrak{h}(\lfloor \alpha N \rfloor, N)$ satisfies a Large Deviation Principle (LDP) with speed $N^2$ and a rate function $\Phi_\alpha^{(-)}$, which is given by the infimal deconvolution between a certain energy integral and a parabola.
  Our analysis begins with a distributional identity from BO17 [arXiv:1608.01564], which relates the lower tail of the height function, after a random shift, with a multiplicative functional of the Schur measure. Tools from potential theory allow us to extract the LDP for the shifted height function. We then use our weak log-concavity result, along with a deconvolution scheme from our earlier paper [arXiv:2307.01179], to convert the LDP for the shifted height function to the LDP for the stochastic six-vertex model height function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study pattern formation in class of a large-dimensional neural networks posed on random graphs and subject to spatio-temporal stochastic forcing. Under generic conditions on coupling and nodal dynamics, we prove that the network admits a rigorous mean-field limit, resembling a Wilson-Cowan neural field equation. The state variables of the limiting systems are the mean and variance of neuronal activity. We select networks whose mean-field equations are tractable and we perform a bifurcation analysis using as control parameter the diffusivity strength of the afferent white noise on each neuron. We find conditions for Turing-like bifurcations in a system where the cortex is modelled as a ring, and we produce numerical evidence of noise-induced spiral waves in models with a two-dimensional cortex. We provide numerical evidence that solutions of the finite-size network converge weakly to solutions of the mean-field model. Finally, we prove a Large Deviation Principle, which provides a means of assessing the likelihood of deviations from the mean-field equations induced by finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>Duality for some models of epidemic spreading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the role of boundaries and the structure of nontrivial duality functions for three non conservative interacting particle systems in one dimension that model epidemic spreading: (i) the diffusive contact process (DCP), (ii) a model that we introduce and call generalized diffusive contact process (GDCP), both in finite volume in contact with boundary reservoirs, i.e., with open boundaries, and (iii) the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model on $\Z$. We establish duality relations for each system through an analytical approach. It turns out that with open boundaries self-duality breaks down and qualitatively different properties compared to closed boundaries (i.e., finite volume without reservoirs) arise: both the DCP and GDCP are ergodic but no longer absorbing, while the respective dual processes are absorbing but not ergodic. We provide expressions for the stationary correlation functions in terms of the dual absorption probabilities. We perform explicit computations for a small sized DCP, and for arbitrary size in a particular setting of the GDCP. The duality function is factorized for the DCP and GDCP, contrary to the SIR model for which the duality relation is nonlocal and yields an explicit expression of the time evolution of some specific correlation functions, describing the time decay of the sizes of clusters of susceptible individuals.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) process converges to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, as time $t$ goes to infinity, in a properly scaled observation window shifted by $t^{3/4}$. Our proof is based on identifying the KMP process with a stochastic flow of kernels describing transition probabilities in a certain model of random walk in space-time random environment. This allows to apply a recent result of arXiv:2401.06073 proving convergence of the density field of random walks in random environment to the KPZ equation in a suitably general sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Coulomb gas with a general potential at the determinantal temperature, or equivalently, the eigenvalues of random normal matrices. We prove that the smallest gaps between particles are typically of order $n^{-3/4}$, and that the associated joint point process of gap locations and gap sizes, after rescaling the gaps by $n^{3/4}$, converges to a Poisson point process. As a consequence, we show that the $k$-th smallest rescaled gap has a limiting density proportional to $x^{4k-1}e^{-\frac{\mathcal{J}}{4}x^{4}}$, where $\mathcal{J}=\pi^{2}\int \rho(z)^{3}d^{2}z$ and $\rho$ is the density of the equilibrium measure. This generalizes a result of Shi and Jiang beyond the quadratic potential.</description>

Abstract: We shift the perspective on the interval fragmentation problem from division points to division spacings. This leads to a proof that is both simpler and stronger, establishing limiting distributions for partition points and spacings and, more importantly, including large-deviation error bounds. Moreover, the approach is general. We obtain the limiting spacing distribution for arbitrary division points, and claim it is independent of splitting scheme. It is shown that, under certain conditions, the limiting partition points are always uniformly distributed. Discrete case (heavy-tailed probability densities of division points) is investigated and new results are presented, such as the stage-wise progression of fragmentation process. The results obtained apply to random trees.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Bounds for Sequential Monte Carlo and Adaptive Path Selection Using the $L_2$ Norm</title>

      <description>arXiv:1807.01346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a bound on the finite sample error of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) on static spaces using the $L_2$ distance between interpolating distributions and the mixing times of Markov kernels. This result is unique in that it is the first finite sample convergence result for SMC that does not require an upper bound on the importance weights. Using this bound we show that careful selection of the interpolating distributions can lead to substantial improvements in the computational complexity of the algorithm. This result also justifies the adaptive selection of SMC distributions using the relative effective sample size commonly used in the literature, and we establish conditions guaranteeing the approximation accuracy of the adaptive SMC approach. We show that the commonly used data tempering approach fails to satisfy these conditions, and introduce a modified data tempering algorithm under which our guarantees do hold. We then demonstrate empirically that this procedure provides nearly-optimal sequences of distributions in an automatic fashion for realistic examples.</description>

      <title>Brown measure of the sum of an elliptic operator and a free random variable in a finite von Neumann algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.09844v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an $n\times n$ random matrix $X_n$ with i.i.d. entries of unit variance, the circular law says that the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of $X_n/\sqrt{n}$ converges to the uniform measure on the unit disk. Let $M_n$ be a deterministic matrix that converges in $*$-moments to an operator ${x}$. It is known from the work by \'{S}niady and Tao--Vu that the ESD of $X_n/\sqrt{n}+M_n$ converges to the Brown measure of ${x}+c$, where $c$ is Voiculescu's circular operator. We obtain a formula for the Brown measure of ${x}+c$ which provides a description of the limit distribution. This answers a question of Biane--Lehner for arbitrary operator ${x}$.
  Generalizing the case of circular and semi-circular operators, we also consider a family of twisted elliptic operators that are $*$-free from ${x}$. For an arbitrary twisted elliptic operator $g$, possible degeneracy then prevents a direct calculation of the Brown measure of ${x}+g$. We instead show that the whole family of Brown measures are the push-forward measures of the Brown measure of ${x}+c$ under a family of self-maps of the plane, which could possibly be singular. We calculate explicit formula for the case ${x}$ is self-adjoint. In addition, we prove that the Brown measure of the sum of an $R$-diagonal operator and a twisted elliptic element is supported in a deformed ring where the inner boundary is a circle and the outer boundary is an ellipse.
  These results generalize some known results about free additive Brownian motions where the free random variable ${x}$ is assumed to be self-adjoint. The approach is based on a Hermitian reduction and subordination functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $t \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $i\in[t]$, let $H_i$ be a $d_i$-regular connected graph, with $1&lt;|V(H_i)|\le C$ for some integer $C\ge 2$. Let $G=\square_{i=1}^tH_i$ be the Cartesian product of $H_1, \ldots, H_t$. We show that if $t\ge 5C$ then $G$ contains a (nearly-)perfect matching.
  Then, considering the random graph process on $G$, we generalise the result of Bollob\'as on the binary hypercube $Q^t$, showing that with high probability, the hitting times for minimum degree one, connectivity, and the existence of a (nearly-)perfect matching in the random graph process on $G$ are the same. As a byproduct, we develop several tools which may be of independent interest in a more general setting when one seeks to establish the typical existence of a perfect matching under percolation.</description>

      <title>Kinetic interacting particle system: parameter estimation from complete and partial discrete observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the estimation of drift and diffusion coefficients in a two dimensional system of N interacting particles modeled by a degenerate stochastic differential equation. We consider both complete and partial observation cases over a fixed time horizon [0, T] and propose novel contrast functions for parameter estimation. In the partial observation scenario, we tackle the challenge posed by unobserved velocities by introducing a surrogate process based on the increments of the observed positions. This requires a modified contrast function to account for the correlation between successive increments. Our analysis demonstrates that, despite the loss of Markovianity due to the velocity approximation in the partial observation case, the estimators converge to a Gaussian distribution (with a correction factor in the partial observation case). The proofs are based on Ito like bounds and an adaptation of the Euler scheme. Additionally, we provide insights into H\"ormander's condition, which helps establish hypoellipticity in our model within the framework of stochastic calculus of variations.</description>

      <title>Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Processes-With Indications for Microbiome Species Sampling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), a new class of species sampling models designed to address the challenges of complex, sparse count data by facilitating information sharing across and within groups. Our theoretical developments enable a tractable Bayesian nonparametric framework with machine learning elements, accommodating a potentially infinite number of species (taxa) whose parameters are learned from data. Focusing on microbiome analysis, we address key gaps by providing a flexible multivariate count model that accounts for overdispersion and robustly handles diverse data types (OTUs, ASVs). We introduce novel parameters reflecting species abundance and diversity. The model borrows strength across groups while explicitly distinguishing between technical and biological zeros to interpret sparse co-occurrence patterns. This results in a framework with tractable posterior inference, exact generative sampling, and a principled solution to the unseen species problem. We describe extensions where domain experts can incorporate knowledge through covariates and structured priors, with potential for strain-level analysis. While motivated by ecology, our work provides a broadly applicable methodology for hierarchical count modeling in genetics, commerce, and text analysis, and has significant implications for the broader theory of species sampling models arising in probability and statistics.</description>

      <title>Achieving constant regret for dynamic matching via state-independent policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a centralized discrete-time dynamic two-way matching model with finitely many agent types. Agents arrive stochastically over time and join their type-dedicated queues waiting to be matched. We focus on state-independent greedy policies that achieve constant regret at all times by making matching decisions based solely on agent availability across types, rather than requiring complete queue-length information. Such policies are particularly appealing for life-saving applications such as kidney exchange, as they require less information and provide more transparency compared to state-dependent policies.
  First, for acyclic matching networks, we analyze a deterministic priority policy proposed by Kerimov et al. [2023] that follows a static priority order over matches. We derive the first explicit regret bound in terms of the general position gap (GPG) parameter $\epsilon$, which measures the distance of the fluid relaxation from degeneracy. Second, for general two-way matching networks, we design a randomized state-independent greedy policy that achieves constant regret with optimal scaling $O(\epsilon^{-1})$, matching the existing lower bound established by Kerimov et al.

      <title>A new measure of dependence: Integrated $R^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new measure of dependence that quantifies the degree to which a random variable $Y$ depends on a random vector $X$. This measure is zero if and only if $Y$ and $X$ are independent, and equals one if and only if $Y$ is a measurable function of $X$. We introduce a simple and interpretable estimator that is comparable in ease of computation to classical correlation coefficients such as Pearson's, Spearman's, or Chatterjee's. Building on this coefficient, we develop a model-free variable selection algorithm, feature ordering by dependence (FORD), inspired by FOCI. FORD requires no tuning parameters and is provably consistent under suitable sparsity assumptions. We demonstrate its effectiveness and improvements over FOCI through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Cycle-factors of regular graphs via entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result that a random permutation of $n$ elements has, on average, about $\log n$ cycles. We generalise this fact to all directed $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices by showing that, on average, a random cycle-factor of such a graph has $\mathcal{O}((n\log d)/d)$ cycles. This is tight up to the constant factor and improves the best previous bound of the form $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log d})$ due to Vishnoi. Our results also yield randomised polynomial-time algorithms for finding such a cycle-factor and for finding a tour of length $(1+\mathcal{O}((\log d)/d)) \cdot n$ if the graph is connected. This makes progress on a conjecture of Magnant and Martin and on a problem studied by Vishnoi and by Feige, Ravi, and Singh. Our proof uses the language of entropy to exploit the fact that the upper and lower bounds on the number of perfect matchings in regular bipartite graphs are extremely close.</description>

      <title>On the Foundations of Dynamic Games and Probability: Decision Making in Stochastic Extensive Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, an abstract and general language for the fundamental objects underlying dynamic games under probabilistic uncertainty is developed. Combining the theory of decision trees by Al\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger (2005) and a Harsanyian notion of exogenous uncertainty, the concept of stochastic decision forests is introduced. Exogenous information is modelled via filtration-like objects providing dynamic updates on the "realised tree", and an abstract decision-theoretic model of adapted choice is formulated.
  Based on this, a consistent model of "rules" is introduced, leading to the notion of stochastic extensive forms, generalising the works of Al\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger (2008, 2011). Well-posedness is completely characterised in terms of order-theoretic properties of the underlying forest. Moreover, the language of stochastic extensive forms addresses a vast class of dynamic decision problems formulated in terms of time-indexed paths of action -- a first step towards an approximation theory of continuous-time games based on stochastic processes. In this formulation, a well-posed theory obtains if and only if the time half-axis is essentially well-ordered.
  Therefore, a relaxed game-theoretic model of "extensive form characteristics" is introduced: the stochastic process form. Its action processes arise from well-posed action path stochastic extensive forms under tilting convergence, which is introduced in order to faithfully describe accumulating reaction behaviour. The problem of instantaneous reaction and information about it is tackled by introducing vertically extended continuous time, for which a suitable stochastic analysis is developed. Stochastic process forms admit a natural notion of information sets, subgames, and equilibrium. The theory applies to stochastic differential and timing games, e.g., addressing open issues in Fudenberg--Tirole (1985) and Riedel--Steg (2017).</description>
