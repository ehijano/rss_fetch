      <title>Evaporative cooling by pulse width modulation (PWM) of optical dipole traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for cooling atoms in an optical dipole trap using pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique, without reducing the laser power of the dipole trap. The PWM technique involves digital modulation of the trap at a fixed frequency. The effective time-averaged dipole potential is lowered by adjusting the duty cycle of the modulation, thereby implementing evaporative cooling. We show that, this technique effectively reduces temperature and enhances phase space density. A comparison with the standard method of evaporative cooling has also been made. Apart from the atom loss due to reduction of the effective trapping potential, we observe an additional loss channel originating from the lack of trapping potential during the trap off time. This atom loss is observed at different modulation frequencies which are an order of magnitude higher compared to trapping frequency of dipole trap. The PWM technique provides an alternative to traditional evaporative cooling in scenarios where it is preferred that the laser power of the trap should be constant.</description>

      <title>Correlated electron dynamics with time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo: three-dimensional helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here the recently proposed time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo method is applied to three dimensional para- and ortho-helium atoms subjected to an external electromagnetic field with amplitude sufficient to cause significant ionization. By solving concurrently sets of up to 20 000 coupled 3D time-dependent Schroedinger equations for the guide waves and corresponding sets of first order equations of motion for the Monte Carlo walkers we obtain ground state energies in close agreement with the exact values. The combined use of spherical coordinates and B-splines along the radial coordinate proves to be especially accurate and efficient for such calculations. Our results for the dipole response and the ionization of an atom with un-correlated electrons are in good agreement with the predictions of the conventional time-dependent Hartree-Fock method while the calculations with correlated electrons show enhanced ionization that is due to the electron-electron repulsion.</description>

      <title>Dielectronic recombination studies on Fe$^{2+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectronic recombination resonance strengths, energy-differential cross sections, and recombination rate coefficients are calculated fully relativistically for Fe$^{2+}$ ions. The ground-state and resonance energies are determined using the multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock method. Radiative and auto-ionization rates are computed with a relativistic configuration interaction method. For the calculation of Auger widths and resonance strengths, the continuum electron is treated within the framework of the relativistic distorted-wave model. Notably, the calculated level energies for Fe$^{2+}$ not only align well with experimental results but also show improvements compared to earlier theoretical studies. These fully relativistic calculations provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the recombination process. This is particularly important in astrophysics and plasma physics, especially for studying phenomena such as kilonova events.</description>

      <title>A hitchhiker's guide to nuclear polarization in muonic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I consider the so-called nuclear polarization correction to the 1S-levels in light to intermediate muonic atoms. An easy to use recipe to compute it is given. The calculation includes the effect of the nucleon polarization, i.e. the contribution from inelastic states in the hadronic range, and Coulomb corrections beyond the leading logarithm approximation to both nuclear and nucleon polarization. I provide numerical estimates for $4\leq Z\leq41$, compare to the estimates in the literature and discuss the need for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the Local Atomic Environment Features of Machine Learning Interatomic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of creating efficient and high-quality datasets for machine learning potential functions. We present a novel approach, termed DV-LAE (Difference Vectors based on Local Atomic Environments), which utilizes the properties of atomic local environments and employs histogram statistics to generate difference vectors. This technique facilitates dataset screening and optimization, effectively minimizing redundancy while maintaining data diversity. We have validated the optimized datasets in high-temperature and high-pressure hydrogen systems as well as the {\alpha}-Fe/H binary system, demonstrating a significant reduction in computational resource usage without compromising prediction accuracy. Additionally, our method has revealed new structures that emerge during simulations but were underrepresented in the initial training datasets. The redundancy in the datasets and the distribution of these new structures can be visually analyzed through the visualization of difference vectors. This approach enhances our understanding of the characteristics of these newly formed structures and their impact on physical processes.</description>

      <title>Modeling Atomic Polarizability: From Charge Distortion to Non-Uniform Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the classical model of atomic polarizability, atomic charges are displaced by an applied electric field, assuming the electron cloud remains spherically symmetric but with its center shifted from the nucleus, thereby inducing an electric dipole. In this work, we propose that the applied electric field distorts the initially spherical electron cloud into a spheroidal shape, with the nucleus positioned at one of its focal points. We assume that the electron cloud's charge density remains uniform and is not altered by the applied field. We derive a modified expression for the polarizability that accounts for the distortion factor, represented by the eccentricity of the spheroid, and analyze an additional model incorporating non-uniform charge distribution. Furthermore, we present an expression for polarizability that combines the effects of both distortion and non-uniform charge density. These models aim to refine the classical approximation and offer deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying atomic polarizability.</description>

      <title>Two-photon interference between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals scattered off a semiconductor quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative linewidth of a two-level emitter (TLE) ultimately determines the bandwidth it can offer for quantum information processing. However, no prior experiment has so far been performed to examine the effect of driving detuning on indistinguishability of photons scattered off a TLE, a parameter that is crucial for photonic quantum computing. Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference experiments between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. Our results suggest that indistinguishability among photons scattered off a quantum dot is inherently insensitive to the driving laser's detuning, as straightforwardly predicted by the resonance fluorescence model that systematically treats all scattered photons as spontaneous emission.</description>

      <title>Shake-off in XFEL heated solid density plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In atoms undergoing ionisation, an abrupt re-arrangement of free and bound electrons can lead to the ejection of another bound electron (shake-off). The spectroscopic signatures of shake-off have been predicted and observed in atoms and solids. Here, we present the first observation of this process in a solid-density plasma heated by an x-ray free electron laser. The results show that shake-off of L-shell electrons persists up to temperatures of 10 eV at solid density, and follow the probability predicted for solids. This work shows that shake-off should be included in plasma models for the correct interpretation of emission spectra.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum many-body dynamics using subsystem Loschmidt echos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Loschmidt echo - the probability of a quantum many-body system to return to its initial state following a dynamical evolution - generally contains key information about a quantum system, relevant across various scientific fields including quantum chaos, quantum many-body physics, or high-energy physics. However, it is typically exponentially small in system size, posing an outstanding challenge for experiments. Here, we experimentally investigate the subsystem Loschmidt echo, a quasi-local observable that captures key features of the Loschmidt echo while being readily accessible experimentally. Utilizing quantum gas microscopy, we study its short- and long-time dynamics. In the short-time regime, we observe a dynamical quantum phase transition arising from genuine higher-order correlations. In the long-time regime, the subsystem Loschmidt echo allows us to quantitatively determine the effective dimension and structure of the accessible Hilbert space in the thermodynamic limit. Performing these measurements in the ergodic regime and in the presence of emergent kinetic constraints, we provide direct experimental evidence for ergodicity breaking due to fragmentation of the Hilbert space. Our results establish the subsystem Loschmidt echo as a novel and powerful tool that allows paradigmatic studies of both non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-body systems, applicable to a broad range of quantum simulation and computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Cold Beam Optical Clock with Multifrequency Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate an optical clock based on Ramsey-Bord\'e interferometry in a laser-cooled ${}^{40}$Ca beam. The mean velocity is reduced by an order of magnitude relative to a thermal beam and the transverse temperature approaches the Doppler limit, enabling the measurement of sub-kHz linewidth fringes in a compact interferometer. Using tailored phase and intensity modulation of the spectroscopy laser to add uniform frequency sidebands, we interrogate atoms throughout the transverse velocity distribution, increasing the Ramsey-Bord\'e fringe amplitude by a factor of 14 and improving the Allan deviation to $3.4\times 10^{-15}$ at one second averaging time.</description>
