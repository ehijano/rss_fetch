      <title>On-Axis Optical Trapping with Vortex Beams: The Role of the Multipolar Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical trapping is a well_established, decades old technology with applications in several fields of research. The most common scenario deals with particles that tend to be centered on the brightest part of the optical trap. Consequently, the optical forces keep the particle away from the dark zones of the beam. However, this is not the case when a focused doughnut_shaped beam generates on_axis trapping. In this system, the particle is centered on the intensity minima of the laser beam and the bright annular part lies on the periphery of the particle. Researchers have shown great interest in this phenomenon due to its advantage of reducing light interaction with trapped particles and the intriguing increase in the trapping strength. This work presents experimental and theoretical results that extend the analysis of on_axis trapping with light vortex beams. Specifically, in our experiments, we trap micron_sized spherical silica (SiO2) particles in water and we measure, through the power spectrum density method, the trap stiffness constant \k{appa} generated by vortex beams with different topological charge orders. The optical forces are calculated from the exact solutions of the electromagnetic fields provided by the generalized Lorentz_Mie theory. We show a remarkable agreement between the theoretical prediction and the experimental measurements of \k{appa}. Moreover, our numerical model gives us information about the electromagnetic fields inside the particle, offering valuable insights into the influence of the electromagnetic fields present in the vortex beam trapping scenario.</description>

      <title>Quantized non-Abelian helicity of flat bands in 2D Floquet topological photonic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-band states in topological systems provide a unique platform for investigating strongly correlated phenomena and many body physics. However, in 2D static tight-binding systems, perfectly flat bands can only exist in the topologically trivial phase, as characterized by a zero Chern number. Here we show that by introducing periodic driving into a 2D photonic Lieb lattice composed of coupled microring resonators, the resulting Floquet topological insulator can host perfectly flat bands with nontrivial topology. In particular, by tracking the evolution of the flat-band modes over each cycle, we show that the non-Abelian displacements of the flat-band modes are characterized by a nontrivial quantized helicity even though the quasi-energy bands have zero Chern number. The helical motion of the flat-band modes can be described by a braiding of the world lines of their trajectories, with a nontrivial winding number directly connected to the helicity. We also propose a scheme to experimentally measure the quantized non-Abelian helicity in a microring lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. These results suggest that Floquet topological photonic insulators based on coupled microring resonators can provide a versatile platform for investigating non-Abelian topological physics and strongly correlated phenomena in photonic flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Passive Daytime Radiative Cooling Enabled by Bio-Derived Ceramic-Polymer Coatings on Rapid-Curing Fiberglass Casts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) provides an energy-free approach to suppress surface temperatures by reflecting solar irradiation while emitting thermal radiation through the mid-infrared atmospheric window. Despite rapid progress in optical performance, most PDRC systems remain limited by rigid, fragile, or planar substrates, restricting their use on flexible, curved, or wearable surfaces. Here, we report a biocompatible and structurally robust PDRC system integrated onto a commercial rapid-curing fiberglass cast, a conformal substrate widely used in orthopedic and industrial applications. The cooling architecture adopts a bilayer polymer design consisting of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) adhesion layer and a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) protective layer, both embedded with calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) ceramic particles derived from processed animal bone waste. The bio-derived CPP simultaneously enables broadband solar scattering and high mid-infrared emittance, while offering sustainability and biocompatibility advantages. The resulting composite exhibits over 90% solar reflectance and achieves up to 15 C sub-ambient cooling under direct outdoor sunlight.</description>

      <title>Electrically pumped AlGaN edge-emitting UV-B laser diodes grown by molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid and deep ultraviolet (UV) laser diodes remain among the least explored devices in semiconductor optoelectronics, despite their importance for spectroscopy, biochemical sensing, disinfection, and emerging quantum photonics. Here, we demonstrate an electrically pumped AlGaN-based laser diode operating in the UV-B band (280-315 nm). The device is grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on single-crystal AlN substrate and fabricated in a ridge-waveguide geometry. The laser diode operates at 298.5 nm and exhibits a relatively low threshold current density of 3.4 kA/cm$^2$. Clear nonlinear light-current characteristics and pronounced spectral narrowing with a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.2 nm are measured above threshold.</description>

      <title>Scaling of broadband Ho:CALGO regenerative amplifier to multi-mJ pulse energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on energy scaling of a 2.08-{\mu}m wavelength regenerative amplifier (RA) system based on the broadband gain material Ho:CaAlGdO4 (CALGO) to multi-mJ pulse energy at kHz repetition rates. Compared to previous reports, energy scaling was enabled thanks to an upgraded seed laser with a higher fluence and better spectral overlap to the gain spectrum of Ho:CALGO, which increased amplification efficiency. Bifurcation-free energy extraction was investigated experimentally and numerically for various repetition rates. A stable output was obtained at 10 W average power for repetition rates of 30 kHz and above. In addition, stable 3.4-mJ energy extraction was achieved at a 1-kHz repetition rate. We discuss the further scaling potential of pulse energy and pulse duration.</description>

      <title>Learned split-spectrum metalens for obstruction-free broadband imaging in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obstructions such as raindrops, fences, or dust degrade captured images, especially when mechanical cleaning is infeasible. Conventional solutions to obstructions rely on a bulky compound optics array or computational inpainting, which compromise compactness or fidelity. Metalenses composed of subwavelength meta-atoms promise compact imaging, but simultaneous achievement of broadband and obstruction-free imaging remains a challenge, since a metalens that images distant scenes across a broadband spectrum cannot properly defocus near-depth occlusions. Here, we introduce a learned split-spectrum metalens that enables broadband obstruction-free imaging. Our approach divides the spectrum of each RGB channel into pass and stop bands with multi-band spectral filtering and learns the metalens to focus light from far objects through pass bands, while filtering focused near-depth light through stop bands. This optical signal is further enhanced using a neural network. Our learned split-spectrum metalens achieves broadband and obstruction-free imaging with relative PSNR gains of 32.29% and improves object detection and semantic segmentation accuracies with absolute gains of +13.54% mAP, +48.45% IoU, and +20.35% mIoU over a conventional hyperbolic design. This promises robust obstruction-free sensing and vision for space-constrained systems, such as mobile robots, drones, and endoscopes.</description>

      <title>Engineering Quantum Emission with Mie Voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous emission, as a fundamental radiative process and a versatile information carrier, plays a vital role in light-emitting devices, optical information modulation and encryption, super-resolution fluorescence imaging and nano sensing. Engineering the photonic environment surrounding quantum emitters can enhance their emission characteristics. However, simultaneously achieving precise control over both excitation enhancement and quantum-yield modulation at the nanoscale remains elusive, highlighting substantial room for advancing the precised engineering of quantum emission. Here, we introduce silicon Mie voids - air-defined cavities that invert the conventional solid-particle geometry - to achieve independent tuning of quantum emission within an individual subwavelength structure, while minimizing optical losses. Full-wave simulations and experiments on both gradient and uniform Mie-void arrays jointly validate this quantitative framework for emission tuning, which disentangles excitation enhancement arising from local field confinement in air and quantum-yield enhancement resulting from strengthened emitter-resonator coupling, while confirming the accelerated radiative decay enabled by the void configuration. Leveraging this flexible mechanism, we realize a bimodal nanophotonic pattern with near-diffraction-limited pixels that encode the EPFL logo in the bright field and the SJTU logo in both dark field and photoluminescence micrographs. These results establish Mie voids as a powerful platform for programmable, high-density multimodal displays and open new avenues for advancing state-of-the-art nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuit devices can be used as refractometric opto-fluidic sensors to detect the presence of analytes in solution at low concentrations. In this work, we investigate the refractive index sensitivity of silicon nitride microring resonator based photonic integrated circuit fluidic sensors. The performance of a foundry fabricated sensor is measured over the C-band in the presence of liquid samples achieving a mean sensitivity of 579 nanometres per refractive index unit. This demonstration of a scalable, high-sensitivity opto-fluidic sensor, compatible with recognition marker surface functionalisation, opens the way to applications in environmental and bio-sensing.</description>

      <title>Automatic Classification of Laser Peening Quality Using Acoustic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser Shock Peening increases the fatigue life of metallic components by introducing beneficial compressive residual stresses. To achieve the desired effect, each individual laser pulse must be delivered correctly. Laser Shock Peening quality is typically verified by destructive and time-consuming residual stress measurements or by subjective operator judgement, which is non-objective and unsuitable for continuous in-line control. We propose a simple, low-cost and robust method based on the analysis of the acoustic response that automatically classifies individual laser pulses as defect-free or defective. We show that the acoustic response captured by a low-cost microphone carries sufficiently informative signatures to reliably distinguish correct from incorrect impacts and enables quality control at the level of single pulses. The method provides a non-destructive and objective route to real-time monitoring of Laser Shock Peening, with the potential to increase process reliability and support industrial deployment of this technology without the need for subsequent destructive measurements.</description>

      <title>Self-locking non-volatile coding metasurfaces via origami-based mechanical bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital coding metasurfaces have revolutionized electromagnetic (EM) manipulation, yet typical tunable approaches based on active components suffer from the "volatility" bottleneck. While mechanical modulation provides a potential solution, current implementations generally lack inherent state-locking capability, rendering them vulnerable to environmental disturbances and actuation errors. Inspired by the concept of mechanical bits (MBs), this paper presents a self-locking non-volatile coding metasurface platform enabled by Kresling origami-based MBs, where the continuous mechanical deformation of individual meta-atoms is discretized into robust binary geometric states protected by intrinsic energy barriers. The bistable states are strictly mapped to 1-bit EM coding phases via tailored metallic patterns integrated onto a multimaterial 3D printed Kresling origami array. Building upon this concept, both transmission- and reflection-type prototypes are proposed and experimentally demonstrated, exhibiting exceptional wavefront manipulation capabilities through near-field holographic imaging and far-field beam steering. In addition, the lightweight origami unit (1.5 g) exhibits an exceptional load-bearing capacity, supporting over 100 times its own weight. These results bridge mechanical logic with EM information processing, establishing a universal physical paradigm for constructing low-power, highly robust coding metasurfaces resilient to extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Design Principles for Tailoring Heat Transport via Iris-Gated Core-Double-Shell Nanoparticles in the Context of Photothermal Therapies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rational design of Janus nanostructures that combine efficient optical absorption with controlled thermal transport is essential for advancing plasmonic photothermal therapies and related applications. Here, we introduce a theoretical and computational framework to investigate core-double-shell nanoparticles and their asymmetric version, the iris-gated core-double-shell architecture. The optical response of the structures is first evaluated using generalized Mie theory and subsequently validated through FEM and FDTD simulations, ensuring a consistent description of their electromagnetic and thermal behavior. To systematically map the space of variables, we defined a multi-objective figure of merit that integrates absorption efficiency, absorption cross section, and polymer-layer thickness. Furthermore, we define a thermal gain parameter that quantifies energy densification and complements the analysis of thermal directionality. Our results reveal a near-optimal configuration with parameters ($r_c$, $\delta_{Au}$, $\delta_p$, $\theta$)=(36 nm, 5 nm, 40 nm, 70$\deg$), capable of producing a temperature rise of 20-23 $\deg$C, with 67% of the thermal fluz directed toward the upper hemispace and yielding 50% focusing enhancement relative to the symmetric case. This design preserves geometric simplicity and high symmetry while delivering robust thermal asymmetry, thereby facilitating experimental implementation. Beyond photothermal therapies, the proposed methodology constitutes a versatile platform for the rapid screening and optimization of layered nanostructures, adaptable to diverse materials, excitation wavelengths, and functional objectives in nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Microring Resonator Dispersion Metrology with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise knowledge of resonator dispersion, from both geometric and material contributions, is essential for reliable high-performance nonlinear integrated photonics devices, such as optical parametric oscillators, frequency doublers, and integrated optical frequency combs. However, direct measurements at the fabrication level provide limited knowledge, whether through destructive cross-section imaging or non-destructive ellipsometry, while complete optical characterization that enables precise dispersion metrology is time-consuming and poorly suited for mass-scale foundry fabrication. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework to solve three complementary problems: (i) predicting resonator geometric dimensions, (ii) identifying the correct material dispersion, and last, but not least, (iii) precisely reconstructing the integrated dispersion spectrum directly from ring dimensions. These three neural networks together enable both inverse and forward characterization of microring resonators. Using numerically generated datasets based on Sellmeier-type material models, we demonstrate &lt;1 nm ring dimension prediction accuracy without noise, &lt;8 nm prediction accuracy with ~45 dispersion samples under a realistic frequency measurement noise level (50 MHz), and ~16 nm prediction accuracy at a higher noise level (200 MHz). The Sellmeier model classification exceeds 99% accuracy in all cases. Importantly, dispersion sampled far from the pump resonances proves most informative, reducing full-spectrum characterization requirements. The forward-prediction network reconstructs dispersion spectra from the ring dimensions with high accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of machine learning applied to dispersion data as a rapid, non-destructive tool for wafer-scale quality control and process monitoring in photonic foundries.</description>

      <title>Optical steering of a large ring laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common approach to reduce the linewidth of a laser is an increase of its resonator length. In large gas lasers, however, the frequency spacing between longitudinal modes of the resonator easily becomes significantly smaller than the Doppler-broadened width of the gain profile. As a consequence, the laser might operate on a multitude of modes simultaneously, or jump between modes. Such unstable operation cannot be tolerated in metrological or sensing applications, such as ring laser gyroscopes. Here, we propose and demonstrate a method to establish stable operation on a chosen mode index by optically steering the ring laser to a desired mode index through injection locking with an external laser. The injected mode reliably follows the external steering. Intra-cavity backscattering can even cause the counter-propagating, non-injected mode to follow the external steering as well.</description>

      <title>Thermo-optic modulator with ultra-high extinction ratio for low-loss silicon nitride integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely low-loss silicon nitride integrated circuits is a potential platform for a growing number of frontier applications in quantum technologies, high-performance and analog computing, nonlinear optics, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and biotechnologies. However, efficient optical modulation with a wide frequency response, high contrast, low power and scalable manufacturing remains one of the key challenges for silicon nitride integrated photonics. Here, we propose an integrated thermo-optic phase shifter with isolation trenches operating in the C-band. The fabricated thermo-optic modulator capable to achieve a $\pi$-phase shift shift at a power consumption of 65 mW, bandwidth of 12 kHz, and extinction ratio (ER) over 80 dB. Moreover, we systematically demonstrate its compatibility with low-loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits with microring resonators exibiting an average quality factor more than $5.9 \times 10^{6}$, which correspond to propagation loss of 0.058 dB/cm.</description>

      <title>6-mJ, 4-ns Pulse Generation at 2.09 $\mu$m from a Diode-Pumped Ho:YAG Thin-Disk Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A holmium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Ho:YAG) thin-disk was experimentally investigated under Q-switching and cavity-dumping operation schemes, pumped by a 1.9 $\mu$m laser-diode (LD). The laser generated pulses at 2090 nm with energies more than 6 mJ and pulse duration down to 3.8 ns, corresponding to a peak power of 1.6 MW with near-diffraction-limited beam quality. The compact and robust system was used for laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) experiments, demonstrating its practical usability. These results represent, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of a Ho:YAG thin-disk laser providing MW peak-power in nanosecond regime.</description>

      <title>Widely tunable SNAP microresonators via translation of side-coupled optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate free spectral range (FSR) tunable Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (SNAP) microresonators induced by side-coupled parallel optical fiber segments. By translating one segment relative to the other, we tune the coupling length from $900~\mu$m to $100~\mu$m and thereby tune the microresonator FSR from $5$ pm to $50$ pm, with an estimated precision of better than $0.003$ pm. The microresonator Q-factor exceeds $10^5$ and can potentially be significantly increased in a clean lab environment. Possible applications of the demonstrated device include miniature and low-loss tunable delay lines and optical frequency comb generators, as well as ultraprecise tunable optical sensors.</description>

      <title>Complete transparency with three active-passive-coupled optical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomena of induced transparency, with the typical examples of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic media and coupled optical resonators, have attracted tremendous interest since their discoveries. Due to the limitations of the involved elements, however, near-100\% transmissions were reported under highly demanding experimental conditions for atomic and other media. Based on a structure of three linearly coupled optical resonators, an active one carrying a possibly arbitrary optical gain and two passive ones simply with dissipation, we demonstrate that a transmitted light field can become completely transparent through the structure, which displays all properties similar to those of EIT. Manifested by a destructive interference to annihilate the intracavity field in the resonator directly coupled to the input, this complete transparency exists for any feasible power of the transmitted field and all realizable coupling strengths of the dark resonator with the input and the neighboring resonator, as long as the inter-cavity coupling for two other resonators is adjustable over a suitable range. A free control on the transparency window size and output field intensity can be realized by tuning two inter-cavity couplings without modifying the built-in system parameters.</description>

      <title>Development of Electroformed X-ray Optics Bridging Synchrotron Technology and Space Astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed X-ray telescope mirrors using an original electroforming replication technique established through the fabrication of millimeter-aperture, ultra-short-focal-length nanofocusing mirrors for synchrotron X-ray microscopy. This paper presents detailed results of X-ray illumination tests of a 60-mm-diameter, full-circumference, double-reflection monolithic electroformed nickel mirror and its Mirror Module Assembly (MMA). The experiments were conducted at the 1-km beamline BL29XUL at SPring-8. To simulate a parallel X-ray beam from celestial sources, we constructed a dedicated evaluation system, the High-Brilliance X-ray Kilometer-long Large-Area Expanded-beam Evaluation System (HBX-KLAEES). Owing to the high photon flux and the quasi-point-like source with a small divergence provided by HBX-KLAEES, the imaging performance was evaluated with high fidelity, resolving both the sharp core and large-angle components of the Point Spread Function (PSF). The results show an extremely sharp core with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 arcsec and a Half Power Diameter (HPD) of 14 arcsec, even after integration into the MMA. In addition, a positive correlation was found between angular resolution and axial figure error in both the primary and secondary mirror sections, indicating that axial figure errors contribute to image degradation. Based on these results, the MMA was selected as one of the hard X-ray optics for the FOXSI-4 sounding rocket experiment, which performs high-resolution soft and hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares and was successfully launched. These results demonstrate the potential for further improvements in angular resolution and the development of high-resolution, ultra-short focal length X-ray optics for small satellites, including CubeSats.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong light-matter coupling in near-field coupled split-ring resonators revealed by photocurrent spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau polaritons arising from the coupling between cyclotron resonance and terahertz split-ring resonators (SRRs) have served as a central platform for exploring ultrastrong light-matter interaction for more than a decade. Over this period, a wide variety of SRR architectures, differing in size, geometry, and even material composition, have been investigated. However, the regime of near-field coupled SRRs has remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate ultrastrong coupling using photocurrent spectroscopy in two prototypical near-field configurations: a SRR dimer and a topological SRR chain. The measurements reveal hybridization not only with bright resonant modes but also with optically dark modes and topological edge modes, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of the photocurrent spectroscopy. Moreover, the engineered near-field interactions allow the study of multi-mode ultrastrong coupling and the interplay between topological band structure and cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Engineering Spatial Dispersion to Synthesize Arbitrary Spatial Filters Based on Metagratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19486v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a design framework for synthesizing angularly selective spatial filters using non-uniform metagratings. While traditional metagratings focus on channeling energy into higher-order Floquet modes for a fixed incidence angle, we leverage the fundamental mode as a versatile degree of freedom to engineer spatial dispersion over a continuous angular spectrum. By strategically distributing non-uniformly loaded metallic wires and rigorously modeling their mutual interactions through an impedance-matrix formulation, we realize prescribed angular transfer functions with high efficiency. In particular, the framework is validated at 3.5 GHz through full-wave simulations of (i) low-pass, (ii) high-pass, and (iii) all-pass spatial filters. The results demonstrate that fundamental-mode engineering in non-uniform metagratins offers a highly efficient platform for advanced spatial wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Near-field effects on cathodoluminescence outcoupling in perovskite thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskite semiconductors are a promising material for high-efficiency solar cells. Their optical properties can vary within and between crystallographic grains. We present spatially-resolved cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy at 2 keV and 5 keV on polycrystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite films to study these variations at the nanoscale. The CL maps show a strongly reduced intensity near the polycrystalline grain boundaries. We perform numerical simulations of the far-field emission of the electron beam-generated optical near fields using the surface profiles from AFM as input. We find that near grain boundaries the light outcoupling is strongly reduced due to enhanced internal reflection and light trapping at the curved surfaces. Lateral variations in CL intensity inside grains are due to Fabry-Perot-like resonances in the film, with the substrate acting as a back reflector. Our results show that near-field coupling and interference effects can dominate nanoscale luminescence maps of halide perovskite films. The results are broadly relevant for the analysis of cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence of corrugated thin films.</description>

      <title>Optimally Driven Dressed Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applicability and performance of qubits dressed by classical fields are limited because their control protocols give rise to an undesired counter-rotating term (CRT). This in turn forces operation in a regime where a (dressed) rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is valid, thereby restricting key aspects of their operation. Here, using only a single coupling axis in the laboratory frame, we introduce a dressed-qubit control protocol that optimally removes the CRT, eliminating the need for the RWA and delivering substantial improvements in multiple performance metrics, including single-qubit gate speed, two-qubit gate fidelity, spectroscopic range, clock stability, and coherence preservation. In addition, we provide a general parameterization together with a Floquet-based coherence-time expression, which elucidates the protocol's working principles and lowers the barrier to adoption. Collectively, these advances position our scheme as the state-of-the-art strategy for qubit control, paving the way for a wider class of quantum technologies to be realized using dressed-qubit architectures.</description>

Abstract: We characterise non-Hermitian Fabry-P\'erot resonances in high-contrast resonator systems and study the properties of their associated resonant modes from continuous differential models. We consider two non-Hermitian effects: the exceptional point degeneracy and the skin effect induced by imaginary gauge potentials. Using the propagation matrix formalism, we characterise these two non-Hermitian effects beyond the subwavelength regime. This analysis allows us to (i) establish the existence of exceptional points purely from radiation conditions and to (ii) prove that the non-Hermitian skin effect applies uniformly across resonant modes, yielding broadband edge localisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies suggest that solenoidal turbulence can significantly enhance fusion reactivity, yet no standard diagnostic exists to directly measure these solenoidal flows in high-energy-density plasmas, nor to distinguish between solenoidal and compressional turbulence. We propose a method that directly diagnoses the energy and spatial structure of this rotational turbulence using the cross-polarization scattering of a probe laser. By coupling to the plasma vorticity, the scattering generates a cross-polarized signal proportional to the turbulent vorticity, effectively acting as a calorimeter for shear flows. We identify a diffractive scattering signature analogous to ``Debye-Scherrer ring'' that reveals the eddy size distribution. We show that this technique is applicable to National Ignition Facility (NIF) implosion conditions and other high-energy-density scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian degeneracies where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, giving rise to unusual physical effects across scientific disciplines. The concept of EPs has recently been extended to nonlinear physical systems. We theoretically demonstrate a universal topology in the nonlinear parameter space for a large class of physical systems that support 2nd order EPs in the linear regime. Knowledge of this topology (called elliptic umbilic singularity in bifurcation theory) deepens our understanding of 2nd order linear EPs, which here emerge as coalescence of 4 nonlinear eigenvectors. This helps guide future experimental discovery of nonlinear EPs and their classification, establish rigorous bounds of sensitivity enhancement of EPs in nonlinear systems, and helps envision and optimize technological applications of nonlinear EPs. Our theoretical approach is general and can be extended to nonlinear perturbations of 3rd and higher-order EPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first direct mapping of the frequency-resolved local density of states (LDOS) in a photonic time crystal (PTC) implemented as an array of time-periodically modulated LC resonators at microwave frequencies. Broadband white noise probes the system and yields an LDOS lineshape near the momentum gap that can be decomposed into absorptive and dispersive Lorentzian components. The finite LDOS peak at the gap frequency, which grows with modulation strength, implies that the spontaneous emission rate of an emitter coupled to the PTC would be maximized at that frequency. The measured spectra are in good agreement with classical non-Hermitian Floquet theory. As the modulation-induced gain exceeds intrinsic losses, the system undergoes a transition to a narrow-band self-oscillation (lasing) regime. These results open a route to nonequilibrium photonics and bring time-periodic LDOS engineering closer to practical realization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The on-chip integration of nonreciprocal optical devices remains a critical challenge for modern optoelectronics, as conventional magneto-optic approaches suffer from material incompatibility and excessive optical losses. Nonlinear photonic diodes have emerged as a promising magnet-free alternative, yet their widespread adoption has been constrained by inherent limitations in reconfigurability. Here, we present an all-silicon, electrically tunable photonic diode leveraging engineered chiral resonances in an ultra-compact microring architecture. The pronounced asymmetric modal coupling enables nonreciprocal transmission with two distinct operation modes at threshold powers down to -5 dBm. The chirality further enables unprecedented control over self-pulsation dynamics, manifesting in propagation-direction-dependent oscillation thresholds and temporal signatures. Crucially, post-fabrication electrical reconfigurability allows dynamic switching between forward, backward, and disabled states. This work represents a significant advancement in integrated nonreciprocal photonics, offering a CMOS-compatible solution with transformative potential for optical interconnects, photonic neural networks, and signal processing systems.</description>

      <title>Chat to Chip: Large Language Model Based Design of Arbitrarily Shaped Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional metasurface design is limited by the computational cost of full-wave simulations, preventing thorough exploration of complex configurations. Data-driven approaches have emerged as a solution to this bottleneck, replacing costly simulations with rapid neural network evaluations and enabling near-instant design for meta-atoms. Despite advances, implementing a new optical function still requires building and training a task-specific network, along with exhaustive searches for suitable architectures and hyperparameters. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs), by contrast, sidestep this laborious process with a simple fine-tuning technique. However, applying LLMs to the design of nanophotonic devices, particularly for arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces, is still in its early stages; as such tasks often require graphical networks. Here, we show that an LLM, fed with descriptive inputs of arbitrarily shaped metasurface geometries, can learn the physical relationships needed for spectral prediction and inverse design. We further benchmarked a range of open-weight LLMs and identified relationships between accuracy and model size at the billion-parameter level. We demonstrated that 1-D token-wise LLMs provide a practical tool to designing 2-D arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces. Linking natural-language interaction to electromagnetic modelling, this "chat-to-chip" workflow represents a step toward more user-friendly data-driven nanophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that unifies pump absorption, gain saturation, thermo-optic distortion, and cavity diffraction into a self-consistent model of multi-pass pumped solid-state lasers. By deriving a theoretical formulation of the nonlinear coupling of the superimposed pump energy and effective absorption, we prove an unique steady-state solution exists. Applied to the multi-pass Yb:YAG thin-disk module, the framework is quantitatively validated with experiments, reproducing a well matched absorption tendency, errors in output power, beam diameter and M^2 within 3.0%, 1.7%, and 0.05 respectively. This approach provides predictive guidelines for pump-power scaling and pass-number optimization in high-power lasers.</description>

      <title>Enhanced posterior sampling via diffusion models for efficient metasurfaces inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces faces inherent challenges due to the nonlinear and highly complex relationship between geometric configurations and their electromagnetic behavior. Traditional optimization approaches often suffer from excessive computational demands and a tendency to converge to suboptimal solutions. This study presents a diffusion-based generative framework that incorporates a dedicated consistency constraint and advanced posterior sampling methods to ensure adherence to desired electromagnetic specifications. Through rigorous validation on small-scale metasurface configurations, the proposed approach demonstrates marked enhancements in both accuracy and reliability of the generated designs. Furthermore, we introduce a scalable methodology that extends inverse design capabilities to large-scale metasurfaces, validated for configurations of up to $98 \times 98$ nanopillars. Notably, this approach enables rapid design generation completed in minute by leveraging models trained on substantially smaller arrays ($23 \times 23$). These innovations establish a robust and efficient framework for high-precision metasurface inverse design.</description>

      <title>High-Repetition-Rate Projection Multiphoton Lithography for Large-Area Sub-Micron 3D Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution lithographic techniques are often limited by low volumetric throughput, since there is no universal and scalable manufacturing process that can produce 3D metasurfaces. In this work, we demonstrate a high-speed holographic 3D printing platform based on spatiotemporal beam shaping, exceeding the repetition rate while keeping the resolution high. The system integrates a femtosecond laser source with a spectral pulse compressor and a beam shaper to project uniform, axially confined light fields to project patterns directly on the advanced photoresists using a Digital Micromirror Device DMD. We investigate the process window for rapid polymerization, optimizing the photoinitiator choice to eliminate thermal crosstalk at high repetition rates. Using this setup, we achieve a production throughput of more than a million voxels per second with sub-micron resolution below 400 nm. The system's reliability is validated through the fabrication of large-area woodpile-like lattices and uniform micropillar arrays, establishing a workflow for scalable manufacturing of micro-optical components.</description>

      <title>Chernoff Information Bottleneck for Covert Quantum Target Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paradigm of quantum metrology and sensing aims to identify a quantum advantage in precision at a fixed energy of the probe state. However, in practice, employing high-energy classical probes is often simpler than leveraging the quantum regime. This is not the case of covert sensing scenarios, where detection must be performed while avoiding to be discovered by an adversary, because increasing energy unduly facilitates the adversary. In this paper, we introduce a general framework to assess the quantum advantage in covert situations based on extending the information bottleneck principle to decision problems via the Chernoff information. We demonstrate how entangled photonic probes paired with photon counting significantly outperform classical coherent transmitters in covert detection and ranging, often representing the only option for secrecy. Thus, our work highlights the great potential of integrating quantum sensing into LiDAR and Radar systems to enhance covert performance.</description>
