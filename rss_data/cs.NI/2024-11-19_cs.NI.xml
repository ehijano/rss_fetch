      <title>A Combined Environmental Monitoring Framework based on WSN Clustering and VANET Edge Computation Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) have been extensively used in IoT applications for environmental monitoring, especially in rural and agricultural areas. In this paper we present a novel combined approach which uses both WSN and VANET clustered structures for the efficient gathering and processing of environmental parameters in long eNodeB/RSU-enabled roads/highways, which cross large rural areas. The former (WSNs) is used for traditional sensing and data gathering, whereas the latter (VANET) is used for both (a) performing intermediate processing based on modern edge computation offloading techniques, and (b) propagating the data (either raw data or computed results) to the residing eNodeB/RSUs. Extended experimental measurements, taken via the combined use of SUMO and Veins simulation platforms (and focusing in the air quality monitoring experimental case), demonstrate the high efficiency and scalability of the presented approach over very large deployment areas.</description>

      <title>Link-identified Routing Architecture in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks have the potential to provide low-latency communication with global coverage. To unleash this potential, it is crucial to achieve efficient packet delivery. In this paper, we propose a Link-identified Routing (LiR) architecture for LEO satellite networks. The LiR architecture leverages the deterministic neighbor relation of LEO constellations, and identifies each inter-satellite link (ISL). Moreover, LiR architecture adopts source-route-style forwarding based on in-packet bloom filter (BF). Each satellite could efficiently encode multiple ISL identifiers via an in-packet BF to specify the end-to-end path for the packets. Due to false positives caused by BF, the more ISLs are encoded at a time, the more redundant forwarding cases emerge. Based on the topology characteristics, we derive the expected forwarding overhead in a closed-form and propose the optimal encoding policy. To accommodate link-state changes in LEO satellite networks, we propose the on-demand rerouting scheme and the on-demand detouring scheme to address the intermittent ISLs. We also elaborate how to take advantage of LiR architecture to achieve seamless handover for ground-satellite links (GSLs). Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments and packet-level simulations to verify our analytical results and evaluate the performance of the LiR architecture.</description>

      <title>To Adopt or Not to Adopt L4S-compatible Congestion Control? Understanding Performance in a Partial L4S Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With few exceptions, the path to deployment for any Internet technology requires that there be some benefit to unilateral adoption of the new technology. In an Internet where the technology is not fully deployed, is an individual better off sticking to the status quo, or adopting the new technology? This question is especially relevant in the context of the Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S) architecture, where the full benefit is realized only when compatible protocols (scalable congestion control, accurate ECN, and flow isolation at queues) are adopted at both endpoints of a connection and also at the bottleneck router. In this paper, we consider the perspective of the sender of an L4S flow using scalable congestion control, without knowing whether the bottleneck router uses an L4S queue, or whether other flows sharing the bottleneck queue are also using scalable congestion control. We show that whether the sender uses TCP Prague or BBRv2 as the scalable congestion control, it cannot be assured that it will not harm or be harmed by another flow sharing the bottleneck link. We further show that the harm is not necessarily mitigated when a scalable flow shares a bottleneck with multiple classic flows. Finally, we evaluate the approach of BBRv3, where scalable congestion control is used only when the path delay is small, and ECN feedback is ignored otherwise, and we show that it is not effective for coexistence in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Beyond Normal: Learning Spatial Density Models of Node Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning models of complex spatial density functions, representing the steady-state density of mobile nodes moving on a two-dimensional terrain, can assist in network design and optimization problems, e.g., by accelerating the computation of the density function during a parameter sweep. We address the question of applicability for off-the-shelf mixture density network models for the description of mobile node density over a disk. We propose the use of M\"obius distributions to retain symmetric spatial relations, yet be flexible enough to capture changes as one radially traverses the disk. The mixture models for M\"obius versus Gaussian distributions are compared and the benefits of choosing M\"obius distributions become evident, yet we also observe that learning mixtures of M\"obius distributions is a fragile process, when using current tools, compared to learning mixtures of Gaussians.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin for Advanced Network Planning: Tackling Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operational data in next-generation networks offers a valuable resource for Mobile Network Operators to autonomously manage their systems and predict potential network issues. Machine Learning and Digital Twin can be applied to gain important insights for intelligent decision-making. This paper proposes a framework for Radio Frequency planning and failure detection using Digital Twin reducing the level of manual intervention. In this study, we propose a methodology for analyzing Radio Frequency issues as external interference employing clustering techniques in operational networks, and later incorporating this in the planning process. Simulation results demonstrate that the architecture proposed can improve planning operations through a data-aided anomaly detection strategy.</description>

      <title>Mixing Neural Networks and Exponential Moving Averages for Predicting Wireless Links Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the behavior of a wireless link in terms of, e.g., the frame delivery ratio, is a critical task for optimizing the performance of wireless industrial communication systems. This is because industrial applications are typically characterized by stringent dependability and end-to-end latency requirements, which are adversely affected by channel quality degradation.
  In this work, we studied two neural network models for Wi-Fi link quality prediction in dense indoor environments. Experimental results show that their accuracy outperforms conventional methods based on exponential moving averages, due to their ability to capture complex patterns about communications, including the effects of shadowing and multipath propagation, which are particularly pronounced in industrial scenarios. This highlights the potential of neural networks for predicting spectrum behavior in challenging operating conditions, and suggests that they can be exploited to improve determinism and dependability of wireless communications, fostering their adoption in the industry.</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Differential Topology based Algorithms for Resilient Network of UAV Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks face severe challenges of communication network split (CNS) issues caused by massive damage in hostile environments. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to restore network connectivity by repositioning remaining UAVs based on damage information within local topologies. Particularly, the locations of destroyed UAVs distributed in gaps between disconnected sub-nets are considered for recovery trajectory planning. Specifically, we construct the multi-hop differential sub-graph (MDSG) to represent local damage-varying topologies. Based on this, we develop two distinct algorithms to address CNS issues. The first approach leverages an artificial potential field algorithm to calculate the recovery velocities via MDSG, enabling simple deployment on low-intelligence UAVs. In the second approach, we design an MDSG-based graph convolution framework to find the recovery topology for high-intelligence swarms. As per the unique topology of MDSG, we propose a novel bipartite graph convolution operation, enhanced with a batch-processing mechanism to improve graph convolution efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms expedite the recovery with significant margin while improving the spatial coverage and topology degree uniformity after recovery.</description>

      <title>Next-generation optical networks to sustain connectivity of the future: All roads lead to optical-computing-enabled network?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From an architectural perspective with the main goal of reducing the effective traffic load in the network and thus gaining more operational efficiency, optical networks have been essentially remained the same in the recent two decades since the year 2000s with the success and then dominance of optical-bypass mode. In the optical-bypass-enabled network, the add/drop and cross-connect functions constitute the fundamental operations in handling the traffic at the optical layer, whose the underlying principle lies in the fact that in cross-connecting in-transit lightpaths over an intermediate node, such lightpaths must be guarded from each other in a certain dimension, be it the time, frequency or spatial domain, to avoid interference, which is treated as destructive. In view of the rapid progresses in the realm of optical computing enabling the precisely controlled interference between optical channels for various computing capabilities, we envision a different perspective to turn the long-established wisdom in optical-bypass network around by putting the optical channel interference to a good use, resulting into the so-called optical-computing-enabled network. This paper presents two illustrative examples based on the optical aggregation and optical XOR operations which have been progressively maturing and thus, could be feasibly integrated into the current legacy infrastructure with possibly minimal disruptions. We then propose a detailed case study in formulating and solving the network coding-enabled optical networks, demonstrating the efficacy of the optical-computing-enabled network, and highlighting the unique challenges tied with greater complexities in network design problems, compared to optical-bypass counterpart</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Image Compression for Wireless Communications: Impacts on Reliability,Throughput, and Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In wireless communications, efficient image transmission must balance reliability, throughput, and latency, especially under dynamic channel conditions. This paper presents an adaptive and progressive pipeline for learned image compression (LIC)-based architectures tailored to such environments. We investigate two state-of-the-art learning-based models: the hyperprior model and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN). The hyperprior model achieves superior compression performance through lossless compression in the bottleneck but is susceptible to bit errors, necessitating the use of error correction or retransmission mechanisms. In contrast, the VQGAN decoder demonstrates robust image reconstruction capabilities even in the absence of channel coding, enhancing reliability in challenging transmission scenarios. We propose progressive versions of both models, enabling partial image transmission and decoding under imperfect channel conditions. This progressive approach not only maintains image integrity under poor channel conditions but also significantly reduces latency by allowing immediate partial image availability. We evaluate our pipeline using the Kodak high-resolution image dataset under a Rayleigh fading wireless channel model simulating dynamic conditions. The results indicate that the progressive transmission framework enhances reliability and latency while maintaining or improving throughput compared to non-progressive counterparts across various Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels. Specifically, the progressive-hyperprior model consistently outperforms others in latency metrics, particularly in the 99.9th percentile waiting time-a measure indicating the maximum waiting time experienced by 99.9% of transmission instances-across all SNRs, and achieves higher throughput in low SNR scenarios. where Adaptive WebP fails.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Entanglement-Enabled Connectivity in QLANs using SeQUeNCe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs) represent a promising building block for larger scale quantum networks with the ambitious goal -- in a long time horizon -- of realizing a Quantum Internet. Surprisingly, the physical topology of a QLAN can be enriched by a set of artificial links, enabled by shared multipartite entangled states among the nodes of the network. This novel concept of artificial topology revolutionizes the possibilities of connectivity within the local network, enabling an on-demand manipulation of the artificial network topology. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of the QLAN model in SeQUeNCe, a discrete-event simulator of quantum networks. Specifically, we provide an analysis of how network nodes interact, with an emphasis on the interplay between quantum operations and classical signaling within the network. Remarkably, through the modeling of a measurement protocol and a correction protocol, our QLAN model implementation enables the simulation of the manipulation process of a shared entangled quantum state, and the subsequent engineering of the entanglement-based connectivity. Our simulations demonstrate how to obtain different virtual topologies with different manipulations of the shared resources and with all the possible measurement outcomes, with an arbitrary number of nodes within the network.</description>

      <title>Careless Whisper: Exploiting Stealthy End-to-End Leakage in Mobile Instant Messengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A majority of the global population relies on mobile instant messengers for personal and professional communication. Besides plain messaging, many services implement convenience features, such as delivery- and read receipts, informing a user when a message has successfully reached its target. Furthermore, they have widely adopted security and privacy improvements, such as end-to-end encryption.
  In this paper, we show that even when messages are sufficiently encrypted, private information about a user and their devices can still be extracted by an adversary. Using specifically crafted messages that stealthily trigger delivery receipts allows arbitrary users to be pinged without their knowledge or consent. We demonstrate how an attacker could extract private information, such as the number of user devices, their operating system, and their online- and activity status. Moreover, we show the feasibility of resource exhaustion attacks draining a user's battery or data allowance. Due to the widespread adoption of vulnerable messengers (WhatsApp and Signal), we show that over two billion customers can be targeted simply by knowing their phone number.</description>

      <title>SpiderDAN: Matching Augmentation in Demand-Aware Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph augmentation is a fundamental and well-studied problem that arises in network optimization. We consider a new variant of this model motivated by reconfigurable communication networks. In this variant, we consider a given physical network and the measured communication demands between the nodes. Our goal is to augment the given physical network with a matching, so that the shortest path lengths in the augmented network, weighted with the demands, are minimal.We prove that this problem is NP-hard, even if the physical network is a cycle. We then use results from demand-aware network design to provide a constant-factor approximation algorithm for adding a matching in case that only a few nodes in the network cause almost all the communication. For general real-world communication patterns, we design and evaluate a series of heuristics that can deal with arbitrary graphs as the underlying network structure. Our algorithms are validated experimentally using real-world traces (from e.g., Facebook) of data centers.</description>

      <title>The Challenges of Trace-Driven Wi-Fi Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.03905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wi-Fi link is unpredictable and it has never been easy to measure it perfectly; there is always bound to be some bias. As wireless becomes the medium of choice, it is useful to capture Wi-Fi traces in order to evaluate, tune, and adapt the different applications and protocols. Several methods have been used for the purpose of experimenting with different wireless conditions: simulation, experimentation, and trace-driven emulation. In this paper, we argue that trace-driven emulation is the most favorable approach. In the absence of a trace-driven emulation tool for Wi-Fi, we evaluate the state-of-the-art trace-driven emulation tool for Cellular networks and we identify issues for Wi-Fi: interference with concurrent traffic, interference with its own traffic if measurements are done on both uplink and downlink simultaneously, and packet loss. We provide a solid argument as to why this tool falls short of effectively capturing Wi-Fi traces. The outcome of our analysis guides us to propose a number of suggestions on how the existing tool can be tweaked to accurately capture Wi-Fi traces.</description>

      <title>Multi-Link Operation and Wireless Digital Twin to Support Enhanced Roaming in Next-Gen Wi-Fi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation of Wi-Fi is meant to achieve ultra-high reliability for wireless communication. Several approaches are available to this extent, some of which are being considered for inclusion in standards specifications, including coordination of access points to reduce interference.
  In this paper, we propose a centralized architecture based on digital twins, called WiTwin, with the aim of supporting wireless stations in selecting the optimal association according to a set of parameters. Unlike prior works, we assume that Wi-Fi 7 features like multi-link operation (MLO) are available. Moreover, one of the main goals of this architecture is to preserve communication quality in the presence of mobility, by helping stations to perform reassociation at the right time and in the best way.</description>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed them from basic conversational tools into sophisticated entities capable of complex reasoning and decision-making. These advancements have led to the development of specialized LLM-based agents designed for diverse tasks such as coding and web browsing. As these agents become more capable, the need for a robust framework that facilitates global communication and collaboration among them towards advanced objectives has become increasingly critical. Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network (DAWN) addresses this need by offering a versatile framework that integrates LLM-based agents with traditional software systems, enabling the creation of agentic applications suited for a wide range of use cases. DAWN enables distributed agents worldwide to register and be easily discovered through Gateway Agents. Collaborations among these agents are coordinated by a Principal Agent equipped with reasoning strategies. DAWN offers three operational modes: No-LLM Mode for deterministic tasks, Copilot for augmented decision-making, and LLM Agent for autonomous operations. Additionally, DAWN ensures the safety and security of agent collaborations globally through a dedicated safety, security, and compliance layer, protecting the network against attackers and adhering to stringent security and compliance standards. These features make DAWN a robust network for deploying agent-based applications across various industries.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Predictive Maintenance in Mining Mobile Machinery through a TinyML-enabled Hierarchical Inference Network</title>

Abstract: Mining machinery operating in variable environments faces high wear and unpredictable stress, challenging Predictive Maintenance (PdM). This paper introduces the Edge Sensor Network for Predictive Maintenance (ESN-PdM), a hierarchical inference framework across edge devices, gateways, and cloud services for real-time condition monitoring. The system dynamically adjusts inference locations--on-device, on-gateway, or on-cloud--based on trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and battery life, leveraging Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) techniques for model optimization on resource-constrained devices. Performance evaluations showed that on-sensor and on-gateway inference modes achieved over 90\% classification accuracy, while cloud-based inference reached 99\%. On-sensor inference reduced power consumption by approximately 44\%, enabling up to 104 hours of operation. Latency was lowest for on-device inference (3.33 ms), increasing when offloading to the gateway (146.67 ms) or cloud (641.71 ms). The ESN-PdM framework provides a scalable, adaptive solution for reliable anomaly detection and PdM, crucial for maintaining machinery uptime in remote environments. By balancing accuracy, latency, and energy consumption, this approach advances PdM frameworks for industrial applications.</description>
