      <title>Modal Semantics for Reasoning with Probability and Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper belongs to the field of probabilistic modal logic, focusing on a comparative analysis of two distinct semantics: one rooted in Kripke semantics and the other in neighbourhood semantics. The primary distinction lies in the following: The latter allows us to adequately express belief functions (lower probabilities) over propositions, whereas the former does not. Thus, neighbourhood semantics is more expressive. The main part of the work is a section in which we study the modal equivalence between probabilistic Kripke models and a subclass of belief neighbourhood models, namely additive ones. We study how to obtain modally equivalent structures.</description>

      <title>Definable $\mathcal C^r$ structures on definable topological groups in d-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Definable topological groups whose topologies are affine have definable $\mathcal C^r$ structures in d-minimal expansions of ordered fields, where $r$ is a positive integer. We prove this fact using a new notion called partition degree of a definable set. Basic properties of partition degree are also studied.</description>

      <title>Randomness versus superspeedability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speedable numbers are real numbers which are algorithmically approximable from below and whose approximations can be accelerated nonuniformly. We begin this article by answering a question of Barmpalias by separating a strict subclass that we will refer to as superspeedable from the speedable numbers; for elements of this subclass, acceleration is possible uniformly and to an even higher degree. This new type of benign left-approximations of numbers then integrates itself into a hierarchy of other such notions studied in a growing body of recent work. We add a new perspective to this study by juxtaposing this hierachy with the well-studied hierachy of algorithmic randomness notions.</description>

      <title>The Frobenius equivalence and Beck-Chevalley condition for Algebraic Weak Factorisation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a locally cartesian closed category carries a weak factorisation system, then the left maps are stable under pullback along right maps if and only if the right maps are closed under pushforward along right maps. We refer to this statement as the Frobenius equivalence and in this paper we state and prove an analogical statement for algebraic weak factorisation systems. These algebraic weak factorisation systems are an explicit variant of the more traditional weak factorisation systems in that the factorisation and the lifts are part of the structure of an algebraic weak factorisation system and are not merely required to exist. Our work has been motivated by the categorical semantics of type theory, where the Frobenius equivalence provides a useful tool for constructing dependent function types. We illustrate our ideas using split fibrations of groupoids, which are the backbone of the groupoid model of Hofmann and Streicher.</description>

      <title>Constructive Interpolation and Concept-Based Beth Definability for Description Logics via Sequents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive method applicable to a large number of description logics (DLs) for establishing the concept-based Beth definability property (CBP) based on sequent systems. Using the highly expressive DL RIQ as a case study, we introduce novel sequent calculi for RIQ-ontologies and show how certain interpolants can be computed from sequent calculus proofs, which permit the extraction of explicit definitions of implicitly definable concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sequent-based approach to computing interpolants and definitions within the context of DLs, as well as the first proof that RIQ enjoys the CBP. Moreover, due to the modularity of our sequent systems, our results hold for any restriction of RIQ, and are applicable to other DLs by suitable modifications.</description>

      <title>Taking Bi-Intuitionistic Logic First-Order: A Proof-Theoretic Investigation via Polytree Sequents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that extending the Hilbert axiomatic system for first-order intuitionistic logic with an exclusion operator, that is dual to implication, collapses the domains in the model into a constant domain. This makes it a very challenging problem to find a sound and complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic with non-constant domains, that is also conservative over first-order intuitionistic logic. We solve this problem by presenting the first sound and complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic with increasing domains. We formalize our proof system in a labeled polytree sequent calculus (a notational variant of nested sequents), and prove that it enjoys cut-elimination and is conservative over first-order intuitionistic logic. A key feature of our calculus is an explicit eigenvariable context, which allows us to control precisely the scope of free variables in a polytree structure. Semantically this context can be seen as encoding a notion of Scott's existence predicate for intuitionistic logic. This turns out to be crucial to avoid the collapse of domains and to prove the completeness of our proof system. The explicit consideration of the variable context in a formula sheds light on a previously overlooked dependency between the residuation principle and the existence predicate in the first-order setting, that may help explain the difficulty in obtaining a complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic.</description>

      <title>Arrow's theorem, ultrafilters, and reverse mathematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper initiates the reverse mathematics of social choice theory, studying Arrow's impossibility theorem and related results including Fishburn's possibility theorem and the Kirman--Sondermann theorem within the framework of reverse mathematics. We formalise fundamental notions of social choice theory in second-order arithmetic, yielding a definition of countable society which is tractable in $\mathsf{RCA}_0$. We then show that the Kirman--Sondermann analysis of social welfare functions can be carried out in $\mathsf{RCA}_0$. This approach yields a proof of Arrow's theorem in $\mathsf{RCA}_0$, and thus in $\mathrm{PRA}$, since Arrow's theorem can be formalised as a $\Pi^0_1$ sentence. Finally we show that Fishburn's possibility theorem for countable societies is equivalent to $\mathsf{ACA}_0$ over $\mathsf{RCA}_0$.</description>

      <title>Building models in small cardinals in local abstract elementary classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many results in the literature where superstablity-like independence notions, without any categoricity assumptions, have been used to show the existence of larger models. In this paper we show that \emph{stability} is enough to construct larger models for small cardinals assuming a mild locality condition for Galois types.
  $\mathbf{Theorem.}$ Suppose $\lambda&lt;2^{\aleph_0}$. Let $\mathbf{K}$ be an abstract elementary class with $\lambda \geq LS(\mathbf{K})$. Assume $\mathbf{K}$ has amalgamation in $\lambda$, no maximal model in $\lambda$, and is stable in $\lambda$. If $\mathbf{K}$ is $(&lt;\lambda^+, \lambda)$-local, then $\mathbf{K}$ has a model of cardinality $\lambda^{++}$.
  The set theoretic assumption that $\lambda&lt;2^{\aleph_0}$ and model theoretic assumption of stability in $\lambda$ can be weakened to the model theoretic assumptions that $|\mathbf{S}^{na}(M)|&lt; 2^{\aleph_0}$ for every $M \in \mathbf{K}_\lambda$ and stability for $\lambda$-algebraic types in $\lambda$. This is a significant improvement of Theorem 0.1., as the result holds on some unstable abstract elementary classes.</description>

      <title>Whitehead's problem and condensed mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the better-known independence results in general mathematics is Shelah's solution to Whitehead's problem of whether $\mathrm{Ext}^1(A,\mathbb{Z})=0$ implies that an abelian group $A$ is free. The point of departure for the present work is Clausen and Scholze's proof that, in contrast, one natural interpretation of Whitehead's problem within their recently-developed framework of condensed mathematics has an affirmative answer in $\mathsf{ZFC}$. We record two alternative proofs of this result, as well as several original variations on it, both for their intrinsic interest and as a springboard for a broader study of the relations between condensed mathematics and set theoretic forcing. We show more particularly how the condensation $\underline{X}$ of any locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ may be viewed as an organized presentation of the forcing names for the points of canonical interpretations of $X$ in all possible set-forcing extensions of the universe, and we argue our main result by way of this fact. We show also that when interpreted within the category of light condensed abelian groups, Whitehead's problem is again independent of the $\mathsf{ZFC}$ axioms. In fact we show that it is consistent that Whitehead's problem has a negative solution within the category of $\kappa$-condensed abelian groups for every uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, but that this scenario, in turn, is inconsistent with the existence of a strongly compact cardinal.</description>

      <title>Splitting differential equations using Galois theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is interested in pullbacks under the logarithmic derivative of algebraic ordinary differential equations. In particular, assuming the solution set of an equation is internal to the constants, we would like to determine when its pullback is itself internal to the constants. To do so, we develop, using model-theoretic Galois theory and differential algebra, a connection between internality of the pullback and the splitting of a short exact sequence of algebraic Galois groups. We then use algebraic group theory to obtain internality and non-internality results.</description>
