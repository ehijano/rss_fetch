      <title>Microfluidic Study of Evaporation-Driven Crystallization of Saline and Ammonia Brines under Hydrogen Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underground storage of hydrogen and ammonia in geological formations is essential for renewable energy integration, but salt precipitation during gas injection may threaten storage performance. While extensively studied for CO2 systems, precipitation mechanisms in hydrogen-brine and ammonia-brine systems remain poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive microfluidic investigation of salt crystallization during hydrogen injection into saline and ammonia-containing brines using high-pressure microfluidics. We conducted 81 high-pressure experiments systematically varying brine composition (1-5 mol/kg NaCl), chemical additives (surfactants, alcohols, ammonia), and hydrogen flow rates (200-1300 mL/min). Quantitative image analysis reveals that hydrogen-induced precipitation differs fundamentally from CO2 systems. Hydrogen drives physical precipitation via evaporation and capillary trapping, producing discrete, localized deposits. In contrast, CO2-ammonia systems generate extensive reactive precipitation of ammonium bicarbonate with interconnected crystal networks. Interfacial tension (IFT) controls both residual brine distribution and final crystal coverage: high-IFT fluids form large, interconnected brine pools promoting extensive crystallization, while low-IFT fluids create isolated pools reducing crystal coverage by 50\%. Alcohol and surfactant additives suppress precipitation by enhancing brine mobility, whereas ammonia paradoxically increases crystal fractions despite lower IFT. Higher flow rates accelerate crystallization across all compositions, enabling operational mitigation strategies. and demonstrate that gas-specific, rather than CO2-analog, risk assessments are essential for underground hydrogen storage design. The effectiveness of chemical additives offers promising pathways for near-wellbore protection in underground hydrogen storage operations.</description>

      <title>Hurdle-IMDL: An Imbalanced Learning Framework for Infrared Rainfall Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model. Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact events.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Emission Cascade Predicting Progression to Failure of Rock and Bone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi brittle materials such as rock and bone are understood to fail via microcrack coalescence. The accompanying Acoustic Emission (AE) event rate is known to increase as failure progresses. Here we examine the progression of the AE event rate for both rock and bone under conditions where failure progresses under fixed loading. The experiments for rock entail subjecting granite beams to a fixed loading under three point bending and monitoring the time-dependent failure. For bone, human cadaver skulls are loaded under pinning loads similar to those used for immobilization of the head for neurosurgical procedures. AE rates are shown to be consistent with a rate dependent material failure law including a quasi-linear cascade of the inverse AE energy rate in the lead up to failure that is shown here to arise because of a coupling wherein a response rate is a power law of a driver and the driver is, in turn, a power law of the accumulated response. For both materials and experimental configurations this cascade provides warning of impending failure. For granite beams there is accurate prediction of failure time over the final 30 percent of the specimens lifetimes, which ranged from 35 seconds to two days. For skull fracture, the commencement of the failure cascade provides 30-70 seconds for warning of failure, which would be sufficient for basic remedial action to avoid patient injury in a surgical application.</description>

      <title>Energy-based opinion on the correlation between stress drop and rupture speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stress drop $\Delta\tau$ and rupture speed $V_r$ are two important earthquake source parameters that control the characteristics of rupture process and the associated ground motion. However, how the two parameters correlate with one another is not fully clear and sometimes can be controversial. Here I propose using the energy balance relation derived from fracture mechanics to understand the correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$. The central idea is to explore the balance between fracture energy $G_c$ and dynamic energy release rate $G_d$ (which itself is a function of $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$) under various conditions of $G_c$. Using averaged values of $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$ for comparison, it is shown that near constant $G_c$ can yield a positive correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$, whereas variable $G_c$ dependent on space, time or other factors may cause a negative correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$. These results suggest a need to examine the condition of other factors (such as $G_c$) when evaluating the correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$. Extra issues can complicate the evaluation of the correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$ when rupture process is inferred from far-field observations, accompanied by strong spatiotemporal variation, or followed by additional phases, which should be investigated by future studies.</description>

      <title>Self-Enhancing Halite Growth Creates Secondary Porous Networks During CO2 Storage in Saline Aquifers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Salt precipitation during CO2 injection into saline aquifers obstructs flow-controlling pore throats and reduces permeability, yet reactive transport models assume salt forms dispersed, non-porous crystals with minimal flow impact. We demonstrate that halite instead creates three-dimensional porous networks with 40% internal porosity through self-enhancing growth mechanisms absent from current models. Time-lapse X-ray micro-computed tomography and spectral imaging reveal preferential nucleation at gas-liquid interfaces, where porous hydrophilic aggregates generate capillary suction that draws brine films toward precipitation sites, accelerating growth and expanding reactive surface area in a positive feedback loop. Spectral tomography shows systematic density gradients reflecting two-stage precipitation: dense macrocrystalline cores formed under moderate supersaturation and evaporation, surrounded by microcrystalline overgrowths from rapid late-stage dynamics. These overgrowths create umbrella-like crusts that encapsulate residual brine beneath surface layers. This porous architecture explains why modest porosity reduction causes severe permeability decline, as aggregates preferentially obstruct flow percolation pathways rather than uniformly cementing grains or filling pore space. Five interconnected mechanisms drive self-enhancing growth across nano- to centimeter scales: interface nucleation, secondary porous structure formation, steep concentration gradients, hydrophilic substrate film maintenance, and capillary-driven solute delivery. Our quantitative characterization of internal salt architecture, reactive surface areas, and pore connectivity provides essential parameters for improving predictive models of evaporation-precipitation dynamics in carbon storage, soil salinization, and cultural heritage preservation.</description>
