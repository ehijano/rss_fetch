      <title>On the Time-Frequency Localization Characteristics of the Delay-Doppler Plane Orthogonal Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the time-frequency (TF) localization characteristics of the prototype pulse of orthogonal delay-Doppler (DD) division multiplexing modulation, namely, the DD plane orthogonal pulse (DDOP). The TF localization characteristics examine how concentrated or spread out the energy of a pulse is in the joint TF domain, the time domain (TD), and the frequency domain (FD). We first derive the TF localization metrics of the DDOP, including its TF area, its time and frequency dispersions, and its direction parameter. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the DDOP exhibits a high energy spread in the TD, FD, and the joint TF domain, while adhering to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Thereafter, we discuss the potential advantages brought by the energy spread of the DDOP, especially with regard to harnessing both time and frequency diversities and enabling fine-resolution sensing. Subsequently, we examine the relationships between the time and frequency dispersions of the DDOP and those of the envelope functions of DDOP's TD and FD representations, paving the way for simplified determination of the TF localization metrics for more generalized variants of the DDOP and the pulses used in other DD domain modulation schemes. Finally, using numerical results, we validate our analysis and find further insights.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Radar Imaging Utilizing the Virtual Source Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates signle-antenna radar imaging with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Configuring phase shifts in a RIS-aided radar system can be thought as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging with a moving virtual source. With this perspective, the problem is modeled in the wavenumber domain and image forming algorithms are formulated for near and far field regions. Thus, a novel and intuitive perspective has been introduced to the RIS-aided radar imaging formation problem, opening a new avenue for adapting well-known SAR methods in the literature to these systems.</description>

      <title>Squint-Aware ISAC Precoding Towards Enhanced Dual-Functional Gain in Sub-Terahertz Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential benefits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are anticipated to play a significant role in future sub-terahertz (sub-THz) systems. However, the beam squint effect is pronounced in sub-THz systems, expanding coverage areas while severely degrading communication performance. Existing hybrid precoding designs struggle to balance both functionalities in the presence of beam squint, limiting the performance gain achievable through ISAC. To address this challenge, we propose two squint-aware hybrid precoding schemes for sub-THz systems that proactively regulate the correlation between communication and sensing channels, leveraging the inherent degrees of freedom in the hardware to enhance integrated gain. We introduce a squint-aware optimization-based hybrid precoding algorithm (SA-Opt) and develop an unsupervised learning-assisted complex-valued squint-aware network (CSP-Net) to reduce complexity, tailoring its architecture to the specific data and task characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is demonstrated through simulations.</description>

      <title>A Proximity-Based Approach for Dynamically Matching Industrial Assets and Their Operators Using Low-Power IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asset tracking solutions have proven their significance in industrial contexts, as evidenced by their successful commercialization (e.g., Hilti On!Track). However, a seamless solution for matching assets with their users, such as operators of construction power tools, is still missing. By enabling assetuser matching, organizations gain valuable insights that can be used to optimize user health and safety, asset utilization, and maintenance. This paper introduces a novel approach to address this gap by leveraging existing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed framework comprises the following components: i) a wearable device, ii) an IoT device attached to or embedded in the assets, iii) an algorithm to estimate the distance between assets and operators by exploiting simple received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and iv) a cloud-based algorithm that collects all estimated distances to derive the correct asset-operator matching. The effectiveness of the proposed system has been validated through indoor and outdoor experiments in a construction setting for identifying the operator of a power tool. A physical prototype was developed to evaluate the algorithms in a realistic setup. The results demonstrated a median accuracy of 0.49m in estimating the distance between assets and users, and up to 98.6% in correctly matching users with their assets.</description>

      <title>Parametric Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted Wideband Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) alters the reflection of incoming signals based on the phase-shift configuration assigned to its elements. This feature can be used to improve the signal strength for user equipments (UEs), expand coverage, and enhance spectral efficiency in wideband communication systems. Having accurate channel state information (CSI) is indispensable to realize the full potential of RIS-aided wideband systems. Unfortunately, CSI is challenging to acquire due to the passive nature of the RIS elements, which cannot perform transmit/receive signal processing. Recently, a parametric maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimator has been developed and demonstrated excellent estimation accuracy. However, this estimator is designed for narrowband systems with no non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths. In this paper, we develop a novel parametric ML channel estimator for RIS-assisted wideband systems, which can handle line-of-sight (LOS) paths in the base station (BS)-RIS and RIS-UE links as well as NLOS paths between the UE, BS, and RIS. We leverage the reduced subspace representation induced by the array geometry to suppress noise in unused dimensions, enabling accurate estimation of the NLOS paths. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates superior estimation performance for the BS-UE and RIS-UE channels, outperforming the existing ML channel estimator.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Mutual Coupling Characteristics for Channel Estimation in Holographic MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems represent a spatially constrained MIMO architecture with a massive number of antennas with small antenna spacing as a close approximation of a spatially continuous electromagnetic aperture. Accurate channel modeling is essential for realizing the full potential of this technology. In this paper, we investigate the impact of mutual coupling and spatial channel correlation on the estimation precision in holographic MIMO systems, as well as the importance of knowing their characteristics. We demonstrate that neglecting mutual coupling can lead to significant performance degradation for the minimum mean squared error estimator, emphasizing its critical consideration when designing estimation algorithms. Conversely, the least-squares estimator is resilient to mutual coupling but only yields good performance in high signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Our findings provide insights into how to design efficient estimation algorithms in holographic MIMO systems, aiding its practical implementation.</description>

      <title>A Robust Anti-noise Scheme for RF Fingerprint Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprint technology is utilized for wireless device identification, extensively employed in the internet of things (IoT). The operating environment for IoT devices is challenging, with pervasive noise and distortion on the signals which blur the feature space of RF fingerprints. Consequently, the model accuracy obtained through training at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios decreases with the low SNR of the received signals in testing. To solve the noise domain adaptation problem, an anti-noise scheme is proposed to enhance identification accuracy of RF fingerprint at varying SNRs. The squared cross power spectral density (SCPSD) features are first proposed to obtain the same RF fingerprint representation. Subsequently, the specific effect of noise on SCPSD is theoretically derived and the rationality of the scheme is demonstrated through simulation experiments. Finally, 60 off-the-shelf ZigBee devices are employed to evaluate the performance of the anti-noise algorithm. The experimental results show that employing the random subspace k-nearest neighbors (RSKNN) classifier not only effectively classifies devices with multi-cluster feature, but combined with the anti-noise scheme can significantly improve the accuracy by approximately 46% for SNRs not less than 5 dB.</description>

      <title>A Review on Deep Learning Autoencoder in the Design of Next-Generation Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional mathematical models used in designing next-generation communication systems often fall short due to inherent simplifications, narrow scope, and computational limitations. In recent years, the incorporation of deep learning (DL) methodologies into communication systems has made significant progress in system design and performance optimisation. Autoencoders (AEs) have become essential, enabling end-to-end learning that allows for the combined optimisation of transmitters and receivers. Consequently, AEs offer a data-driven methodology capable of bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexities. The paper presents a comprehensive survey of the application of AEs within communication systems, with a particular focus on their architectures, associated challenges, and future directions. We examine 120 recent studies across wireless, optical, semantic, and quantum communication fields, categorising them according to transceiver design, channel modelling, digital signal processing, and computational complexity. This paper further examines the challenges encountered in the implementation of AEs, including the need for extensive training data, the risk of overfitting, and the requirement for differentiable channel models. Through data-driven approaches, AEs provide robust solutions for end-to-end system optimisation, surpassing traditional mathematical models confined by simplifying assumptions. This paper also summarises the computational complexity associated with AE-based systems by conducting an in-depth analysis employing the metric of floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). This analysis encompasses the evaluation of matrix multiplications, bias additions, and activation functions. This survey aims to establish a roadmap for future research, emphasising the transformative potential of AEs in the formulation of next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>THz Channels for Short-Range Mobile Networks: Multipath Clusters and Human Body Shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The THz band (0.1-10 THz) is emerging as a crucial enabler for sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication systems, overcoming the limitations of current technologies and unlocking new opportunities for low-latency and ultra-high-speed communications by utilizing several tens of GHz transmission bandwidths. However, extremely high spreading losses and other interaction losses pose significant challenges to establishing wide-area communication coverage, while human body shadowing further complicates maintaining stable communication links. Although point-to-point (P2P) fixed wireless access in the THz band has been successfully demonstrated, realizing fully mobile and reliable wireless access remains a challenge due to numerous issues to be solved for highly directional communication. To provide insights into the design of THz communication systems, this article addresses the challenges associated with THz short-range mobile access networks. It offers an overview of recent findings on the environment-dependence of multipath cluster channel properties and the impact of human body shadowing, based on measurements at 300 GHz using a double-directional high-resolution channel sounder and a motion capture-integrated channel sounder.</description>

      <title>Antenna Activation for NOMA Assisted Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted downlink pinching-antenna system is investigated, where multiple pinching antennas can be activated at pre-configured positions along a dielectric waveguide to serve users via NOMA. In particular, the objective of this letter is to study at what locations and how many pinching antennas should be activated in order to maximize the system throughput. To this end, a sum rate maximization problem with antenna activation is formulated. With the help of matching theory, the formulated problem can be recast as a one-sided one-to-one matching, for which a low-complexity algorithm is developed. Simulation results indicate that the considered NOMA assisted pinching-antenna system can outperform conventional fixed-antenna systems in terms of sum rate, and the proposed matching based antenna activation algorithm yields a significant performance gain over the considered benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a supervised machine-learning (ML) approach for blind digital calibration of SAR ADCs without requiring prior knowledge of errors. A low-speed reference ADC is used to train a shallow neural network (NN) to estimate errors in a high-speed ADC by comparing the outputs of the ADCs when their sampling instants align and subtracting these errors in the back-end. The proposed NN-calibration improves SFDR of a 28nm, 12-bit, 84MHz ADC by &gt;38dB while consuming 25.8fJ/conversion-step.</description>

      <title>EOM Minimum Point Bias Voltage Estimation for Application in Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum computing systems the quantum states of qubits can be modified among others by applying light pulses. In order to achieve low computing error rates these pulses have to be precisely shaped in magnitude and phase. In practical applications, both acousto-optic (AOM) and electro-optic modulators (EOM) are used for this purpose. The advantages of EOMs, in particular Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs), include e.g. higher bandwidth, compactness, good integrability and better noise performance. On the other hand, EOMs are challenging regarding their control voltage regulation as they experience a bias drift, i.e. voltage shifts in the modulator's operating point. Such a shift significantly impairs the quality of the modulation, which is why EOMs usually require a bias control loop to track the DC operating point. This work addresses the estimation of the instantaneous bias voltage using a small pilot tone, where the optical output power of the EOM is tracked by a photodetector feedback signal.</description>

      <title>Driving Innovation in 6G Wireless Technologies: The OpenAirInterface Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of 6G wireless technologies is rapidly advancing, with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) entering the pre-standardization phase and aiming to deliver the first specifications by 2028. This paper explores the OpenAirInterface (OAI) project, an open-source initiative that plays a crucial role in the evolution of 5G and the future 6G networks. OAI provides a comprehensive implementation of 3GPP and O-RAN compliant networks, including Radio Access Network (RAN), Core Network (CN), and software-defined User Equipment (UE) components. The paper details the history and evolution of OAI, its licensing model, and the various projects under its umbrella, such as RAN, the CN, as well as the Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) projects. It also highlights the development methodology, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) processes, and end-to-end systems powered by OAI. Furthermore, the paper discusses the potential of OAI for 6G research, focusing on spectrum, reflective intelligent surfaces, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) integration. The open-source approach of OAI is emphasized as essential for tackling the challenges of 6G, fostering community collaboration, and driving innovation in next-generation wireless technologies.</description>

      <title>Low Time Complexity Near-Field Channel and Position Estimations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the application of high-frequency communication and extremely large MIMO (XL-MIMO), the near-field effect has become increasingly apparent. The near-field channel estimation and position estimation problems both rely on the Angle of Arrival (AoA) and the Curvature of Arrival (CoA) estimation. However, in the near-field channel model, the coupling of AoA and CoA information poses a challenge to the estimation of the near-field channel. This paper proposes a Joint Autocorrelation and Cross-correlation (JAC) scheme to decouple AoA and CoA estimation. Based on the JAC scheme, we propose two specific near-field estimation algorithms, namely Inverse Sinc Function (JAC-ISF) and Gradient Descent (JAC-GD) algorithms. Finally, we analyzed the time complexity of the JAC scheme and the cramer-rao lower bound (CRLB) for near-field position estimation. The simulation experiment results show that the algorithm designed based on JAC scheme can solve the problem of coupled CoA and AoA information in near-field estimation, thereby improving the algorithm performance. The JAC-GD algorithm shows significant performance in channel estimation and position estimation at different SNRs, snapshot points, and communication distances compared to other algorithms. This indicates that the JAC-GD algorithm can achieve more accurate channel and position estimation results while saving time overhead.</description>

      <title>Robust UAV Jittering and Task Scheduling in Mobile Edge Computing with Data Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data compression technology is able to reduce data size, which can be applied to lower the cost of task offloading in mobile edge computing (MEC). This paper addresses the practical challenges for robust trajectory and scheduling optimization based on data compression in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted MEC, aiming to minimize the sum energy cost of terminal users while maintaining robust performance during UAV flight. Considering the non-convexity of the problem and the dynamic nature of the scenario, the optimization problem is reformulated as a Markov decision process. Then, a randomized ensembled double Q-learning (REDQ) algorithm is adopted to solve the issue. The algorithm allows for higher feasible update-to-data ratio, enabling more effective learning from observed data. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively reduces the energy consumption while ensuring flight robustness. Compared to the PPO and A2C algorithms, energy consumption is reduced by approximately $21.9\%$ and $35.4\%$, respectively. This method demonstrates significant advantages in complex environments and holds great potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security for Continuous-Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based secure transmission framework is proposed to enhance physical layer security. Continuous current distributions, or beamformers, are designed to maximize the secrecy transmission rate under a power constraint and to minimize the required transmission power for achieving a specific target secrecy rate. On this basis, the fundamental secrecy performance limits achieved by CAPAs are analyzed by deriving closed-form expressions for the maximum secrecy rate (MSR) and minimum required power (MRP), along with the corresponding optimal current distributions. To provide further insights, asymptotic analyses are performed for the MSR and MRP, which reveals that i) for the MSR, the optimal current distribution simplifies to maximal ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming in the low-SNR regime and to zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in the high-SNR regime; i) for the MRP, the optimal current distribution simplifies to ZF beamforming in the high-SNR regime. The derived results are specialized to the typical array structures, e.g., planar CAPAs and planar spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs). The rate and power scaling laws are further analyzed by assuming an infinitely large CAPA. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed secure continuous beamforming design outperforms MRT and ZF beamforming in terms of both achievable secrecy rate and power efficiency; ii) CAPAs achieve superior secrecy performance compared to conventional SPDAs.</description>

      <title>Graph-Driven Models for Gas Mixture Identification and Concentration Estimation on Heterogeneous Sensor Array Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately identifying gas mixtures and estimating their concentrations are crucial across various industrial applications using gas sensor arrays. However, existing models face challenges in generalizing across heterogeneous datasets, which limits their scalability and practical applicability. To address this problem, this study develops two novel deep-learning models that integrate temporal graph structures for enhanced performance: a Graph-Enhanced Capsule Network (GraphCapsNet) employing dynamic routing for gas mixture classification and a Graph-Enhanced Attention Network (GraphANet) leveraging self-attention for concentration estimation. Both models were validated on datasets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository and a custom dataset, demonstrating superior performance in gas mixture identification and concentration estimation compared to recent models. In classification tasks, GraphCapsNet achieved over 98.00% accuracy across multiple datasets, while in concentration estimation, GraphANet attained an R2 score exceeding 0.96 across various gas components. Both GraphCapsNet and GraphANet exhibited significantly higher accuracy and stability, positioning them as promising solutions for scalable gas analysis in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Minimum Data Rate Maximization for Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses, for the first time, the uplink performance optimization of multi-user pinching-antenna systems, recently developed for next-generation wireless networks. By leveraging the unique capabilities of pinching antennas to dynamically configure wireless channels, we focus on maximizing the minimum achievable data rate between devices to achieve a balanced trade-off between throughput and fairness. An effective approach is proposed that separately optimizes the positions of the pinching antennas and the resource allocation. The antenna positioning problem is reformulated into a convex one, while a closed-form solution is provided for the resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the investigated system using the proposed algorithm over corresponding counterparts, emphasizing the significant potential of pinching-antenna systems for robust and efficient uplink communication in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Speech Watermarking with Discrete Intermediate Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech watermarking techniques can proactively mitigate the potential harmful consequences of instant voice cloning techniques. These techniques involve the insertion of signals into speech that are imperceptible to humans but can be detected by algorithms. Previous approaches typically embed watermark messages into continuous space. However, intuitively, embedding watermark information into robust discrete latent space can significantly improve the robustness of watermarking systems. In this paper, we propose DiscreteWM, a novel speech watermarking framework that injects watermarks into the discrete intermediate representations of speech. Specifically, we map speech into discrete latent space with a vector-quantized autoencoder and inject watermarks by changing the modular arithmetic relation of discrete IDs. To ensure the imperceptibility of watermarks, we also propose a manipulator model to select the candidate tokens for watermark embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness and imperceptibility, simultaneously. Moreover, our flexible frame-wise approach can serve as an efficient solution for both voice cloning detection and information hiding. Additionally, DiscreteWM can encode 1 to 150 bits of watermark information within a 1-second speech clip, indicating its encoding capacity. Audio samples are available at https://DiscreteWM.github.io/discrete_wm.</description>

      <title>Event-based Photometric Bundle Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of bundle adjustment (i.e., simultaneous refinement of camera poses and scene map) for a purely rotating event camera. Starting from first principles, we formulate the problem as a classical non-linear least squares optimization. The photometric error is defined using the event generation model directly in the camera rotations and the semi-dense scene brightness that triggers the events. We leverage the sparsity of event data to design a tractable Levenberg-Marquardt solver that handles the very large number of variables involved. To the best of our knowledge, our method, which we call Event-based Photometric Bundle Adjustment (EPBA), is the first event-only photometric bundle adjustment method that works on the brightness map directly and exploits the space-time characteristics of event data, without having to convert events into image-like representations. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate EPBA's effectiveness in decreasing the photometric error (by up to 90%), yielding results of unparalleled quality. The refined maps reveal details that were hidden using prior state-of-the-art rotation-only estimation methods. The experiments on modern high-resolution event cameras show the applicability of EPBA to panoramic imaging in various scenarios (without map initialization, at multiple resolutions, and in combination with other methods, such as IMU dead reckoning or previous event-based rotation estimation methods). We make the source code publicly available. https://github.com/tub-rip/epba</description>

Abstract: This paper presents COSMIC (Connectivity-Oriented Sensing Method for Imaging and Communication), an innovative waveform design framework that integrates environmental radio imaging with robust communication capabilities. COSMIC introduces an extended orthogonality condition achieved through algebraic precoding across transmitting antennas, differentiating it from conventional time, frequency, or space multiplexing techniques. By leveraging the constrained imaging field of view relative to the signal duration, COSMIC enables the simultaneous transport of information while preserving high sensing performance. Numerical evaluations reveal that COSMIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, doubling the imaging Signal-to-Noise Ratio and substantially reducing the Integrated Side Lobe Ratio, thus demonstrating its effectiveness in combining communication and imaging functionalities.</description>

      <title>A tensor model for the calibration of air-coupled ultrasonic sensor arrays in 3D imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrays of ultrasonic sensors are capable of 3D imaging in air and an affordable supplement to other sensing modalities, such as radar, lidar, and camera, i.e. in heterogeneous sensing systems. However, manufacturing tolerances of air-coupled ultrasonic sensors may lead to amplitude and phase deviations. Together with artifacts from imperfect knowledge of the array geometry, there are numerous factors that can impair the imaging performance of an array. We propose a reference-based calibration method to overcome possible limitations. First, we introduce a novel tensor signal model to capture the characteristics of piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers (PUTs) and the underlying multidimensional nature of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) sensor array. Second, we formulate and solve an optimization problem based on this model to obtain the calibrated parameters of the array. Third, we assess both our model and the commonly used analytic model using real data from a 3D imaging experiment. The experiment reveals that our array response model we learned with calibration data yields an imaging performance similar to that of the analytic array model, which requires perfect array geometry information.</description>

      <title>Comparing Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing: Introducing the Multipath Lifetime Map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing presence of dynamic scenarios, such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications, radio propagation modeling tools must adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the radio channel. Recently, both Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing frameworks have emerged to address these challenges. However, there is often confusion about how these approaches differ and which one should be used in specific contexts. In this paper, we provide an overview of these two techniques and a comparative analysis against two state-of-the-art tools: 3DSCAT from UniBo and Sionna from NVIDIA. To provide a more precise characterization of the scope of these methods, we introduce a novel simulation-based metric, the Multipath Lifetime Map, which enables the evaluation of spatial and temporal coherence in radio channels only based on the geometrical description of the environment. Finally, our metrics are evaluated on a classic urban street canyon scenario, yielding similar results to those obtained from measurement campaigns.</description>

      <title>HeartBERT: A Self-Supervised ECG Embedding Model for Efficient and Effective Medical Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The HeartBert model is introduced with three primary objectives: reducing the need for labeled data, minimizing computational resources, and simultaneously improving performance in machine learning systems that analyze Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in natural language processing and enhanced with a self-supervised learning approach, the HeartBert model-built on the RoBERTa architecture-generates sophisticated embeddings tailored for ECG-based projects in the medical domain. To demonstrate the versatility, generalizability, and efficiency of the proposed model, two key downstream tasks have been selected: sleep stage detection and heartbeat classification. HeartBERT-based systems, utilizing bidirectional LSTM heads, are designed to address complex challenges. A series of practical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority and advancements of HeartBERT, particularly in terms of its ability to perform well with smaller training datasets, reduced learning parameters, and effective performance compared to rival models. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ecgResearch/HeartBert.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised *Rel*ative *Con*trastive learning approach that uses a learnable distance measure in combination with a softened contrastive loss for training an motion foundation model from wearable sensors. The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we take an information-theoretic approach to understand the robustness in wireless distributed learning. Upon measuring the difference in loss functions, we provide an upper bound of the performance deterioration due to imperfect wireless channels. Moreover, we characterize the transmission rate under task performance guarantees and propose the channel capacity gain resulting from the inherent robustness in wireless distributed learning. An efficient algorithm for approximating the derived upper bound is established for practical use. The effectiveness of our results is illustrated by the numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved issues requiring further investigation. ISCC is expected to unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</description>

      <title>Urban traffic analysis and forecasting through shared Koopman eigenmodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting traffic flow in data-scarce cities is challenging due to limited historical data. To address this, we leverage transfer learning by identifying periodic patterns common to data-rich cities using a customized variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD): constrained Hankelized DMD (TrHDMD). This method uncovers common eigenmodes (urban heartbeats) in traffic patterns and transfers them to data-scarce cities, significantly enhancing prediction performance. TrHDMD reduces the need for extensive training datasets by utilizing prior knowledge from other cities. By applying Koopman operator theory to multi-city loop detector data, we identify stable, interpretable, and time-invariant traffic modes. Injecting ``urban heartbeats'' into forecasting tasks improves prediction accuracy and has the potential to enhance traffic management strategies for cities with varying data infrastructures. Our work introduces cross-city knowledge transfer via shared Koopman eigenmodes, offering actionable insights and reliable forecasts for data-scarce urban environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for parameter learning when the studied model exhibits random discontinuous jumps in behaviour. To facilitate the learning of high dimensional parameter sets, such as those associated to neural networks, we adopt the emerging framework of differentiable particle filtering, wherein parameters are trained by gradient descent. We design a new differentiable interacting multiple model particle filter to be capable of learning the individual behavioural regimes and the model which controls the jumping simultaneously. In contrast to previous approaches, our algorithm allows control of the computational effort assigned per regime whilst using the probability of being in a given regime to guide sampling. Furthermore, we develop a new gradient estimator that has a lower variance than established approaches and remains fast to compute, for which we prove consistency. We establish new theoretical results of the presented algorithms and demonstrate superior numerical performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Wireless-powered underground sensor networks (WPUSNs), which enable wireless energy transfer to sensors located underground, is a promising approach for establishing sustainable internet of underground things (IoUT). To support urgent information transmission and improve resource utilization within WPUSNs, backscatter communication (BC) is introduced, resulting in what is known as wireless-powered backscatter underground sensor networks (WPBUSNs). Nevertheless, the performance of WPBUSNs is significantly limited by severe channel impairments caused by the underground soil and the blockage of direct links. To overcome this challenge, in this work, we propose integrating reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with WPBUSNs, leading to the development of RIS-aided WPBUSNs. We begin by reviewing the recent advancements in BC-WPUSNs and RIS. Then, we propose a general architecture of RIS-aided WPBUSNs across various IoUT scenarios, and discuss its advantages and implementation challenges. To illustrate the effectiveness of RIS-aided WPBUSNs, we focus on a realistic farming case study, demonstrating that our proposed framework outperforms the three benchmarks in terms of the sum throughput. Finally, we discuss the open challenges and future research directions for translating this study into practical IoUT applications.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Inference with On-Device Small and Remote Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a hybrid language model (HLM) architecture that integrates a small language model (SLM) operating on a mobile device with a large language model (LLM) hosted at the base station (BS) of a wireless network. The HLM token generation process follows the speculative inference principle: the SLM's vocabulary distribution is uploaded to the LLM, which either accepts or rejects it, with rejected tokens being resampled by the LLM. While this approach ensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it suffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the computation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose a novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware opportunistic HLM (U-HLM), wherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty and skips both uplink transmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted. This opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear correlation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability. We analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk of rejection. Simulations show that U-HLM reduces uplink transmissions and LLM computations by 45.93%, while achieving up to 97.54% of the LLM's inference accuracy and 2.54$\times$ faster token throughput than HLM without skipping.</description>
