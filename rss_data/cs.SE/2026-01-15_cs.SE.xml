      <title>LAUDE: LLM-Assisted Unit Test Generation and Debugging of Hardware DEsigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unit tests are critical in the hardware design lifecycle to ensure that component design modules are functionally correct and conform to the specification before they are integrated at the system level. Thus developing unit tests targeting various design features requires deep understanding of the design functionality and creativity. When one or more unit tests expose a design failure, the debugging engineer needs to diagnose, localize, and debug the failure to ensure design correctness, which is often a painstaking and intense process. In this work, we introduce LAUDE, a unified unit-test generation and debugging framework for hardware designs that cross-pollinates the semantic understanding of the design source code with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of foundational Large-Language Models (LLMs). LAUDE integrates prompt engineering and design execution information to enhance its unit test generation accuracy and code debuggability. We apply LAUDE with closed- and open-source LLMs to a large corpus of buggy hardware design codes derived from the VerilogEval dataset, where generated unit tests detected bugs in up to 100% and 93% of combinational and sequential designs and debugged up to 93% and 84% of combinational and sequential designs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Software Engineering Education in the Era of Large Language Models: A Curriculum Adaptation and Academic Integrity Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, into professional workflows is increasingly reshaping software engineering practices. These tools have lowered the cost of code generation, explanation, and testing, while introducing new forms of automation into routine development tasks. In contrast, most of the software engineering and computer engineering curricula remain closely aligned with pedagogical models that equate manual syntax production with technical competence. This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model. While this work provides a structured proposal for curriculum adaptation, it remains a theoretical contribution; the paper concludes by outlining the need for longitudinal empirical studies to evaluate these interventions and their long-term impacts on learning.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Trust Metrics for Multi-LLM Systems: Enhancing Reliability in Regulated Industries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and law, yet their integration raises pressing concerns around trust, accountability, and reliability. This paper explores adaptive trust metrics for multi LLM ecosystems, proposing a framework for quantifying and improving model reliability under regulated constraints. By analyzing system behaviors, evaluating uncertainty across multiple LLMs, and implementing dynamic monitoring pipelines, the study demonstrates practical pathways for operational trustworthiness. Case studies from financial compliance and healthcare diagnostics illustrate the applicability of adaptive trust metrics in real world settings. The findings position adaptive trust measurement as a foundational enabler for safe and scalable AI adoption in regulated industries.</description>

      <title>EZInput: A Cross-Environment Python Library for Easy UI Generation in Scientific Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers face a persistent barrier when applying computational algorithms with parameter configuration typically demanding programming skills, interfaces differing across environments, and settings rarely persisting between sessions. This fragmentation forces repetitive input, slows iterative exploration, and undermines reproducibility because parameter choices are difficult to record, share, and reuse. We present EZInput, a cross-runtime environment Python library enabling algorithm developers to automatically generate graphical user interfaces that make their computational tools accessible to end-users without programming expertise. EZInput employs a declarative specification system where developers define input requirements and validation constraints once; the library then handles environment detection, interface rendering, parameter validation, and session persistence across Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, and terminal environments. This "write once, run anywhere" architecture enables researchers to prototype in notebooks and deploy identical parameter configurations for batch execution on remote systems without code changes or manual transcription. Parameter persistence, inspired by ImageJ/FIJI and adapted to Python workflows, saves and restores user configurations via lightweight YAML files, eliminating redundant input and producing shareable records that enhance reproducibility. EZInput supports diverse input types essential for scientific computing and it also includes built-in validation that ensures data integrity and clear feedback that reduces user friction.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Empowering Small Models in Reliable OpenACC-based Parallelization via GEPA-Optimized Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenACC lowers the barrier to GPU offloading, but writing high-performing pragma remains complex, requiring deep domain expertise in memory hierarchies, data movement, and parallelization strategies. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. We present a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without the prohibitive computational costs associated with model post-training. Leveraging the GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework, we iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop. This process utilizes crossover and mutation of instructions, guided by expert-curated gold examples and structured feedback based on clause- and clause parameter-level mismatches between the gold and predicted pragma. In our evaluation on the PolyBench suite, we observe an increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragma generated using the optimized prompts compared to those annotated using the simpler initial prompt, particularly for the "nano"-scale models. Specifically, with optimized prompts, the compilation success rate for GPT-4.1 Nano surged from 66.7% to 93.3%, and for GPT-5 Nano improved from 86.7% to 100%, matching or surpassing the capabilities of their significantly larger, more expensive versions. Beyond compilation, the optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs that achieve functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines. These results demonstrate that prompt optimization effectively unlocks the potential of smaller, cheaper LLMs in writing stable and effective GPU-offloading directives, establishing a cost-effective pathway to automated directive-based parallelization in HPC workflows.</description>

      <title>Build Code is Still Code: Finding the Antidote for Pipeline Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open source C code underpins society's computing infrastructure. Decades of work has helped harden C code against attackers, but C projects do not consist of only C code. C projects also contain build system code for automating development tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging. These build systems are critcal to software supply chain security and vulnerable to being poisoned, with the XZ Utils and SolarWinds attacks being recent examples. Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack. We outline our future plans to protect against pipeline poisoning by automatically checking development phase isolation. We envision a future where build system security checkers are as prevalent as program code checkers.</description>

      <title>On the Flakiness of LLM-Generated Tests for Industrial and Open-Source Database Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flaky tests are a common problem in software testing. They produce inconsistent results when executed multiple times on the same code, invalidating the assumption that a test failure indicates a software defect. Recent work on LLM-based test generation has identified flakiness as a potential problem with generated tests. However, its prevalence and underlying causes are unclear. We examined the flakiness of LLM-generated tests in the context of four relational database management systems: SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite. We amplified test suites with two LLMs, GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, to assess the flakiness of the generated test cases. Our results suggest that generated tests have a slightly higher proportion of flaky tests compared to existing tests. Based on a manual inspection, we found that the most common root cause of flakiness was the reliance of a test on a certain order that is not guaranteed ("unordered collection"), which was present in 72 of 115 flaky tests (63%). Furthermore, both LLMs transferred the flakiness from the existing tests to the newly generated tests via the provided prompt context. Our experiments suggest that flakiness transfer is more prevalent in closed-source systems such as SAP HANA than in open-source systems. Our study informs developers on what types of flakiness to expect from LLM-generated tests. It also highlights the importance of providing LLMs with tailored context when employing LLMs for test generation.</description>

      <title>SafePlanner: Testing Safety of the Automated Driving System Plan Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present SafePlanner, a systematic testing framework for identifying safety-critical flaws in the Plan model of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). SafePlanner targets two core challenges: generating structurally meaningful test scenarios and detecting hazardous planning behaviors. To maximize coverage, SafePlanner performs a structural analysis of the Plan model implementation - specifically, its scene-transition logic and hierarchical control flow - and uses this insight to extract feasible scene transitions from code. It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS. It generates 20635 test cases and detects 520 hazardous behaviors, grouped into 15 root causes through manual analysis. For four of these, we applied patches based on our analysis; the issues disappeared, and no apparent side effects were observed. SafePlanner achieves 83.63 percent function and 63.22 percent decision coverage on the Plan model, outperforming baselines in both bug discovery and efficiency.</description>

      <title>AI-NativeBench: An Open-Source White-Box Agentic Benchmark Suite for AI-Native Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from Cloud-Native to AI-Native architectures is fundamentally reshaping software engineering, replacing deterministic microservices with probabilistic agentic services. However, this shift renders traditional black-box evaluation paradigms insufficient: existing benchmarks measure raw model capabilities while remaining blind to system-level execution dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce AI-NativeBench, the first application-centric and white-box AI-Native benchmark suite grounded in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) standards. By treating agentic spans as first-class citizens within distributed traces, our methodology enables granular analysis of engineering characteristics beyond simple capabilities. Leveraging this benchmark across 21 system variants, we uncover critical engineering realities invisible to traditional metrics: a parameter paradox where lightweight models often surpass flagships in protocol adherence, a pervasive inference dominance that renders protocol overhead secondary, and an expensive failure pattern where self-healing mechanisms paradoxically act as cost multipliers on unviable workflows. This work provides the first systematic evidence to guide the transition from measuring model capability to engineering reliable AI-Native systems. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we have open-sourced the benchmark and dataset.</description>

      <title>DepRadar: Agentic Coordination for Context Aware Defect Impact Analysis in Deep Learning Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning libraries like Transformers and Megatron are now widely adopted in modern AI programs. However, when these libraries introduce defects, ranging from silent computation errors to subtle performance regressions, it is often challenging for downstream users to assess whether their own programs are affected. Such impact analysis requires not only understanding the defect semantics but also checking whether the client code satisfies complex triggering conditions involving configuration flags, runtime environments, and indirect API usage. We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered. To improve accuracy and explainability, DepRadar integrates static analysis with DL-specific domain rules for defect reasoning and client side tracing. We evaluate DepRadar on 157 PRs and 70 commits across two representative DL libraries. It achieves 90% precision in defect identification and generates high quality structured fields (average field score 1.6). On 122 client programs, DepRadar identifies affected cases with 90% recall and 80% precision, substantially outperforming other baselines.</description>

      <title>Towards a Metadata Schema for Energy Research Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-specific metadata schemas are essential to improve the findability and reusability of research software and to follow the FAIR4RS principles. However, many domains, including energy research, lack established metadata schemas. To address this gap, we developed a metadata schema for energy research software based on a requirement analysis and evaluated it through user testing. Our results show that the schema balances the need for formalization and interoperability, while also meeting the specific needs of energy researchers. Meanwhile, the testing showed that a good presentation of the required information is key to enable researchers to create the required metadata. This paper provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of designing a metadata schema for energy research software.</description>

      <title>Analyzing GitHub Issues and Pull Requests in nf-core Pipelines: Insights into nf-core Pipeline Repositories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) such as Nextflow have become essential software frameworks for conducting reproducible, scalable, and portable computational analyses in data-intensive fields like genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Building on Nextflow, the nf-core community curates standardized, peer-reviewed pipelines that follow strict testing, documentation, and governance guidelines. Despite its broad adoption, little is known about the challenges users face during the development and maintenance of these pipelines. This paper presents an empirical study of 25,173 issues and pull requests from these pipelines to uncover recurring challenges, management practices, and perceived difficulties. Using BERTopic modeling, we identify 13 key challenges, including pipeline development and integration, bug fixing, integrating genomic data, managing CI configurations, and handling version updates. We then examine issue resolution dynamics, showing that 89.38\% of issues and pull requests are eventually closed, with half resolved within three days. Statistical analysis reveals that the presence of labels (large effect, $\delta$ = 0.94) and code snippets (medium effect, $\delta$ = 0.50) significantly improve resolution likelihood. Further analysis reveals that tool development and repository maintenance poses the most significant challenges, followed by testing pipelines and CI configurations, and debugging containerized pipelines. Overall, this study provides actionable insights into the collaborative development and maintenance of nf-core pipelines, highlighting opportunities to enhance their usability, sustainability, and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>SysPro: Reproducing System-level Concurrency Bugs from Bug Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducing system-level concurrency bugs requires both input data and the precise interleaving order of system calls. This process is challenging because such bugs are non-deterministic, and bug reports often lack the detailed information needed. Additionally, the unstructured nature of reports written in natural language makes it difficult to extract necessary details. Existing tools are inadequate to reproduce these bugs due to their inability to manage the specific interleaving at the system call level. To address these challenges, we propose SysPro, a novel approach that automatically extracts relevant system call names from bug reports and identifies their locations in the source code. It generates input data by utilizing information retrieval, regular expression matching, and the category-partition method. This extracted input and interleaving data are then used to reproduce bugs through dynamic source code instrumentation. Our empirical study on real-world benchmarks demonstrates that SysPro is both effective and efficient at localizing and reproducing system-level concurrency bugs from bug reports.</description>

      <title>How well LLM-based test generation techniques perform with newer LLM versions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has strongly impacted software engineering, leading to a growing number of studies on automated unit test generation. However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries). We also observe that the granularity at which the plain LLM is applied has a significant impact on the cost. We therefore propose targeting first the program classes, where test generation is more efficient, and then the uncovered methods to reduce the number of LLM requests. This strategy achieves comparable (slightly higher) effectiveness while requiring about 20% fewer LLM requests.</description>

      <title>ShortCoder: Knowledge-Augmented Syntax Optimization for Token-Efficient Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code generation tasks aim to automate the conversion of user requirements into executable code, significantly reducing manual development efforts and enhancing software productivity. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.</description>

      <title>Integrating APK Image and Text Data for Enhanced Threat Detection: A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach to Android Malware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As zero-day Android malware attacks grow more sophisticated, recent research highlights the effectiveness of using image-based representations of malware bytecode to detect previously unseen threats. However, existing studies often overlook how image type and resolution affect detection and ignore valuable textual data in Android Application Packages (APKs), such as permissions and metadata, limiting their ability to fully capture malicious behavior. The integration of multimodality, which combines image and text data, has gained momentum as a promising approach to address these limitations. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework integrating APK images and textual features to enhance Android malware detection. We systematically evaluate various image types and resolutions across different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures, including VGG, ResNet-152, MobileNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet-B4, and use LLaMA-2, a large language model, to extract and annotate textual features for improved analysis. The findings demonstrate that RGB images at higher resolutions (e.g., 256x256, 512x512) achieve superior classification performance, while the multimodal integration of image and text using the CLIP model reveals limited potential. Overall, this research highlights the importance of systematically evaluating image attributes and integrating multimodal data to develop effective malware detection for Android systems.</description>

      <title>Optimising for Energy Efficiency and Performance in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquity of machine learning (ML) and the demand for ever-larger models bring an increase in energy consumption and environmental impact. However, little is known about the energy scaling laws in ML, and existing research focuses on training cost -- ignoring the larger cost of inference. Furthermore, tools for measuring the energy consumption of ML do not provide actionable feedback.
  To address these gaps, we developed Energy Consumption Optimiser (ECOpt): a hyperparameter tuner that optimises for energy efficiency and model performance. ECOpt quantifies the trade-off between these metrics as an interpretable Pareto frontier. This enables ML practitioners to make informed decisions about energy cost and environmental impact, while maximising the benefit of their models and complying with new regulations.
  Using ECOpt, we show that parameter and floating-point operation counts can be unreliable proxies for energy consumption, and observe that the energy efficiency of Transformer models for text generation is relatively consistent across hardware. These findings motivate measuring and publishing the energy metrics of ML models. We further show that ECOpt can have a net positive environmental impact and use it to uncover seven models for CIFAR-10 that improve upon the state of the art, when considering accuracy and energy efficiency together.</description>

      <title>Cluster Workload Allocation: Semantic Soft Affinity Using Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (&gt;95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.</description>

      <title>Formally Verifying Noir Zero Knowledge Programs with NAVe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof systems are cryptographic protocols that can (with overwhelming probability) demonstrate that the pair $(X, W)$ is in a relation $R$ without revealing information about the private input $W$. This membership checking is captured by a complex arithmetic circuit: a set of polynomial equations over a finite field. ZK programming languages, like Noir, have been proposed to simplify the description of these circuits. A developer can write a Noir program using traditional high-level constructs that can be compiled into a lower-level ACIR (Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation), which is essentially a high-level description of an arithmetic circuit. In this paper, we formalise some of the ACIR language using SMT-LIB and its extended theory of finite fields. We use this formalisation to create an open-source formal verifier for the Noir language using the SMT solver cvc5. Our verifier can be used to check whether Noir programs behave appropriately. For instance, it can be used to check whether a Noir program has been properly constrained, that is, the finite-field polynomial equations generated truly capture the intended relation. We evaluate our verifier over 4 distinct sets of Noir programs, demonstrating its practical applicability and identifying a hard-to-check constraint type that charts an improvement path for our verification framework.</description>

      <title>Path-optimal symbolic execution of heap-manipulating programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic execution is at the core of many techniques for program analysis and test generation. Traditional symbolic execution of programs with numeric inputs enjoys the property of forking as many analysis traces as the number of analyzed program paths, a property that in this paper we refer to as path optimality. On the contrary, current approaches for symbolic execution of heap-manipulating programs fail to satisfy this property, thereby incurring crucial path explosion effects. This paper introduces POSE, path-optimal symbolic execution, a symbolic execution algorithm that originally achieves path optimality against heap-manipulating programs. We formalize the POSE algorithm and experiment it against a benchmark of programs that take data structures as inputs, supporting the potential of POSE for improving on the state of the art of symbolic execution of heap-manipulating programs.</description>

      <title>Smart Contract Vulnerabilities, Tools, and Benchmarks: an Updated Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smart contracts are self-executing programs on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, which have revolutionized decentralized finance by enabling trustless transactions and the operation of decentralized applications. Despite their potential, the security of smart contracts remains a critical concern due to their immutability and transparency, which expose them to malicious actors. Numerous solutions for vulnerability detection have been proposed, but it is still unclear which one is the most effective. This paper presents a systematic literature review that explores vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts, focusing on automated detection tools and benchmark evaluation. We reviewed 3,380 studies from five digital libraries and five major software engineering conferences, applying a structured selection process that resulted in 222 high-quality studies. The key results include a hierarchical taxonomy of 192 vulnerabilities grouped into 13 categories, a comprehensive list of 219 detection tools with corresponding functionalities, methods, and code transformation techniques, a mapping between our taxonomy and the list of tools, and a collection of 133 benchmarks used for tool evaluation. We conclude with a discussion about the insights into the current state of Ethereum smart contract security and directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Enabling Global, Human-Centered Explanations for LLMs:From Tokens to Interpretable Code and Test Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models for Code (LM4Code) become integral to software engineering, establishing trust in their output becomes critical. However, standard accuracy metrics obscure the underlying reasoning of generative models, offering little insight into how decisions are made. Although post-hoc interpretability methods attempt to fill this gap, they often restrict explanations to local, token-level insights, which fail to provide a developer-understandable global analysis. Our work highlights the urgent need for \textbf{global, code-based} explanations that reveal how models reason across code. To support this vision, we introduce \textit{code rationales} (CodeQ), a framework that enables global interpretability by mapping token-level rationales to high-level programming categories. Aggregating thousands of these token-level explanations allows us to perform statistical analyses that expose systemic reasoning behaviors. We validate this aggregation by showing it distills a clear signal from noisy token data, reducing explanation uncertainty (Shannon entropy) by over 50%. Additionally, we find that a code generation model (\textit{codeparrot-small}) consistently favors shallow syntactic cues (e.g., \textbf{indentation}) over deeper semantic logic. Furthermore, in a user study with 37 participants, we find its reasoning is significantly misaligned with that of human developers. These findings, hidden from traditional metrics, demonstrate the importance of global interpretability techniques to foster trust in LM4Code.</description>

      <title>Repairing vulnerabilities without invisible hands. A differentiated replication study on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) is a fast-growing branch of program repair. Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) outperform traditional techniques, extending their success beyond code generation and fault detection.
  Hypothesis: These gains may be driven by hidden factors -- "invisible hands" such as training-data leakage or perfect fault localization -- that let an LLM reproduce human-authored fixes for the same code.
  Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by deliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the prompt. If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large localization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because any offset should divert the model from the original fix.
  Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans benchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth. A first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the result with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests. Finally, we manually audit a sample of patches and estimate the error rate with the Agresti-Coull-Wilson method.</description>

      <title>CodeWiki: Evaluating AI's Ability to Generate Holistic Documentation for Large-Scale Codebases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24428v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a large and evolving codebase, the ability to automatically generate holistic, architecture-aware documentation that captures not only individual functions but also cross-file, cross-module, and system-level interactions remains an open challenge. Comprehensive documentation is essential for long-term software maintenance and collaboration, yet current automated approaches still fail to model the rich semantic dependencies and architectural structures that define real-world software systems. We present \textbf{CodeWiki}, a unified framework for automated repository-level documentation across seven programming languages. CodeWiki introduces three key innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves architectural context across multiple levels of granularity, (ii) recursive multi-agent processing with dynamic task delegation for scalable generation, and (iii) multi-modal synthesis that integrates textual descriptions with visual artifacts such as architecture diagrams and data-flow representations. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce \textbf{CodeWikiBench}, a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-dimensional rubrics and LLM-based assessment protocols. Experimental results show that CodeWiki achieves a 68.79\% quality score with proprietary models, outperforming the closed-source DeepWiki baseline (64.06\%) by 4.73\%, with particularly strong improvements on high-level scripting languages (+10.47\%). We open-source CodeWiki to foster future research and community adoption.</description>

      <title>"Where is My Troubleshooting Procedure?": Studying the Potential of RAG in Assisting Failure Resolution of Large Cyber-Physical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In today's complex industrial environments, operators must often navigate through extensive technical manuals to identify troubleshooting procedures that may help react to some observed failure symptoms. These manuals, written in natural language, describe many steps in detail. Unfortunately, the number, magnitude, and articulation of these descriptions can significantly slow down and complicate the retrieval of the correct procedure during critical incidents. Interestingly, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables the development of tools based on conversational interfaces that can assist operators in their retrieval tasks, improving their capability to respond to incidents. This paper presents the results of a set of experiments that derive from the analysis of the troubleshooting procedures available in Fincantieri, a large international company developing complex naval cyber-physical systems. Results show that RAG can assist operators in reacting promptly to failure symptoms, although specific measures have to be taken into consideration to cross-validate recommendations before actuating them.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06821v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</description>
