      <title>Advancing Recommender Systems by mitigating Shilling attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the premise that the number of products offered grow in an exponential fashion and the amount of data that a user can assimilate before making a decision is relatively small, recommender systems help in categorizing content according to user preferences. Collaborative filtering is a widely used method for computing recommendations due to its good performance. But, this method makes the system vulnerable to attacks which try to bias the recommendations. These attacks, known as 'shilling attacks' are performed to push an item or nuke an item in the system. This paper proposes an algorithm to detect such shilling profiles in the system accurately and also study the effects of such profiles on the recommendations.</description>

      <title>OmniSearchSage: Multi-Task Multi-Entity Embeddings for Pinterest Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present OmniSearchSage, a versatile and scalable system for understanding search queries, pins, and products for Pinterest search. We jointly learn a unified query embedding coupled with pin and product embeddings, leading to an improvement of $&gt;8\%$ relevance, $&gt;7\%$ engagement, and $&gt;5\%$ ads CTR in Pinterest's production search system. The main contributors to these gains are improved content understanding, better multi-task learning, and real-time serving. We enrich our entity representations using diverse text derived from image captions from a generative LLM, historical engagement, and user-curated boards. Our multitask learning setup produces a single search query embedding in the same space as pin and product embeddings and compatible with pre-existing pin and product embeddings. We show the value of each feature through ablation studies, and show the effectiveness of a unified model compared to standalone counterparts. Finally, we share how these embeddings have been deployed across the Pinterest search stack, from retrieval to ranking, scaling to serve $300k$ requests per second at low latency. Our implementation of this work is available at https://github.com/pinterest/atg-research/tree/main/omnisearchsage.</description>

      <title>RE-RecSys: An End-to-End system for recommending properties in Real-Estate domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an end-to-end real-estate recommendation system, RE-RecSys, which has been productionized in real-world industry setting. We categorize any user into 4 categories based on available historical data: i) cold-start users; ii) short-term users; iii) long-term users; and iv) short-long term users. For cold-start users, we propose a novel rule-based engine that is based on the popularity of locality and user preferences. For short-term users, we propose to use content-filtering model which recommends properties based on recent interactions of users. For long-term and short-long term users, we propose a novel combination of content and collaborative filtering based approach which can be easily productionized in the real-world scenario. Moreover, based on the conversion rate, we have designed a novel weighing scheme for different impressions done by users on the platform for the training of content and collaborative models. Finally, we show the efficiency of the proposed pipeline, RE-RecSys, on a real-world property and clickstream dataset collected from leading real-estate platform in India. We show that the proposed pipeline is deployable in real-world scenario with an average latency of &lt;40 ms serving 1000 rpm.</description>

      <title>MMGRec: Multimodal Generative Recommendation with Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation aims to recommend user-preferred candidates based on her/his historically interacted items and associated multimodal information. Previous studies commonly employ an embed-and-retrieve paradigm: learning user and item representations in the same embedding space, then retrieving similar candidate items for a user via embedding inner product. However, this paradigm suffers from inference cost, interaction modeling, and false-negative issues. Toward this end, we propose a new MMGRec model to introduce a generative paradigm into multimodal recommendation. Specifically, we first devise a hierarchical quantization method Graph RQ-VAE to assign Rec-ID for each item from its multimodal and CF information. Consisting of a tuple of semantically meaningful tokens, Rec-ID serves as the unique identifier of each item. Afterward, we train a Transformer-based recommender to generate the Rec-IDs of user-preferred items based on historical interaction sequences. The generative paradigm is qualified since this model systematically predicts the tuple of tokens identifying the recommended item in an autoregressive manner. Moreover, a relation-aware self-attention mechanism is devised for the Transformer to handle non-sequential interaction sequences, which explores the element pairwise relation to replace absolute positional encoding. Extensive experiments evaluate MMGRec's effectiveness compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as "What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose a Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be indexed. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages: first to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na\"ive RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is forthcoming at https://aka.ms/graphrag.</description>

      <title>Retrieval and Distill: A Temporal Data Shift-Free Paradigm for Online Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current recommendation systems are significantly affected by a serious issue of temporal data shift, which is the inconsistency between the distribution of historical data and that of online data. Most existing models focus on utilizing updated data, overlooking the transferable, temporal data shift-free information that can be learned from shifting data. We propose the Temporal Invariance of Association theorem, which suggests that given a fixed search space, the relationship between the data and the data in the search space keeps invariant over time. Leveraging this principle, we designed a retrieval-based recommendation system framework that can train a data shift-free relevance network using shifting data, significantly enhancing the predictive performance of the original model in the recommendation system. However, retrieval-based recommendation models face substantial inference time costs when deployed online. To address this, we further designed a distill framework that can distill information from the relevance network into a parameterized module using shifting data. The distilled model can be deployed online alongside the original model, with only a minimal increase in inference time. Extensive experiments on multiple real datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the performance of the original model by utilizing shifting data.</description>

      <title>Description-Based Text Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying texts with a given semantics is central for many information seeking scenarios. Similarity search over vector embeddings appear to be central to this ability, yet the similarity reflected in current text embeddings is corpus-driven, and is inconsistent and sub-optimal for many use cases. What, then, is a good notion of similarity for effective retrieval of text?
  We identify the need to search for texts based on abstract descriptions of their content, and the corresponding notion of \emph{description based similarity}. We demonstrate the inadequacy of current text embeddings and propose an alternative model that significantly improves when used in standard nearest neighbor search. The model is trained using positive and negative pairs sourced through prompting a LLM, demonstrating how data from LLMs can be used for creating new capabilities not immediately possible using the original model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In digital markets, antitrust law and special regulations aim to ensure that markets remain competitive despite the dominating role that digital platforms play today in everyone's life. Unlike traditional markets, market participant behavior is easily observable in these markets. We present a series of empirical investigations into the extent to which Amazon engages in practices that are typically described as self-preferencing. We discuss how the computer science tools used in this paper can be used in a regulatory environment that is based on algorithmic auditing and requires regulating digital markets at scale.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Dense Blocking for Entity Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blocking is a critical step in entity resolution, and the emergence of neural network-based representation models has led to the development of dense blocking as a promising approach for exploring deep semantics in blocking. However, previous advanced self-supervised dense blocking approaches require domain-specific training on the target domain, which limits the benefits and rapid adaptation of these methods. To address this issue, we propose UniBlocker, a dense blocker that is pre-trained on a domain-independent, easily-obtainable tabular corpus using self-supervised contrastive learning. By conducting domain-independent pre-training, UniBlocker can be adapted to various downstream blocking scenarios without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. To evaluate the universality of our entity blocker, we also construct a new benchmark covering a wide range of blocking tasks from multiple domains and scenarios. Our experiments show that the proposed UniBlocker, without any domain-specific learning, significantly outperforms previous self- and unsupervised dense blocking methods and is comparable and complementary to the state-of-the-art sparse blocking methods.</description>
