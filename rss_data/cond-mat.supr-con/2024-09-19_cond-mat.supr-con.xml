      <title>Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors and fermionic superfluids. We identify cases where the long-time SH response is determined by a pole in the averaged SH susceptibility, located on the unphysical sheet of its Riemann surface. Using analytic continuation across the two-particle branch cut, we obtain the zero-temperature dispersion relation and damping rate of the SH mode linked to this pole. When the coherence length significantly exceeds the mean free path, the pole is ``hidden'' behind the two-particle continuum edge at $2\Delta$, leading to SH oscillations at late times decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$. Nevertheless, the pole induces a peak in the retarded SH susceptibility at a frequency above $2\Delta$ and causes sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z=4$ at both late times and long distances. Conversely, long-distance oscillations at a fixed frequency $\omega$ occur only for $\omega$ exceeding $2\Delta$, with a spatial period diverging at the threshold as $1/(\omega - 2\Delta)^{1/4}$, up to logarithmic factors. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, the pole can reemerge into the continuum, resulting in additional late-time oscillations at fixed wave vectors with frequencies above $2\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Unconventional gate-induced superconductivity in transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in few-layer semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) can be induced by field-effect doping through ionic-liquid gating. While several experimental observations have been collected over the years, a fully-consistent theoretical picture is still missing. Here we develop a realistic framework that combines the predictive power of first-principles simulations with the versatility and insight of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer gap equations to rationalize such experiments. The multi-valley nature of semiconducting TMDs in taken into account, together with the doping- and momentum-dependent electron-phonon and Coulomb interactions. Consistently with experiments, we find that superconductivity occurs when the electron density is large enough that the Q valleys get occupied, as a result of a large enhancement of electron-phonon interactions. Despite being phonon-driven, the superconducting state is predicted to be sensitive to Coulomb interactions, which can lead to the appearance of a relative sign difference between valleys and thus to a $s_{+-}$ character. We discuss qualitatively how such scenario may account for many of the observed physical phenomena for which no microscopic explanation has been found so far, including in particular the presence of a large subgap density of states, and the sample-dependent dome-shaped dependence of $T_c$ on accumulated electron density. Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of gate-induced superconductivity in semiconducting TMDs, and introduce an approach that will likely be valuable for other multivalley electronic systems, in which superconductivity occurs at relatively low electron density.</description>

      <title>Exploring functionalized Zr$_2$N and Sc$_2$N MXenes as superconducting candidates with $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ from $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 11.23 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$). Strain-induced $T_c$ enhancement is demonstrated with an example case for Zr$_2$NCl$_2$. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which are likely influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <title>Identifying inflated Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of inflated Fermi surfaces (IFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These IFSs exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of $d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized version of our continuum model.</description>

      <title>Multifold Majorana corner modes arising from multiple pairs of helical edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators with a pair of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity have been shown to support second-order topological superconductors with Majorana corner modes. As the Majorana corner modes are originated from the helical edge states of the quantum spin Hall insulators, whether quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity can give rise to second-order topological superconductors with multifold Majorana corner modes is an interesting question to address. In this work, we consider a quantum spin Hall insulator with two pairs of helical edge states. We find robust twofold Majorana corner modes can be achieved when the helical edge states are gapped by a combined action of a magnetic exchange field and an $s$-wave pairing, or an $s+p$ mixed-parity pairing. The stability of two Majorana zero modes per corner under the action of magnetic exchange fields is attributed to the protection from the chiral symmetry. Our study reveals that heterostructures composed of superconductors and quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states could serve as a platform to pursue multifold Majorana corner modes.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Photon Blockade for Nonreciprocal Quantum Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the flow of photons is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. We introduce the concept of spatiotemporal photon blockade for nonreciprocal quantum absorption, utilizing space-time-periodic metasurfaces. Our study presents a methodology for experimentally realizing this effect, where photon frequency coherence with the metasurface's space-time modulation enables one-way quantum absorption. In this system, forward-traveling photons are energetically modulated and absorbed within the slab, while backward-traveling photons are transmitted without interaction. Our analysis includes band structure, isofrequency diagrams, and nonreciprocal absorption results. These findings lay the groundwork for developing nonreciprocal quantum devices and enhancing photon management in milli-Kelvin temperature quantum systems.</description>
