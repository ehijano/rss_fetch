      <title>Hierarchical Multi-Armed Bandits for the Concurrent Intelligent Tutoring of Concepts and Problems of Varying Difficulty Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote education has proliferated in the twenty-first century, yielding rise to intelligent tutoring systems. In particular, research has found multi-armed bandit (MAB) intelligent tutors to have notable abilities in traversing the exploration-exploitation trade-off landscape for student problem recommendations. Prior literature, however, contains a significant lack of open-sourced MAB intelligent tutors, which impedes potential applications of these educational MAB recommendation systems. In this paper, we combine recent literature on MAB intelligent tutoring techniques into an open-sourced and simply deployable hierarchical MAB algorithm, capable of progressing students concurrently through concepts and problems, determining ideal recommended problem difficulties, and assessing latent memory decay. We evaluate our algorithm using simulated groups of 500 students, utilizing Bayesian Knowledge Tracing to estimate students' content mastery. Results suggest that our algorithm, when turned difficulty-agnostic, significantly boosts student success, and that the further addition of problem-difficulty adaptation notably improves this metric.</description>

      <title>A Process for Reviewing Design Science Research Papers to Enhance Content Knowledge &amp; Research Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most published Information Systems research are of the behavioral science research (BSR) category rather than the design science research (DSR) category. This is due in part to the BSR orientation of many IS doctoral programs, which often do not involve much technical courses. This includes IS doctoral programs that train Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) researchers. Without such technical knowledge many doctoral and postdoctoral researchers will not feel confident in engaging in DSR research. Given the importance of designing artifacts that are appropriate for a given context, an important question is how can ICT4D and other IS researchers increase their IS technical content knowledge and intimacy with the DSR process. In this paper we present, a process for reviewing DSR papers that has as its objectives: enhancing technical content knowledge, increasing knowledge and understanding of approaches to designing and evaluating IS/IT artifacts, and facilitating the identification of new DSR opportunities. This process has been applied for more than a decade at a USA research university.</description>

      <title>Spatial Microclimatic Characterization of a Parisian "Oasis" Schoolyard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the aftermath of the 2003 heatwave, and with growing concern over climate change, Paris City Hall has been implementing several heat mitigation strategies. One of these is the OASIS Schoolyard Strategy which aims to transform Parisian schoolyards into cool islands. Within this framework, the EU-funded ERDF UIA OASIS Project aims to study the transformation of ten schoolyards, including an evaluation of their microclimatic performance.The present article presents case study results from one schoolyard using GIS data and fixed and mobile microclimatic measurements. An analysis method for mobile measurement data is proposed, tested and discussed on the basis of this case study.</description>

      <title>Effects of a Prompt Engineering Intervention on Undergraduate Students' AI Self-Efficacy, AI Knowledge and Prompt Engineering Ability: A Mixed Methods Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt engineering is critical for effective interaction with large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. However, efforts to teach this skill to students have been limited. This study designed and implemented a prompt engineering intervention, examining its influence on undergraduate students' AI self-efficacy, AI knowledge, and proficiency in creating effective prompts. The intervention involved 27 students who participated in a 100-minute workshop conducted during their history course at a university in Hong Kong. During the workshop, students were introduced to prompt engineering strategies, which they applied to plan the course's final essay task. Multiple data sources were collected, including students' responses to pre- and post-workshop questionnaires, pre- and post-workshop prompt libraries, and written reflections. The study's findings revealed that students demonstrated a higher level of AI self-efficacy, an enhanced understanding of AI concepts, and improved prompt engineering skills because of the intervention. These findings have implications for AI literacy education, as they highlight the importance of prompt engineering training for specific higher education use cases. This is a significant shift from students haphazardly and intuitively learning to engineer prompts. Through prompt engineering education, educators can faciitate students' effective navigation and leverage of LLMs to support their coursework.</description>

      <title>New Curriculum, New Chance -- Retrieval Augmented Generation for Lesson Planning in Ugandan Secondary Schools. Prototype Quality Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Poor educational quality in Secondary Schools is still regarded as one of the major struggles in 21st century Uganda - especially in rural areas. Research identifies several problems, including low quality or absent teacher lesson planning. As the government pushes towards the implementation of a new curriculum, exiting lesson plans become obsolete and the problem is worsened. Using a Retrieval Augmented Generation approach, we developed a prototype that generates customized lesson plans based on the government-accredited textbooks. This helps teachers create lesson plans more efficiently and with better quality, ensuring they are fully aligned the new curriculum and the competence-based learning approach.
  Methods: The prototype was created using Cohere LLM and Sentence Embeddings, and LangChain Framework - and thereafter made available on a public website. Vector stores were trained for three new curriculum textbooks (ICT, Mathematics, History), all at Secondary 1 Level. Twenty-four lessons plans were generated following a pseudo-random generation protocol, based on the suggested periods in the textbooks. The lesson plans were analyzed regarding their technical quality by three independent raters following the Lesson Plan Analysis Protocol (LPAP) by Ndihokubwayo et al. (2022) that is specifically designed for East Africa and competence-based curriculums.
  Results: Evaluation of 24 lesson plans using the LPAP resulted in an average quality of between 75 and 80%, corresponding to "very good lesson plan". None of the lesson plans scored below 65%, although one lesson plan could be argued to have been missing the topic. In conclusion, the quality of the generated lesson plans is at least comparable, if not better, than those created by humans, as demonstrated in a study in Rwanda, whereby no lesson plan even reached the benchmark of 50%.</description>

      <title>The Adaptive Strategies of Anti-Kremlin Digital Dissent in Telegram during the Russian Invasion of Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Telegram became an essential social media platform for Kremlin-sponsored propaganda dissemination. Over time, Anti-Kremlin Russian opposition channels have also emerged as a prominent voice of dissent against the state-sponsored propaganda. This study examines the dynamics of Anti-Kremlin content on Telegram over seven phases of the invasion, inspired by the concept of breach in narrative theory. A data-driven, computational analysis of emerging topics revealed the Russian economy, combat updates, international politics, and Russian domestic affairs, among others. Using a common set of statistical contrasts by phases of the invasion, a longitudinal analysis of topic prevalence allowed us to examine associations with documented offline events and viewer reactions, suggesting an adaptive breach-oriented communications strategy that maintained viewer interest. Viewer approval of those events that threaten Kremlin control suggests that Telegram levels the online playing field for the opposition, surprising given the Kremlin's suppression of free speech offline.</description>

      <title>Handwritten Code Recognition for Pen-and-Paper CS Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teaching Computer Science (CS) by having students write programs by hand on paper has key pedagogical advantages: It allows focused learning and requires careful thinking compared to the use of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) with intelligent support tools or "just trying things out". The familiar environment of pens and paper also lessens the cognitive load of students with no prior experience with computers, for whom the mere basic usage of computers can be intimidating. Finally, this teaching approach opens learning opportunities to students with limited access to computers.
  However, a key obstacle is the current lack of teaching methods and support software for working with and running handwritten programs. Optical character recognition (OCR) of handwritten code is challenging: Minor OCR errors, perhaps due to varied handwriting styles, easily make code not run, and recognizing indentation is crucial for languages like Python but is difficult to do due to inconsistent horizontal spacing in handwriting. Our approach integrates two innovative methods. The first combines OCR with an indentation recognition module and a language model designed for post-OCR error correction without introducing hallucinations. This method, to our knowledge, surpasses all existing systems in handwritten code recognition. It reduces error from 30\% in the state of the art to 5\% with minimal hallucination of logical fixes to student programs. The second method leverages a multimodal language model to recognize handwritten programs in an end-to-end fashion. We hope this contribution can stimulate further pedagogical research and contribute to the goal of making CS education universally accessible. We release a dataset of handwritten programs and code to support future research at https://github.com/mdoumbouya/codeocr</description>

      <title>Neural embedding of beliefs reveals the role of relative dissonance in human decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beliefs serve as the foundation for human cognition and decision-making. They guide individuals in deriving meaning from their lives, shaping their behaviors, and forming social connections. Therefore, a model that encapsulates beliefs and their interrelationships is crucial for quantitatively studying the influence of beliefs on our actions. Despite its importance, research on the interplay between human beliefs has often been limited to a small set of beliefs pertaining to specific issues, with a heavy reliance on surveys or experiments. Here, we propose a method for extracting nuanced relations between thousands of beliefs by leveraging large-scale user participation data from an online debate platform and mapping these beliefs to an embedding space using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). This belief embedding space effectively encapsulates the interconnectedness of diverse beliefs as well as polarization across various social issues. We discover that the positions within this belief space predict new beliefs of individuals. Furthermore, we find that the relative distance between one's existing beliefs and new beliefs can serve as a quantitative estimate of cognitive dissonance, allowing us to predict new beliefs. Our study highlights how modern LLMs, when combined with collective online records of human beliefs, can offer insights into the fundamental principles that govern human belief formation and decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Do GPT Language Models Suffer From Split Personality Disorder? The Advent Of Substrate-Free Psychometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07377v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous research on emergence in large language models shows these display apparent human-like abilities and psychological latent traits. However, results are partly contradicting in expression and magnitude of these latent traits, yet agree on the worrisome tendencies to score high on the Dark Triad of narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, which, together with a track record of derailments, demands more rigorous research on safety of these models. We provided a state of the art language model with the same personality questionnaire in nine languages, and performed Bayesian analysis of Gaussian Mixture Model, finding evidence for a deeper-rooted issue. Our results suggest both interlingual and intralingual instabilities, which indicate that current language models do not develop a consistent core personality. This can lead to unsafe behaviour of artificial intelligence systems that are based on these foundation models, and are increasingly integrated in human life. We subsequently discuss the shortcomings of modern psychometrics, abstract it, and provide a framework for its species-neutral, substrate-free formulation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing HIV Patient Engagement with Reinforcement Learning in Resource-Limited Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By providing evidence-based clinical decision support, digital tools and electronic health records can revolutionize patient management, especially in resource-poor settings where fewer health workers are available and often need more training. When these tools are integrated with AI, they can offer personalized support and adaptive interventions, effectively connecting community health workers (CHWs) and healthcare facilities. The CHARM (Community Health Access &amp; Resource Management) app is an AI-native mobile app for CHWs. Developed through a joint partnership of Causal Foundry (CF) and mothers2mothers (m2m), CHARM empowers CHWs, mainly local women, by streamlining case management, enhancing learning, and improving communication. This paper details CHARM's development, integration, and upcoming reinforcement learning-based adaptive interventions, all aimed at enhancing health worker engagement, efficiency, and patient outcomes, thereby enhancing CHWs' capabilities and community health.</description>

Abstract: Pharmacies are critical in healthcare systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Procuring pharmacists with the right behavioral interventions or nudges can enhance their skills, public health awareness, and pharmacy inventory management, ensuring access to essential medicines that ultimately benefit their patients. We introduce a reinforcement learning operational system to deliver personalized behavioral interventions through mobile health applications. We illustrate its potential by discussing a series of initial experiments run with SwipeRx, an all-in-one app for pharmacists, including B2B e-commerce, in Indonesia. The proposed method has broader applications extending beyond pharmacy operations to optimize healthcare delivery.</description>

      <title>Non-Determinism and the Lawlessness of Machine Learning Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11834v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legal literature on machine learning (ML) tends to focus on harms, and thus tends to reason about individual model outcomes and summary error rates. This focus has masked important aspects of ML that are rooted in its reliance on randomness -- namely, stochasticity and non-determinism. While some recent work has begun to reason about the relationship between stochasticity and arbitrariness in legal contexts, the role of non-determinism more broadly remains unexamined. In this paper, we clarify the overlap and differences between these two concepts, and show that the effects of non-determinism, and consequently its implications for the law, become clearer from the perspective of reasoning about ML outputs as distributions over possible outcomes. This distributional viewpoint accounts for randomness by emphasizing the possible outcomes of ML. Importantly, this type of reasoning is not exclusive with current legal reasoning; it complements (and in fact can strengthen) analyses concerning individual, concrete outcomes for specific automated decisions. By illuminating the important role of non-determinism, we demonstrate that ML code falls outside of the cyberlaw frame of treating ``code as law,'' as this frame assumes that code is deterministic. We conclude with a brief discussion of what work ML can do to constrain the potentially harm-inducing effects of non-determinism, and we indicate where the law must do work to bridge the gap between its current individual-outcome focus and the distributional approach that we recommend.</description>

      <title>Building an Ethical and Trustworthy Biomedical AI Ecosystem for the Translational and Clinical Integration of Foundational Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundational Models (FMs) are gaining increasing attention in the biomedical AI ecosystem due to their ability to represent and contextualize multimodal biomedical data. These capabilities make FMs a valuable tool for a variety of tasks, including biomedical reasoning, hypothesis generation, and interpreting complex imaging data. In this review paper, we address the unique challenges associated with establishing an ethical and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem, with a particular focus on the development of FMs and their downstream applications. We explore strategies that can be implemented throughout the biomedical AI pipeline to effectively tackle these challenges, ensuring that these FMs are translated responsibly into clinical and translational settings. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of key stewardship and co-design principles that not only ensure robust regulation but also guarantee that the interests of all stakeholders, especially those involved in or affected by these clinical and translational applications are adequately represented. We aim to empower the biomedical AI community to harness these models responsibly and effectively. As we navigate this exciting frontier, our collective commitment to ethical stewardship, co-design, and responsible translation will be instrumental in ensuring that the evolution of FMs truly enhances patient care and medical decision making, ultimately leading to a more equitable and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics Incorporating Higher-Order Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.03569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The issue of opinion sharing and formation has received considerable attention in the academic literature, and a few models have been proposed to study this problem. However, existing models are limited to the interactions among nearest neighbors, ignoring those second, third, and higher-order neighbors, despite the fact that higher-order interactions occur frequently in real social networks. In this paper, we develop a new model for opinion dynamics by incorporating long-range interactions based on higher-order random walks. We prove that the model converges to a fixed opinion vector, which may differ greatly from those models without higher-order interactions. Since direct computation of the equilibrium opinion is computationally expensive, which involves the operations of huge-scale matrix multiplication and inversion, we design a theoretically convergence-guaranteed estimation algorithm that approximates the equilibrium opinion vector nearly linearly in both space and time with respect to the number of edges in the graph. We conduct extensive experiments on various social networks, demonstrating that the new algorithm is both highly efficient and effective.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the increase in the usage and efficiency of Artificial Intelligence and, more in general, of Automated Decision-Making systems has brought with it an increasing and welcome awareness of the risks associated with such systems. One of such risks is that of perpetuating or even amplifying bias and unjust disparities present in the data from which many of these systems learn to adjust and optimise their decisions. This awareness has on the one hand encouraged several scientific communities to come up with more and more appropriate ways and methods to assess, quantify, and possibly mitigate such biases and disparities. On the other hand, it has prompted more and more layers of society, including policy makers, to call for fair algorithms. We believe that while many excellent and multidisciplinary research is currently being conducted, what is still fundamentally missing is the awareness that having fair algorithms is per se a nearly meaningless requirement that needs to be complemented with many additional social choices to become actionable. Namely, there is a hiatus between what the society is demanding from Automated Decision-Making systems, and what this demand actually means in real-world scenarios. In this work, we outline the key features of such a hiatus and pinpoint a set of crucial open points that we as a society must address in order to give a concrete meaning to the increasing demand of fairness in Automated Decision-Making systems.</description>

      <title>MiTTenS: A Dataset for Evaluating Gender Mistranslation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translation systems, including foundation models capable of translation, can produce errors that result in gender mistranslation, and such errors can be especially harmful. To measure the extent of such potential harms when translating into and out of English, we introduce a dataset, MiTTenS, covering 26 languages from a variety of language families and scripts, including several traditionally under-represented in digital resources. The dataset is constructed with handcrafted passages that target known failure patterns, longer synthetically generated passages, and natural passages sourced from multiple domains. We demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset by evaluating both neural machine translation systems and foundation models, and show that all systems exhibit gender mistranslation and potential harm, even in high resource languages.</description>

      <title>LLM Voting: Human Choices and AI Collective Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the voting behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, their biases, and how they align with human voting patterns. Our methodology involved using a dataset from a human voting experiment to establish a baseline for human preferences and conducting a corresponding experiment with LLM agents. We observed that the choice of voting methods and the presentation order influenced LLM voting outcomes. We found that varying the persona can reduce some of these biases and enhance alignment with human choices. While the Chain-of-Thought approach did not improve prediction accuracy, it has potential for AI explainability in the voting process. We also identified a trade-off between preference diversity and alignment accuracy in LLMs, influenced by different temperature settings. Our findings indicate that LLMs may lead to less diverse collective outcomes and biased assumptions when used in voting scenarios, emphasizing the need for cautious integration of LLMs into democratic processes.</description>

      <title>PsyDI: Towards a Personalized and Progressively In-depth Chatbot for Psychological Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of psychology, traditional assessment methods, such as standardized scales, are frequently critiqued for their static nature, lack of personalization, and reduced participant engagement, while comprehensive counseling evaluations are often inaccessible. The complexity of quantifying psychological traits further limits these methods. Despite advances with large language models (LLMs), many still depend on single-round Question-and-Answer interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce PsyDI, a personalized and progressively in-depth chatbot designed for psychological measurements, exemplified by its application in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) framework. PsyDI leverages user-related multi-modal information and engages in customized, multi-turn interactions to provide personalized, easily accessible measurements, while ensuring precise MBTI type determination. To address the challenge of unquantifiable psychological traits, we introduce a novel training paradigm that involves learning the ranking of proxy variables associated with these traits, culminating in a robust score model for MBTI measurements. The score model enables PsyDI to conduct comprehensive and precise measurements through multi-turn interactions within a unified estimation context. Through various experiments, we validate the efficacy of both the score model and the PsyDI pipeline, demonstrating its potential to serve as a general framework for psychological measurements. Furthermore, the online deployment of PsyDI has garnered substantial user engagement, with over 3,000 visits, resulting in the collection of numerous multi-turn dialogues annotated with MBTI types, which facilitates further research. The source code for the training and web service components is publicly available as a part of OpenDILab at: https://github.com/opendilab/PsyDI</description>

      <title>Large Model Strategic Thinking, Small Model Efficiency: Transferring Theory of Mind in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the performance of larger, newer Large Language Models continues to improve for strategic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, the demand for these state of the art models increases commensurately. However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, simulation-ready agents by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine a social context with a social dilemma, recording its answers, and using them for Q\&amp;A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model exhibited significant performance closer to that of its larger relative, and that their improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a \%46 improvement in aligning with the behavior of the larger model, with \%100 representing complete alignment. This suggests that our pipeline represents an efficient method to transmit some form of theory of mind to smaller models, creating improved and cheaply deployable algorithms in the process. Despite their simplicity and their associated shortcomings and limitations, our findings represent a stepping stone in the pursuit and training of specialized models for strategic and social decision making.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN) is a theoretical framework addressing significant challenges of health data sovereignty and AI utilization in healthcare caused by data fragmentation across providers and institutions. It establishes a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision as a prerequisite to a sovereign health network, then facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse medical data sources. This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal health record (PHR) as a prerequisite for health data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, where health data remains with participants and only model parameter updates are shared; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution. This framework ensures that no entity can prevent or control access to training on health data offered by participants or determine financial benefits, as these processes operate on a public blockchain with an immutable record and without a third party. It supports effective AI training in healthcare, allowing patients to maintain control over their health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial healthcare algorithms. Patients receive rewards into their digital wallets as an incentive to opt-in to the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to funding decentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel, self-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage. It highlights the potential to transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while empowering patients.</description>
