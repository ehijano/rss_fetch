      <title>GRAPE: Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning for Genetic Perturbation with Coding and Non-Coding Biotype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting genetic perturbations enables the identification of potentially crucial genes prior to wet-lab experiments, significantly improving overall experimental efficiency. Since genes are the foundation of cellular life, building gene regulatory networks (GRN) is essential to understand and predict the effects of genetic perturbations. However, current methods fail to fully leverage gene-related information, and solely rely on simple evaluation metrics to construct coarse-grained GRN. More importantly, they ignore functional differences between biotypes, limiting the ability to capture potential gene interactions. In this work, we leverage pre-trained large language model and DNA sequence model to extract features from gene descriptions and DNA sequence data, respectively, which serve as the initialization for gene representations. Additionally, we introduce gene biotype information for the first time in genetic perturbation, simulating the distinct roles of genes with different biotypes in regulating cellular processes, while capturing implicit gene relationships through graph structure learning (GSL). We propose GRAPE, a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) that leverages gene representations initialized with features from descriptions and sequences, models the distinct roles of genes with different biotypes, and dynamically refines the GRN through GSL. The results on publicly available datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Sparsity is All You Need: Rethinking Biological Pathway-Informed Approaches in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biologically-informed neural networks typically leverage pathway annotations to enhance performance in biomedical applications. We hypothesized that the benefits of pathway integration does not arise from its biological relevance, but rather from the sparsity it introduces. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of all relevant pathway-based neural network models for predictive tasks, critically evaluating each study's contributions. From this review, we curated a subset of methods for which the source code was publicly available. The comparison of the biologically informed state-of-the-art deep learning models and their randomized counterparts showed that models based on randomized information performed equally well as biologically informed ones across different metrics and datasets. Notably, in 3 out of the 15 analyzed models, the randomized versions even outperformed their biologically informed counterparts. Moreover, pathway-informed models did not show any clear advantage in interpretability, as randomized models were still able to identify relevant disease biomarkers despite lacking explicit pathway information. Our findings suggest that pathway annotations may be too noisy or inadequately explored by current methods. Therefore, we propose a methodology that can be applied to different domains and can serve as a robust benchmark for systematically comparing novel pathway-informed models against their randomized counterparts. This approach enables researchers to rigorously determine whether observed performance improvements can be attributed to biological insights.</description>

      <title>PersiST: Robust Identification of Spatially Variable Features in Spatial Omics Datasets via Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics studies are becoming increasingly large and commonplace, necessitating the analysis of a large number of spatially resolved variables. With spatial transcriptomics data sets typically containing data on thousands of different genes, on increasingly large numbers of samples, there is a need for bioinformatics tools that enable the comparison of spatial structure across large numbers of variables. Here we present PersiST, an exploratory tool that uses topology to automatically compute a continuous measure of spatial structure for each gene in a spatial transcriptomics sample. This quantification can be used for analytical tasks such as spatially variable gene identification, or searching for spatial differences in the expression of a gene between samples. We use PersiST to derive biologically meaningful insights into two public spatial transcriptomics data sets, and we experiment with applying PersiST to a spatial metabolomics data set, making use of PersiST's non-parametric approach to enable application across different measurement types. Our work showcases the advantages of using a continuous quantification of spatial structure over p-value based approaches to SVG identification, the potential for developing unified methods for the analysis of different spatial `omics modalities, and the utility of persistent homology in big data applications.</description>

      <title>Comparing CPU and GPU compute of PERMANOVA on MI300A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing the tradeoffs of CPU and GPU compute for memory-heavy algorithms is often challenging, due to the drastically different memory subsystems on host CPUs and discrete GPUs. The AMD MI300A is an exception, since it sports both CPU and GPU cores in a single package, all backed by the same type of HBM memory. In this paper we analyze the performance of Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA), a non-parametric method that tests whether two or more groups of objects are significantly different based on a categorical factor. This method is memory-bound and has been recently optimized for CPU cache locality. Our tests show that GPU cores on the MI300A prefer the brute force approach instead, significantly outperforming the CPU-based implementation. The significant benefit of Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) was also a pleasant surprise.</description>

      <title>A Sloppy approach to QSP: XAI enabling fit-for-purpose models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) promises to accelerate drug development, enable personalized medicine, and improve the predictability of clinical outcomes. Realizing its full potential depends on effectively managing the complexity of the underlying mathematical models and biological systems. Here, we present and validate a novel QSP workflow grounded in the principles of sloppy modeling, offering a practical and principled strategy for building and deploying models in a QSP pipeline. Our approach begins with a literature-derived model, constructed to be as comprehensive and unbiased as possible by drawing from the collective knowledge of prior research. At the core of the workflow is the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM), which simplifies models while preserving their predictive capacity and mechanistic interpretability. Applying MBAM as a context-specific model reduction strategy, we link the simplified representation directly to the downstream predictions of interest. The resulting reduced models are computationally efficient and well-suited to key QSP tasks, including virtual population generation, experimental design, and target discovery. We demonstrate the utility of this workflow through case studies involving the coagulation cascade and SHIV infection. Our analysis suggests several promising next steps for improving the efficacy of bNAb therapies in HIV infected patients within the context of a general-purpose QSP modeling workflow.</description>
