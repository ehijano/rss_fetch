      <title>Metabolic scaling in small life forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metabolic scaling is one of the most important patterns in biology. Theory explaining the 3/4-power size-scaling of biological metabolic rate does not predict the non-linear scaling observed for smaller life forms. Here we present a new model for cells $&lt;10^{-8}$ m$^{3}$ that maximizes power from the reaction-displacement dynamics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Maximum metabolic rate is achieved through an allocation of cell volume to optimize a ratio of reaction velocity to molecular movement. Small cells $&lt; 10^{-17}$ m$^{3}$ generate power under diffusion by diluting enzyme concentration as cell volume increases. Larger cells require bulk flow of cytoplasm generated by molecular motors. These outcomes predict curves with literature-reported parameters that match the observed scaling of metabolic rates for unicells, and predicts the volume at which Prokaryotes transition to Eukaryotes. We thus reveal multiple size-dependent physical constraints for microbes in a model that extends prior work to provide a parsimonious hypothesis for how metabolism scales across small life.</description>

      <title>Radical Pair Mechanism and the Role of Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity during Planaria Regeneration: Effect of Weak Magnetic Field on ROS levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planarian is an intriguing model system wherein the effect of electric and magnetic fields can be studied on various biochemical pathways during cell morphogenesis. Recent experimental observations have demonstrated the non-trivial modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by a weak magnetic field during planaria regeneration. However, the underlying biophysical mechanism behind this remains elusive. In this paper, we study the radical pair mechanism to explain the effect of weak magnetic fields on ROS modulation during planaria regeneration to explain the experimental results. We also investigate the effect of chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) on ROS levels by including it in the framework of the radical pair mechanism. We conclude that the inclusion of CISS explains the experimental results better and allows the radical pair model to have more parametric space to satisfy the experimental constraints. This study explains the crucial process of ROS modulation by the weak magnetic field with and without CISS, thereby paving the way to unraveling the vast domain of ROS modulation for desired outcomes.</description>

      <title>Evaporation of bacteria-laden surrogate respiratory fluid droplets: On a hydrophilic substrate versus contact-free environment confers differential bacterial infectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transmission of viruses/ bacteria cause infection predominantly via aerosols. The transmission mechanism of respiratory diseases is complex, including direct or indirect contact, large droplet, and airborne routes apart from close contact transmission. With this pretext, we have investigated two modes of droplet evaporation to understand its significance in airborne disease transmission; a droplet in a contact-free environment, which evaporates and forms droplet nuclei, and a droplet on a hydrophilic substrate (fomite). The study examines mass transport, the deposition pattern of bacteria in the precipitates, and their survival and virulence. The osmotic pressure increases with the salt concentration, inactivating the bacteria embedded in the precipitates with accelerated evaporation. Further, the bacteria's degree of survival and enhanced pathogenicity are compared for both evaporation modes. The striking differences in pathogenicity are attributed to the evaporation rate, oxygen availability, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.</description>

      <title>Mathematical models of drug delivery via a contact lens during wear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we develop and investigate mathematical and computational models that describe drug delivery from a contact lens during wear. Our models are designed to predict the dynamics of drug release from the contact lens and subsequent transport into the adjacent pre-lens tear film and post-lens tear film as well as into the ocular tissue (e.g. cornea), into the eyelid, and out of these regions. These processes are modeled by one dimensional diffusion out of the lens coupled to compartment-type models for drug concentrations in the various accompanying regions. In addition to numerical solutions that are compared with experimental data on drug release in an in vitro eye model, we also identify a large diffusion limit model for which analytical solutions can be written down for all quantities of interest, such as cumulative release of the drug from the contact lens. We use our models to make assessments about possible mechanisms and drug transport pathways through the pre-lens and post-lens tear films and provide interpretation of experimental observations. We discuss successes and limitations of our models as well as their potential to guide further research to help understand the dynamics of ophthalmic drug delivery via drug-eluting contact lenses.</description>

      <title>Spiral wave dynamics in a neuronal network model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral waves are spatial-temporal patterns that can emerge in different systems as heart tissues, chemical oscillators, ecological networks and the brain. These waves have been identified in the neocortex of turtles, rats, and humans, particularly during sleep-like states. Although their functions in cognitive activities remain until now poorly understood, these patterns are related to cortical activity modulation and contribute to cortical processing. In this work, we construct a neuronal network layer based on the spatial distribution of pyramidal neurons. Our main goal is to investigate how local connectivity and coupling strength are associated with the emergence of spiral waves. Therefore, we propose a trustworthy method capable of detecting different wave patterns, based on local and global phase order parameters. As a result, we find that the range of connection radius (R) plays a crucial role in the appearance of spiral waves. For R &lt; 20 {\mu}m, only asynchronous activity is observed due to small number of connections. The coupling strength (gsyn ) greatly influences the pattern transitions for higher R, where spikes and bursts firing patterns can be observed in spiral and non-spiral waves. Finally, we show that for some values of R and gsyn bistable states of wave patterns are obtained.</description>

      <title>Organic electrochemical neurons and synapses with ion mediated spiking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future brain-machine interfaces, prosthetics, and intelligent soft robotics will require integrating artificial neuromorphic devices with biological systems. Due to their poor biocompatibility, circuit complexity, low energy efficiency, and operating principles fundamentally different from the ion signal modulation of biology, traditional Silicon-based neuromorphic implementations have limited bio-integration potential. Here, we report the first organic electrochemical neurons (OECNs) with ion-modulated spiking, based on allprinted complementary organic electrochemical transistors. We demonstrate facile biointegration of OECNs with Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) to induce lobe closure upon input stimuli. The OECNs can also be integrated with all-printed organic electrochemical synapses (OECSs), exhibiting short-term plasticity with paired-pulse facilitation and longterm plasticity with retention &gt;1000 s, facilitating Hebbian learning. These soft and flexible OECNs operate below 0.6 V and respond to multiple stimuli, defining a new vista for localized artificial neuronal systems possible to integrate with bio-signaling systems of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates.</description>

      <title>Towards Prebiotic Chemistry on Titan: Impact experiments on organic haze particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impacts are critical to producing the aqueous environments necessary to stimulate prebiotic chemistry on Titan's surface. Furthermore, organic hazes resting on the surface are a likely feedstock of biomolecules. In this work, we conduct impact experiments on laboratory-produced organic haze particles and haze/sand mixtures and analyze these samples for life's building blocks. Samples of unshocked haze and sand particles are also analyzed to determine the change in biomolecule concentrations and distributions from shocking. Across all samples, we detect seven nucleobases, nine proteinogenic amino acids, and five other biomolecules (e.g., urea) using a blank subtraction procedure to eliminate signals due to contamination. We find that shock pressures of 13 GPa variably degrade nucleobases, amino acids, and a few other organics in haze particles and haze/sand mixtures; however, certain individual biomolecules become enriched or are even produced from these events. Xanthine, threonine, and aspartic acid are enriched or produced in impact experiments containing sand, suggesting these minerals may catalyze the production of these biomolecules. On the other hand, thymine and isoleucine/norleucine are enriched or produced in haze samples containing no sand, suggesting catalytic grains are not necessary for all impact shock syntheses. Uracil, glycine, proline, cysteine, and tyrosine are the most unstable to impact-related processing. These experiments suggest that impacts alter biomolecule distributions on Titan's surface, and that organic hazes co-occurring with fine-grained material on the surface may provide an initial source for further prebiotic chemistry on Titan.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result -- a time-integrated generalized speed limit -- reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g. in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

      <title>Waves, patterns and bifurcations: a tutorial review on the vertebrate segmentation clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proper vertebrae formation relies on a tissue-wide oscillator called the segmentation clock. Individual cellular oscillators in the presomitic mesoderm are modulated by intercellular coupling and external signals, leading to the propagation of oscillatory waves of genetic expression eventually stabilizing into a static pattern of genetic expression. Here, we review 4 decades of biophysical models of this process, starting from the pioneering Clock and Wavefront model by Cooke and Zeeman, and the reaction-diffusion model by Meinhardt. We discuss how modern descriptions followed advances in molecular description and visualization of the process, reviewing phase models, delayed models, systems-level, and finally geometric models. We connect models to high-level aspects of embryonic development from embryonic scaling to wave propagation, up to reconstructed stem cell systems. We provide new analytical calculations and insights into classical and recent models, leading us to propose a geometric description of somitogenesis organized along two primary waves of differentiation.</description>

      <title>Impact of Diffusion on synchronization pattern of epidemics in nonidentical metapopulation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a prior study, a novel deterministic compartmental model known as the SEIHRK model was introduced, shedding light on the pivotal role of test kits as an intervention strategy for mitigating epidemics. Particularly in heterogeneous networks, it was empirically demonstrated that strategically distributing a limited number of test kits among nodes with higher degrees substantially diminishes the outbreak size. The network's dynamics were explored under varying values of infection rate. In this research, we expand upon these findings to investigate the influence of migration on infection dynamics within distinct communities of the network. Notably, we observe that nodes equipped with test kits and those without tend to segregate into two separate clusters when coupling strength is low, but beyond a critical threshold coupling coefficient, they coalesce into a unified cluster. Building on this clustering phenomenon, we develop a reduced equation model and rigorously validate its accuracy through comprehensive simulations. We show that this property is observed in both complete and random graphs.</description>

      <title>Shaping an evanescent focus of light for high spatial resolution optogenetic activations in live cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confining light illumination in the three dimensions of space is a challenge for various applications. Among these, optogenetic methods developed for live experiments in cell biology would benefit from such a localized illumination as it would improve the spatial resolution of diffusive photosensitive proteins leading to spatially constrained biological responses in specific subcellular organelles. Here, we describe a method to create and move a focused evanescent spot across the field of view of a high numerical aperture microscope objective, using a digital micro-mirror device (DMD). We show that, after correcting the optical aberrations, light is confined within a spot of sub-micron lateral size and $\sim$100~nm axial depth, resulting in a volume of illumination drastically smaller than the one generated by a standard propagative focus. This evanescent focus is sufficient to induce a more intense and localized recruitment compared to a propagative focus on the optogenetic system CRY2-CIBN, improving the resolution of its pattern of activation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain biological systems exhibit both direct and retrograde propagating wave signals, despite unidirectional neural coupling. However, there is no model to explain this. Therefore, the underlying physics of reversing the signal's direction for one-way coupling remains unclear. Here, we resolve this issue using a Wilson-Cowan oscillators network. By analyzing the limit cycle period of various coupling configurations, we determine that intrinsic frequency differences among oscillators control wave directionality.</description>

      <title>Neurological disorders leading to mechanical dysfunction of the esophagus: an emergent behavior of a neuromechanical dynamical system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An understanding how neurological disorders lead to mechanical dysfunction of the esophagus requires knowledge of the neural circuit of the enteric nervous system. Historically, this has been elusive. Here, we present an empirically guided neural circuit for the esophagus. It has a chain of unidirectionally coupled relaxation oscillators, receiving excitatory signals from stretch receptors along the esophagus. The resulting neuromechanical model reveals complex patterns and behaviors that emerge from interacting components in the system. A wide variety of clinically observed normal and abnormal esophageal responses to distension are successfully predicted. Specifically, repetitive antegrade contractions (RACs) are conclusively shown to emerge from the coupled neuromechanical dynamics in response to sustained volumetric distension. Normal RACs are shown to have a robust balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, and the mechanical input through stretch receptors. When this balance is affected, contraction patterns akin to motility disorders are observed. For example, clinically observed repetitive retrograde contractions emerge due to a hyper stretch sensitive wall. Such neuromechanical insights could be crucial to eventually develop targeted pharmacological interventions.</description>
