      <title>Localized atomic vibrations caused by point impurity in long chains of noble gas atoms adsorbed in outer grooves of carbon nanobundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characteristics of discrete vibrational levels caused by a point three-parameter substitutional impurity in long linear chain of inert gas atoms adsorbed in groove on the surface of carbon nanobundle are studied. The impurity atom differs from the atoms of the chain in the following parameters: the mass, the parameter of interaction with neighboring atoms and the parameter of interaction with the substrate. Analytical expressions for the frequencies of the localized vibrations and the intensities of these vibrations are obtained. The conditions for the existence of localized vibrations both below and above the band of the quasi-continuous spectrum of the adsorbed chain are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Entropy from scattering in weakly interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system in the course of a gedanken scattering experiment. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the initial state and the scattering matrix that guarantee that the subsystem entropy increases. The class of states that meet these criteria are more correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by classical processes alone.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling between a dielectric nanocavity and a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate strong coupling between light in a dielectric nanocavity with deep sub-wavelength confinement and excitons in a monolayer of molybdenum ditelluride. Avoided crossing is demonstrated by both photoluminescence and reflection measurements, from which we extract a light-matter interaction strength of $g_{\mathrm{PL}} =\SI{5.3\pm0.3}{\milli\eV}$ and $g_{\mathrm{R}} =\SI{4.7\pm0.7}{\milli\eV}$, respectively. The associated Rabi splitting is twice as large as the system's losses. These values are in good agreement with values obtained by a novel exciton reaction coordinate formalism, yielding $g_{\mathrm{theory}} = \SI{5.2\pm0.7}{\milli\eV}$. The strong light-matter interaction, combined with low losses and sub-wavelength confinement of light, black demonstrates a new regime of light-matter interactions where strong nonlinearities at the single-photon level are expected.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional sub-wavelength topological dark state lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</description>
