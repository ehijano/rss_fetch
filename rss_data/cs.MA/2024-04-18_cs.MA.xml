      <title>Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the entire road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatial and temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent and reactive urban traffic management solutions.</description>

      <title>Circular Distribution of Agents using Convex Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of conflict-free distribution of agents on a circular periphery encompassing all agents. The two key elements of the proposed policy include the construction of a set of convex layers (nested convex polygons) using the initial positions of the agents, and a novel search space region for each of the agents. The search space for an agent on a convex layer is defined as the region enclosed between the lines passing through the agent's position and normal to its supporting edges. Guaranteeing collision-free paths, a goal assignment policy designates a unique goal position within the search space of an agent. In contrast to the existing literature, this work presents a one-shot, collision-free solution to the circular distribution problem by utilizing only the initial positions of the agents. Illustrative examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy.</description>

      <title>Sustainability of Data Center Digital Twins with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of machine learning (ML) has led to an increased demand for computational power, resulting in larger data centers (DCs) and higher energy consumption. To address this issue and reduce carbon emissions, intelligent design and control of DC components such as IT servers, cabinets, HVAC cooling, flexible load shifting, and battery energy storage are essential. However, the complexity of designing and controlling them in tandem presents a significant challenge. While some individual components like CFD-based design and Reinforcement Learning (RL) based HVAC control have been researched, there's a gap in the holistic design and optimization covering all elements simultaneously. To tackle this, we've developed DCRL-Green, a multi-agent RL environment that empowers the ML community to design data centers and research, develop, and refine RL controllers for carbon footprint reduction in DCs. It is a flexible, modular, scalable, and configurable platform that can handle large High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. Furthermore, in its default setup, DCRL-Green provides a benchmark for evaluating single as well as multi-agent RL algorithms. It easily allows users to subclass the default implementations and design their own control approaches, encouraging community development for sustainable data centers.

      <title>Group-Aware Coordination Graph for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) necessitates seamless collaboration among agents, often represented by an underlying relation graph. Existing methods for learning this graph primarily focus on agent-pair relations, neglecting higher-order relationships. While several approaches attempt to extend cooperation modelling to encompass behaviour similarities within groups, they commonly fall short in concurrently learning the latent graph, thereby constraining the information exchange among partially observed agents. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel approach to infer the Group-Aware Coordination Graph (GACG), which is designed to capture both the cooperation between agent pairs based on current observations and group-level dependencies from behaviour patterns observed across trajectories. This graph is further used in graph convolution for information exchange between agents during decision-making. To further ensure behavioural consistency among agents within the same group, we introduce a group distance loss, which promotes group cohesion and encourages specialization between groups. Our evaluations, conducted on StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, demonstrate GACG's superior performance. An ablation study further provides experimental evidence of the effectiveness of each component of our method.</description>

      <title>Self-adaptive PSRO: Towards an Automatic Population-based Game Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) as a general algorithmic framework has achieved state-of-the-art performance in learning equilibrium policies of two-player zero-sum games. However, the hand-crafted hyperparameter value selection in most of the existing works requires extensive domain knowledge, forming the main barrier to applying PSRO to different games. In this work, we make the first attempt to investigate the possibility of self-adaptively determining the optimal hyperparameter values in the PSRO framework. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) Using several hyperparameters, we propose a parametric PSRO that unifies the gradient descent ascent (GDA) and different PSRO variants. (2) We propose the self-adaptive PSRO (SPSRO) by casting the hyperparameter value selection of the parametric PSRO as a hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem where our objective is to learn an HPO policy that can self-adaptively determine the optimal hyperparameter values during the running of the parametric PSRO. (3) To overcome the poor performance of online HPO methods, we propose a novel offline HPO approach to optimize the HPO policy based on the Transformer architecture. Experiments on various two-player zero-sum games demonstrate the superiority of SPSRO over different baselines.</description>

      <title>Distributed Fractional Bayesian Learning for Adaptive Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a distributed adaptive optimization problem, where all agents only have access to their local cost functions with a common unknown parameter, whereas they mean to collaboratively estimate the true parameter and find the optimal solution over a connected network. A general mathematical framework for such a problem has not been studied yet. We aim to provide valuable insights for addressing parameter uncertainty in distributed optimization problems and simultaneously find the optimal solution. Thus, we propose a novel Prediction while Optimization scheme, which utilizes distributed fractional Bayesian learning through weighted averaging on the log-beliefs to update the beliefs of unknown parameters, and distributed gradient descent for renewing the estimation of the optimal solution. Then under suitable assumptions, we prove that all agents' beliefs and decision variables converge almost surely to the true parameter and the optimal solution under the true parameter, respectively. We further establish a sublinear convergence rate for the belief sequence. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Distributed Random Reshuffling Methods with Improved Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes two distributed random reshuffling methods, namely Gradient Tracking with Random Reshuffling (GT-RR) and Exact Diffusion with Random Reshuffling (ED-RR), to solve the distributed optimization problem over a connected network, where a set of agents aim to minimize the average of their local cost functions. Both algorithms invoke random reshuffling (RR) update for each agent, inherit favorable characteristics of RR for minimizing smooth nonconvex objective functions, and improve the performance of previous distributed random reshuffling methods both theoretically and empirically. Specifically, both GT-RR and ED-RR achieve the convergence rate of $O(1/[(1-\lambda)^{1/3}m^{1/3}T^{2/3}])$ in driving the (minimum) expected squared norm of the gradient to zero, where $T$ denotes the number of epochs, $m$ is the sample size for each agent, and $1-\lambda$ represents the spectral gap of the mixing matrix. When the objective functions further satisfy the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition, we show GT-RR and ED-RR both achieve $O(1/[(1-\lambda)mT^2])$ convergence rate in terms of the averaged expected differences between the agents' function values and the global minimum value. Notably, both results are comparable to the convergence rates of centralized RR methods (up to constant factors depending on the network topology) and outperform those of previous distributed random reshuffling algorithms. Moreover, we support the theoretical findings with a set of numerical experiments.</description>
