      <title>Relative-error testing of conjunctions and decision lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relative-error property testing model for Boolean functions that was recently introduced in the work of Chen et al. (SODA 2025). In relative-error testing, the testing algorithm gets uniform random satisfying assignments as well as black-box queries to $f$, and it must accept $f$ with high probability whenever $f$ has the property that is being tested and reject any $f$ that is relative-error far from having the property. Here the relative-error distance from $f$ to a function $g$ is measured with respect to $|f^{-1}(1)|$ rather than with respect to the entire domain size $2^n$ as in the Hamming distance measure that is used in the standard model; thus, unlike the standard model, relative-error testing allows us to study the testability of sparse Boolean functions that have few satisfying assignments. It was shown in Chen et al. (SODA 2025) that relative-error testing is at least as difficult as standard-model property testing, but for many natural and important Boolean function classes the precise relationship between the two notions is unknown.
  In this paper we consider the well-studied and fundamental properties of being a conjunction and being a decision list. In the relative-error setting, we give an efficient one-sided error tester for conjunctions with running time and query complexity $O(1/\epsilon)$.
  Secondly, we give a two-sided relative-error $\tilde{O}$$(1/\epsilon)$ tester for decision lists, matching the query complexity of the state-of-the-art algorithm in the standard model Bshouty (RANDOM 2020) and Diakonikolas et al. (FOCS 2007).</description>

      <title>High dimensional online calibration in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In online (sequential) calibration, a forecaster predicts probability distributions over a finite outcome space $[d]$ over a sequence of $T$ days, with the goal of being calibrated. While asymptotically calibrated strategies are known to exist, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the best known algorithms require $\exp(d)$ days to achieve non-trivial calibration.
  In this work, we present the first asymptotically calibrated strategy that guarantees non-trivial calibration after a polynomial number of rounds. Specifically, for any desired accuracy $\epsilon &gt; 0$, our forecaster becomes $\epsilon$-calibrated after $T = d^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ days. We complement this result with a lower bound, proving that at least $T = d^{\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))}$ rounds are necessary to achieve $\epsilon$-calibration. Our results resolve the open questions posed by [Abernethy-Mannor'11, Hazan-Kakade'12].
  Our algorithm is inspired by recent breakthroughs in swap regret minimization [Peng-Rubinstein'24, Dagan et al.'24]. Despite its strong theoretical guarantees, the approach is remarkably simple and intuitive: it randomly selects among a set of sub-forecasters, each of which predicts the empirical outcome frequency over recent time windows.</description>

      <title>Testing Juntas and Junta Subclasses with Relative Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This papers considers the junta testing problem in a recently introduced ``relative error'' variant of the standard Boolean function property testing model. In relative-error testing we measure the distance from $f$ to $g$, where $f,g: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$, by the ratio of $|f^{-1}(1) \triangle g^{-1}(1)|$ (the number of inputs on which $f$ and $g$ disagree) to $|f^{-1}(1)|$ (the number of satisfying assignments of $f$), and we give the testing algorithm both black-box access to $f$ and also access to independent uniform samples from $f^{-1}(1)$.
  Chen et al. (SODA 2025) observed that the class of $k$-juntas is $\text{poly}(2^k,1/\epsilon)$-query testable in the relative-error model, and asked whether $\text{poly}(k,1/\epsilon)$ queries is achievable. We answer this question affirmatively by giving a $\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon)$-query algorithm, matching the optimal complexity achieved in the less challenging standard model. Moreover, as our main result, we show that any subclass of $k$-juntas that is closed under permuting variables is relative-error testable with a similar complexity. This gives highly efficient relative-error testing algorithms for a number of well-studied function classes, including size-$k$ decision trees, size-$k$ branching programs, and size-$k$ Boolean formulas.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robustness of Hypergrid Johnson-Lindenstrauss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Johnson and Lindenstrauss (Contemporary Mathematics, 1984) showed that for $n &gt; m$, a scaled random projection $\mathbf{A}$ from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ is an approximate isometry on any set $S$ of size at most exponential in $m$. If $S$ is larger, however, its points can contract arbitrarily under $\mathbf{A}$. In particular, the hypergrid $([-B, B] \cap \mathbb{Z})^n$ is expected to contain a point that is contracted by a factor of $\kappa_{\mathsf{stat}} = \Theta(B)^{-1/\alpha}$, where $\alpha = m/n$.
  We give evidence that finding such a point exhibits a statistical-computational gap precisely up to $\kappa_{\mathsf{comp}} = \widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{\alpha}/B)$. On the algorithmic side, we design an online algorithm achieving $\kappa_{\mathsf{comp}}$, inspired by a discrepancy minimization algorithm of Bansal and Spencer (Random Structures &amp; Algorithms, 2020). On the hardness side, we show evidence via a multiple overlap gap property (mOGP), which in particular captures online algorithms; and a reduction-based lower bound, which shows hardness under standard worst-case lattice assumptions.
  As a cryptographic application, we show that the rounded Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding is a robust property-preserving hash function (Boyle, Lavigne and Vaikuntanathan, TCC 2019) on the hypergrid for the Euclidean metric in the computationally hard regime. Such hash functions compress data while preserving $\ell_2$ distances between inputs up to some distortion factor, with the guarantee that even knowing the hash function, no computationally bounded adversary can find any pair of points that violates the distortion bound.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Differentially Private Regret Bounds in Linear MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study regret minimization under privacy constraints in episodic inhomogeneous linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), motivated by the growing use of reinforcement learning (RL) in personalized decision-making systems that rely on sensitive user data. In this setting, both transition probabilities and reward functions are assumed to be linear in a feature mapping $\phi(s, a)$, and we aim to ensure privacy through joint differential privacy (JDP), a relaxation of differential privacy suited to online learning. Prior work has established suboptimal regret bounds by privatizing the LSVI-UCB algorithm, which achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 H^4 K})$ regret in the non-private setting. Building on recent advances that improve this to minimax optimal regret $\widetilde{O}(HD\sqrt{K})$ via LSVI-UCB++ with Bernstein-style bonuses, we design a new differentially private algorithm by privatizing LSVI-UCB++ and adapting techniques for variance-aware analysis from offline RL. Our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(d \sqrt{H^3 K} + H^{4.5} d^{7/6} K^{1/2} / \epsilon)$, improving over previous private methods. Empirical results show that our algorithm retains near-optimal utility compared to non-private baselines, indicating that privacy can be achieved with minimal performance degradation in this setting.</description>

      <title>Nash Social Welfare with Submodular Valuations: Approximation Algorithms and Integrality Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating items to agents such that the (un)weighted Nash social welfare (NSW) is maximized under submodular valuations. The best-known results for unweighted and weighted problems are the $(4+\epsilon)$ approximation given by Garg, Husic, Li, Vega, and Vondrak~\cite{stoc/GargHLVV23} and the $(233+\epsilon)$ approximation given by Feng, Hu, Li, and Zhang~\cite{stoc/FHLZ25}, respectively.
  For the weighted NSW problem, we present a $(5.18+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, significantly improving the previous approximation ratio and simplifying the analysis. Our algorithm is based on the same configuration LP in~\cite{stoc/FHLZ25}, but with a modified rounding algorithm. For the unweighted NSW problem, we show that the local search-based algorithm in~\cite{stoc/GargHLVV23} is an approximation of $(3.914+\epsilon)$ by more careful analysis.
  On the negative side, we prove that the configuration LP for weighted NSW with submodular valuations has an integrality gap at least $2^{\ln 2}-\epsilon \approx 1.617 - \epsilon$, which is slightly larger than the current best-known $e/(e-1)-\epsilon \approx 1.582-\epsilon$ hardness of approximation~\cite{talg/GargKK23}. For the additive valuation case, we show an integrality gap of $(e^{1/e}-\epsilon)$, which proves that the ratio of $(e^{1/e}+\epsilon)$~\cite{icalp/FengLi24} is tight for algorithms based on the configuration LP. For unweighted NSW with additive valuations, we show a gap of $(2^{1/4}-\epsilon) \approx 1.189-\epsilon$, slightly larger than the current best-known $\sqrt{8/7} \approx 1.069$-hardness for the problem~\cite{mor/Garg0M24}.</description>

      <title>Vermilion: A Traffic-Aware Reconfigurable Optical Interconnect with Formal Throughput Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing gap between datacenter traffic volume and the capacity of electrical switches has driven the development of reconfigurable network designs utilizing optical circuit switching. Recent advancements, particularly those featuring periodic fixed-duration reconfigurations, have achieved practical end-to-end delays of just a few microseconds. However, current designs rely on multi-hop routing to enhance utilization, which can lead to a significant reduction in worst-case throughput and added overhead from congestion control and routing complexity. These factors pose significant operational challenges for the large-scale deployment of these technologies.
  We present Vermilion, a reconfigurable optical interconnect that breaks the throughput barrier of existing periodic reconfigurable networks, without the need for multi-hop routing -- thus eliminating congestion control and simplifying routing to direct communication. Vermilion adopts a traffic-aware approach while retaining the simplicity of periodic fixed-duration reconfigurations, similar to RotorNet. We formally establish throughput bounds for Vermilion, demonstrating that it achieves at least $33\%$ more throughput in the worst-case compared to existing designs. The key innovation of Vermilion is its short traffic-aware periodic schedule, derived using a matrix rounding technique. This schedule is then combined with a traffic-oblivious periodic schedule to efficiently manage any residual traffic. Our evaluation results support our theoretical findings, revealing significant performance gains for datacenter workloads.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Matching is in Catalytic Logspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching is a central problem in theoretical computer science, with a large body of work spanning the last five decades. However, understanding matching in the time-space bounded setting remains a longstanding open question, even in the presence of additional resources such as randomness or non-determinism.
  In this work we study space-bounded machines with access to catalytic space, which is additional working memory that is full with arbitrary data that must be preserved at the end of its computation. Despite this heavy restriction, many recent works have shown the power of catalytic space, its utility in designing classical space-bounded algorithms, and surprising connections between catalytic computation and derandomization.
  Our main result is that bipartite maximum matching ($MATCH$) can be computed in catalytic logspace ($CL$) with a polynomial time bound ($CLP$). Moreover, we show that $MATCH$ can be reduced to the lossy coding problem for $NC$ circuits ($LOSSY[NC]$). This has consequences for matching, catalytic space, and derandomization:
  - Matching: this is the first well studied subclass of $P$ which is known to compute $MATCH$, as well as the first algorithm simultaneously using sublinear free space and polynomial time with any additional resources.
  - Catalytic space: this is the first new problem shown to be in $CL$ since the model was defined, and one which is extremely central and well-studied.
  - Derandomization: we give the first class $\mathcal{C}$ beyond $L$ for which we exhibit a natural problem in $LOSSY[\mathcal{C}]$ which is not known to be in $\mathcal{C}$, as well as a full derandomization of the isolation lemma in $CL$ in the context of $MATCH$.
  Our proof combines a number of strengthened ideas from isolation-based algorithms for matching alongside the compress-or-random framework in catalytic computation.</description>

      <title>Fairness and Efficiency in Two-Sided Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new fairness notion, motivated by the practical challenge of allocating teaching assistants (TAs) to courses in a department. Each course requires a certain number of TAs and each TA has preferences over the courses they want to assist. Similarly, each course instructor has preferences over the TAs who applied for their course. We demand fairness and efficiency for both sides separately, giving rise to the following criteria: (i) every course gets the required number of TAs and the average utility of the assigned TAs meets a threshold; (ii) the allocation of courses to TAs is envy-free, where a TA envies another TA if the former prefers the latter's course and has a higher or equal grade in that course. Note that the definition of envy-freeness here differs from the one in the literature, and we call it merit-based envy-freeness.
  We show that the problem of finding a merit-based envy-free and efficient matching is NP-hard even for very restricted settings, such as two courses and uniform valuations; constant degree, constant capacity of TAs for every course, valuations in the range {0,1,2,3}, identical valuations from TAs, and even more. To find tractable results, we consider some restricted instances, such as, strict valuation of TAs for courses, the difference between the number of positively valued TAs for a course and the capacity, the number of positively valued TAs/courses, types of valuation functions, and obtained some polynomial-time solvable cases, showing the contrast with intractable results. We further studied the problem in the paradigm of parameterized algorithms and designed some exact and approximation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Diversity-Fair Online Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10389v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online selection problems frequently arise in applications such as crowdsourcing and employee recruitment. Existing research typically focuses on candidates with a single attribute. However, crowdsourcing tasks often require contributions from individuals across various demographics. Further motivated by the dynamic nature of crowdsourcing and hiring, we study the diversity-fair online selection problem, in which a recruiter must make real-time decisions to foster workforce diversity across many dimensions. We propose two scenarios for this problem. The fixed-capacity scenario, suited for short-term hiring for crowdsourced workers, provides the recruiter with a fixed capacity to fill temporary job vacancies. In contrast, in the unknown-capacity scenario, recruiters optimize diversity across recruitment seasons with increasing capacities, reflecting that the firm honors diversity consideration in a long-term employee acquisition strategy. By modeling the diversity over $d$ dimensions as a max-min fairness objective, we show that no policy can surpass a competitive ratio of $O(1/d^{1/3})$ for either scenario, indicating that any achievable result inevitably decays by some polynomial factor in $d$. To this end, we develop bilevel hierarchical randomized policies that ensure compliance with the capacity constraint. For the fixed-capacity scenario, leveraging marginal information about the arriving population allows us to achieve a competitive ratio of $1/(4\sqrt{d} \lceil \log_2 d \rceil)$. For the unknown-capacity scenario, we establish a competitive ratio of $\Omega(1/d^{3/4})$ under mild boundedness conditions. In both bilevel hierarchical policies, the higher level determines ex-ante selection probabilities and then informs the lower level's randomized selection that ensures no loss in efficiency. Both policies prioritize core diversity and then adjust for underrepresented dimensions.</description>

      <title>Unique Decoding of Reed-Solomon and Related Codes for Semi-Adversarial Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over a quarter century, the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm has served as the state-of-the-art for list-decoding Reed-Solomon (RS) codes up to the Johnson bound against adversarial errors. However, some recent structural results on the combinatorial list decoding of randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes suggest that Johnson bound can likely be broken for some subclasses of RS codes. Motivated by these results, we seek to make traction on understanding adversarial decoding by considering a new model: semi-adversarial errors. This error model bridges between fully random errors and fully adversarial errors by allowing some symbols of a message to be corrupted by an adversary while others are replaced with uniformly random symbols.
  As our main quest, we seek to understand optimal efficient unique decoding algorithms in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, we revisit some classical results on decoding interleaved Reed-Solomon codes (aka subfield evaluation RS codes) in the random error model by Bleichenbacher-Kiayias-Yung (BKY) and work to improve and extend their analysis. First, we give an improved implementation and analysis of the BKY algorithm for interleaved Reed-Solomon codes in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, our algorithm runs in near-linear time, and for most mixtures of random and adversarial errors, our analysis matches the information-theoretic optimum.
  Moreover, inspired by the BKY algorithm, we use a novel interpolation to extend our approach to the settings of folded Reed-Solomon codes, resulting in fast algorithms for unique decoding against semi-adversarial errors. A particular advantage of our near-linear time algorithm over state-of-the-art decoding algorithms for adversarial errors is that its running time depends only on a polynomial function of the folding parameter rather than on an exponential function.</description>

      <title>Learning with Positive and Imperfect Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning binary classifiers from positive and unlabeled data when the unlabeled data distribution is shifted, which we call Positive and Imperfect Unlabeled (PIU) Learning. In the absence of covariate shifts, i.e., with perfect unlabeled data, Denis (1998) reduced this problem to learning under Massart noise; however, that reduction fails under even slight shifts.
  Our main results on PIU learning are the characterizations of the sample complexity of PIU learning and a computationally and sample-efficient algorithm achieving a misclassification error $\varepsilon$. We further show that our results lead to new algorithms for several related problems.
  1. Learning from smooth distributions: We give algorithms that learn interesting concept classes from only positive samples under smooth feature distributions, bypassing known existing impossibility results and contributing to recent advances in smoothened learning (Haghtalab et al, J.ACM'24) (Chandrasekaran et al., COLT'24).
  2. Learning with a list of unlabeled distributions: We design new algorithms that apply to a broad class of concept classes under the assumption that we are given a list of unlabeled distributions, one of which--unknown to the learner--is $O(1)$-close to the true feature distribution.
  3. Estimation in the presence of unknown truncation: We give the first polynomial sample and time algorithm for estimating the parameters of an exponential family distribution from samples truncated to an unknown set approximable by polynomials in $L_1$-norm. This improves the algorithm by Lee et al. (FOCS'24) that requires approximation in $L_2$-norm.
  4. Detecting truncation: We present new algorithms for detecting whether given samples have been truncated (or not) for a broad class of non-product distributions, including non-product distributions, improving the algorithm by De et al. (STOC'24).</description>

      <title>Critical Relaxed Stable Matchings with Ties in the Many-to-Many Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the many-to-many bipartite matching problem in the presence of preferences where ties, as well as lower quotas, may appear on both sides of the bipartition. The input is a bipartite graph $G=(A \cup B, E)$, where each vertex in $A \cup B$ has a positive upper quota and a non-negative lower quota denoting the maximum and minimum number of vertices that can be assigned to it from its neighborhood. Additionally, each vertex specifies a preference ordering, possibly containing ties, over its neighbors. A \textit{critical} matching is a matching which fulfills vertex lower quotas to the maximum possible extent. We seek to compute a matching that is critical as well as optimal with respect to the preferences of vertices. Stability, a well-accepted notion of optimality in the presence of two-sided preferences, is generalized to weak-stability in the presence of ties. However, a matching that is critical as well as weakly stable may not exist. Popularity is another well-investigated notion of optimality for the two-sided preference model; however, in the presence of ties (even without lower quotas), a popular matching may not exist. We, therefore, consider the notion of relaxed stability, which was introduced and studied by Krishnaa, Limaye, Nasre, and Nimbhorkar~(JoCO 2023). We show that a critical matching that is relaxed stable always exists, although computing a maximum-size relaxed stable matching turns out to be NP-hard. Our main contribution is a $\frac{3}{2}$-approximation algorithm for computing a maximum-size critical relaxed stable matching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recast move generators for solving board games as operations on compressed sets of strings. We aim for compressed representations with space sublinear in the number of game positions for interesting sets of positions, move generation in time roughly linear in the compressed size and membership tests in constant time. To the extent that we achieve these tradeoffs empirically, we can strongly solve board games in time sublinear in the state space. We demonstrate this concept with the game Breakthrough where we empirically realize compressed representations taking roughly $n^{0.5}$ to $n^{0.7}$ space to store relevant sets of $n$ positions.</description>

      <title>Implicit High-Order Moment Tensor Estimation and Learning Latent Variable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the task of learning latent-variable models. A common algorithmic technique for this task is the method of moments. Unfortunately, moment-based approaches are hampered by the fact that the moment tensors of super-constant degree cannot even be written down in polynomial time. Motivated by such learning applications, we develop a general efficient algorithm for {\em implicit moment tensor computation}. Our framework generalizes the work of~\cite{LL21-opt} which developed an efficient algorithm for the specific moment tensors that arise in clustering mixtures of spherical Gaussians.
  By leveraging our implicit moment estimation algorithm, we obtain the first $\mathrm{poly}(d, k)$-time learning algorithms for the following models.
  * {\bf Mixtures of Linear Regressions} We give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time algorithm for this task, where $\epsilon$ is the desired error.
  * {\bf Mixtures of Spherical Gaussians} For density estimation, we give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time learning algorithm, where $\epsilon$ is the desired total variation error, under the condition that the means lie in a ball of radius $O(\sqrt{\log k})$. For parameter estimation, we give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time algorithm under the {\em optimal} mean separation of $\Omega(\log^{1/2}(k/\epsilon))$.
  * {\bf Positive Linear Combinations of Non-Linear Activations} We give a general algorithm for this task with complexity $\mathrm{poly}(d, k) g(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired error and the function $g$ depends on the Hermite concentration of the target class of functions. Specifically, for positive linear combinations of ReLU activations, our algorithm has complexity $\mathrm{poly}(d, k) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)}$.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Robust Covariance and Scatter Matrix Estimation Beyond Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of computationally efficient robust estimation of the covariance/scatter matrix of elliptical distributions -- that is, affine transformations of spherically symmetric distributions -- under the strong contamination model in the high-dimensional regime $d \gtrsim 1/\varepsilon^2$, where $d$ is the dimension and $\varepsilon$ is the fraction of adversarial corruptions.
  We propose an algorithm that, under a very mild assumption on the scatter matrix $\Sigma$, and given a nearly optimal number of samples $n = \tilde{O}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$, computes in polynomial time an estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ such that, with high probability, \[ \left\| \Sigma^{-1/2} \hat{\Sigma} \Sigma^{-1/2} - Id \right\|_{\text F} \le O(\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon))\,. \]
  As an application of our result, we obtain the first efficiently computable, nearly optimal robust covariance estimators that extend beyond the Gaussian case. Specifically, for elliptical distributions satisfying the Hanson--Wright inequality (such as Gaussians and uniform distributions over ellipsoids), our estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ of the covariance $\Sigma$ achieves the same error guarantee as in the Gaussian case. Moreover, for elliptical distributions with sub-exponential tails (such as the multivariate Laplace distribution), we construct an estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ satisfying the spectral norm bound \[ \left\| \Sigma^{-1/2} \hat{\Sigma} \Sigma^{-1/2} - Id \right\| \le O(\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon))\,. \]
  Our approach is based on estimating the covariance of the spatial sign of elliptical distributions. The estimation proceeds in several stages, one of which involves a novel spectral covariance filtering algorithm. This algorithm combines covariance filtering techniques with degree-4 sum-of-squares relaxations, and we believe it may be of independent interest for future applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Learning of Multi-index Models via Iterative Subspace Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning Multi-Index Models (MIMs) with label noise under the Gaussian distribution. A $K$-MIM is any function $f$ that only depends on a $K$-dimensional subspace. We focus on well-behaved MIMs with finite ranges that satisfy certain regularity properties. Our main contribution is a general robust learner that is qualitatively optimal in the Statistical Query (SQ) model. Our algorithm iteratively constructs better approximations to the defining subspace by computing low-degree moments conditional on the projection to the subspace computed thus far, and adding directions with relatively large empirical moments. This procedure efficiently finds a subspace $V$ so that $f(\mathbf{x})$ is close to a function of the projection of $\mathbf{x}$ onto $V$. Conversely, for functions for which these conditional moments do not help, we prove an SQ lower bound suggesting that no efficient learner exists. As applications, we provide faster robust learners for the following concept classes:
  * {\bf Multiclass Linear Classifiers} We give a constant-factor approximate agnostic learner with sample complexity $N = O(d) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first constant-factor agnostic learner for this class whose complexity is a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  * {\bf Intersections of Halfspaces} We give an approximate agnostic learner for this class achieving 0-1 error $K \tilde{O}(\mathrm{OPT}) + \epsilon$ with sample complexity $N=O(d^2) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first agnostic learner for this class with near-linear error dependence and complexity a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  Furthermore, we show that in the presence of random classification noise, the complexity of our algorithm scales polynomially with $1/\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>A Competitive Posted-Price Mechanism for Online Budget-Feasible Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider online procurement auctions, where the agents arrive sequentially, in random order, and have private costs for their services. The buyer aims to maximize a monotone submodular value function for the subset of agents whose services are procured, subject to a budget constraint on their payments. We consider a posted-price setting where upon each agent's arrival, the buyer decides on a payment offered to them. The agent accepts or rejects the offer, depending on whether the payment exceeds their cost, without revealing any other information about their private costs whatsoever. We present a randomized online posted-price mechanism with constant competitive ratio, thus resolving the main open question of (Badanidiyuru, Kleinberg and Singer, EC 2012). Posted-price mechanisms for online procurement typically operate by learning an estimation of the optimal value, denoted as OPT, and using it to determine the payments offered to the agents. The main challenge is to learn OPT within a constant factor from the agents' accept / reject responses to the payments offered. Our approach is based on an online test of whether our estimation is too low compared against OPT and a carefully designed adaptive search that gradually refines our estimation.</description>

      <title>Finding Near-Optimal Maximum Set of Disjoint $k$-Cliques in Real-World Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $k$-clique is a dense graph, consisting of $k$ fully-connected nodes, that finds numerous applications, such as community detection and network analysis. In this paper, we study a new problem, that finds a maximum set of disjoint $k$-cliques in a given large real-world graph with a user-defined fixed number $k$, which can contribute to a good performance of teaming collaborative events in online games. However, this problem is NP-hard when $k \geq 3$, making it difficult to solve. To address that, we propose an efficient lightweight method that avoids significant overheads and achieves a $k$-approximation to the optimal, which is equipped with several optimization techniques, including the ordering method, degree estimation in the clique graph, and a lightweight implementation. Besides, to handle dynamic graphs that are widely seen in real-world social networks, we devise an efficient indexing method with careful swapping operations, leading to the efficient maintenance of a near-optimal result with frequent updates in the graph. In various experiments on several large graphs, our proposed approaches significantly outperform the competitors by up to 2 orders of magnitude in running time and 13.3\% in the number of computed disjoint $k$-cliques, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approaches in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Ineffectiveness for Search and Undecidability of PCSP Meta-Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an open question whether the search and decision versions of promise CSPs are equivalent. Most known algorithms for PCSPs solve only their \emph{decision} variant, and it is unknown whether they can be adapted to solve \emph{search} as well. The main approaches, called BLP, AIP and BLP+AIP, handle a PCSP by finding a solution to a relaxation of some integer program. We prove that rounding those solutions to a proper search certificate can be as hard as any problem in the class TFNP. In other words, these algorithms are ineffective for search. Building on the algebraic approach to PCSPs, we find sufficient conditions that imply ineffectiveness for search. Our tools are tailored to algorithms that are characterized by minions in a suitable way, and can also be used to prove undecidability results for meta-problems. This way, we show that the families of templates solvable via BLP, AIP, and BLP+AIP are undecidable.
  Using the same techniques we also analyze several algebraic conditions that are known to guarantee the tractability of finite-template CSPs. We prove that several meta-problems related to cyclic polymorphims and WNUs are undecidable for PCSPs. In particular, there is no algorithm deciding whether a finite PCSP template (1) admits cyclic a polymorphism, (2) admits a WNU.</description>
