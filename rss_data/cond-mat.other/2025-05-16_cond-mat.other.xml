      <title>Emergent chirality and enantiomeric selectivity in layered NbOX$_2$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of chirality in crystalline solids has profound implications for electronic, optical, and topological properties, making the control of chiral phases a central challenge in materials design. Here, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of a new family of layered compounds, $\mathrm{NbOX_2}$, and explore the connection between their achiral $I m m m$ phase and chiral $C 2$ phase. Through first-principles calculations, we identify an intermediate achiral $C 2/m$ phase that bridges the high- and low-symmetry phases within a three-dimensional order parameter space. The insulating $C 2$ phase exhibits unique electronic properties, including flat Niobium $d$-orbital bands near the Fermi level associated with an obstructed atomic limit (OAL), hosting topologically non-trivial surface states under specific cleavage conditions. By analyzing the Born-Oppenheimer energy surfaces (BOES), we find that the shallow energy minima of the $C 2$ phase suggest that the intermediate $C 2/m$ phase may be stabilized either by ionic quantum or thermal fluctuations, and the consequent lattice anharmonicity, or by external factors such as pressure. Additionally, we show how an external electric field, by breaking the necessary symmetries, biases the system toward a preferred chirality by lifting the energy degeneracy between the two enantiomers. This, combined with the small energy barrier between the enantiomers in the $C 2$ phase, enables handedness control and allows us to propose a mechanism for selective handedness stabilization by leveraging electric fields and temperature-dependent anharmonic effects. Our findings establish a framework for understanding chirality emergence in layered materials and offer a pathway for designing systems with tunable enantiomeric populations.</description>

      <title>Topological photonics of generalized and nonlinear eigenvalue equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological photonics is developed based on the analogy of Schr\"{o}dinger equation which is mathematically reduced to a standard eigenvalue equation. Notably, several photonic systems are beyond the standard topological band theory as they are described by generalized or nonlinear eigenvalue equations. In this article, we review the topological band theory of this category. In the first part, we discuss topological photonics of generalized eigenvalue equations where the band structure may take complex values even when the involved matrices are Hermitian. These complex bands explain the characteristic dispersion relation of hyperbolic metamaterials. In addition, our numerical analysis predicts the emergence of symmetry-protected exceptional points in a photonic crystal composed of negative index media. In the second part, by introducing auxiliary bands, we establish the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence under ``weak" nonlinearity of eigenvalues. The nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence elucidates the robustness of chiral edge modes in photonic systems where the permittivity and permeability are frequency dependent.</description>

Abstract: The next generation of technology is rooted in quantum-based advancements. The entangled photon pair sources play a pivotal role in a wide range of advanced quantum applications, including quantum high precision sensors, communication, computing, cryptography and so on. Scalable on-chip quantum photonic devices have the potential to drive game changing developments in this field. This review article highlights recent breakthroughs in the generation of entangled photon pairs in two dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials, with a focus on their applicability to quantum technologies and plausible on-chip integration technology. The article begins by discussing the fundamental principles of entangled photon pairs generation. It provides a comprehensive review of the origin and generation of entangled photons in emerging vdW materials, alongside various optical quantum characterization techniques. The review then explores key physical parameters of the quantum states associated with entangled photon pairs. Additionally, it examines concepts related to the realization of paired photon generation at the quantum limit. The final section focuses on the potential for on-chip integrated quantum device applications. Beyond highlighting recent advancements in quantum-based research, the review also outlines current limitations and future prospects aimed at advancing the field</description>

      <title>Investigations of optical aberration on quantum diamond microscopy toward high spatial resolution and sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), which employs nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles, is a promising approach to quantitatively imaging magnetic fields with both high resolution that approaches the diffraction limit and a wide field of view. The commonly adopted setups of QDM capture the photoluminescence through transparent diamonds, which inevitably entail aberrations -- optical errors that degrade the optical resolution and contrast of the obtainable image. In this study, we delve into the impact of optical aberrations, focusing on their dependence on diamond thickness. We first introduce a rigorous model [Richards et al., Braat et al.] of diffraction that incorporates aberrations, producing the NV center optical image. We confirm that this model accurately reproduces the confocal images of single NV centers obtained at various depths in diamonds. Extending this model to a wide-field microscope, we find that the model also accurately reproduces the USAF 1951 resolution test chart obtained through diamonds of various thicknesses. Based on these investigations, we quantitatively assess the consequent resolution constraints and propose thinning the diamond as a viable solution. We present a robust method to quantitatively ascertain resolution in optical systems influenced by aberrations caused by ray transmission through diamonds. For instance, for a typical microscope with an objective lens of NA = 0.7, the diffraction limit is achievable through diamonds that are 30 {\mu}m thick, and a resolution of 1 {\mu}m is obtained through diamonds that are 100 {\mu}m thick. Those results opens up avenues for enhanced performance in QDM. The Julia package used to calculate the vectorial PSFs is available at VectorPSFs.jl.</description>
