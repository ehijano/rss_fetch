      <title>Dark forces suppress structure growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No experimental test precludes the possibility that the dark matter experiences forces beyond general relativity -- in fact, a variety of cosmic microwave background observations suggest greater late-time structure than predicted in the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model. We show that minimal models of scalar-mediated forces between dark matter particles do not enhance the growth of unbiased tracers of structure: weak lensing observables depend on the total density perturbation, for which the enhanced growth of the density contrast in the matter era is cancelled by the more rapid dilution of the background dark matter density. Moreover, the same background-level effects imply that scenarios compatible with CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies in fact suppress structure growth, as fixing the distance to last scattering requires a substantially increased density of dark energy. Though massive mediators undo these effects upon oscillating, they suppress structure even further because their gravitational impact as nonclustering subcomponents of matter outweighs the enhanced clustering strength of dark matter. We support these findings with analytic insight that clarifies the physical impact of dark forces and explains how primary CMB measurements calibrate the model's predictions for low-redshift observables. We discuss implications for neutrino mass limits and other cosmological anomalies, and we also consider how nonminimal extensions of the model might be engineered to enhance structure.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Thompson optical depth to the CMB from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first constraints on the electron optical depth to reionization, $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$, from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest alone for physically motivated reionization models that match the reionization's end-point, $z_{\rm{end}}$, required by the same astrophysical probe, and for symmetric reionization models with fixed duration, $\Delta z$, commonly adopted in CMB reionization analyses. Compared to traditional estimates from the latter, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest traces the ionization state of the IGM through its coupling with the thermal state. We find an explicit mapping between the two solving the chemistry and temperature evolution equations for hydrogen and helium. Our results yield $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=$0.042^{+0.047}_{-0.02}$ (95% C.L) and $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=$0.042^{+0.024}_{-0.015}$ for reionization models with $z_{\rm{end}}$ and $\Delta z$-fixed, respectively, disfavoring a high $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=0.09 by 2.57$\sigma$ and 4.31$\sigma$. With mock Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data that mimics the precision of future larger quasar sample datasets, we would potentially obtain tighter $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$ constraints and exclude such a high $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$ with a higher significance, paving the way for novel constraints on the epoch of reionization from a large-scale structure probe independent of the CMB.</description>

      <title>Inconsistencies of Tsallis Cosmology within Horizon Thermodynamics and Holographic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of Tsallis entropy in two widely discussed settings: the Cai-Kim thermodynamic derivation of the Friedmann equations and the holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario with the Hubble scale as infrared cutoff. In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter $\delta$, with standard $\Lambda$CDM recovered for $\delta=1$. Previous studies have argued that only small deviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically constraining $|1 - \delta| \lesssim 10^{-3}$. In this work we go further and present, for the first time, a systematic consistency analysis across the entire expansion history. We show that even mild departures from $\delta=1$ lead to pathological behavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density becomes negative or complex, its equation of state diverges, or alternatively it contributes an unacceptably large early-time fraction that spoils radiation domination and violates BBN and CMB bounds. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints of tension, providing a clear physical explanation in terms of corrections that grow uncontrollably with expansion rate toward the past. We conclude that, within both the Cai-Kim and HDE frameworks, viable cosmology is realized only in the extensive limit, effectively collapsing the models back to $\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings call attention to the importance of dynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests when assessing nonextensive entropies as possible explanations of the Universe's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Effects of Primordial Black Holes on IGM History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently the asteroid mass window (mass $\sim 10^{17}- 10^{21}$ grams) remains unconstrained for Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) to make up all of the dark matter content of the universe. Given these PBHs have very small masses, their Hawking temperature can be up to hundreds of keV. This study investigates the potential impacts of PBH Hawking radiation on the intergalactic medium from $z\sim 800-25$, namely studying the ionization history, kinetic gas temperature, and ultimately the 21 cm signature. We find that for masses on the low edge of the asteroid mass window, there are up two orders of magnitude increases in the ionization fraction and kinetic gas temperature by redshift 25, and the 21 cm spin temperature can differ from non-PBH cosmology by factors of a few. This analysis results in maximum differential brightness temperatures of +17 mK for our lightest PBH masses of $2.12\times 10^{16}$g. We also show maximal $53$ mK discrepancies in differential brightness temperatures between our PBH and non-PBH cosmologies for our lightest PBH mass, while our heaviest PBH mass of $1.65 \times 10^{17}$g shows only $0.5$ mK variations. We find the Hawking-radiated electrons and positrons are instrumental in driving these IGM modifications. This study shows the necessity for a rigorous treatment of Hawking radiation in PBH cosmological observables from the dark ages through cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>Faraday Depolarization Study of a Radio Galaxy Using LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey: Data Release 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed depolarization analysis of a radio galaxy ILTJ012215.21+254334.8, utilizing polarimetric data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 2 (DR2) catalogue. The selected source exhibits a rotation measure (RM) of ~ - 47 rad/m^2 and a projected linear size of 335 kpc at a redshift z ~ 0.05. Depolarization model fitting was performed on LOFAR High Band Antenna data (120 - 168 MHz), with fractional polarization detected at 3.0%. Five depolarization models were tested, and Bayesian qu-fitting revealed that the three-component model (1T+2ED) best describes the data, with a reduced chi-squared value of 2.12 and a logarithmic Bayesian evidence of 1384.82. This model includes a Faraday-thin component at RM ~ - 0.3 rad/m^2 (instrumental leakage) and two external Faraday dispersion astrophysical emission at RM ~ - 47 rad/m^2. The results demonstrate that depolarization in low-frequency radio galaxies requires multi-component modelling and is driven by turbulence and inhomogeneity in the magneto-ionic medium. Our findings highlight the potential of LOFAR polarization studies for probing galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields with high precision.</description>

      <title>Dark-to-black super accretion as a mechanism for early supermassive black hole growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of supermassive black holes with masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$ challenges conventional formation scenarios based on baryonic accretion and mergers within the first few hundred million years. We propose an alternative channel in which ultralight scalar dark matter undergoes dark-to-black conversion via quasi-bound state depletion around black hole seeds. We estimate the accretion rate of the scalar field as a function of the boson mass parameter $\mu$ and the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$, and integrate this rate over cosmological timescales. Our results show that once a critical value of $\mu M_{\rm BH}$ is reached, scalar field accretion becomes highly efficient, enabling substantial black hole growth even from relatively small initial seed masses. For boson masses $\mu \sim 10^{-19}-10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$, black hole seeds of $10^2-10^5 M_\odot$ can reach $10^6-10^8 M_\odot$ within $\sim 10^8$ yr. This dark-to-black mechanism provides a natural pathway for the rapid formation of massive black holes in the early universe, offering a potential probe of the microphysical nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Impact of projection-induced optical selection bias on the weak lensing mass calibration of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing signals of optically identified clusters are impacted by a selection bias -- halo triaxiality and large-scale structure along the line of sight simultaneously boost the lensing signal and richness (the inferred number of galaxies associated with a cluster). As a result, a cluster sample selected by richness has a mean lensing signal higher than expected from its mean mass, and the inferred mass will be biased high. This selection bias is currently limiting the accuracy of cosmological parameters derived from optical clusters. In this paper, we quantify the bias in mass calibration due to this selection bias. Using two simulations, MiniUchuu and Cardinal, with different galaxy models and cluster finders, we find that the selection bias leads to an overestimation of lensing mass at a 20-50% level, with a larger bias 20-80% for large-scale lensing (&gt;3 Mpc). Even with a conservative projection model, the impact of selection bias significantly outweighs the impact of other currently known cluster lensing systematics. We urge the cluster community to account for this bias in all future optical cluster cosmology analyses, and we discuss strategies for mitigating this bias.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of 21 cm HI signal: detection prospects at z ~ 1 with uGMRT in galaxy cluster lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic hydrogen HI content of galaxies is intimately related to star formation and galaxy evolution through the baryon cycle, which involves processes such as accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. While probing the HI gas over cosmic time has improved our understanding, direct HI detection is essentially limited to $z \lesssim 0.42$ due to the faintness of the 21cm line. Detections beyond this redshift have made use of the stacking technique to obtain average quantities of galaxy populations. Gravitational lensing by the cluster lenses enhances the HI signal and can extend the redshift limit further. In this work, we describe simulations of HI lensing in cluster lenses. We explore the feasibility of detecting strongly lensed HI emission from background galaxies using known 50 cluster lenses within the uGMRT sky coverage. We demonstrate that certain clusters offer a strong likelihood of HI detection. We also investigate how strong lensing distorts the HI spectral line profile. The shape of the HI signal in these lensing models provides useful information and can be used in optimising signal extraction in blind and targeted HI surveys. We find that blind detection of HI signal from galaxies in the redshift range up to 1.58 requires more than a few hundred hours of observations of individual clusters with the uGMRT. Detection of HI emission in galaxies where strong lensing has been observed in the optical appears to be more promising with potential for a $5\sigma$ detection in $&lt;50$ hours of on-source observations for Abell 370 and in $&lt;75$ hours for Abell 1703 with the uGMRT.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Cosmological Tensions with the Hadrosymmetric Twin Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hadrosymmetric Twin Higgs (HTH) model provides a natural solution to the little hierarchy problem by incorporating all three generations of quarks in a twin sector. Unlike other Twin Higgs scenarios, such as the Mirror Twin Higgs (MTH), the HTH framework avoids introducing additional light states or radiation and thus remains consistent with stringent bounds on the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Its particle content and interactions also make it difficult to probe at colliders, highlighting the importance of cosmological tests. In this work, we study the cosmological implications of the HTH model, focusing on the persistent tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($\sigma_8$). Implementing the HTH sector in a Boltzmann code and confronting it with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and local $H_0$ measurements, we find that the scenario reduces the Hubble tension from more than $4\sigma$ to about $2.5\sigma$, while also alleviating the $\sigma_8$ discrepancy. These results demonstrate that the HTH framework not only addresses naturalness in particle physics but also offers a viable route to mitigating current cosmological tensions, thereby strengthening the link between fundamental theory and precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves sourced by Gauge Fields during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inflationary gravitational wave background induced by Abelian gauge fields generated by non-minimal kinetic and axial couplings to the inflaton. We show that the gravitational wave spectrum is scale invariant and derive its amplitude for generic gauge field coupling parameters, within the slow-roll approximation. We constrain the coupling values and the scale of inflation for which the induced gravitational wave background is observable, while ensuring that back-reaction on the inflationary dynamics remains negligible. We find that a sizeable axial coupling can boost this secondary gravitational wave signal above the standard inflationary background. In the course of our analysis, we also show how to analytically match tensor perturbations across an arbitrary number of eras with different equations of state.</description>

      <title>The Clustering of Active Galactic Nuclei and Star Forming Galaxies in the LoTSS DeepFields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using deep observations across three of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields, this work measures the angular clustering of star forming galaxies (SFGs) and low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) to $z$$\lesssim$1.5 for faint sources, $S_{\textrm{144 MHz}}$$\geq$200 $\mu$Jy. We measure the angular auto-correlation of LOFAR sources in redshift bins and their cross-correlation with multi-wavelength sources {to} measure the evolving galaxy bias for SFGs and LERGs. Our work shows the bias of the radio-selected SFGs increases from $b=0.90^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ at $z \sim 0.2$ to $b = 2.94^{+0.36}_{-0.36}$ at $z \sim 1.2$; faster than the assumed $b(z)$$\propto$$1/D(z)$ models adopted in previous LOFAR cosmology studies (at sensitivities where AGN dominate), but in broad agreement with previous work. We further study the luminosity dependence of bias for SFGs and find little evidence for any luminosity dependence at fixed redshift, although uncertainties remain large for the sample sizes available. The LERG population instead shows a weaker redshift evolution with $b=2.33^{+0.28}_{-0.27}$ at $z \sim 0.7$ to $b=2.65^{+0.57}_{-0.55}$ at $z \sim 1.2$, though it is also consistent with the assumed bias evolution model ($b(z)$$\propto$$1/D(z)$) within the measured uncertainties. For those LERGs which reside in quiescent galaxies (QLERGs), there is weak evidence that they are more biased than the general LERG population and evolve from $b = 2.62^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$ at $z \sim 0.7$ to $b = 3.08^{+0.85}_{-0.84}$ at $z \sim 1.2$. This suggests the halo environment of radio sources may be related to their properties. These measurements can help constrain models for the bias evolution of these source populations, and can help inform multi-tracer analyses.</description>

      <title>CosmoUiT: A Vision Transformer-UNet Hybrid for Fast and Accurate Emulation of 21-cm Maps from the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the intergalactic medium will probe the epoch of reionization (EoR) with unprecedented detail. Various simulations are being developed and used to predict and understand the nature and morphology of this signal. However, these simulations are computationally very expensive and time-consuming to produce in large numbers. To overcome this problem, an efficient field-level emulator of this signal is required. However, the EoR 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian; therefore, capturing the correlations between different scales of this signal, which is directly related to the evolution of the reionization, with the neural network is quite difficult. Here, we introduce CosmoUiT, a UNet integrated vision transformer-based architecture, to overcome these difficulties. CosmoUiT emulates the 3D cubes of 21-cm signal from the EoR, for a given input dark matter density field, halo density field, and reionization parameters. CosmoUiT uses the multi-head self-attention mechanism of the transformer to capture the long-range dependencies and convolutional layers in the UNet to capture the small-scale variations in the target 21-cm field. Furthermore, the training of the emulator is conditioned on the input reionization parameters such that it gives a fast and accurate prediction of the 21-cm field for different sets of input reionization parameters. We evaluate the predictions of our emulator by comparing various statistics (e.g., bubble size distribution, power spectrum) and morphological features of the emulated and simulated maps. We further demonstrate that this vision transformer-based architecture can emulate the entire 3D 21-cm signal cube with high accuracy at both large and small scales.</description>

      <title>KiDS-1000 cosmic shear reanalysis using MetaCalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of cosmic shear studies have reported results that are in mild tension with the Planck cosmic microwave measurement. To explore if this can be caused by biases in the shear estimation, we revisit the analysis of data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) using an alternative shape measurement pipeline that is more robust to uncertainties in the calibration. To this end, we present an implementation of MetaCalibration, and compare its performance to that of lensfit, which has been used in previous analyses of these data. We find that the multiplicative bias is reduced, especially for the most distant redshifts, as derived from multi-band image simulations designed to match the KiDS data (SURFS-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations: SKiLLS). For all tomographic bins we obtain a multiplicative bias $|m|&lt;0.017$, with negligible additive bias. Importantly, the calibration has a negligible sensitivity to key galaxy properties. The resulting robust shear estimates were used to obtain cosmological parameter constraints. We find that the parameter $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3} =0.789_{-0.024}^{+0.020}$ is consistent with the previous KiDS-1000 lensfit constraint of $S_8=0.776^{+0.029 +0.002}_{-0.027-0.003}$ (statistical + systematic errors). Thanks to the higher effective source density, the constraining power is improved by about 28%. The difference in $S_8$ with the Planck value remains at a similar level, 1.8$\sigma$, implying that it is not caused by the shear measurements.</description>

Abstract: Effective field theories offer a powerful method to unify diverse models under a small set of control parameters, allowing systematic expansions around well-established theories. These techniques, developed in particle physics, were designed for experiments where the initial state - the vacuum before a scattering event - is as clean and isolated as possible. Besides colliders, realistic environments are often noisy and dissipative. The recognition of the limitations of traditional EFT techniques has, over the past decade, sparked intense progress at the interface of high-energy physics and condensed matter. These considerations motivate a new approach to gravitation and cosmology, one that models the gravitational sector as evolving in the presence of an unobservable medium. Open Effective Field Theories provide a systematic and controllable field-theoretic framework for modeling dissipation and noise in gravitation and cosmology. These notes aim to introduce this versatile toolkit, enabling model-agnostic assessments of how unknown environments shape our observational probes.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Pop III.1 Protostars Powered by Dark Matter Annihilation. II. Dependence on WIMP Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid appearance of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z\gtrsim7$ requires efficient pathways to form massive black hole seeds. We investigate whether annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can alter primordial (Pop III.1) protostellar evolution sufficiently to enable formation of such `heavy'' seeds. Using the one-dimensional Geneva stellar-evolution code (GENEC) with an implemented Gould single-scatter capture module, we compute a grid of protostellar evolution models covering ambient WIMP mass densities $\rho_\chi=10^{12}$-$10^{16}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$, WIMP masses $m_\chi=30$-$3000\ \mathrm{GeV}$, spin-dependent cross sections $\sigma_{\rm SD}=10^{-42}$-$10^{-40}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$, and baryonic accretion rates $\dot{M_*}=(1-3)\times10^{-3}\, M_\odot \,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. We find a robust bifurcation of outcomes. For sufficiently high ambient dark matter density ($\rho_\chi\gtrsim5\times10^{14}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$) and capture efficiency ($\sigma_{\rm SD}\gtrsim10^{-41}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$) WIMP annihilation supplies enough energy to inflate protostars onto extended, cool (Hayashi-track) configurations that dramatically suppress ionizing feedback and permit uninterrupted growth to $\sim10^{5}\,M_\odot$. Lighter WIMPs and larger $\sigma_{\rm SD}$ favour earlier and stronger annihilation support; heavier WIMPs delay the effect. For our fiducial case, WIMP masses $&lt;$3 TeV are essential for allowing growth to the supermassive regime, otherwise the protostar evolves to the compact, feedback-limited regime that results in `light'' seeds. These results indicate that, under plausible halo conditions, DM annihilation provides a viable channel for forming heavy black hole seeds.</description>

      <title>ELENA: a software for fast and precise computation of first order phase transitions and gravitational waves production in particle physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ELENA (EvaLuator of tunnElliNg Actions), an open-source Python package designed to compute the full evolution of first-order phase transitions in the early Universe generated by particle physics models, taking into account several refinements that go beyond commonly assumed simplifications. The core of ELENA is based on a vectorized implementation of the tunnelling potential formalism, which allows for a fast computation of the finite-temperature tunnelling action. This, in turn, enables the sampling of the full range of temperatures where two phases coexist and the use of integral expressions that track the complete evolution of the transition, providing a comprehensive picture of it. In addition, ELENA provides all the tools to compute the resulting stochastic gravitational waves spectrum, allowing for the full chain of computations - from the Lagrangian parameter inputs to the final gravitational waves spectrum - in a fast and self-contained implementation.</description>

      <title>Modified cosmology through generalized mass-to-horizon entropy: implications for structure growth and primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of entropic cosmology, entropic forces arising at the cosmological horizon have been proposed as an alternative mechanism to explain the Universe's current accelerated phase. However, recent studies have shown that, under the Clausius relation and assuming a linear mass-to-horizon (MHR) relation, all entropic force models reduce to the original Bekenstein-Hawking formulation, regardless of the specific form of the horizon entropy. As a result, they inherit the same observational limitations in accounting for cosmic dynamics. To address this issue, a generalized MHR has been introduced, providing the foundation for a modified cosmological scenario rooted in the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture. In this work, we explore the implications of this generalized framework for early-Universe dynamics. Specifically, we analyze the growth of matter perturbations within the spherical Top-Hat formalism in the linear regime, showing that the density contrast profile is significantly influenced by the modified background dynamics predicted by the model. Moreover, considering the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors in the sub-$10^3\,\mathrm{Hz}$ range, we examine the impact on the relic abundance of Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs), identifying parameter regions where deviations from standard cosmology may arise through an enhanced PGW spectrum.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Schwarzschild solutions in $f(R)$ gravity and their observable effects on the photon sphere of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate asymptotic Schwarzschild exterior solutions in the context of modified gravity theories, specifically within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, where the asymptotic behavior recovers the standard Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity. Unlike previous studies that rely mainly on analytical approximations, our approach combines asymptotic analysis with numerical integration of the underlying differential equations. Using these solutions, we analyze strong lensing effects to obtain the photon sphere radius and the corresponding capture parameter. Considering rings produced by total reflection, we define the photon sphere width as the difference between the first total reflection and the capture parameter; and study how it is modified in the $f(R)$ scenario. Our results show that the photon sphere width increases in the presence of $f(R)$-type modifications, indicating deviations from GR that could be observable in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Observable Rates of Gravitationally Lensed Supernovae for the PASSAGES Dusty Starbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than 60 years have passed since the first formal suggestion to use strongly-lensed supernovae to measure the expansion rate of the Universe through time-delay cosmography. Yet, fewer than 10 such objects have ever been discovered. We consider the merits of a targeted strategy focused on lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxies -- among the most rapidly star-forming galaxies known in the Universe. With star formation rates (SFRs) $\sim {200 - 6000}~\textrm{M}_\odot~\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, the $\sim 30$ objects in the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts (PASSAGES) are excellent candidates for a case study, in particular, and have already led to the discovery of the multiply-imaged SN H0pe. Considering their lens model-corrected SFRs, we estimate their intrinsic supernova rates to be an extraordinary ${1.8 - 65}~\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (core-collapse) and ${0.2 - 6.4}~\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (Type Ia). Moreover, these massive starbursts typically have star-forming companions which are unaccounted for in this tally. We demonstrate a strong correlation between Einstein radius and typical time delays, with cluster lenses often exceeding several months (and therefore most favorable for high-precision $H_0$ inferences). A multi-visit monitoring campaign with a sensitive infrared telescope (namely, JWST) is necessary to mitigate dust attenuation. Still, a porous interstellar medium and clumpy star formation in these extreme galaxies might produce favorable conditions for detecting supernovae as transient point sources. Targeted campaigns of known lensed galaxies to discover new lensed supernovae can greatly complement wide-area cadenced surveys. Increasing the sample size helps to realize the potential of supernova time-delay cosmography to elucidate the Hubble tension through a single-step measurement, independent of other $H_0$ techniques.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy dark matter dynamical friction: Defying galactic cannibalism of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new implementation of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) dynamical friction within the galpy framework, enabling orbital integrations of globular clusters (GCs) across a broad range of halo-to-GC mass ratios and boson masses. In this alternative DM scenario, dynamical friction is reduced or even suppressed by heating induced by FDM density granules. We further quantify the role of baryons and solitonic cores, natural consequences of FDM in galaxies, on the efficiency of orbital decay and the long-term survival of GCs. The most significant deviations from the cold DM (CDM) paradigm arise in the dwarf-galaxy regime, where FDM dynamical friction can stall the inspiral of GCs over a Hubble time, thereby preventing their sinking into galactic centers and halting the canonical galactic cannibalism of clusters. Importantly, our FDM-only friction model should be regarded as a conservative lower bound, since the inclusion of realistic FDM cores can only strengthen the survival of GCs through core stalling. This stalling mechanism not only preserves in-situ populations that would otherwise be erased in CDM, but also strongly suppresses the mixing of in-situ and ex-situ clusters, yielding a bimodal radial distribution of GCs. Our results show that the demographics of GC systems encode a distinct dynamical signature of FDM in dwarfs. These predictions open a new pathway to constrain the boson mass parameter with upcoming Euclid DR1 observations of extragalactic GCs, while simultaneously offering a natural explanation for the long-standing Fornax timing problem.</description>

      <title>The causal structure of galactic astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven astrophysics currently relies on the detection and characterisation of correlations between objects' properties, which are then used to test physical theories that make predictions for them. This process fails to utilise information in the data that forms a crucial part of the theories' predictions, namely which variables are directly correlated (as opposed to accidentally correlated through others), the directions of these determinations, and the presence or absence of confounders that correlate variables in the dataset but are themselves absent from it. We propose to recover this information through causal discovery, a well-developed methodology for inferring the causal structure of datasets that is however almost entirely unknown to astrophysics. We develop a causal discovery algorithm suitable for astrophysical datasets and illustrate it on $\sim$5$\times10^5$ low-redshift galaxies from the Nasa Sloan Atlas, demonstrating its ability to distinguish physical mechanisms that are degenerate on the basis of correlations alone.</description>

      <title>Slaying Axion-Like Particles via Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes from Supercooled Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from density fluctuations due to supercooled phase transitions (PTs) triggered in an axion-like particle (ALP) model. We find that the mass of the PBHs is inversely correlated with the ALP decay constant $f_a$. For instance, for $f_a$ varying from ${\cal O}$(100 MeV) to ${\cal O}$($10^{12}$ GeV), the PBH mass varies between $(10^{3} - 10^{-24}) M_{\odot}$. We then identify the ALP parameter space where the PBH can account for the entire (or partial) dark matter fraction of the Universe, in a single (multi-component) dark matter scenario, with the ALP being the other dark matter candidate. The PBH parameter space ruled out by current cosmological and microlensing observations can thus be directly mapped onto the ALP parameter space, thus providing new bounds on ALPs, complementary to the laboratory and astrophysical ALP constraints. Similarly, depending on the ALP couplings to other Standard Model particles, the ALP constraints on $f_a$ can be translated into a lower bound on the PBH mass scale. Moreover, the supercooled PT leads to a potentially observable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal at future GW observatories, such as aLIGO, LISA and ET, that acts as another complementary probe of the ALPs, as well as of the PBH dark matter. Finally, we show that the recent NANOGrav signal of stochastic GW in the nHz frequency range can be explained in our model with $f_a\simeq (10~{\rm GeV}-1~{\rm TeV})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) we study the core formation in the presence of an Ideal Gas (IG). Our analysis is based on the solution of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson-Euler system of equations that drives the evolution of FDM together with a compressible IG, both coupled through the gravitational potential they produce. Starting from random initial conditions for both FDM and IG, we study the evolution of the system until it forms a nearly relaxed, virialized and close to hydrostatic equilibrium core, surrounded by an envelope of the two components. We find that the core corresponds to Newtonian Fermion-Boson Stars (FBS). If the IG is used to model luminous matter, our results indicate that FBS behave as attractor core solutions of structure formation of FDM along with visible matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing perturbations have a non-negligible impact on strong lensing observables, and several degeneracies exist between the properties of the main lens, line of sight, and cosmology. In this work, we consider the impact of the line of sight on double-source-plane lenses (DSPLs), a rare class of lens systems in which two sources at different redshifts are lensed by the same foreground galaxy, and which enable competitive constraints on the dark energy equation of state. Generating and sampling statistically representative lines of sight from N-body simulations, we show that line-of-sight perturbations add a $\sim1\%$ uncertainty to measurements of the cosmological scaling factor $\eta$ (a ratio of angular diameter distance ratios), which is subdominant but non-negligible compared to the measurement error. We also show that the line-of-sight shear experienced by images of the two sources can differ significantly in both magnitude and direction. Including a line-of-sight error budget, we measure $w=-1.17^{+0.19}_{-0.21}$ from the Jackpot DSPL in combination with Planck. We show that the line of sight is expected to introduce an additional scatter in the constraints possible with a larger sample of DSPLs from Euclid, but that this scatter is subdominant compared to other sources of error.</description>

      <title>Learning the Universe: Learning to Optimize Cosmic Initial Conditions with Non-Differentiable Structure Formation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making the most of next-generation galaxy clustering surveys requires overcoming challenges in complex, non-linear modelling to access the significant amount of information at smaller cosmological scales. Field-level inference has provided a unique opportunity beyond summary statistics to use all of the information of the galaxy distribution. However, addressing current challenges often necessitates numerical modelling that incorporates non-differentiable components, hindering the use of efficient gradient-based inference methods. In this paper, we introduce Learning the Universe by Learning to Optimize (LULO), a gradient-free framework for reconstructing the 3D cosmic initial conditions. Our approach advances deep learning to train an optimization algorithm capable of fitting state-of-the-art non-differentiable simulators to data at the field level. Importantly, the neural optimizer solely acts as a search engine in an iterative scheme, always maintaining full physics simulations in the loop, ensuring scalability and reliability. We demonstrate the method by accurately reconstructing initial conditions from $M_{200\mathrm{c}}$ halos identified in a dark matter-only $N$-body simulation with a spherical overdensity algorithm. The derived dark matter and halo overdensity fields exhibit $\geq80\%$ cross-correlation with the ground truth into the non-linear regime $k \sim 1h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Additional cosmological tests reveal accurate recovery of the power spectra, bispectra, halo mass function, and velocities. With this work, we demonstrate a promising path forward to non-linear field-level inference surpassing the requirement of a differentiable physics model.</description>

      <title>Structure Formation under Inelastic Two-Component Dark Matter: Halo Statistics and Matter Power Spectra in the High-$z$ Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present hydrodynamic simulations of a flavour-mixed two-component dark matter (2cDM) model that utilize IllustrisTNG baryonic physics. The model parameters are explored for two sets of power laws of the velocity-dependent cross sections, favoured on the basis of previous studies. The model is shown to suppress the formation of structures at scales $k\gtrsim 10^2\ h\text{ Mpc}^{-1}$ up to 40\% compared to cold dark matter (CDM) at redshifts $z\sim5-2$. We compare our results to structure enhancement and suppression due to cosmological and astrophysical parameters presented in the literature and find that 2cDM effects remain relevant at galactic and subgalactic scales. The results indicate the robustness of the role of nongravitational dark matter interactions in structure formation and the absence of putative degeneracies introduced by baryonic feedback at high $z$. The predictions made can be further tested with future Ly-$\alpha$ forest observations.</description>

      <title>Increase of $n_s$ in regularized pole inflation &amp; Einstein-Cartan gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the regularization of the second order pole in the pole inflation can induce the increase of $n_s$, which may be important after the latest data release of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Pole inflation is known to provide a unified description of attractor models that they can generate a flat plateau for inflation given a general potential. Recent ACT observation suggests that the constraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ at CMB scale may be shifted to a larger value than the predictions in the Starobinsky model, the Higgs inflation, and the $\alpha$-attractor model, which motivates us to consider the modification of the pole inflation. We find that if we regularize the second order pole in the kinetic term such that the kinetic term becomes regular for all field range, we can generally increase $n_s$ because the potential in the large field regime will be lifted. We have explicitly demonstrated that this type of regularized pole inflation can naturally arise from the Einstein-Cartan formalism, and the inflationary predictions are consistent with the latest ACT data without spoiling the success of the $\alpha$-attractor models.</description>

      <title>Toward mapping turbulence in the intracluster medium IV. Using NewAthena/X-IFU and simulation based inference to constrain turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The NewAthena mission planned for launch in the late 2030s will carry X-IFU, an integral field unit spectrometer that will obtain unique insight into the X-ray hot universe through its combination of spectral and spatial capabilities. Its high spectral resolution will allow a mapping of turbulent velocities of the hot gas in galaxy clusters, providing an unrivaled way to study the complex dynamics within galaxy clusters. Aims. This is the fourth in a series of papers aimed at forecasting the ability to investigate turbulence in the intracluster medium through the observation of the centroid shift caused by turbulent motions of the gas. In this paper we improve on previous methods by investigating the ability of simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the underlying nature of velocity fluctuations through the use of standard observational diagnostics, such as the structure function. Methods. We rely on a complex architecture of neural networks in order to model the likelihood and posterior distributions relevant to our case. We investigate its capability to retrieve the turbulence parameters on mock observations, and explore its capability to use alternative summary statistics. Results. Our trained models are able to infer the parameters of the intracluster gas velocity power-spectrum in independently simulated X-IFU observations of a galaxy cluster. We evaluated the precision of the recovery for different models. We show the necessity to use methods such as SBI to avoid an under-estimation of the sources of variance by comparing the results to our previous paper. We confirm that sample variance severely impacts the precision of recovered turbulent features. Our results demonstrate the need for advanced modeling methods to tackle the complexity of the physical information nested within future observations expected from X-IFU/NewAthena.</description>

      <title>Cosmography with DESI DR2 and SN data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a kinematic analysis of the Universe's expansion history using cosmography, with a particular emphasis on the jerk parameter $j_0$, which is equal to one in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario. We use distance measurements from DESI DR2, both independently and in combination with current Type Ia supernova (SN) samples, to constrain the cosmographic parameters up to the fourth order without relying on a specific cosmological model. Our results show that for the DESI DR2 data alone, the $\Lambda$CDM prediction ($j_0 = 1$) falls within the 2$\sigma$ confidence region. However, when DESI DR2 is combined with the Union3, Pantheon+, and DESY5 SN datasets, the result obtained is discrepant with the $\Lambda$CDM model at about 3.4$\sigma$, 4.1$\sigma$, and 5.4$\sigma$, respectively. These results are consistent with the conclusions based on dark energy parameterizations reported by the DESI Collaboration, which suggest the presence of a dynamic dark energy component in the universe.</description>

      <title>DARKSKIES: A suite of super-sampled zoom-in simulations of galaxy clusters with self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the "DARKSKIES" suite of one hundred, zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of massive ($M_{200}&gt;5\times10^{14}{\rm M}_\odot)$ galaxy clusters with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We super-sample the simulations such that $m_{\rm DM}/m_{\rm gas}\sim0.1$, enabling us to simulate a dark matter particle mass of $m=0.68\times10^{8}M_\odot$ an order of magnitude faster, whilst exploring SIDM in the core of clusters at extremely high resolution. We calibrate the baryonic feedback to produce observationally consistent and realistic galaxy clusters across all simulations and simulate five models of velocity-independent SIDM targeting the expected sensitivity of future telescopes - $\sigma_{\rm DM}/m=0.,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$ cm$^2$/g. We find the density profiles exhibit the characteristic core even in the smallest of cross-sections, with cores developing only at late times ($z&lt;0.5$). We investigate the dynamics of the brightest cluster galaxy inside the dark matter halo and find in SIDM cosmologies there exists a so-called wobbling not observed in collisionless dark matter. We find this wobble is driven by accreting mass on to a cored density profile with the signal peaking at $z=0.25$ and dropping thereafter. This finding is further supported by the existence of an anti-correlation between the offset between the BCG and the dark matter halo and its relative velocity in SIDM only, a hallmark of harmonic oscillation.</description>

      <title>Tests of Evolving Dark Energy with Geometric Probes of the Late-Time Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have shown a strong statistical preference for a time-evolving dark energy model over $\Lambda$CDM when combining BAO, CMB, and supernova (SN) data. We investigate the robustness of this conclusion by isolating geometric information in weak lensing measurements from the DES Year 3 survey and combining it with different datasets. We introduce a hyperparameter, $\Omega_{\rm m}^{\rm growth}$, to decouple the growth contribution from the lensing 2-point correlation and thus bypass the possible effect of the $\sigma_8$ tension in our analysis. We then combine with the late-time geometric probes provided by BAO and SN, along with CMB primary data. The preference for evolving dark energy is consistent with the DESI-DR2 findings: when combining BAO, primary CMB, and weak lensing data, the $w_0w_a$CDM is preferred at about the $3\sigma$ significance. However, when we add SN, the result is sensitive to the choice of data: if we leave out $z&lt;0.1$ SN data in the analysis, as a test of the effect of inhomogeneous calibration, we obtain a statistical significance below $2\sigma$ for time evolving dark energy. Indeed, the high-z only SN data \textbf{lowers} the evidence for evolving dark energy in all the data combinations we have examined. This underscores the importance of improved SN samples at low redshift and of alternative data combinations. We show that cosmic shear measurements with LSST Year 1 data will provide comparable power to current SN data. We discuss other low-redshift probes provided by lensing and galaxy clustering to test for evolving dark energy.</description>

Abstract: Nucleation rate computations are of broad importance in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used to compute the nucleation rate $\Gamma$, but these are incomplete. We perform nonperturbative lattice simulations of nucleation in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, computing a final result extrapolated to the thermodynamic and continuum limits. Although the system in question should be well-described by a complete one-loop perturbative calculation, we find only qualitative agreement with the full perturbative result, with a 20% discrepancy in $|\log \Gamma|$. Our result motivates further testing of the current nucleation paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study general properties of confinement phase transitions in the early universe. An observable gravitational wave signal from such transitions requires significant supercooling. However, in almost all understood examples of confining gauge theories the degree of supercooling is too small to give interesting gravitational wave signals. We review and highlight the evidence why supercooling is not generic in confining gauge theories. The exceptions are Randall-Sundrum models which define a strongly coupled gauge theory holographically by a 5D gravitational theory. We construct a simple illustrative model of a 4D gauge theory inspired by features of the Randall-Sundrum model. It is a large-$N$ gauge theory in the conformal window coupled to a weakly coupled scalar field which undergoes a supercooled phase transition that breaks the conformal symmetry and triggers confinement. We show that there are interesting features in the gravitational wave spectra that can carry the imprint of the confining gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Polarization-shape alignment of IllustrisTNG star-forming galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In star-forming disk galaxies, the radio continuum emission ($1$-$10\,$GHz) powered by star formation has an integrated polarization direction imperfectly aligned with the apparent disk minor axis. This polarization-shape alignment effect was previously observed in a small sample of local spirals. If this is prevalent for disk galaxies out to cosmological redshifts, novel measurements of cosmic birefringence and cosmic shear will be enabled by leveraging radio continuum surveys synergized with galaxy shape measurements. We calculate the polarization-shape misalignment angle for star-forming galaxies in the \texttt{IllustrisTNG50} simulation at $0 &lt; z &lt; 2$, assuming that additional polarized radio emission from an AGN is negligible. The alignment found for $z=0$ is consistent with local spiral data, but significantly deteriorates as redshift increases. Moreover, it degrades toward lower frequencies due to internal Faraday depolarization. Thanks to cosmic redshifting, observing higher-$z$ galaxies at a fixed frequency greatly mitigates degradation due to reduced Faraday depolarization at the source-frame frequency. We present analytic fits to the non-Gaussian misalignment angle distribution, and evaluate Fisher information per galaxy for measuring cosmic birefringence. For observation at 4.8 GHz, the effective RMS misalignment angle $\sigma_{\alpha,{\rm eff}}$ is $18^\circ$, $23^\circ$ and $33^\circ$ at $z=0$, $1$ and $2$, respectively. Analyzing $N$ independent galaxies reduces the uncertainty on an isotropic cosmic birefringence signal to $\sigma_{\alpha,{\rm eff}}/\sqrt{N}$, providing competitive sensitivity once large samples are available. Our results motivate pilot observations to empirically characterize polarization-shape alignment, facilitate forecasts of cosmology and fundamental physics applications that exploit this effect.</description>

      <title>FLORAH-Tree: Emulating Dark Matter Halo Merger Trees with Graph Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Merger trees track the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos across cosmic time and serve as essential inputs for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. However, conventional methods for constructing merger trees rely on ad-hoc assumptions and are unable to incorporate environmental information. Nguyen et al. (2024) introduced FLORAH, a generative model based on recurrent neural networks and normalizing flows, for modeling main progenitor branches of merger trees. In this work, we extend this model, now referred to as FLORAH-Tree, to generate complete merger trees by representing them as graph structures that capture the full branching hierarchy. We trained FLORAH-Tree on merger trees extracted from the Very Small MultiDark Planck cosmological N-body simulation. To validate our approach, we compared the generated merger trees with both the original simulation data and with semi-analytic trees produced using the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. We show that FLORAH-Tree accurately reproduces key merger rate statistics across a wide range of mass and redshift, outperforming the conventional EPS-based approach. We demonstrate its utility by applying the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) to generated trees and showing that the resulting galaxy-halo scaling relations, such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation and supermassive black hole mass-halo mass relation, closely match those from applying the SAM to trees extracted directly from the simulation. FLORAH-Tree provides a computationally efficient method for generating merger trees that maintain the statistical fidelity of N-body simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</description>

      <title>Wide binaries in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy: discovery, population modeling, and a nail in the coffin of primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Bo\"{o}tes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff ($\sim0.1$ - $0.8~{\rm M_\odot}$). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that $1.25\pm0.25\%$ of Bo\"{o}tes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] $\approx -2.5$. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with $M \gtrsim 5~{\rm M_\odot}$ cannot constitute more than $\sim1\%$ of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.</description>
