      <title>Family of Multilayer Graphene Superconductors with Tunable Chirality: Momentum-Space Vortices Forged in the Berry-Ring of Fire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments in rhombohedrally-stacked multilayer graphene heterostructures have reported signatures of chiral superconductivity, emerging from a spin and valley-polarized normal state with broken time-reversal symmetry and an associated anomalous Hall effect. These findings bring into focus the role of the electronic Bloch wavefunction and the quantum geometric tensor in determining the superconducting pairing channel. In this work, we examine superconducting instabilities of a model of $N$-layer rhombohedral graphene that possesses an enhanced Berry curvature distribution on an extended ring in momentum space $-$ that we dub the 'Berry-ring of fire' $-$ in the presence of an isotropic attractive interaction with a parametrically controlled spatial range. We determine that local interactions favor a $N$-fold winding in the order parameter phase for odd-$N$ layered systems, with even-$N$ layers requiring a spatially extended attraction range to achieve pairing. For generic interaction lengths, we discover a family of chiral superconductors and, remarkably, momentum-space vortices nucleated on the Berry-ring of fire. The existence of these vortices can be traced to a momentum-space flux quantization condition involving the Berry curvature, with the phase winding dictated by a combination of the Berry flux and a 'statistical flux' to enforce Fermi-Dirac statistics. Such an order parameter structure allows for the possibility of in-situ tuning between various chiral superconducting phases through changes in the electron density or the displacement field. We discuss ways in which these predictions can be experimentally tested and potentially exploited in future devices.</description>

      <title>Robust and Symmetric Magnetic Field Dependency of Superconducting Diode Effect in Asymmetric Dirac Semimetal SQUIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent demonstration of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) has generated renewed interests in superconducting electronics in which devices such as compact superconducting diodes that can perform signal rectification where low-energy operations are needed. In this article, we present our results of robust and symmetric-in-magnetic-field SDE in asymmetric superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) realized in high-quality Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin film grown by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. Consistent with previous work, a zero magnetic field SDE is observed. Furthermore, the difference in switching current is independent of the strength and polarity of an out-plane magnetic field in the range of -10 mT and 10 mT. We speculate that this robust symmetric-in-field SDE in our Dirac semimetal SQUIDs is due to the formation of helical spin texture, theoretically predicted in Dirac semimetals.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality-Driven Anomalous Metallic State with Zero-field Nonreciprocal Transport in Layered Ising Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous metal state (AMS), observed in failed superconductors, provides insights into superconductivity and quantum criticality, with studies revealing unconventional quantum phases like the Bose metal. Recently, layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors approaching the two-dimensional limit have garnered significant attention for the enhanced phase fluctuations and electronic correlations. Investigating AMS in these systems, particularly in the absence of an external magnetic field, could offer valuable insights into the dimensionality-driven emergence of exotic quantum phenomena, including triplet Cooper pairing, phase fluctuation dynamics, and especially the recently discovered field-free superconducting diode effects. However, the field-free AMS has yet to be observed in TMD superconductors. Here, we report the dimensionality-tunable AMS near the superconducting quantum phase transitions in a layered TMD superconductor 2H-Ta2S3Se. In samples with thicknesses below 10 nm, we demonstrate magnetic field-driven AMS under external magnetic field, characterized by the vanishing of the Hall resistance and the presence of finite longitudinal resistance. Remarkably, an unexpected zero-field AMS emerges as the sample thickness is reduced to 3 nm. This AMS aligns well with the quantum vortex creep model and exhibits non-reciprocal transport behaviors, suggesting the onset of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking accompanied by vortex motion as the system approaches the two-dimensional limit. Our findings open new avenues for exploring dimensionality-driven exotic superconducting quantum critical phases, and pave the way for a deeper understanding of zero-field superconducting diode effects.</description>

      <title>Prediction and Synthesis of Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$: A Metallic Complex Transition Metal Hydride Stabilized at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-pressure stabilization of superconducting hydrides with high critical temperatures ($T_c$s) remains a significant challenge, and experimentally verified superconducting hydrides are generally constrained to a limited number of structural prototypes. Ternary transition-metal complex hydrides (hydrido complexes)-typically regarded as hydrogen storage materials-exhibit a large range of compounds stabilized at low pressure with recent predictions for high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Motivated by this class of materials, we investigated complex hydride formation in the Mg-Pt-H system, which has no known ternary hydride compounds. Guided by ab initio structural predictions, we successfully synthesized a novel complex transition-metal hydride, Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$, using laser-heated diamond anvil cells. The compound forms in a body-centered cubic structural prototype at moderate pressures between 8-25 GPa. Unlike the majority of known hydrido complexes, Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$ is metallic, with formal charge described as 4[Mg]$^{2+}$.3[PtH$_2$]$^{2-}$. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements obtained during decompression reveal that Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$ remains stable upon quenching to ambient conditions. Magnetic-field and temperature-dependent electrical transport measurements indicate ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c$ (50%) = 2.9 K, in reasonable agreement with theoretical calculations. These findings clarify the phase behavior in the Mg-Pt-H system and provide valuable insights for transition-metal complex hydrides as a new class of hydrogen-rich superconductors.</description>

      <title>Time-tagging data acquisition system for testing superconducting electronics based on an RFSoC and custom analog frontend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with over $50\,\mathrm{dB}$ of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency ($200\,\mathrm{MHz}$ vs. $80\,\mathrm{MHz}$) at roughly one seventh the cost.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Self-doped Molecular Mott Insulator for Bilayer High-Temperature Superconducting La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating correlation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we show that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit formed by the bonding band owing to Hubbard interaction $U$ and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott insulator becomes self-doped due to electrons transferred to the antibonding bands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott insulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We propose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to be a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose molecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The effects of Hund's coupling $J_H$ on the low-energy spectra are also studied via exact diagonalization. The proposed low-energy theory for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is found to be valid in a wide range of $U$ and $J_H$.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium introduce microwave losses that degrade the performance of superconducting resonators. While such losses have been extensively studied above 1~K, we report here their direct quantification in the millikelvin and low-photon regime relevant to quantum devices. Using a high-quality factor 3-D niobium cavity cooled through its superconducting transition in controlled magnetic fields, we isolate flux-induced losses and extract a sensitivity to trapped flux of approximately 2~n$\Omega$/mG at 10~mK and 6~GHz. The decay rate is initially dominated by two-level system (TLS) losses from the native niobium pentoxide, with vortex-induced degradation of $T_1$ occurring above $B_{\text{trap}}\sim$~50~mG. In the absence of the oxide, even 10~mG of trapped flux limits performance $Q_0\sim$~10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, underscoring the need for stringent magnetic shielding. The sensitivity decreases with temperature and remains largely field-independent, whereas the flux-induced frequency shift exhibits a minimum near 0.8~K. These behaviors are well modeled assuming the thermal activation of pinning centers within the Gittleman-Rosenblum framework. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits can tolerate vortex-induced dissipation at trapped field levels up to several hundred mG, but achieving long coherence times still requires careful magnetic shielding to suppress lower-field losses from other mechanisms.</description>
