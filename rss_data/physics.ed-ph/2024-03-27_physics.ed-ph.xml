      <title>Emission atomic spectra. Individualized computer simulations of laboratory work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the experience of developing and utilizing computer simulations for student laboratory assignments in atomic physics, specifically focusing on emission atomic spectra. The fundamental component of each laboratory assignment is a computer simulator of a spectrograph, which displays atomic line spectra on the monitor screen. The simulator operates by converting the wavelength of radiation into an RGB triplet. Calibration of the spectrograph is conducted using the atomic spectrum of mercury. The configuration of setup parameters and experimental conditions is unique to each student conducting the laboratory assignment using the simulator. Individualized parameters, stored in Google Sheets, are transferred to the HTML template of the laboratory assignment via the Google Apps Scripts service. This individualization of simulator parameters serves to encourage students to engage in independent work.</description>

      <title>From Computing to Quantum Mechanics: Accessible and Hands-On Quantum Computing Education for High School Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper outlines an alternative approach to teaching quantum computing at the high school level, tailored for students with limited prior knowledge in advanced mathematics and physics. This approach diverges from traditional methods by building upon foundational concepts in classical computing before gradually introducing quantum mechanics, thereby simplifying the entry into this complex field. The course was initially implemented in a program for gifted high school students under the Hong Kong Education Bureau and received encouraging feedback, indicating its potential effectiveness for a broader student audience. A key element of this approach is the practical application through portable NMR quantum computers, which provides students with hands-on experience. The paper describes the structure of the course, including the organization of the lectures, the integration of the hardware of the portable nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computers, the Gemini/Triangulum series, and detailed lecture notes in an appendix. The initial success in the specialized program and ongoing discussions to expand the course to regular high schools in Hong Kong and Shenzhen suggest the viability of this approach for wider educational application. By focusing on accessibility and student engagement, this approach presents a valuable perspective on introducing quantum computing concepts at the high school level, aiming to enhance student understanding and interest in the field.</description>
