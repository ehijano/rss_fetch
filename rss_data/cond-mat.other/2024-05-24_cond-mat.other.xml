      <title>Realization of Singular Topological Edge States in Locally Resonant Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate singular topological edge states in a locally resonant metamaterial with a configuration based on inversion-symmetric extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. Such states arise from a topological gap transition from a conventional Bragg-type gap (BG) to a local resonance-induced gap (LRG), accompanied by a topological phase transition. Remarkably, nontrivial topological states can emerge in the vicinity of the singularity in the imaginary parts of the wavenumber within the bandgap, leading to highly localized modes on a scale comparable to a single subwavelength unit cell. We experimentally demonstrate distinct differences in topologically protected modes-highlighted by wave localization-between the BG and the LRG in locally resonant granular-based metamaterials. Our findings suggest the scope of topological metamaterials may be extended via their bandgap nature.</description>

      <title>Geodesic nature and quantization of shift vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Xu et al. introduced the concept of an interband character for a time-dependent quantum system. This quantity is gauge invariant and quantized as integer values, analogous to the Euler characteristic based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a manifold with a smooth boundary. In this work, we find that the geometric shift vector in momentum space from shift currents in the bulk photovoltaic effect is equivalent to the quantum geometric potential and plays the role of geodesic curvature, that is, of a quantum system whose parameter space is the Bloch momentum. We reveal the intricate relationships among geometric quantities such as the shift vector, Berry curvature, and quantum metric. Additionally, we present the Wilson representation for the quantized interband character and extend our analysis to bosonic photon and phonon drag shift vectors with non-vertical transitions. The application of Wilson loop method facilitates first-principles calculations, providing insights into the geometric underpinnings of these interband gauge invariant quantities and shedding light on their nonlinear optical manifestations in real materials.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane magnetic phase diagram of Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate Na2Co2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic properties and mapped out the phase diagram of the honeycomb magnet Na2Co2TeO6 with Co 3d7 in out-of-plane magnetic fields. This material has previously been proposed to show nearest-neighbor Kitaev interactions between Co spins and maybe even Kitaev quantum spin liquid behavior in high fields. At low magnetic fields, we observe a thermal phase transition at TN = 27 K, transitioning from a paramagnetic state to a canonical ferrimagnetic state. Under the application of magnetic fields, a spin flop-like phase transition occurred before saturation of J = 1/2 between 10 K and TN. Below 10 K, a peak-dip-peak structure emerges between 10 and 17 T in the magnetic susceptibility (dM/dH) before the magnetic saturation, reminiscent of magnetic plateau behavior. The measurement of the magnetocaloric effect also shows dip-peak-dip behavior in this field range. Our data can be explained by an XXZ model with a single ion anisotropy and possibly small Kitaev and {\Gamma} exchange interactions. We also unambiguously determined the magnetization saturation field that helps constrain the energy scale of the exchange interactions</description>

      <title>Topological Weyl Altermagnetism in CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a novel, third fundamental class of collinear magnetic ordered materials, alongside with ferro- and antiferromagnets. They share with conventional antiferromagnets the feature of a vanishing net magnetization. At the same time they show a spin-splitting of electronic bands, just as in ferromagnets, caused by the atomic exchange interaction. Interestingly, the altermagnetic spin-splitting may in principle allow for topological electronic structures far beyond collinear antiferromagnets with spin-degenerate bands. Here, using high-resolution and spin angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe that the momentum-dependent spin-splitting in altermagnetic CrSb reaches up to 1 eV, while vanishing at high symmetry lines in the Brillouin zone. We find it causes spin-carrying altermagnetic Weyl points, and observe their protected Fermi-arc surface states. This establishes that in altermagnets the large energy scale intrinsic to the spin-splitting - orders of magnitude larger that the relativistic spin-orbit coupling - creates its own realm of robust electronic topology, with spin-polarized topological surface states that are altermagnetic.</description>

      <title>Conventional and novel anomalous velocities accounting for multiple energy bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07810v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous velocity of the magnetic Bloch state is known as the origin of the quantum Hall effect. The anomalous velocity has been derived so far based on the single-band approximation. In this paper, the anomalous velocity is derived accounting for multiple energy bands. It is shown that when multiple energy bands are considered, the anomalous velocity is actually derived from the velocity term which goes to zero under the single-band approximation. It is also shown that the anomalous velocity based on the single-band approximation is derived improperly from the velocity term which becomes zero in considering multiple energy bands. Furthermore, it is found that novel types of anomalous velocity may appear in addition to the conventional anomalous velocity. These novel anomalous velocities are perpendicular to the electric field and come from the singularity of the magnetic Bloch function in the magnetic Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Programmable XY-type couplings through parallel spin-dependent forces on the same trapped ion motional modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an analog scheme for generating XY-type ($J_{ij}^x \sigma_x^i \sigma_x^j \;$ + $J_{ij}^y \sigma_y^i \sigma_y^j \;$) Hamiltonians on trapped ion spins with independent control over the $J_{ij}^x$ and $J_{ij}^y$ terms. The Ising-type interactions $\sigma_x^i \sigma_x^j \;$ and $\sigma_y^i \sigma_y^j \;$ are simultaneously generated by employing two spin-dependent forces operating in parallel on the same set of normal modes. We analytically calculate the region of validity of this scheme, and provide numerical and experimental validation with $^{171}\rm{Yb}^+\;$ ions. This scheme inherits the programmability and scalability of the Ising-type interactions with trapped ions that have been explored in numerous quantum simulation experiments. Our approach extends the capabilities of existing trapped ion quantum simulators to access a large class of spin Hamiltonians relevant for exploring exotic quantum phases such as superfluidity and spin liquids.</description>

      <title>A Fermi Surface Descriptor Quantifying the Correlations between Anomalous Hall Effect and Fermi Surface Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few decades, basic ideas of topology have completely transformed the prediction of quantum transport phenomena. Following this trend, we go deeper into the incorporation of modern mathematics into quantum material science focusing on geometry. Here we investigate the relation between the geometrical type of the Fermi surface and Anomalous and Spin Hall Effects. An index, $\mathbb{H}_F$, quantifying the hyperbolic geometry of the Fermi surface, shows a universal correlation (R$^2$ = 0.97) with the experimentally measured intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, of 16 different compounds spanning a wide variety of crystal, chemical, and electronic structure families, including those where topological methods give R$^2$ = 0.52. This raises a question about the predictive limits of topological physics and its transformation into a wider study of bandstructures' and Fermi surfaces' geometries, opening horizon for prediction of phenomena beyond topological understanding.</description>

      <title>Real-time quantum dynamics of thermal states with neural thermofields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving the time-dependent quantum many-body Schr\"odinger equation is a challenging task, especially for states at a finite temperature, where the environment affects the dynamics. Most existing approximating methods are designed to represent static thermal density matrices, 1D systems, and/or zero-temperature states. In this work, we propose a method to study the real-time dynamics of thermal states in two dimensions, based on thermofield dynamics, variational Monte Carlo, and neural-network quantum states. To this aim, we introduce two novel tools: (i) a procedure to accurately simulate the cooling down of arbitrary quantum variational states from infinite temperature, and (ii) a generic thermal (autoregressive) recurrent neural-network (ARNNO) Ansatz that allows for direct sampling from the density matrix using thermofield basis rotations. We apply our technique to the transverse-field Ising model subject to an additional longitudinal field and demonstrate that the time-dependent observables, including correlation operators, can be accurately reproduced for a 4x4 spin lattice. We provide predictions of the real-time dynamics on a 6x6 lattice that lies outside the reach of exact simulations.</description>
