      <title>Unsteady Thermal and Flow Structures of an Impinging Sweeping Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sweeping jets are increasingly employed in thermal management and flow control applications due to their inherent unsteadiness and ability to cover wide surface areas. This study investigates the unsteady heat transfer and flow structures of an impinging sweeping jet, with particular emphasis on the influence of Reynolds number and nozzle-to-plate spacing. A combined diagnostic approach, utilising non-synchronous high-speed infrared thermography and planar particle image velocimetry, is adopted to independently measure wall heat flux distributions and flow field dynamics. Time-averaged Nusselt number maps reveal a progressive widening of the thermal footprint as the nozzle-to-plate distance increases, accompanied by a reduction in peak heat transfer intensity. In contrast, the fluctuating component exhibits a double-lobe structure that becomes more pronounced at higher Reynolds numbers. Velocity measurements confirm the presence of a bifurcated jet core and shear-driven unsteadiness, with fluctuating velocity components and Reynolds shear stress spatially correlated with zones of enhanced heat transfer fluctuations. A direct spatial comparison between velocity and heat transfer fluctuations demonstrates that wall-normal velocity unsteadiness dominates the thermal response at low nozzle-to-plate distances, while streamwise fluctuations become increasingly significant at larger spacings. Finally, the full-field heat transfer data are embedded into a reduced-order parametric space, demonstrating that the complex system behaviour can be effectively represented by a low-dimensional manifold governed by Reynolds number and nozzle-to-plate spacing. The findings underscore the importance of the fluctuating thermal component in sweeping jet impingement and highlight the potential of data-driven models for predicting surface heat transfer in oscillatory jet systems.</description>

      <title>A computational approach for the study of electromagnetic interactions in reacting flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computational fluid dynamics methodology for the simulation of electromagnetic interactions in compressible reacting flows has been formulated. The developed code, named EMI, is based on the SENGA Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) software. Static electric and magnetic fields are solved using Gauss's laws of Maxwell's equations. Electromagnetic wave propagation is solved by discretizing Ampere's and Faraday's equations using the explicit Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. The equations for the electromagnetic fields are fully coupled with the Navier-Stokes equations, such that interactions between the electromagnetic fields and the fluid are included in the formulation. The interaction terms include the Lorentz, polarization, and magnetization forces. These forces determine volume forces that affect the transport of momentum, the diffusion velocity, and the energy conservation equations. In addition, the medium's properties affect the propagation of the electromagnetic fields via electrical permittivity and conductivity, charge density, and magnetic permeability. The solution of electromagnetic fields is validated against analytical and numerical solutions. The implementation of the coupling between electromagnetic fields and conservation equations for species, energy, and momentum is validated with laminar reacting flow numerical solutions from the literature. The capabilities of the formulation are investigated for a range of laminar methane-air computations under electrostatic, magnetostatic, and high-frequency electromagnetic waves. The validity of the electrostatic formulation in the presence of currents related to the movement of charged species is also assessed. Results demonstrate that EMI-SENGA can capture the fundamental effects of electromagnetic fields on reacting flows and the dynamics of charged species and their effect on flame shape and reactivity.</description>

      <title>Dipole Propagation in Inhomogeneous Strongly Coupled Dusty Plasmas: A Viscoelastic Fluid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation characteristics of fluid vortices, particularly monopoles and dipoles, in a homogeneous viscoelastic fluid were reported in a recent publication [ Phys. Plasmas 23, 013707 (2016)]. In that study, a dusty plasma was modeled as a viscoelastic fluid using the incompressible limit of the generalized hydrodynamic model under strongly coupled conditions in a regime where the system remains in a fluid state but exhibits significant interparticle correlations, with potential energy dominating over kinetic energy. In this paper, we extend the previous work by employing the same model to investigate the evolution of a dipole represented by two counter rotating Lamb-Oseen vortices in an inhomogeneous medium. It is shown that the entire dynamics of a dipole is governed by the competition between the strength of transverse shear waves, which is proportional to the elastic strength of the viscoelastic background medium, and the circulation strength of the vortices in the dipole structure. The density inhomogeneity is introduced along the vertical direction, perpendicular to the direction of dipole motion, using both smooth and sharp cutoffs. The numerical simulations show that a higher circulation strength of a dipole or lower coupling strength of the background medium allows the dipole to survive longer and follow a more pronounced curved trajectory toward the high-density side. While the overall effects of circulation and coupling strength are similar in both densities, the resulting structure morphologies differ in the smooth density case, the interface around the vortices gradually forms a mushroom-like shape, whereas in the sharp case, it forms a simple spiral envelope. These effects are visualized through two dimensional simulations based on the incompressible generalized hydrodynamic model.</description>

      <title>Kinetic framework with consistent hydrodynamics for shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel discrete velocity kinetic framework to consistently recover the viscous shallow water equations. The proposed model has the following fundamental advantages and novelties: (a) A novel interpretation and general framework to introduce forces, (b) the possibility to consistently split pressure contributions between equilibrium and a force-like contribution, (c) consistent recovery of the viscous shallow water equations with no errors in the dissipation rates, (d) independent control over bulk viscosity, and (e) consistent second-order implementation of forces. As shown through a variety of different test cases, these features make for an accurate and stable solution method for the shallow-water equations.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-induced anti-Stokes flow: experiments and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experimental evidence of an Eulerian-mean flow, $\overline{u}(z)$, created by the interaction of surface waves and tailored ambient sub-surface turbulence, which partly cancels the Stokes drift, $u_s(z)$, and present supporting theory. Water-side turbulent velocity fields and Eulerian-mean flows were measured with particle image velocimetry before vs after the passage of a wave group, and with vs without the presence of regular waves. We compare different wavelengths, steepnesses and turbulent intensities. In all cases, a significant change in the Eulerian-mean current is observed, strongly focused near the surface, where it opposes the Stokes drift. The observations support the picture that when waves encounter ambient sub-surface turbulence, the flow undergoes a transition during which Eulerian-mean momentum is redistributed vertically (without changing the depth-integrated mass transport) until a new equilibrium state is reached, wherein the near-surface ratio between $\mathrm{d}\overline{u}/\mathrm{d}z$ and $|\mathrm{d}u_s/\mathrm{d} z|$ approximately equals the ratio between the streamwise and vertical Reynolds normal stresses. This accords with a simple statistical theory derived here and holds regardless of the absolute turbulence level, whereas stronger turbulence means faster growth of the Eulerian-mean current. We present a model based on Rapid Distortion Theory which describes the generation of the Eulerian-mean flow as a consequence of the action of the Stokes drift on the background turbulence. Predictions are in qualitative, and reasonable quantitative, agreement with experiments on wave groups, where equilibrium has not yet been reached. Our results could have substantial consequences for predicting the transport of water-borne material in the oceans.</description>

      <title>Sharp front tracking with geometric interface reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel sharp front-tracking method designed to address limitations in classical front-tracking approaches, specifically their reliance on smooth interpolation kernels and extended stencils for coupling the front and fluid mesh. In contrast, the proposed method employs exclusively sharp, localized interpolation and spreading kernels, restricting the coupling to the interfacial fluid cells. This localized coupling is achieved by integrating a divergence-preserving velocity interpolation method with a piecewise parabolic interface calculation (PPIC) and a polyhedron intersection algorithm to compute the indicator function and local interface curvature. Surface tension is computed using the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) method, maintaining consistency with the sharp representation. Additionally, we propose an efficient local roughness smoothing implementation to account for surface mesh undulations, which is easily applicable to any triangulated surface mesh. Building on our previous work, the primary innovation of this study lies in the localization of the coupling for both the indicator function and surface tension calculations. By reducing the interface thickness on the fluid mesh to a single cell, as opposed to the 4-5 cell spans typical in classical methods, the proposed sharp front-tracking method achieves a highly localized and accurate representation of the interface. This sharper representation mitigates parasitic currents and improves force balancing, making it particularly suitable for scenarios where the interface plays a critical role, such as microfluidics, fluid-fluid interactions, and fluid-structure interactions. The presented results demonstrate that the sharp front-tracking method significantly outperforms the classical approach in terms of accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Coherence of velocity fluctuations in a turbulent round jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence between the velocity fluctuations measured at two points is investigated in a turbulent jet flow. Coherence is calculated in different regions of the flow by changing the separation between the points, the distance between the points from the exit of the jet and from its central axis, and the injection velocity of the jet. It is observed that coherence scales with the system parameters, the functional form of coherence and the corresponding scaling laws change depending on in which region coherence is measured, and that coherence is self similar in both the regions.</description>

      <title>Scaling of wall pressure and the peak of streamwise turbulence intensity in compressible wall flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops scaling laws for wall-pressure root-mean-square (r.m.s.) and the peak of streamwise turbulence intensity, accounting for both variable-property and intrinsic compressibility effects -- those associated with changes in fluid volume due to pressure variations. To develop such scaling laws, we express the target quantities as an expansion series in powers of an appropriately defined Mach number. The leading-order term is represented using the scaling relations developed for incompressible flows, but with an effective Reynolds number. Higher-order terms capture intrinsic compressibility effects and are modeled as constant coefficients, calibrated using flow cases specifically designed to isolate these effects. The resulting scaling relations are shown to be accurate for a wide range of channel flows and boundary layers.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal pulse propagation during highly-resolved onset of Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study explores the onset of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) and Kelvin-Helmholtz Rayleigh-Taylor instability (KHRTI) with highly-resolved direct numerical simulations of two setups which consider air at different temperatures (or densities) and/or velocities in two halves of three-dimensional cuboidal domains. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a novel parallel algorithm which does not involve overlapping points at sub-domain boundaries. The pressure disturbance field is compared during onset of RTI and KHRTI and corresponding convection- and advection-dominated mechanisms are highlighted by instantaneous features, spectra, and proper orthogonal decomposition. The relative contributions of pressure, kinetic energy and rotational energy to the overall energy budget is explored for both instabilities, revealing acoustic trigger to be the incipient mechanism for both RTI and KHRTI. The nonlinear, spatio-temporal nature of the instability is further explored by application of a transport equation for enstrophy of compressible flows. This provides insights into the similarities and differences between the onset mechanisms of RTI and KHRTI, serving as a benchmark data set for shear and buoyancy-driven instabilities across diverse applications in geophysics, nuclear energy and atmospheric fluid dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments using 3D Lagrangian tracking are used to investigate Kolmogorov scaling below the bubble size in bubble-induced turbulence (BIT). Second and third order structure functions reveal approximate Kolmogorov scaling for homogeneous bubble swarms. A new scaling for the kinetic energy dissipation rate is derived and shown to be in excellent agreement with the data. Using this we predict the scale separation below the bubble size as a function of the parameters and find that a large inertial range is not possible in BIT since bubbles of the required size would quickly break down.</description>

      <title>Modal analysis of oblique shock-induced flow dynamics in a supersonic reacting shear layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient mixing in high-speed compressible flows, crucial for scramjet operation, can be significantly enhanced by shock wave interactions. This study employs Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) to comprehensively examine the interaction between an oblique shock and a spatially developing turbulent mixing layer, contrasting inert and reacting (hydrogen-air combustion) cases. Utilizing streaming Dynamic Mode Decomposition (sDMD), we analyze four configurations: inert and reacting shear layers, both with and without shock impingement (at $\mathrm{Ma}_c = 0.48$). We evaluate the temporal mode growth rates, the evolution of vorticity thickness, and the spatial structures of dominant DMD modes to elucidate how shocks and heat release synergistically influence flow stability, mixing, and the underlying coherent dynamics. Results reveal that the oblique shock significantly amplifies Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, excites a broader spectrum of unstable temporal modes, and accelerates the growth of the vorticity thickness. Combustion-induced heat release further modifies this response, leading to a redistribution of energy among the DMD modes and indicating a complex coupled effect with shock dynamics, particularly in the enhanced excitation of high-frequency modes and the alteration of spatial structures. The modal analysis identifies distinct frequency bands associated with shock and combustion effects and characterizes the dominant spatial patterns, offering refined insights for controlling and enhancing mixing in high-speed propulsion flows.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of temporal aiming for water waves with an anisotropic metabathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deflection of waves by combining the effects of time modulation with anisotropy has been recently proposed in the context of electromagnetism. In this work, we characterise this phenomenon, called temporal aiming, for water waves using a time-varying metabathymetry. This metabathymetry is composed of thin vertical plates that are periodically arranged at the fluid bottom and which act as an effective anisotropic medium for the surface wave in the long-wavelength approximation. When this plate array is vertically lifted at the fluid bottom at a given time, the medium switches from isotropic to anisotropic, causing a wavepacket to scatter in time and deflect from its initial trajectory. Following a simple modelling, we obtain the scattering coefficients of the two waves generated due to the sudden medium change as well as the angle of deviation with respect to the incident angle. We then numerically evaluate this scattering problem with simulations of the full 2D effective anisotropic wave equation, with a time-dependent anisotropy tensor. Finally, we provide experimental evidence of the temporal aiming, using space time resolved measurement techniques, demonstrating the trajectory shift of a wavepacket and measuring its angle of deviation.</description>

      <title>Energetic consistency and heat transport in Fourier-Galerkin truncations of free slip 3D rotating convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of energetic consistency in Fourier truncated models of the 3D Boussinesq-Coriolis (BC) equations as a case-study towards improving the realism of convective processes in climate models. As a benchmark we consider the Nusselt number, defined as the average vertical heat transport of a convective flow. A set of formulae are derived which give the ODE projection of the BC model onto any finite selection of modes. It is proven that projected ODE models obey energy relations consistent with the PDE if and only if a mode selection Criterion regarding the vertical resolution is satisfied. It is also proven that the energy relations imply the existence of a compact attractor for these ODE's, which then implies bounds on the Nusselt number. By contrast, it is proven that a broad class of energetically inconsistent models admit solutions with unbounded, exponential growth, precluding the existence of a compact attractor and giving an infinite Nusselt number. On the other hand, certain energetically inconsistent models can admit compact attractors as shown via a simple model. The above formulas are implemented in MATLAB, enabling a user to study any desired Fourier truncated model by selecting a desired finite set of Fourier modes. All code is made available on GitHub. Several numerical studies of the Nusselt number are conducted to assess the convergence of the Nusselt number with respect to increasing spatial resolution for consistent models and measure the distorting effects of inconsistency for more general solutions.</description>

      <title>Accessing the dipole-multipole transition in rapidly rotating spherical shell dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarity reversals are a key feature of Earth's magnetic field, yet the processes governing them are still poorly understood. Dipole reversals have been found in many numerical dynamo simulations and often occur close to the transition between dipolar and multipolar regimes. Simulated conditions are far from those in Earth's liquid iron core because of the long runtimes needed to capture polarity transitions. We develop a unidimensional path theory in an attempt to simplify the search for the dipole-multipole transition at increasingly realistic physical conditions. We build 3 paths, all based on a constant magnetic Reynolds number $Rm$; one aiming for Magnetic, Coriolis, and Archimedean (MAC), and 2 aiming for inertia-MAC force balance. We add inertia due to its role in simulated reversals. Results show reasonable agreement with predictions within the accessible parameter space, but deviate from predicted behaviour for certain quantities, e.g. magnetic field strength and magnetic/kinetic energy ratio. Further, simulations move into the dipolar non-reversing regime as they are advanced along the path. By increasing the buoyancy driving (via higher Rayleigh number) above the values predicted by the path theory, we are able to access the dipole-multipole transition down to an Ekman number $E\sim 10^{-6}$, comparable to the most extreme conditions reported to date. Results demonstrate that our approach is an efficient method for seeking the dipole-multipole transition at low $E$. However, the conditions under which we access the dipole-multipole transition become increasingly hard to access numerically and also increasingly unrealistic because $Rm$ rises beyond plausible bounds inferred from geophysical observations. Future work combining path theory with variations in the core buoyancy distribution, appears a promising approach to accessing the transition at extreme physical conditions.</description>

      <title>Elongation of material lines and vortices by Euler flows on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of the differential geometry of the flow domain on the motion of fluids on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, particularly on the elongation of material lines and vortices. We derive a formula for the second order time derivative of the square of the distance between close fluid particles and show that a curvature term appears. The elongation of a material line is accelerated by negative curvature. The use of this expression extends Haller's definition of hyperbolic domains to flows on curved surfaces. The need to consider curvature effects is illustrated by three examples. The example of a curved two-dimensional torus implies that the filamentation of vortices can be triggered by negative curvature.</description>

      <title>Intensification of Oceanic Inverse Energy Cascade Under Global Warming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic energy (KE) cascade in the turbulent ocean is pivotal in connecting diverse scales of oceanic motions, redistributing energy, and influencing ocean circulation and climate variability. However, its response to global warming remains poorly understood. Using a 24-year satellite altimetry dataset, we identify a pronounced intensification of inverse geostrophic kinetic energy cascade at the sea surface across most ocean regions during 1994-2017, with cascade amplitude increasing by 1% to 2% per decade. This intensification occurs not only in energetic regions but also in expansive quiescent areas. Contributing factors to this intensification of geostrophic KE cascade include enhanced vertical shear of horizontal velocity, deepened mixed layer, strengthened stratification, weakened eddy killing as well as changes in the KE budget. The dominant factors vary across regions. Our findings offer new insights into the ocean's response to global warming and improve understanding of feedback mechanisms for ocean circulation changes.</description>

      <title>Evolving dunes under flow reversals: from an initial heap toward an inverted dune</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sand dunes are ubiquitous in nature, and are found in abundance on Earth and other planetary environments. One of the most common types are crescent-shaped dunes known as barchans, whose mid-line could be assumed to behave as 2D dunes. In this work, we (i) compare the morphology of the mid-line of 3D barchans with 2D dunes; and (ii) track the evolution of 3D barchans and 2D dunes while reversing flow conditions. We performed experiments on 2D dunes in a 2D flume and Euler-Lagrange simulations of 3D bedforms. In all reversal experiments and simulations, the initial condition start with a conical heap deforming into a steady-state dune, which is then perturbed by reversing the flow, resulting in an inverted dune. We show that during the reversal the grains on the lee side immediately climb back onto the dune while its internal part and toe remain static, forming a new lee face of varying angle on the previous stoss slope. We show that (i) the characteristic time for the development of 2D dunes scales with that for 3D barchans, (ii) that the time for dune reversal is twice the time necessary to develop an initial triangular or conical heap to steady-state, and (iii) that a considerable part of grains remain static during the entire process. Our findings reveal the dynamics for dune reversal, and highlight that numerical computations of barchans based on 2D slices, which are more feasible in geophysical scales, predict realistic outcomes for the relevant time-scales.</description>

      <title>Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 100 trillion grid points via information~geometric regularization and the MFC flow solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a method and optimized implementation for exascale simulations of high-speed compressible fluid flows, enabling the simulation of multi-engine rocket craft at an unprecedented scale. We significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in terms of computational cost and memory footprint through a carefully crafted implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization, which eliminates the need for numerical shock capturing. Unified addressing on tightly coupled CPU--GPU platforms increases the total problem size with negligible performance hit. Despite linear stencil algorithms being memory-bound, we achieve wall clock times that are four times faster than optimized baseline numerics. This enables the execution of CFD simulations at more than 100 trillion grid points, surpassing the largest state-of-the-art publicly available simulations by an order of magnitude. Ideal weak scaling is demonstrated on OLCF Frontier and CSCS Alps using the full system, entailing 37.8K AMD MI250X GPUs (Frontier) or 9.2K NVIDIA GH200 superchips (Alps).</description>

      <title>Run-away transition to turbulent strong-field dynamo</title>

Abstract: Planets and stars are able to generate coherent large-scale magnetic fields by helical convective motions in their interiors. This process, known as hydromagnetic dynamo, involves nonlinear interaction between the flow and magnetic field. Nonlinearity facilitates existence of bi-stable dynamo branches: a weak field branch where the magnetic field is not strong enough to enter into the leading order force balance in the momentum equation at large flow scales, and a strong field branch where the field enters into this balance. The transition between the two with enhancement of convection can be either subcritical or supercritical, depending on the strength of magnetic induction. In both cases, it is accompanied by topological changes in velocity field across the system; however, it is yet unclear how these changes are produced. In this work, we analyse transitions between the weak and strong dynamo regimes using a data-driven approach, separating different physical effects induced by dynamically active flow scales. Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition, we decompose the dynamo data from direct numerical simulations into different components (modes), identify the ones relevant for transition, and estimate relative magnitudes of their contributions Lorentz force and induction term. Our results suggest that subcritical transition to a strong dynamo is facilitated by a subharmonic instability, allowing for a more efficient mode of convection, and provide a modal basis for reduced-order models of this transition.</description>

      <title>Online learning of eddy-viscosity and backscattering closures for geophysical turbulence using ensemble Kalman inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different approaches to using data-driven methods for subgrid-scale closure modeling have emerged recently. Most of these approaches are data-hungry, and lack interpretability and out-of-distribution generalizability. Here, we use {online} learning to address parametric uncertainty of well-known physics-based large-eddy simulation (LES) closures: the Smagorinsky (Smag) and Leith eddy-viscosity models (1 free parameter) and the Jansen-Held (JH) backscattering model (2 free parameters). For 8 cases of 2D geophysical turbulence, optimal parameters are estimated, using ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI), such that for each case, the LES' energy spectrum matches that of direct numerical simulation (DNS). Only a small training dataset is needed to calculate the DNS spectra (i.e., the approach is {data-efficient}). We find the optimized parameter(s) of each closure to be constant across broad flow regimes that differ in dominant length scales, eddy/jet structures, and dynamics, suggesting that these closures are {generalizable}. In a-posteriori tests based on the enstrophy spectra and probability density functions (PDFs) of vorticity, LES with optimized closures outperform the baselines (LES with standard Smag, dynamic Smag or Leith), particularly at the tails of the PDFs (extreme events). In a-priori tests, the optimized JH significantly outperforms the baselines and optimized Smag and Leith in terms of interscale enstrophy and energy transfers (still, optimized Smag noticeably outperforms standard Smag). The results show the promise of combining advances in physics-based modeling (e.g., JH) and data-driven modeling (e.g., {online} learning with EKI) to develop data-efficient frameworks for accurate, interpretable, and generalizable closures.</description>

      <title>Exploratory study of liquid metal response to rapid variation of applied magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient plasma events, such as plasma disruptions, are anticipated in the future magnetic-confinement nuclear fusion reactors. The events are accompanied by a rapid change in the magnetic field generated by the plasma current and, accordingly, induction of strong eddy currents and Lorentz forces within the reactor structure. This work targets processes within liquid-metal components of the reactor's breeding blankets. Order-of-magnitude analysis and {exploratory} numerical simulations are performed to understand the response of liquid metal to a rapidly changing magnetic field and to evaluate the accuracy of commonly used simplifying model assumptions. The response is found to consist of two stages: an initial brief stage ($\sim 1$ ms) characterized by a rapid increase in the induced currents, forces, and fluid velocity; and a subsequent stage, which is triggered by the growing velocity of the metal and marked by reversals of Lorentz force, and oscillations and decreases in the amplitude of the induced fields. The transition to the second stage sets the upper limit of the velocity ($\sim 0.5$ m/s in our tests), to which an initially quiescent metal can be accelerated during the event. The simulations indicate that many widely used model assumptions, such as the negligible role of Joule dissipation in the heat balance and the constancy of physical property coefficients, remain valid during the response. However, the assumption of liquid metal incompressibility is found to be questionable due to the potential significant effects of pressure waves.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Relative Pressure Estimation Methods Utilizing 4D Flow MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can estimate three-dimensional (3D) time-resolved relative pressure fields using 4D-flow MRI, thereby providing rich pressure field information. Clinical alternatives include catheterization and Doppler echocardiography, which only provide one-dimensional pressure drops. The accuracy of one-dimensional pressure drops derived from 4D-flow has been explored previously, but additional work is needed to evaluate the accuracy of 3D relative pressure field estimates. This work presents an analysis of three state-of-the-art relative pressure estimators: virtual Work-Energy Relative Pressure (vWERP), the Pressure Poisson Estimator (PPE), and the Stokes Estimator (STE). The spatiotemporal characteristics and sensitivity to noise were determined in silico. Estimators were then validated using a type B aortic dissection (TBAD) flow phantom with varying tear geometry and twelve catheter pressure measurements. Finally, the performance of each estimator was evaluated across eight patient cases. In silico pressure field errors were lower in STE compared to PPE, although PPE pressures were less noise sensitive. High velocity gradients and low spatial resolution contributed most significantly to local variations in 3D pressure field errors. Low temporal resolution lead to systematic underestimation of highly transient peak pressure events. In the flow phantom analysis, vWERP was the most accurate method, followed by STE and PPE. Each pressure estimator was strongly correlated with ground truth pressure values, despite the tendency to underestimate peak pressures. Patient case results demonstrated that each pressure estimator could be feasibly integrated into a clinical workflow.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of rotating helices in viscous fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a pair of rigid rotating helices in a viscous fluid, as a model for bacterial flagellar bundle and a prototype of microfluidic pumps. Combining experiments with hydrodynamic modeling, we examine how spacing and phase difference between the two helices affect their torque, flow field and fluid transport capacity at low Reynolds numbers. Hydrodynamic coupling reduces the torque when the helices rotate in phase at constant angular speed, but increases the torque when they rotate out of phase. We identify a critical phase difference, at which the hydrodynamic coupling vanishes despite the close spacing between the helices. A simple model, based on the flow characteristics and positioning of a single helix, is constructed, which quantitatively predicts the torque of the helical pair in both unbounded and confined systems. Lastly, we show the influence of spacing and phase difference on the axial flux and the pump efficiency of the helices. Our findings shed light on the function of bacterial flagella and provide design principles for efficient low-Reynolds-number pumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows exhibit large intermittent fluctuations from inertial to dissipative scales, characterized by multifractal statistics and breaking the statistical self-similarity. It has recently been proposed that the Navier-Stokes turbulence restores a hidden form of scale invariance in the inertial interval when formulated for a dynamically (nonlinearly) rescaled quasi-Lagrangian velocity field. Here we show that such hidden self-similarity extends to the Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) approach in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In particular, we show that classical subgrid-scale models, such as implicit or explicit Smagorinsky closures, respect the hidden scale invariance at all scales -- both resolved and subgrid. In the inertial range, they reproduce the hidden scale invariance of Navier-Stokes statistics. These properties are verified very accurately by numerical simulations and, beyond CFD, turn LES into a valuable tool for fundamental turbulence research.</description>

      <title>Surface bubble lifetime in the presence of a turbulent air flow, and the effect of surface layer renewal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface bubbles in the ocean are critical in moderating several fluxes between the atmosphere and the ocean. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the drainage and lifetime of surface bubbles in solutions containing surfactants and salts, subjected to turbulence in the air surrounding them modelling the wind in the ocean. We carefully construct a setup allowing us to repeatably measure the mean lifetime of a series of surface bubbles, while varying the solution and the wind speed or humidity of the air. To that end, we show that renewing the surface layer is critical to avoid a change of the physical properties of the interface. We show that the drainage of the bubbles is well modelled by taking into account the outwards viscous flow and convective evaporation. The lifetime of surface bubbles in solutions containing no salt is given by the time when evaporation becomes the main draining mechanism and independent on surfactant concentration. When salt is added, the same scaling is valid only at high surfactant concentrations. At low concentrations, the lifetime is always smaller and independent of wind speed, owing to the presence of impurities triggering a thick bursting event.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed Newton's law of cooling with a finite-rate thermal quench: Impact on the Mpemba and Kovacs effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba and Kovacs effects are two notable memory phenomena observed in nonequilibrium relaxation processes. In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.</description>
