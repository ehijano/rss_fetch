      <title>Microscopic modeling of attention-based movement behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For transportation hubs, leveraging pedestrian flows for commercial activities presents an effective strategy for funding maintenance and infrastructure improvements. However, this introduces new challenges, as consumer behaviors can disrupt pedestrian flow and efficiency. To optimize both retail potential and pedestrian efficiency, careful strategic planning in store layout and facility dimensions was done by expert judgement due to the complexity in pedestrian dynamics in the retail areas of transportation hubs. This paper introduces an attention-based movement model to simulate these dynamics. By simulating retail potential of an area through the duration of visual attention it receives, and pedestrian efficiency via speed loss in pedestrian walking behaviors, the study further explores how design features can influence the retail potential and pedestrian efficiency in a bi-directional corridor inside a transportation hub.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the evolution history of networked complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution processes of complex systems carry key information in the systems' functional properties. Applying machine learning algorithms, we demonstrate that the historical formation process of various networked complex systems can be extracted, including protein-protein interaction, ecology, and social network systems. The recovered evolution process has demonstrations of immense scientific values, such as interpreting the evolution of protein-protein interaction network, facilitating structure prediction, and particularly revealing the key co-evolution features of network structures such as preferential attachment, community structure, local clustering, degree-degree correlation that could not be explained collectively by previous theories. Intriguingly, we discover that for large networks, if the performance of the machine learning model is slightly better than a random guess on the pairwise order of links, reliable restoration of the overall network formation process can be achieved. This suggests that evolution history restoration is generally highly feasible on empirical networks.</description>

      <title>Entropy and the City: Origins, trajectories and explorations of the concept in urban science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy is arguably one of the most powerful concepts to understand the world, from the behavior of molecules to the expansion of the universe, from how life emerges to how hybrid complex systems like cities come into being and continue existing. Yet, despite its widespread application, it is also one of the most misunderstood concepts across the sciences. This chapter seeks to demystify entropy and its main interpretations, along with some of its explorations in the context of cities. It first establishes the foundations of the concept by describing its trajectory since its inception in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics in the 19th century, its different incarnations from Boltzmanns pioneering formulation and Shannons information theory to its absorption in biology and the social sciences, until it reaches a nascent urban science in the late 1960s. The chapter then identifies some of the main domains in which entropy has been explored to understand cities as complex systems, from entropy-maximizing models of spatial interaction and applications as a measure of urban form, diversity, and complexity to a tool for understanding conditions of self-organization and urban sustainability.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Transit Gap: A Comparative Study of On-Demand Bus Services and Urban Climate Resilience in South End, Charlotte, NC and Avondale, Chattanooga, TN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban design significantly impacts sustainability, particularly in the context of public transit efficiency and carbon emissions reduction. This study explores two neighborhoods with distinct urban designs: South End, Charlotte, NC, featuring a dynamic mixed-use urban design pattern, and Avondale, Chattanooga, TN, with a residential suburban grid layout. Using the TRANSIT-GYM tool, we assess the impact of increased bus utilization in these different urban settings on traffic and CO2 emissions. Our results highlight the critical role of urban design and planning in transit system efficiency. In South End, the mixed-use design led to more substantial emission reductions, indicating that urban layout can significantly influence public transit outcomes. Tailored strategies that consider the unique urban design elements are essential for climate resilience. Notably, doubling bus utilization decreased daily emissions by 10.18% in South End and 8.13% in Avondale, with a corresponding reduction in overall traffic. A target of 50% bus utilization saw emissions drop by 21.45% in South End and 14.50% in Avondale. At an idealistic goal of 70% bus utilization, South End and Avondale witnessed emission reductions of 37.22% and 27.80%, respectively. These insights are crucial for urban designers and policymakers in developing sustainable urban landscapes.</description>

      <title>Consensus formation in quality-sensitive interdependent agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate fluctuations arising from finite-size effects.
  In scenarios with strong interdependence, we identify an absorbing phase transition and scrutinize its key features, including critical fluctuations in finite spatial systems. We find that fluctuations play a significant role in the collective decision-making process, particularly when options have similar qualities.
  Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively. Finally, we show that this model also fulfills Weber's Law of perception, aligning with previous analyses of collective-decision problems in their adherence to different psychophysical laws.</description>

      <title>Wastewater-based Epidemiology for COVID-19 Surveillance: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pandemic of COVID-19 has imposed tremendous pressure on public health systems and social economic ecosystems over the past years. To alleviate its social impact, it is important to proactively track the prevalence of COVID-19 within communities. The traditional way to estimate the disease prevalence is to estimate from reported clinical test data or surveys. However, the coverage of clinical tests is often limited and the tests can be labor-intensive, requires reliable and timely results, and consistent diagnostic and reporting criteria. Recent studies revealed that patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 often undergo fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus into wastewater, which makes wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for COVID-19 surveillance a promising approach to complement traditional clinical testing. In this paper, we survey the existing literature regarding WBE for COVID-19 surveillance and summarize the current advances in the area. Specifically, we have covered the key aspects of wastewater sampling, sample testing, and presented a comprehensive and organized summary of wastewater data analytical methods. Finally, we provide the open challenges on current wastewater-based COVID-19 surveillance studies, aiming to encourage new ideas to advance the development of effective wastewater-based surveillance systems for general infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Human behaviour through a LENS: How Linguistic content triggers Emotions and Norms and determines Strategy choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, a growing body of experimental research has provided evidence that linguistic frames influence human behaviour in economic games, beyond the economic consequences of the available actions. This article proposes a novel framework that transcends the traditional confines of outcome-based preference models. According to the LENS model, the Linguistic description of the decision problem triggers Emotional responses and suggests potential Norms of behaviour, which then interact to shape an individual's Strategic choice. The article reviews experimental evidence that supports each path of the LENS model. Furthermore, it identifies and discusses several critical research questions that arise from this model, pointing towards avenues for future inquiry.</description>

      <title>Prospects For A New Light Nuclei, Fission Fusion Energy Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future advanced nuclear rocket propulsion, and the availability of new nuclear power cycle designs, will benefit substantially from the large current investment in alternative nuclear energy that is underway today. We propose a new nuclear cycle which includes the primary fission of lithium-6, followed by secondary fusion of deuterium and tritium, and a secondary fission of lithium-7 by tritium. This cycle does not produce nuclear waste from its nuclear fuel, since all byproducts of these cascade reactions are stable, provided that the triton production during the primary reaction is fully consumed in the secondary reactions. This cycle may, however, activate surrounding technical materials from its neutron flux. This light-element nuclear fuel is readily obtained through the ongoing expansion of the lithium mining industry and electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling industries.</description>

      <title>Identifying hubs in directed networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nodes in networks that exhibit high connectivity, also called ``hubs'', play a critical role in determining the structural and functional properties of networked systems. However, there is no clear definition of what constitutes a hub node in a network, and the classification of network hubs in existing work has either been purely qualitative or relies on ad hoc criteria for thresholding continuous data that do not generalize well to networks with certain degree sequences. Here we develop a set of efficient nonparametric methods that classify hub nodes in directed networks using the Minimum Description Length principle, effectively providing a clear and principled definition for network hubs. We adapt our methods to both unweighted and weighted networks and demonstrate them in a range of example applications using real and synthetic network data.</description>

      <title>The optimal placement of the head in the noun phrase. The case of demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10311v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The word order of a sentence is shaped by multiple principles. The principle of syntactic dependency distance minimization is in conflict with the principle of surprisal minimization (or predictability maximization) in single head syntactic dependency structures: while the former predicts that the head should be placed at the center of the linear arrangement, the latter predicts that the head should be placed at one of the ends (either first or last). A critical question is when surprisal minimization (or predictability maximization) should surpass syntactic dependency distance minimization. In the context of single head structures, it has been predicted that this is more likely to happen when two conditions are met, i.e. (a) fewer words are involved and (b) words are shorter. Here we test the prediction on the noun phrase when it is composed of a demonstrative, a numeral, an adjective and a noun. We find that, across preferred orders in languages, the noun tends to be placed at one of the ends, confirming the theoretical prediction. We also show evidence of anti locality effects: syntactic dependency distances in preferred orders are longer than expected by chance.</description>
